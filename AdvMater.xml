         <title>Engineering Metallic Heterostructure Based on Ni3N and 2M&#8208;MoS2 for Alkaline Water Electrolysis with Industry&#8208;Compatible Current Density and Stability</title>

Abstract
Alkaline water electrolysis is commercially desirable to realize large&#8208;scale hydrogen production. Although non&#8208;precious catalysts exhibit high electrocatalytic activity at low current density (10&#8208;50&#160;mA cm&#8211;2), it is still challenging to achieve industrially&#8208;required current density over 500&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 due to inefficient electron transport and competitive adsorption between hydroxyl and water. Herein, we design a novel metallic heterostructure based on nickel nitride and monoclinic molybdenum disulfide (Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2) for extraordinary water electrolysis. The Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2 composite with heterointerface provides two kinds of separated reaction sites to overcome the steric hindrance of competitive hydroxyl/water adsorption. The kinetically decoupled hydroxyl/water adsorption/dissociation and metallic conductivity of Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2 enable hydrogen production from Ni3N and oxygen evolution from the heterointerface at large current density. The metallic heterostructure is proved to be imperative for the stabilization and activation of Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2, which could efficiently regulate the active electronic states of Ni/N atoms around the Fermi&#8208;level through the charge transfer between the active atoms of Ni3N and Mo&#8208;Mo bonds of 2M&#8208;MoS2 to boost overall water splitting. The Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2 incorporated water electrolyzer requires ultralow cell voltage of 1.644 V@1000&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 with &#8764;100% retention over 300 h, far exceeding the commercial Pt/C&#9553;RuO2 (2.41 V@1000&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, 100 h, 58.2%).

         <title>Metal&#8208;organic framework glass anode with an exceptional cycling&#8208;induced capacity enhancement for lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great promise as high&#8208;energy anode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their tunable chemistry, pore structure and abundant reaction sites. However, the pore structure of crystalline MOFs tends to collapse during lithium&#8208;ion insertion and extraction, and hence, their electrochemical performances are rather limited. As a critical breakthrough, a MOF glass anode for LIBs has been developed in the present work. In detail, it was fabricated by melt&#8208;quenching Cobalt&#8208;ZIF&#8208;62 (Co(Im)1.75(bIm)0.25) to glass, and then by combining glass with carbon black and binder. The derived anode exhibits high lithium storage capacity (306 mAh g&#8211;1 after 1000 cycles at of 2 A g&#8211;1), outstanding cycling stability and superior rate performance compared with the crystalline Cobalt&#8208;ZIF&#8208;62 and the amorphous one prepared by high&#8208;energy ball&#8208;milling. Importantly, it was found that the Li&#8208;ion storage capacity of the MOF glass anode continuously rises with charge&#8208;discharge cycling and even tripled after 1000 cycles. Combined spectroscopic and structural analyses, along with density functional theory calculations, revealed the origin of the unusual cycling&#8208;enhancement of the performances of the MOF glass anode, that is, increased distortion and local breakage of the Co&#8208;N coordination making the Li&#8208;ion intercalation sites more accessible.

&lt;p&gt;Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great promise as high-energy anode materials for next-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their tunable chemistry, pore structure and abundant reaction sites. However, the pore structure of crystalline MOFs tends to collapse during lithium-ion insertion and extraction, and hence, their electrochemical performances are rather limited. As a critical breakthrough, a MOF glass anode for LIBs has been developed in the present work. In detail, it was fabricated by melt-quenching Cobalt-ZIF-62 (Co(Im)&lt;sub&gt;1.75&lt;/sub&gt;(bIm)&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;) to glass, and then by combining glass with carbon black and binder. The derived anode exhibits high lithium storage capacity (306 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 1000 cycles at of 2 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;), outstanding cycling stability and superior rate performance compared with the crystalline Cobalt-ZIF-62 and the amorphous one prepared by high-energy ball-milling. Importantly, it was found that the Li-ion storage capacity of the MOF glass anode continuously rises with charge-discharge cycling and even &lt;i&gt;tripled&lt;/i&gt; after 1000 cycles. Combined spectroscopic and structural analyses, along with density functional theory calculations, revealed the origin of the unusual cycling-enhancement of the performances of the MOF glass anode, that is, increased distortion and local breakage of the Co-N coordination making the Li-ion intercalation sites more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Differential polymer chain scission enables free&#8208;standing microcavity laser arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Control over material architectures is essential to the performance of photonic devices and systems. Optical isolation of the photonic materials from substrates can significantly enhance their performance but suffers from complicated fabrication processes and limited applications. Here we propose a differential polymer chain scission strategy to fabricate free&#8208;standing photonic structures based on one&#8208;step electron&#8208;beam direct writing on polymer bilayers (EOB). The polymer molecular mass&#8208;dependent sensitivity to electron beam enables differential patterning of the two layers of polymers, leading to the direct formation of suspended optical microcavities. The EOB technique features high materials compatibility and design flexibility for the optical microcavities, which significantly expands the application scope of the suspended optical microcavities. As well as providing a versatile strategy for building high&#8208;performance photonic materials, our results provide a promising platform for innovative applications of optical microstructures.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Phenolic&#8208;Network&#8208;Coated Dendrimer&#8211;Drug Conjugates for Tumor MR Imaging and Chemo/Chemodynamic Therapy via Amplification of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;phenolic&#8208;network&#8208;coated dendrimer&#8211;drug conjugates are constructed as a novel theranostic nanoplatform based on endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) amplification. The generated nanocomplexes can responsively release the ERS drug toyocamycin in the tumor microenvironment, while the coated iron&#8211;tannic acid network can generate cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals, thus rendering ERS amplification for combined chemo/chemodynamic therapy of tumors under the guidance of magnetic resonance imaging.








Abstract
Amplification of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) to realize enhanced cancer therapy has been considered to be unique in current cancer nanomedicine design. Herein, the design of metal&#8211;phenolic&#8208;network&#8208;coated dendrimer&#8211;drug conjugates as a novel theranostic nanoplatform based on ERS amplification is reported. In the design, acetylated generation&#8208;5 poly(amidoamine) dendrimers are conjugated with an ERS drug, toyocamycin (Toy), through the attached phenylboronic acid moiety, and coated with an iron (Fe)&#8211;tannic acid (TF) network. The generated nanocomplexes with a size of 50.2&#160;nm are stable under the physiological environment, and can rapidly release Toy under the tumor microenvironment due to the pH&#8208; and reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species&#8208;responsive boronic ester bonds to effectively inhibit the ERS&#8208;mediated cancer cell adaptation. Meanwhile, the coated TF network enables the nanocomplexes to generate cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals through a Fenton reaction, amplifying the ERS for improved chemo/chemodynamic therapy of cancer cells in vitro and a xenografted breast tumor model in vivo.

     alt="Metal&#8211;Phenolic-Network-Coated Dendrimer&#8211;Drug Conjugates for Tumor MR Imaging and Chemo/Chemodynamic Therapy via Amplification of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;phenolic-network-coated dendrimer&#8211;drug conjugates are constructed as a novel theranostic nanoplatform based on endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) amplification. The generated nanocomplexes can responsively release the ERS drug toyocamycin in the tumor microenvironment, while the coated iron&#8211;tannic acid network can generate cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals, thus rendering ERS amplification for combined chemo/chemodynamic therapy of tumors under the guidance of magnetic resonance imaging.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amplification of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) to realize enhanced cancer therapy has been considered to be unique in current cancer nanomedicine design. Herein, the design of metal&#8211;phenolic-network-coated dendrimer&#8211;drug conjugates as a novel theranostic nanoplatform based on ERS amplification is reported. In the design, acetylated generation-5 poly(amidoamine) dendrimers are conjugated with an ERS drug, toyocamycin (Toy), through the attached phenylboronic acid moiety, and coated with an iron (Fe)&#8211;tannic acid (TF) network. The generated nanocomplexes with a size of 50.2&#160;nm are stable under the physiological environment, and can rapidly release Toy under the tumor microenvironment due to the pH- and reactive-oxygen-species-responsive boronic ester bonds to effectively inhibit the ERS-mediated cancer cell adaptation. Meanwhile, the coated TF network enables the nanocomplexes to generate cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals through a Fenton reaction, amplifying the ERS for improved chemo/chemodynamic therapy of cancer cells in vitro and a xenografted breast tumor model in vivo. Moreover, the coating of TF also renders the complexes with an eminent &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; relaxivity for in vivo &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted tumor magnetic resonance imaging. The created intelligent nanocomplexes may represent an advanced nanomedicine formulation uniquely integrated with a metal&#8211;phenolic network and dendrimer nanotechnology for imaging-guided cancer therapy through ERS amplification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Tumor Extracellular Matrix by Simultaneous Inhibition of Two Cancer Cell Receptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) is involved in fundamental cellular processes and pathological progression of many diseases. While most research and current knowledge focuses on the processes of biological and mechanical changes in ECM signaling residing cancer cells to respond, little is known of the converse&#8211;of how cancer cells initiate the changes of ECM properties. Here, we report that blocking the cancer cell signaling leads to disruption of tumor ECM. Using recombinant proteins (RPs) and recombinant protein&#8208;drug conjugates (RPDCs) that simultaneously target both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and integrin, we demonstrated that multi&#8208;receptor&#8208;mediated active modulation of tumor ECM (mRMM&#8208;ECM) can inhibit and even reverse tumor remodeling of the physiological and structural microenvironment. These results not only provide insights into the regulatory roles of cancer cells in developing a pro&#8208;tumoral microenvironment, but also introduce a new therapeutic platform or strategy to treat cancers.

         <title>Sunlight&#8208;coordinated high&#8208;performance Moisture Power in Natural Condition</title>

Abstract
It is of challenge to spontaneously harvest multiple clean sources from environment for upgraded energy converting system. The ubiquitous moisture and sunlight in the nature are attractive for sustainable power generation especially. We herein develop a high&#8208;performance light&#8208;coordinated moist&#8208;electric generator (LMEG) based on the rational combination of polyelectrolyte and phytochrome. By spontaneous adsorption of gaseous water molecules and simultaneous exposure to sunlight, a piece of 1 cm2 composite film with a thickness of 0.56&#160;mm offers an open circuit voltage of 0.92&#160;V and a considerable short&#8208;circuit&#8208;current density of up to 1.55&#160;mA cm&#8208;2. This record high current density is about two orders of magnitude improvement over that of most conventional moisture&#8208;enabled generation, which is caused by the moisture&#8208;induced charge separation companied with photoexcited carrier migration as confirmed by a dynamic Monte Carlo device simulation. Flexible devices with customizable size are available for large&#8208;scale integration to effectively work under the wide range of relative humidity (about 20%&#8210;100%), temperature (10&#8210;80&#160;&#176;C) and light intensity (30&#8210;200&#160;mW cm&#8210;2). The wearable and portable LMEGs provide ample power supply in the natural conditions for indoor and outdoor electricity consuming systems such as lighting and electrically&#8208;driven objects. This work opens a novel avenue to develop green and sustainable power generation through simultaneously collecting multi&#8208;types of natural energy by a single hybrid harvester.

         <title>Reshaping Tumor Immune Microenvironment Based on Light Activated Nano&#8208;Platform for Efficient Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) always cause poor antitumor immune efficacy, prone to relapse and metastasis. Herein, a novel polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) modified BiFeO3/Bi2WO6 (BFO/BWO) with p&#8208;n type heterojunction was constructed for reshaping immunosuppressive TME. Reactive oxygen species could be generated under light activation by the well separation of hole (h+)&#8208;electron (e&#8722;) pairs owing to the heterojunction in BFO/BWO&#8208;PVP NPs. Interestingly, the h+ can trigger the decomposition of H2O2 to generate O2 for alleviating tumor hypoxia, which not only sensitizes photodynamic therapy (PDT) and radiotherapy (RT), but also promotes the tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization from M2 to M1 phenotype, beneficial to decrease the expression of HIF&#8208;1&#945;. Importantly, such a light activated nano&#8208;platform combing with RT could efficiently activate and recruit cytotoxic T lymphocytes to infiltrate in tumor tissues, as well as stimulate TAMs to M1 phenotype, dramatically reverse the immunosuppressive TME into the immunoactive one and further boost immune memory responses. Moreover, BFO/BWO&#8208;PVP NPs also present high performance of computed tomography imaging contrast. Taken together, this work offers a novel paradigm for achieving O2 self&#8208;supplement of inorganic nano&#8208;agent and reshaping tumor immune microenvironment to effective inhibition of cancer as well as metastasis and recurrence.

         <title>Ionic liquid treatment for highest&#8208;efficiency ambient printed stable all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic cesium lead triiodide (CsPbI3) perovskite is well known for its unparalleled stability at high temperatures up to 500&#160;&#176;C and under oxidative chemical stresses. However, upscaling solar cells via ambient printing suffers from imperfect crystal quality and defects caused by uncontrollable crystallization. Herein, we report that the incorporation of a low concentration of novel ionic liquid is promising for managing defects in CsPbI3 film, interfacial energy alignment and device stability of solar cells fabricated via ambient blade&#8208;coating. Both theoretical simulations and experimental measurements reveal that the ionic liquid successfully regulates the perovskite thin&#8208;film growth to decrease perovskite grain boundaries, strongly coordinates with the undercoordinated Pb2+ to passivate iodide vacancy defects, aligns interface to decrease energy barrier at the electron transporting layer by 280 meV, and relaxes the lattice strain to effectively promote phase stability. Consequently, we achieved high&#8208;efficiency ambient printed CsPbI3 solar cells with PCE as high as 20.01% under 1 sun illumination (100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and 37.24% under indoor light illumination (1000 lux, 365 &#956;W cm&#8722;2), both are the highest for the printed all&#8208;inorganic cells for corresponding applications. Furthermore, the bare cells without any encapsulation showed an impressive long&#8208;term ambient stability with only &#8764;5% PCE degradation after 1000 h aging under ambient condition.

         <title>Monolithic All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells with Minimized Optical and Energetic Losses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;based multijunction solar cells are a potentially cost&#8208;effective technology that can help surpass the efficiency limits of single&#8208;junction devices. However, both mixed&#8208;halide wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites and lead&#8208;tin narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskites suffer from non&#8208;radiative recombination due to the formation of bulk traps and interfacial recombination centers which limit the open&#8208;circuit voltage of sub&#8208;cells and consequently of the integrated tandem. Additionally, the complex optical stack in a multijunction solar cell can lead to losses stemming from parasitic absorption and reflection of incident light which aggravates the current mismatch between sub&#8208;cells, thereby limiting the short&#8208;circuit current density of the tandem. Here, we present an integrated all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cell that uses surface passivation strategies to reduce non&#8208;radiative recombination at the perovskite&#8208;fullerene interfaces, yielding a high open&#8208;circuit voltage. By using optically benign transparent electrode and charge&#8208;transport layers, absorption in the narrow&#8208;bandgap sub&#8208;cell is improved, leading to an improvement in current&#8208;matching between sub&#8208;cells. Collectively, these strategies allow the development of a monolithic tandem solar cell exhibiting a power&#8208;conversion efficiency of over 23%.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite-based multijunction solar cells are a potentially cost-effective technology that can help surpass the efficiency limits of single-junction devices. However, both mixed-halide wide-bandgap perovskites and lead-tin narrow-bandgap perovskites suffer from non-radiative recombination due to the formation of bulk traps and interfacial recombination centers which limit the open-circuit voltage of sub-cells and consequently of the integrated tandem. Additionally, the complex optical stack in a multijunction solar cell can lead to losses stemming from parasitic absorption and reflection of incident light which aggravates the current mismatch between sub-cells, thereby limiting the short-circuit current density of the tandem. Here, we present an integrated all-perovskite tandem solar cell that uses surface passivation strategies to reduce non-radiative recombination at the perovskite-fullerene interfaces, yielding a high open-circuit voltage. By using optically benign transparent electrode and charge-transport layers, absorption in the narrow-bandgap sub-cell is improved, leading to an improvement in current-matching between sub-cells. Collectively, these strategies allow the development of a monolithic tandem solar cell exhibiting a power-conversion efficiency of over 23%.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Rapid Identification of DNA Fragments through Direct Sequencing with Electro&#8208;Optical Zero&#8208;Mode Waveguides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
In contrast to sequence&#8208;specific techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA sequencing does not require prior knowledge of the sample for surveying DNA. However, current sequencing technologies demand high inputs for a suitable library preparation, which typically necessitates DNA amplification, even for single&#8208;molecule sequencing methods. Here, we present electro&#8208;optical zero&#8208;mode waveguides (eZMWs), which can load DNA into the confinement of zero&#8208;mode waveguides with high efficiency and negligible DNA fragment length bias. Using eZMWs, we observe highly efficient voltage&#8208;induced loading of DNA fragments of various sizes from ultralow inputs (ng&#8208;to&#8208;pg levels). We demonstrate rapid DNA fragment identification by burst sequencing of short and long DNA molecules (260&#160;bp and 20000&#160;bp) loaded from an equimolar pM&#8208;level concentration mixture in just a few&#8208;minutes. Our device allows further studies in which low&#8208;input DNA capture is essential, for example, in epigenetics, where native DNA is required for obtaining modified base information.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclic electrochemical polishing and thermal annealing approach that allows the effective conversion from commercial Cu to single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) foils is reported. Using Cu(111), a general &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8208;etching&#8221; method is developed for producing pure monolayer graphene film with high and uniform electronic quality. This work provides new ways and mechanisms to address these key issues.








Abstract
Synthesis of large&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystalline graphene monolayers without multilayers involves the fabrication of proper single&#8208;crystalline substrates and the ubiquitous formation of multilayered graphene islands during chemical vapor deposition. Here, a method of cyclic electrochemical polishing combined with thermal annealing, which allows the conversion of commercial polycrystalline Cu foils to single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) with an almost 100% yield, is presented. A global &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8208;etching&#8221; method that is capable of fabricating large&#8208;area pure single&#8208;crystalline graphene monolayers without multilayers through selectively etching bottom multilayered graphene underneath large area as&#8208;grown graphene monolayer on Cu(111) surface is demonstrated. Terahertz time&#8208;domain spectroscopy (THz&#8208;TDS) measurement of the pure monolayer graphene film shows a high average sheet conductivity of 2.8 mS and mean carrier mobility of 6903 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 over a large area. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the selective etching is induced by the much easier diffusion of hydrogen atoms than hydrocarbon radicals across the edges of the top graphene layer, and the simulated selective etching processes based on phase field modeling are well consistent with experimental observations. This work provides new ways toward the production of single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) and the synthesis of pure monolayer graphene with high electronic quality.

         <title>Machine Learning Guided Dopant Selection for Metal Oxide based Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting: The Case Study of Fe2O3 and CuO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Doping is an effective strategy for tuning metal oxide based semiconductors for solar&#8208;driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Despite decades of extensive research effort, the dopant selection is still largely dependent on a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach. Machine learning (ML) is promising in providing predictable insights on the dopant selection for high&#8208;performing PEC systems because it can uncover correlations from the seemingly ambiguous linkages between vast features of dopants and the PEC performance of doped photoelectrodes. Herein, we successfully build ML model to predict the doping effect of 17 metal dopants into hematite (Fe2O3), a prototype photoelectrode material. Our findings disclose the critical parameters from the 10 intrinsic features of each dopant. The model is further experimentally validated by the coherent prediction on Y and La dopants&#8217; behaviors. Further interpretation of the ML model suggests that the chemical state is the most significant selection criteria, meanwhile, dopants with higher metal&#8208;oxygen bond formation enthalpy and larger ionic radius are favored in improving the charge separation and transfer (CST) in the Fe2O3 photoanodes. The generic feature of this ML guided selection criteria has been further extended to CuO&#8208;based photoelectrodes showing improved CST by alkaline metal ions doping.

         <title>A Stiffness&#8208;Switchable, Biomimetic Smart Material Enabled by Supramolecular Reconfiguration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In nature, stiffness&#8208;changing behavior is essential for living organisms, which, however, is challenging to achieve in synthetic materials. Here, we report a stiffness&#8208;changing smart material by developing the interchangeable supramolecular configurations inspired from dermis of sea cucumber, which shows extreme, switchable mechanical properties. At hydrated state, the material, owning a stretched, double&#8208;stranded supramolecular network, showcases a soft&#8208;gel behaviour with a low stiffness and high pliability. Upon the stimulation of ethanol to transform into the coiled supramolecular configuration, it self&#8208;adjusts to be a hard matter with nearly 500&#8208;times enhanced stiffness from 0.51 to 243.6&#160;MPa, outstanding load&#8208;bearing capability (over 35,000 times its own weight), and excellent puncture/impact resistance with a specific impact strength of &#8764;116&#160;kJ m&#8722;2 (g cm&#8722;3)&#8722;1 (higher than some metals and alloys such as aluminum, and even comparable to the commercially available protective materials such as D3O and Kevlar). Moreover, this material demonstrates reconfiguration&#8208;dependent self&#8208;healing behavior and designable formability, holding great promise in advanced engineering fields that requires both high&#8208;strength durability and good formability. This work may open up a new perspective for the development of self&#8208;regulating materials from the supramolecular&#8208;scale configuration regulation.

Abstract
Although one of the most mature battery technologies, lithium&#8208;ion batteries still have many aspects that have not reached the desired requirements, such as energy density, current density, safety, environmental compatibility, and price. To solve these problems, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLB) based on lithium metal anodes with high energy density and safety have been proposed and become a research hotpot in recent years. Due to the advanced electrochemical properties of two&#8208;dimensional materials (2DM), they have been applied to mitigate some of the current problems of ASSLBs, such as high interface impedance and low electrolyte ionic conductivity. In this work, the background and fabrication method of 2DMs are reviewed initially. The improvement strategies of 2DMs are categorized based on their application in the three main components of ASSLBs: The anode, cathode, and electrolyte. Finally, to elucidate the mechanisms of 2DMs in ASSLBs, the role of in&#8208;situ characterization, synchrotron X&#8208;ray techniques and other advanced characterization are discussed.

         <title>Highly Transparent and Self&#8208;Healable Solar Thermal Anti&#8208;/De&#8208;Icing Surfaces: When Ultrathin MXene Multilayers Marry Solid Slippery Self&#8208;Cleaning Coating</title>

Abstract
Solar anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing can solve icing problems by converting sunlight into heat. One of the biggest problems, which has long been plaguing the design of solar anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing surfaces, is that photothermal materials are always lightproof and appear black, because of the mutual exclusiveness between generating heat and retaining transparency. Herein, we report a highly transparent and scalable solar anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing surface, which enables the coated glass to exhibit high transparency (&gt;77% transmittance at 550&#160;nm) and meanwhile, causes a &gt;30&#176;C&#160;surface temperature increase relative to ambient under 1.0 sun illumination. Such a transparent anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing surface can be fabricated onto a large class of substrates (e.g., glass, ceramics, metals, plastics), by applying a solid omniphobic slippery coating onto layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembled ultrathin MXene multilayers. Hence, the surface possesses self&#8208;cleaning ability to shed waterborne and oil&#8208;based liquids thanks to residue&#8208;free slipping motion. Passive anti&#8208;icing and active de&#8208;icing capabilities are, respectively, obtained on the solar thermal surface, which effectively prevents water from freezing and simultaneously melts pre&#8208;formed ice and thick frost. The self&#8208;cleaning effect enables residue&#8208;free removal of unfrozen water and interfacially melted ice/frost to boost the anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing efficiency. Importantly, the surface is capable of self&#8208;healing under illumination to repair physical damage and chemical degradation.

Abstract
Photocatalysis is a green technology to use ubiquitous and intermittent sunlight. The emerging S&#8208;scheme heterojunction has demonstrated its superiority in photocatalysis. This article covers the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress and provides new insights into its general designing criteria. It starts with the challenges confronted by single photocatalyst from the perspective of energy dissipation by borrowing the common behaviors in the dye molecule. Subsequently, other problems faced by single photocatalyst are summarized. Then a viable solution for these problems is the construction of heterojunctions. To overcome the problems and mistakes of type&#8208;II and Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, S&#8208;scheme heterojunction is proposed and the underlying reaction mechanism is summarized. Afterward, the design principles for S&#8208;scheme heterojunction are proposed and four types of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions are suggested. Following this, direct characterization techniques for testifying the charge transfer in S&#8208;scheme heterojunction are presented. Finally, different photocatalytic applications of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions are summarized. Specifically, this work endeavors to clarify the critical understanding on curved Fermi level in S&#8208;schem2e heterojunction interface, which can help strengthen and advance the fundamental theories of photocatalysis. Moreover, the current challenges and prospects of the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst are critically discussed.

         <title>A New Durable Surface Nanoparticles&#8208;Modified Perovskite Cathode for Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells from Selective Cation Exsolution under Oxidizing Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A high&#8208;performance cathode of a protonic ceramic fuel cell (PCFC) should possess excellent oxygen reduction reactivity, high proton/oxygen&#8208;ion/electron conductivity, and sufficient operational stability, thus requiring a delicate tuning of both the bulk and surface properties of the electrode material. Although surface modification of perovskites with nanoparticles from reducing&#8208;atmosphere exsolution has been demonstrated effective at improving the electrochemical anodic oxidation, such nanoparticles would easily re&#8208;incorporate into the perovskite lattice causing a big challenge for their application as cathode. Here, we report a durable perovskite&#8208;based nanocomposite cathode for PCFC, which is facilely prepared via the exsolution of nanoparticles in an oxidizing atmosphere. Through composition and cation nonstoichiometry manipulation, a precursor with the nominal composition of Ba0.95(Co0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1)0.95Ni0.05O3&#8208;&#948; (BCFZYN&#8208;095) is designed, synthesized, and investigated, which, upon calcination, gives rise to the formation of a perovskite&#8208;based nanocomposite comprising a major perovskite phase and a minor NiO phase enriched on the perovskite surface. The major perovskite phase enabled by the proper cation nonstoichiometry manipulation promotes bulk proton conduction while the NiO nanoparticles facilitate oxygen surface exchange process, leading to superior cathodic performance with a maximum peak power density of 1040&#160;mW cm&#8211;2 at 650&#176;C and an excellent operational stability of 400 h at 550&#176;C.

         <title>Escalating ferromagnetic order via Se&#8208;vacancy near vanadium in WSe2 monolayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Magnetic order has been proposed to arise from a variety of defects including vacancies, anti&#8208;sites, and grain&#8208;boundaries, which are relevant in numerous electronics and spintronics applications. Nevertheless, its magnetism remains controversial due to the lack of structural analysis. We herein demonstrate the escalation of ferromagnetism in vanadium&#8208;doped WSe2 monolayer by tailoring complex configurations of Se vacancies via post heat&#8208;treatment. Structural analysis of atomic defects was systematically performed using transmission electron microscopy, enabled by monolayer nature. Temperature&#8208;dependent magnetoresistance hysteresis ensures enhanced magnetic order after high&#8208;temperature heat&#8208;treatment, consistent with magnetic domain analysis from magnetic force microscopy. The vanadium &#8211; Se vacancy pairing is a key to promote ferromagnetism via spin&#8208;flip by electron transfer, predicted from density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations. Our approach towards nano&#8208;defect engineering paves a way to overcome weak magnetic order in diluted magnetic semiconductors for renovating semiconductor spintronics.

Despite the clinically proven efficacies of immune checkpoint blockades, including anti&#8208;cytotoxic T lymphocyte&#8208;associated protein 4 antibody (&#945;CTLA&#8208;4), the low response rate and immune&#8208;related adverse events (irAEs) in cancer patients represent major drawbacks of the therapy. These drawbacks of &#945;CTLA&#8208;4 therapy are mainly due to the suboptimal activation of tumor&#8208;specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and the systemic non&#8208;specific activation of T cells. To overcome such drawbacks, &#945;CTLA&#8208;4 was delivered by dendritic cell&#8208;derived nanovesicles presenting tumor antigens (DCNV&#8208;TAs) that exclusively interact with tumor&#8208;specific T cells, leading to selective activation of tumor&#8208;specific CTLs. Compared to conventional &#945;CTLA&#8208;4 therapy, treatment with &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#8208;conjugated DCNV&#8208;TAs significantly inhibited tumor growth and reduced irAEs in syngeneic tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This study demonstrates that the spatiotemporal presentation of both &#945;CTLA&#8208;4 and tumor antigens enables selective activation of tumor&#8208;specific T cells and potentiates the antitumor efficacy of &#945;CTLA&#8208;4 without inducing systemic irAEs.

         <title>Mass&#8208;Manufactured Beam&#8208;Steering Metasurfaces for High&#8208;Speed Full&#8208;Duplex Optical Wireless&#8208;Broadcasting Communications</title>

Assisted by an silicon&#8208;on&#8208;isolator&#8208;based metasurface that can be mass&#8208;manufactured by the complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) process, an ultracompact prototype for full&#8208;duplex metabroadcasting communications is demonstrated, which shows beam&#8208;steering angles up to &#177;40&#176;, 14 broadcasting channels with capacity for downstream and upstream links up to 100 and 10&#160;Gbps for each user channel, and three operating modes for flexible signal switching.








Abstract
Beam&#8208;steering devices, which are at the heart of optical wireless&#8208;broadcasting communication links, play an important role in data allocation and exchange. An ideal beam&#8208;steering device features large steering angles, arbitrary channel numbers, reconfigurability, and ultracompactness. However, these criteria have been achieved only partially with conventional beam&#8208;steering devices based on waveguides, micro&#8208;electricalmechanical systems, spatial light modulators, and gratings, which will substantially limit the application of optical wireless&#8208;broadcasting communication techniques. In this study, an ultracompact full&#8208;duplex metabroadcasting communication system is designed and experimentally demonstrated, which exhibits beam steering angles up to &#177;40&#176;, 14 broadcasting channels with capacity for downstream and upstream links up to 100 and 10&#160;Gbps for each user channel, three operating modes for flexible signal switching, and metadevice dimensions as small as 2&#160;mm&#160;&#215;&#160;2&#160;mm. In particular, the beam&#8208;steering metadevices are mass&#8208;manufactured by a complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) processing platform, which shows their potential for large&#8208;scale commercial applications. The demonstrated metabroadcasting communication system merges optical wireless&#8208;broadcasting communications and metasurfaces, which reduces the complexity of beam&#8208;steering devices while significantly increasing their performance, opening up a new avenue for high&#8208;quality optical wireless&#8208;broadcasting communications.

         <title>Rational Design of Covalent Heptazine Frameworks with Spatially Separated Redox Centers for High&#8208;Efficiency Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent heptazine frameworks (CHFs) with spatially separated redox centers are rationally designed from the molecular level. The spatial separation feature is critical for enhancing surface charge separation and achieving efficient H2O2 production. This study establishes a new foundation for the future development of metal&#8208;free polymer photocatalysts toward various photocatalytic overall reactions.








Abstract
The redox reaction centers in natural organisms conducting oxygenic photosynthesis are well arranged in a physically separated manner to convert sunlight into chemical energy efficiently. Mimicking natural photosynthesis via precisely constructing oxidative and reductive reaction centers within photocatalysts is ideal for enhancing catalytic performances in artificial photosynthesis. In this study, new covalent heptazine frameworks (CHFs) with spatially separated redox centers are rationally designed for photocatalytic production of H2O2 from water and oxygen without using any sacrificial agents. Both experimental and computational investigations indicate that the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction occurs on the heptazine moiety, whereas the two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction occurs on the acetylene or diacetylene bond in the CHFs. This unique spatial separation feature is critical for enhancing charge separation and achieving efficient H2O2 production. Meanwhile, the measured exciton binding energy of the diacetylene&#8208;containing polymer is merely 24 meV. Under simulated solar irradiation, the rationally designed CHFs can achieve a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.78%, surpassing previously reported photocatalytic materials. This study establishes a molecular engineering approach to construct periodically arranged and spatially separated redox centers in single&#8208;component polymer photocatalysts, representing a hallmark to create more exciting polymer structures for photocatalysis moving forward.

         <title>Stabilization of Exposed Metal Nanocrystals in High&#8208;Temperature Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A partial oxide coating strategy is developed for the stabilization of exposed metal nanocrystals to enhance their performance in thermal reverse water gas shift (RWGS) catalysis particularly at high temperatures. This study opens a new avenue for the exploration of high&#8208;quality colloidal metal nanocrystals in high&#8208;temperature heterogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
Colloidal metal nanocrystals with uniform sizes, shapes, compositions, and architectures are ideal building blocks for constructing heterogeneous catalysts with well&#8208;defined characteristics toward the investigation of accurate structure&#8211;property relationships and better understanding of catalytic mechanism. However, their applications in high&#8208;temperature heterogeneous catalysis are often restricted by the difficulty in maintaining the high metal dispersity and easy accessibility to active sites under harsh operating conditions. Here, a partial&#8208;oxide&#8208;coating strategy is proposed to stabilize metal nanocrystals against sintering and meanwhile enable an effective exposure of active sites. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, controlled partial silica coating of colloidally prepared Pd0.82Ni0.18 nanocrystals with the size of 8 nm is demonstrated. This partially coated catalyst exhibits excellent activity, selectivity, and stability, outperforming its counterparts with fully coated and supported structures, in reverse water gas shift (RWGS) catalysis particularly at high operating temperatures. This study opens a new avenue for the exploration of colloidal metal nanocrystals in high&#8208;temperature heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Active and Passive Tuning of ultra&#8208;narrow Resonances in Polaritonic Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Optical nanoantennas are of great importance for photonic devices and spectroscopy due to their capability to squeeze light at the nanoscale and enhance light&#8208;matter interactions. Among them, nanoantennas made of polar crystals supporting phonon polaritons (phononic nanoantennas) exhibit the highest quality factors. This is due to the low optical losses inherent in these materials, which, however, hinder the spectral tuning of the nanoantennas due to their dielectric nature. Here we realize active and passive tuning of ultra&#8208;narrow resonances in phononic nanoantennas over a wide spectral range (&#8764;35 cm&#8211;1, being the resonance linewidth &#8764;9 cm&#8211;1), monitored by near&#8208;field nanoscopy. To do that, we modify the local environment of a single nanoantenna made of hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) by placing it on different polar substrates, such as quartz (SiO2) and silicon carbide (4H&#8208;SiC), or covering it with layers of a high refractive&#8208;index van der Waals crystal (WSe2). Importantly, we demonstrate active tuning of the nanoantenna polaritonic resonances by placing it on top of a gated graphene monolayer in which we vary the Fermi energy. Our work presents the realization of tunable polaritonic nanoantennas with ultra&#8208;narrow resonances, which could find applications in active nanooptics and (bio)&#8208;sensing.

&lt;p&gt;Optical nanoantennas are of great importance for photonic devices and spectroscopy due to their capability to squeeze light at the nanoscale and enhance light-matter interactions. Among them, nanoantennas made of polar crystals supporting phonon polaritons (phononic nanoantennas) exhibit the highest quality factors. This is due to the low optical losses inherent in these materials, which, however, hinder the spectral tuning of the nanoantennas due to their dielectric nature. Here we realize active and passive tuning of ultra-narrow resonances in phononic nanoantennas over a wide spectral range (&#8764;35 cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;, being the resonance linewidth &#8764;9 cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;), monitored by near-field nanoscopy. To do that, we modify the local environment of a single nanoantenna made of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) by placing it on different polar substrates, such as quartz (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and silicon carbide (4H-SiC), or covering it with layers of a high refractive-index van der Waals crystal (WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Importantly, we demonstrate active tuning of the nanoantenna polaritonic resonances by placing it on top of a gated graphene monolayer in which we vary the Fermi energy. Our work presents the realization of tunable polaritonic nanoantennas with ultra-narrow resonances, which could find applications in active nanooptics and (bio)-sensing.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enabling Anionic Redox Stability of P2&#8208;Na5/6Li1/4Mn3/4O2 by Mg Substitution</title>

Abstract
Oxygen&#8208;based anionic redox reactions have recently emerged as a lever to increase the capacity of Mn&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes in addition to the charge compensation based on cationic redox reactions for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Unfortunately, the irreversibility of anionic redox often aggravates irreversible structure change and poor cycling performance. Here, a stable anionic redox is achieved through substituting Na ions by Mg ions in P2&#8208;type Na0.83Li0.25Mn0.75O2. DFT calculations reveal that Mg substitution effectively decreases the oxygen chemical potential, causing an improvement in lattice oxygen stability. Moreover, at a highly desodiated state, Mg ions that remain in the lattice and interact with O 2p orbitals can decrease the undercoordinated oxygen and the non&#8208;bonded, electron&#8208;deficient O 2p states, facilitating the reversibility of oxygen redox. When cycled in the voltage range of 2.6&#8208;4.5&#160;V where only anionic redox is occurred for charge compensation, Na0.773Mg0.03Li0.25Mn0.75O2 presents a much better reversibility, giving a 4 times better cycle stability than that of Na0.83Li0.25Mn0.75O2. Experimentally, Na0.773Mg0.03Li0.25Mn0.75O2 exhibits a &#8764;1.1% volume expansion during sodium insertion/extraction, suggestive of a &#8220;zero&#8208;strain&#8221; cathode. Overall, our work opens a new avenue for enhancing anionic reversibility of oxygen&#8208;related Mn&#8208;rich cathodes.

Abstract
Long after the heady days of high&#8208;temperature superconductivity, the oxides came back into the limelight in 2004 with the discovery of the two&#8208;dimensional electron gas in SrTiO3 and several heterostructures based on it. Not only do these materials exhibit interesting physics, they have opened up new vistas in oxide electronics and spintronics. However, much of the attention has recently shifted to KTaO3, a material with all the &#8220;good&#8221; properties of SrTiO3 (simple cubic structure, high mobility, etc.) but with the additional advantage of a much larger spin&#8208;orbit coupling. In this state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art review of the fascinating world of KTaO3, we attempt to cover the remarkable progress made, particularly in the last five years. We also indicate certain unsolved issues, while suggesting future research directions as well as potential applications. The range of physical phenomena associated with the two&#8208;dimensional electron gas trapped at the interfaces of KTaO3&#8208;based heterostructures include spin polarization, superconductivity, quantum oscillations in the magnetoresistance, spin&#8208;polarized electron transport, persistent photocurrent, Rashba effect, topological Hall effect, and inverse Edelstein Effect. We aim to discuss, on a single platform, the various fabrication techniques, the exciting physical properties and future application possibilities of this family of materials.

         <title>Novel Technique for Controlling Anisotropic Ion Diffusion: Bulk Single&#8208;crystalline Metallic Silicon Clathrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Na&#8208;free Si clathrates consisting only of Si cages are an allotrope of diamond&#8208;structured Si. This material is promising for various device applications, such as next&#8208;generation photovoltaics. The probable technique for synthesizing Na&#8208;free Si clathrates is to extract Na+ from the Si cages of Na24Si136. Vacuum annealing is presently a well&#8208;known conventional and effective approach for extracting Na. However, this study demonstrates that Na+ cannot be extracted from the surface of a single&#8208;crystalline type&#8208;II metallic Si clathrate (Na24Si136) in areas deeper than 150&#160;&#956;m. Therefore, a novel method was developed to control anisotropic ion diffusion: this is effective for various compounds with a large difference in the bonding strength between their constituent elements, such as Na24Si136 composed of covalent Si cages and weakly trapped Na+. By skillfully exploiting the difference in the chemical potentials as a driving force, Na+ was homogeneously extracted regardless of the size of the single crystal while maintaining high crystallinity. Additionally, the proposed point defect model was evaluated via density functional theory (DFT), and the migration of Na+ between the Si cages was explained. It is expected that the developed experimental and computational techniques would significantly advance material design for synthesizing thermodynamically metastable materials.

         <title>Tunable Nanoscale Evolution and Topological Phase Transitions of a Polar Vortex Supercrystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Understanding the phase transitions and domain evolutions of mesoscale topological structures in ferroic materials is critical to realize their potential applications in next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance storage devices. Here, we study the behaviors of a mesoscale supercrystal with 3&#8208;D nanoscale periodicity and rotational topology phases in a PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattice under thermal and electrical stimuli using a combination of phase&#8208;field simulations and X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. We construct a phase diagram of temperature versus polar state, showing the formation of the supercrystal from a mixed vortex and a&#8208;twin state and a temperature&#8208;dependent erasing process of a supercrystal returning to a classical a&#8208;twin structure. Under an in&#8208;plane electric field bias at room temperature, the vortex topology of the supercrystal irreversibly transforms to a new type of stripe&#8208;like supercrystal. Under an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electric field, the vortices inside the supercrystal undergo a topological phase transition to polar skyrmions. These results demonstrate the potential for the on&#8208;demand manipulation of polar topology and transformations in supercrystals using electric fields. The findings provide a theoretical understanding which may be utilized to guide the design and control of mesoscale polar structures and to explore novel polar structures in other systems and their topological nature.

         <title>Nanotechnology Enables Novel Modalities for Neuromodulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in developing novel nanoscale neuromodulation strategies with less invasiveness, improved biointerfaces, deeper penetration, and higher spatiotemporal precision are discussed. The employment of versatile nanomaterials and nanoscale devices with tailored physical properties has led to considerable research progress in nanotechnology&#8208;enabled electrical, optical, chemical, acoustic, and magnetic neuromodulation modalities, and cross&#8208;modal neuromodulation strategies using nanomaterials as energy transducers.








Abstract

         <title>Uncommon Behavior of Li Doping Suppresses Oxygen Redox in P2&#8208;Type Manganese&#8208;Rich Sodium Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
P2&#8208;type manganese&#8208;rich cathodes can have stabilized oxygen redox through doping Li/Mg to create unhybridized O 2p orbitals or introducing high covalency transition metals to induce a reductive coupling effect. This study on the model materials of P2&#8208;Na0.66Mn0.75Ni0.25O2 with and without Li doping reveals that the doped Li has complicated interactions with transition metals leading to an unusual oxygen redox suppression.








Abstract
Utilizing both cationic and anionic oxygen redox reactions is regarded as an important approach to exploit high&#8208;capacity layered cathode materials with earth abundant elements. It has been popular strategies to effectively elevate the oxygen redox activities by Li&#8208;doping to introduce unhybridized O 2p orbitals in NaxMnO2&#8208;based chemistries or enabling high covalency transition metals in P2&#8208;Na0.66MnxTM1&#8722;xO2 (TM = Fe, Cu, Ni) materials. Here, the effect of Li doping on regulating the oxygen redox activities P2&#8208;structured Na0.66Ni0.25Mn0.75O2 materials is investigated. Systematic X&#8208;ray characterizations and ab initio simulations have shown that the doped Li has uncommon behavior in modulating the density of states of the neighboring Ni, Mn, and O, leading to the suppression of the existing oxygen and Mn redox reactivities and the promotion of the Ni redox. The findings provide a complementary scenario to current oxygen redox mechanisms and shed lights on developing new routes for high&#8208;performance cathodes.

         <title>Optimized Colossal Near&#8208;Field Thermal Radiation Enabled by Manipulating Coupled Plasmon Polariton Geometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupled plasmon polaritons excited by gap&#8208;bridging multilayer graphene/SU8&#160;heterostructures lead to near&#8208;perfect photon&#8208;tunneling probability and improve the state of the art by one order of magnitude in near&#8208;field thermal radiation (NFTR). Electric tuning of the graphene Fermi&#8208;level allows for optimized NFTR enhancement. Colossal energy transfer should inspire potential applications in thermophotovoltaic and so on.








Abstract
Collective optoelectronic phenomena such as plasmons and phonon polaritons can drive processes in many branches of nanoscale science. Classical physics predicts that a perfect thermal emitter operates at the black body limit. Numerous experiments have shown that surface phonon polaritons allow emission two orders of magnitude above the limit at a gap distance of &#8776;50&#160;nm. This work shows that a supported multilayer graphene structure improves the state of the art by around one order of magnitude with a &#8776;1129&#8208;fold&#8208;enhancement at a gap distance of &#8776;55&#160;nm. Coupled surface plasmon polaritons at mid&#8208; and far&#8208;infrared frequencies allow for near&#8208;unity photon tunneling across a broad swath of k&#8208;space enabling the improved result. Electric tuning of the Fermi&#8208;level allows for the detailed characterization and optimization of the colossal nanoscale heat transfer.

         <title>Dense Silicon Nanowire Networks Grown on a Stainless&#8208;Steel Fiber Cloth: A Flexible and Robust Anode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dense and tunable mass loading of Si NWs is directly grown on a highly conductive, flexible, fire&#8208;resistant, and mechanically robust interwoven stainless&#8208;steel fiber cloth (SSFC) by a simple and readily scalable glassware setup. Si NWs@SSFC anode with a mass loadings of 1.32&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 achieves a stable areal capacity of &#8776;2 mAh cm&#8722;2 after 200 cycles.








Abstract
Silicon nanowires (Si NWs) are a promising anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high specific capacity. Achieving adequate mass loadings for binder&#8208;free Si NWs is restricted by low surface area, mechanically unstable and poorly conductive current collectors (CCs), as well as complicated/expensive fabrication routes. Herein, a tunable mass loading and dense Si NW growth on a conductive, flexible, fire&#8208;resistant, and mechanically robust interwoven stainless&#8208;steel fiber cloth (SSFC) using a simple glassware setup is reported. The SSFC CC facilitates dense growth of Si NWs where its open structure allows a buffer space for expansion/contraction during Li&#8208;cycling. The Si NWs@SSFC anode displays a stable performance for 500 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of &gt;99.5%. Galvanostatic cycling of the Si NWs@SSFC anode with a mass loading of 1.32&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 achieves a stable areal capacity of &#8776;2 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 0.2 C after 200 cycles. Si NWs@SSFC anodes with different mass loadings are characterized before and after cycling by scanning and transmission electron microscopy to examine the effects of Li&#8208;cycling on the morphology. Notably, this approach allows the large&#8208;scale fabrication of robust and flexible binder&#8208;free Si NWs@SSFC architectures, making it viable for practical applications in high energy density LIBs.

         <title>Fe3O4/Ag/Bi2MoO6 Photoactivatable Nanozyme for Self&#8208;Replenishing and Sustainable Cascaded Nanocatalytic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; photoactivable nanozyme (Fe3O4/Ag/Bi2MoO6) enables self&#8208;replenishing cascaded nanocatalytic reactions in tumor microenvironment for outstanding synergistic chemodynamic, photodynamic, photothermal therapy with guidance by multimode imagings.








Abstract
Catalytic cancer therapy based on nanozymes has recently attracted much interest. However, the types of the current nanozymes are limited and their efficiency is usually compromised and not sustainable in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Therefore, combination therapy involving additional therapeutics is often necessary and the resulting complication may jeopardize the practical feasibility. Herein, an unprecedented &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; Fe3O4/Ag/Bi2MoO6 nanoparticle (FAB NP) is rationally devised to achieve synergistic chemodynamic, photodynamic, photothermal therapy with guidance by magnetic resonance, photoacoustic, and photothermal imaging. Based on its manifold nanozyme activities (mimicking peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione oxidase) and photodynamic property, cascaded nanocatalytic reactions are enabled and sustained in TME for outstanding therapeutic outcomes. The working mechanisms underlying the intraparticulate interactions, sustainability, and self&#8208;replenishment arising from the coupling between the nanocatalytic reactions and nanozyme activities are carefully revealed, providing new insights into the design of novel nanozymes for nanocatalytic therapy with high efficiency, good specificity, and low side effects.

         <title>2D Cu9S5/PtS2/WSe2 Double Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor with High Current Gain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based Cu9S5/PtS2/WSe2 double&#8208;heterojunction bipolar transistor (DHBT) is constructed by direct mechanical transfer and exhibits high current gain (&#946;&#160;&#8776; 910 under common&#8208;emitter mode). This excellent performance is mainly attributed to restrained reverse current flux from base into emitter and thus greatly improves injection efficiency.








Abstract
Bipolar junction transistor (BJT) as one important circuit element is now widely used in high&#8208;speed computation and communication for its capability of high&#8208;power signal amplification. 2D materials and their heterostructures are promising in building high&#8208;amplification and high&#8208;frequency BJTs because they can be naturally thin and highly designable in tailoring components properties. However, currently the low emitter injection efficiency results in only moderate current gain achieved in the pioneer researches, severely restraining its future development. Herein, it is shown that an elaborately designed double heterojunction bipolar transistor (DHBT) can greatly promote the injection efficiency, improving the current gain by order of magnitude. In this DHBT high&#8208;doping&#8208;density wide&#8208;bandgap 2D Cu9S5 is used as emitter and narrow&#8208;bandgap PtS2 as base. This heterostructure efficiently suppresses the reverse electron flux from base and increase the injection efficiency. Consequently, the DHBT achieves an excellent current gain (&#946; &#8776; 910). This work systematically explores the electrical behavior of 2D materials based DHBT, and provides deep insight of the architecture design for building high gain DHBT, which may promote the applications of 2Dheterojunctions in the fields of integrated circuits.

         <title>A Novel Porous Ti&#8208;Squarate as Efficient Photocatalyst in the Overall Water Splitting Reaction under Simulated Sunlight Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel porous titanium(IV) squarate metal&#8211;organic framework with outstanding and recyclable photocatalytic activity on the overall water splitting reaction under simulated sunlight is reported.








Abstract
A new porous titanium(IV) squarate metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), denoted as IEF&#8208;11, having a never reported titanium secondary building unit, is successfully synthesized and fully characterized. IEF&#8208;11 not only exhibits a permanent porosity but also an outstanding chemical stability. Further, as a consequence of combining the photoactive Ti(IV) and the electroactive squarate, IEF&#8208;11 presents relevant optoelectronic properties, applied here to the photocatalytic overall water splitting reaction. Remarkably, IEF&#8208;11 as a photocatalyst is able to produce record H2 amounts for MOF&#8208;based materials under simulated sunlight (up to 672 &#181;mol gcatalyst in 22 h) without any activity loss during at least 10 d.

         <title>Designing and Demystifying the Lithium Metal Interface toward Highly Reversible Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A viable methodology is proposed to build highly reversible Li metal anodes by carefully designing the interface, which concurrently contributes to flattened Li deposition and minimizes inactive Li growth rates. Anode&#8208;free coin and pouch cells are further assembled to demonstrate the profound significance of anode Coulombic efficiency on the capacity retention of full cells.








Abstract
Reversible lithium (Li) plating/stripping is essential for building practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries based on Li metal chemistry, which unfortunately remains a severe challenge. In this contribution, it is demonstrated that through the rational regulation of strong Li+&#8722;anion coordination structures in a highly compatible low&#8208;polarity solvent, 2&#8208;methyl tetrahydrofuran, the Li plating/stripping assisted by a nucleation modulation procedure delivers a remarkably high average Coulombic efficiency under rather demanding conditions (99.7% and 99.5% under 1.0&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 3.0&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 and 3.0&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 3.0&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2, respectively). The exceedingly reversible cycling obtained herein is fundamentally correlated with the flattened Li deposition and minimized solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) generation/reconstruction in the customized condition, which notably restrains the growth rates of both dead Li0 (0.0120&#160;mAh per cycle) and SEI&#8208;Li+ (0.0191&#160;mAh per cycle) during consecutive cycles. Benefiting from the efficient Li plating/stripping manner, the assembled anode&#8208;free Cu|LiFePO4 (2.7&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2) coin and pouch cells exhibit impressive capacity retention of 43.8% and 41.6% after 150 cycles, respectively, albeit with no optimization on the test conditions. This work provides guidelines into the targeted interfacial design of high&#8208;efficiency working Li anodes, aiming to pave the way for the practical deployment of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries.

         <title>Dynamic Polymer Amphiphiles for Efficient Intracellular and In Vivo Protein Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of dynamic polymer supra&#8208;amphiphiles for intracellular protein delivery is reported. The prepared supra&#8208;amphiphiles can be coassembled with proteins to form stable nanoparticles, which can promote the effective intracellular delivery process of multiple proteins due to their dynamic features and show great potency in the delivery of superoxide dismutase to treat ulcerative colitis in vivo.








Abstract
Intracellular delivery of proteins is receiving considerable attention in biotherapeutics for various diseases by replacing dysfunctional proteins. Successful intracellular protein delivery highly relies on the development of efficient and safe polymeric carriers, which remains a grand challenge due to the lack of strong binding sites on proteins and their distinct molecular sizes and polarities. In this work, a strategy is proposed for efficient intracellular protein delivery by using dynamic polymer supra&#8208;amphiphiles, which are prepared by grafting boronated polylysine with a series of lipidated catechols via dynamic covalent catechol&#8211;boronate ester bonds. The prepared supra&#8208;amphiphiles can coassemble with proteins to form stable nanoparticles in water and also enable the release of bound proteins in cells due to their dynamic features, thereby strongly promoting the intracellular delivery process. The lead supra&#8208;amphiphiles screened in the library demonstrate high efficiency in the delivery of various proteins including bovine serum albumin, &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, &#945;&#8208;chymotrypsin, saporin, R&#8208;phycoerythrin, ovalbumin, catalase, and superoxide dismutase, and show great potency in delivering superoxide dismutase to treat ulcerative colitis in vivo. This work provides new opportunities for rational design and facile construction of robust intracellular protein delivery materials by the integration of polymer chemistry and supramolecular engineering strategies.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Thermal Switching of Individual Plasmonically Activated Spin Crossover Nanoparticle Imaged by Ultrafast Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrafast electron microscopy study shows how an individual spin crossover nanoparticle, with different number of embedded gold nanorods, acts as an efficient photoswitch where the size of the particle can be controlled within less than 20&#160;ns.








Abstract
Spin crossover (SCO) is a promising switching phenomenon when implemented in electronic devices as molecules, thin films or nanoparticles. Among the properties modulated along this phenomenon, optically induced mechanical changes are of tremendous importance as they can work as fast light&#8208;induced mechanical switches or allow to investigate and control microstructural strains and fatigability. The development of characterization techniques probing nanoscopic behavior with high spatio&#8208;temporal resolution allows to trigger and visualize such mechanical changes of individual nanoscopic objects. Here, ultrafast transmission electron microscopy (UTEM) is used to precisely probe the length changes of individual switchable nanoparticles induced thermally by nanosecond laser pulses. This allows revealing of the mechanisms of spin switching, leading to the macroscopic expansion of SCO materials. This study is conducted on individual pure SCO nanoparticles and SCO nanoparticles encapsulating gold nanorods that serve for plasmonic heating under laser pulses. Length changes are compared with time&#8208;resolved optical measurements performed on an assembly of these particles.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Perovskite Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Artificial Synapses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed perovskite artificial synapse that emulates a biological synapse is demonstrated. The perovskite synapse employs a field&#8208;effect transistor layout with a ferroelectric gate dielectric, wherein the channel conductance can be updated by ferroelectric polarization in a non&#8208;volatile fashion. The perovskite artificial synapse emulates essential synaptic behavior, offering a route to utilize perovskites in neuromorphic devices.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are distinctive semiconductors that exhibit both ionic and electronic transport and are promising for artificial synapses. However, developing a 3&#8208;terminal transistor artificial synapse with the perovskite channel remains elusive due to the lack of a proper technique to regulate mobile ions in a non&#8208;volatile manner. Here, a solution&#8208;processed perovskite transistor is reported for artificial synapses through the implementation of a ferroelectric gate. The ferroelectric polarization provides a non&#8208;volatile electric field on the perovskite, leading to fixation of the mobile ions and hence modulation of the electronic conductance of the channel. Multi&#8208;state channel conductance is realized by partial ferroelectric polarization. The ferroelectric&#8208;gated perovskite transistor is successfully used as an artificial synapse that emulates basic synaptic functions such as long&#8208;term plasticity with excellent linearity, short&#8208;term as well as spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity. The strategy to regulate ion dynamics in the perovskites using the ferroelectric gate suggests a generic route to employ perovskites for synaptic electronics.

         <title>Electron and Ion Co&#8208;Conductive Catalyst Achieving Instant Transformation of Lithium Polysulfide towards Li2S</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique electron and ion co&#8208;conductive catalyst of carbon&#8208;coated Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 (C@LATP) composite electrolyte is developed, which can synchronously provide both Li&#8208;ions and electrons for the conversion reaction of LiPSs. The conversion reaction path of lithium polysulfide (LiPSs) using C@LATP changes from traditional &#8220;adsorption&#8211;diffusion&#8211;conversion&#8221; to novel &#8220;adsorption&#8211;conversion&#8221;, which effectively promotes the instant conversion reaction of LiPSs to Li2S.








Abstract
Most of the catalysts in lithium sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries present low electronic conductivity and the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) must diffuse onto the surface of the carbon materials to achieve their conversion reaction. It is a significant challenge to achieve the instantaneous transformation of LiPSs to Li2S in Li&#8211;S batteries to suppress the shuttle effect of LiPSs. Herein, a unique electron and ion co&#8208;conductive catalyst of carbon&#8208;coated Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 (C@LATP) is developed, which not only possesses strong adsorption to LiPSs, but, more importantly, also promotes the instantaneous conversion reaction of LiPSs to Li2S. The C@LATP nanoparticles as catalytic active sites can synchronously and efficiently provide both Li ions and electrons to facilitate the conversion reaction of LiPSs. The conversion reaction path of LiPSs using C@LATP changes from traditional &#8220;adsorption&#8211;diffusion&#8211;conversion&#8221; to novel &#8220;adsorption&#8211;conversion,&#8221; which effectively lowers the decomposition barrier of Li2S6 and promotes faster conversion of LiPSs. The shuttle effect of LiPSs is considerably suppressed and utilization of sulfur is greatly improved. The Li&#8211;S batteries using C@LATP present excellent rate, cycling, and self&#8208;discharge properties. This work highlights the significance of electron and ion co&#8208;conductive solid&#8208;state electrolytes for the instantaneous transformation of LiPSs in advanced Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polysaccharide&#8208;based, multilayered hydrogel fibers in the photonics arena are explored. Natural ionic&#8208;crosslinking hydrogels are leveraged for developing a hydrogel fiber fusion splicing method and combined with nanoplasmonic&#8208;based photonics for detecting biotargets such as SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The integration of living entities in the cytocompatible light&#8208;guiding core enables the digitalization and quantification of complex 3D biological events, such as cancer invasive proliferation.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state optics has been the pillar of modern digital age. Integrating soft hydrogel materials with micro/nanooptics could expand the horizons of photonics for bioengineering. Here, wet&#8208;spun multilayer hydrogel fibers are engineered through ionic&#8208;crosslinked natural polysaccharides that serve as multifunctional platforms. The resulting flexible hydrogel structure and reversible crosslinking provide tunable design properties such as adjustable refractive index and fusion splicing. Modulation of the optical readout via physical stimuli, including shape, compression, and multiple optical inputs/outputs is demonstrated. The unique permeability of the hydrogels is also combined with plasmonic nanoparticles for molecular detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in fiber&#8208;coupled biomedical swabs. A tricoaxial 3D printing nozzle is then employed for the continuous fabrication of living optical fibers. Light interaction with living cells enables the quantification and digitalization of complex biological phenomena such as 3D cancer progression and drug susceptibility. These fibers pave the way for advances in biomaterial&#8208;based photonics and biosensing platforms.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Fluorination of Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, scalable strategy is attempted using a direct gas&#8208;phase fluorination technique to fluorinate&#160;hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The nature of fluorine bonding to the&#160;hBN lattice and their chemical coordination are evaluated using various analytical techniques and theoretical models. Interestingly, the derived F&#8208;hBN displays significant improvement in its thermal and friction properties and displays a semiconducting behavior.








Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has received much attention in recent years as a 2D dielectric material with potential applications ranging from catalysts to electronics. hBN is a stable covalent compound with a planar hexagonal lattice and is relatively unreactive to most chemical environments, making the chemical functionalization of hBN challenging. Here, a simple, scalable strategy to fluorinate hBN using a direct gas&#8208;phase fluorination technique is reported. The nature of fluorine bonding to the hBN lattice and their chemical coordination are described based on various characterization studies and theoretical models. The fluorine functionalized hBN shows a bandgap reduction and displays a semiconducting behavior due to the fluorination process. Additionally, the fluorinated hBN shows significant improvement in its thermal and friction properties, which could be substantial in applications such as lubricants and thermal fluids. Theory and simulations reveal that the enhanced friction properties of fluorinated hBN result from reduced inter&#8208;planar interaction energy by electrostatic repulsion of intercalated fluorine atoms between hBN layers without significant disruption of the in&#8208;plane lattice. This technique paves the way for the fluorination of several other 2D structures for various applications such as magnetism and functional nanoscale electronic devices.

Theory and simulations reveal that the enhanced friction properties of fluorinated &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;BN result from reduced inter-planar interaction energy by electrostatic repulsion of intercalated fluorine atoms between &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;BN layers without significant disruption of the in-plane lattice. This technique paves the way for the fluorination of several other 2D structures for various applications such as magnetism and functional nanoscale electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hybrid Electrolyte with Dual&#8208;Anion&#8208;Aggregated Solvation Sheath for Stabilizing High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A moderate&#8208;concentration electrolyte with an inner dual&#8208;anion&#8208;aggregated Li+ solvation sheath is developed, which guarantees the reversibility of Li plating/stripping and meets the requirements of a high&#8208;voltage cathode. This peculiar solvated structure plays an important role in tailoring the electrode/electrolyte interphases, so as to realize the long&#8208;term cyclability of lithium&#8208;metal batteries with limited Li anodes and LiNi0.85Co0.10Al0.05O2 cathodes.








Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) with high&#8208;voltage cathodes and limited Li&#8208;metal anodes are crucial to realizing high&#8208;energy storage. However, functional electrolytes that are compatible with both high&#8208;voltage cathodes and Li anodes are required for their developments. In this study, the use of a moderate&#8208;concentration LiPF6 and LiNO3 dual&#8208;salt electrolyte composed of ester and ether co&#8208;solvents (fluoroethylene carbonate/dimethoxyethane, FEC/DME), which forms a unique Li+ solvation with aggregated dual anions, that is, PF6&#8722; and NO3&#8722;, is proposed to stabilize high&#8208;voltage LMBs. Mechanistic studies reveal that such a solvation sheath improves the Li plating/stripping kinetics and induces the generation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer with gradient heterostructure and high Young's modulus on the anode, and a thin and robust cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) film. Therefore, this novel electrolyte enables colossal Li deposits with a high Coulombic efficiency (&#8776;98.9%) for 450 cycles at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2. The as&#8208;assembled Li&#449;LiNi0.85Co0.10Al0.05O2 full batteries deliver an excellent lifespan and capacity retention at 4.3 V with a rigid negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive capacity ratio. This electrolyte system with a dual&#8208;anion&#8208;aggregated solvation structure provides insights into the interfacial chemistries through solvation regulation for high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc Batteries Based on Organic/Organic Cathodes Integrating Multiredox Centers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous carbon (C) electrodeposited  with stable poly(1,5&#8208;naphthalenediamine, NAPD) nanorods and excellent conductive poly(para&#8208;aminophenol, pAP) nano dots, designated as C@multilayer polymer cathode, are first synthesized via a novel two&#8208;step electrodeposition method. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of C&#63742;O and C&#63742;N active groups, Zn//C@multilayer polymer delivers high energy&#8208;storage performances.








Abstract
Organic cathode materials with redox&#8208;active sites and flexible structure are promising for developing aqueous zinc ion batteries with high capacity and large output power. However, the energy storage of most organic hosts relies on the coordination/incoordination reaction between Zn2+/H+ and a single functional group, which result in inferior capacity, low discharge platform, and structural instability. Here, the lead is taken in in situ electrodepositing stable poly(1,5&#8208;naphthalenediamine, 1,5&#8208;NAPD) as interlayer and excellent conductive poly(para&#8208;aminophenol, pAP) skin onto nanoporous carbon in sequence for the structural optimization of organic/organic cathodes, designated as C@multi&#8208;layer polymer. In situ analyses, electrochemical measurements, and theoretical calculation prove that both C&#63742;O and C&#63742;N active groups can act as a strong electron donor as well as Zn2+ host during the discharging process. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the double organic layers, C@multi&#8208;layer polymer delivers high capacity, long lifespan, and excellent capacity reservation even at large discharge current and commercial mass loading (&gt;10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). Introducing multiredox centers into one organic composites will provide new insights into designing advanced Zn&#8211;organic batteries.

         <title>Synergistic Modulation of the Separation of Photo&#8208;Generated Carriers via Engineering of Dual Atomic Sites for Promoting Photocatalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalyst with Cu single atoms anchored on S doped polymeric carbon nitride (p&#8208;CN) is designed for photo&#8208;oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The construction of dual atomic sites of Cu&#8211;N4 and C&#8211;S&#8211;C in Cu SAs/p&#8208;CNS facilitates the separation of photo&#8208;generated carriers and thus enhances the photo catalytic activity.








Abstract
The separation efficiency of photo&#8208;generated carriers is still a great challenge that restricts the practical application of photocatalytic technology. The design of spatial separation path for photo&#8208;generated carriers at atomic level provides an innovative approach to address this challenge. Herein, a facile dual atomic sites strategy, consisting of Cu&#8208;N4 and C&#8208;S&#8208;C active moieties decorated on polymeric carbon nitride (Cu SAs/p&#8208;CNS) is reported to simultaneously achieve the highly efficient separation of photo&#8208;generated electrons and holes for boosting photocatalytic performance. As a proof of concept, the Cu SAs/p&#8208;CNS is successfully applied to the photo&#8208;oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF), which exhibits 77.1% HMF conversion and 85.6% DFF selectivity under visible light irradiation. The activity is considerably higher than that of bulk p&#8208;CN, S doped p&#8208;CN, and p&#8208;CN supported Cu single atom catalysts. Theoretical calculations and experimental results suggest that, during photocatalytic reaction, the isolated Cu&#8208;N4 sites directly capture photo&#8208;generated electrons, while the surrounding S atoms bear photo&#8208;generated holes, which synergistically facilitates the separation of photo&#8208;generated carriers and thus results in enhanced photocatalytic activity. This study provides a new perspective for the rational design of high performance photocatalysts at atomic level.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Friction MSCs Delivery System Improves the Therapy for Severe Osteoarthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA supramolecular hydrogel is employed as a carrier for bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) to treat osteoarthritis (OA). Compared with current clinical strategies, the DNA  supramolecular hydrogel can significantly improve the vitality of BMSCs during delivery, and provide cells with long&#8208;term antifriction protection, excellent permeability, 3D support, and 3D microenvironment of cell proliferation and differentiation, ultimately enhancing the therapeutic effect of BMSCs.








Abstract
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a musculoskeletal disorder disease affecting about 500 million people worldwide and mesenchymal sem cells (MSCs) therapy has been demonstrated as a potential strategy to treat OA. However, the shear forces during direct injection and the harsher shear condition of OA environments would lead to significant cell damage and inhibit the therapeutic efficacy. Herein, DNA supramolecular hydrogel has been applied as delivering material for MSCs to treat severe OA model, which perform extraordinary protection in MSCs against the shear force both in vitro and in vivo. It is demonstrated that the DNA supramolecular hydrogel can promote formation of quality cartilage, reduce osteophyte, and normalize subchondral bone under the high friction condition of OA, whose molecular mechanisms underlying therapeutic effects are also investigated. It can be anticipated that DNA supramolecular hydrogel would be a promising cell delivery system for multiple potential MSCs therapy.

         <title>Using Dipole Interaction to Achieve Nonvolatile Voltage Control of Magnetism in Multiferroic Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy using the dipole interaction to achieve nonvolatile electrical control of magnetism is demonstrated in an interacting magnet using a volatile strain. This work reveals the important role of the dipole interaction in multiferroic heterostructures and can stimulate future research on the electrical control of magnetism by introducing additional interactions to multiferroic heterostructures.








Abstract
Nonvolatile electrical control of magnetism is crucial for developing energy&#8208;efficient magnetic memory. Based on strain&#8208;mediated magnetoelectric coupling, a multiferroic heterostructure containing an isolated magnet requires nonvolatile strain to achieve this control. However, the magnetization response of an interacting magnet to strain remains elusive. Herein, Co/MgO/CoFeB magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) exhibiting dipole interaction on ferroelectric substrates are fabricated. Remarkably, nonvolatile voltage control of the resistance in the MTJs is demonstrated, which originates from the nonvolatile magnetization rotation of an interacting CoFeB magnet driven by volatile voltage&#8208;generated strain. Conversely, for an isolated CoFeB magnet, this volatile strain induces volatile control of magnetism. These results reveal that the magnetization response to volatile strain among interacting magnets is different from that among isolated magnets. The findings highlight the role of dipole interaction in multiferroic heterostructures and can stimulate future research on nonvolatile electrical control of magnetism with additional interactions.

         <title>Facet&#8208;Dependent Surface Charge and Hydration of Semiconducting Nanoparticles at Variable pH</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface properties of different facets of SrTiO3 nanoparticles are investigated by atomic force microscopy. Facet&#8208;specific forces, atomic&#8208;level surface structure, defects, and charges are characterized in liquid environment. These measurements reveal substantial differences in isoelectric points and hydration between adjacent facets. These insights are important for the performance of anisotropic nanoparticles in (photoelectro&#8208;)catalysis and for their colloidal self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
Understanding structure and function of solid&#8211;liquid interfaces is essential for the development of nanomaterials for various applications including heterogeneous catalysis in liquid phase processes and water splitting for storage of renewable electricity. The characteristic anisotropy of crystalline nanoparticles is believed to be essential for their performance but remains poorly understood and difficult to characterize. Dual scale atomic force microscopy is used to measure electrostatic and hydration forces of faceted semiconducting SrTiO3 nanoparticles in aqueous electrolyte at variable pH. The following are demonstrated: the ability to quantify strongly facet&#8208;dependent surface charges yielding isoelectric points of the dominant {100} and {110} facets that differ by as much as 2&#160;pH units; facet&#8208;dependent accumulation of oppositely charged (SiO2) particles; and that atomic scale defects can be resolved but are in fact rare for the samples investigated. Atomically resolved images and facet&#8208;dependent oscillatory hydration forces suggest a microscopic charge generation mechanism that explains colloidal scale electrostatic forces.

         <title>Gradient H&#8208;Bonding Binder Enables Stable High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Si&#8208;Based Anodes in Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient H&#8208;bonding polymer binder for Si&#8208;based anodes is reported, where the H&#8208;bond energies are regulated in a wide range. The well&#8208;defined gradient hydrogen bonds can effectively release stress and maintain the integrity of the electrode via sequential bonding cleavage. Additionally, a 2 Ah pouch cell with an impressive capacity retention makes this binder more promising for practical application.








Abstract
Alleviating large stress is critical for high&#8208;energy batteries with large volume change upon cycling, yet this still presents a challenge. Here, a gradient hydrogen&#8208;bonding binder is reported for high&#8208;capacity silicon&#8208;based anodes that are highly desirable for the next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The well&#8208;defined gradient hydrogen bonds, with a successive bond energy of &#8722;2.88&#8211; &#8722;10.04&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1, can effectively release the large stress of silicon via the sequential bonding cleavage. This can avoid recurrently abrupt structure fracture of traditional binder due to lack of gradient energy dissipation. Certainly, this regulated binder endows stable high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity silicon&#8208;based electrodes &gt;4 mAh cm&#8722;2. Beyond proof of concept, this work demonstrates a 2 Ah silicon&#8208;based pouch cell with an impressive capacity retention of 80.2% after 700 cycles (0.028% decay/cycle) based on this gradient hydrogen&#8208;bonding binder, making it more promising for practical application.

         <title>2D Molybdenum Carbide MXenes for Enhanced Selective Detection of Humidity in Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D Mo2CTx MXene flakes are successfully synthesized and studied on their chemiresistive effect, demonstrating an enhanced sensitivity toward water vapor at room temperature in dry air. The low&#8208;noise resistance signal allows the detection of H2O down to 10&#160;ppm, with humidity suppressing the Mo2CTx response to organic analytes due to the blocking of adsorption active sites.








Abstract
2D transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) open up novel opportunities in gas sensing with high sensitivity at room temperature. Herein, 2D Mo2CTx flakes with high aspect ratio are successfully synthesized. The chemiresistive effect in a sub&#8208;&#181;m MXene multilayer for different organic vapors and humidity at 101&#8211;104&#160;ppm in dry air is studied. Reasonably, the low&#8208;noise resistance signal allows the detection of H2O down to 10&#160;ppm. Moreover, humidity suppresses the response of Mo2CTx to organic analytes due to the blocking of adsorption active sites. By measuring the impedance of MXene layers as a function of ac frequency in the 10&#8722;2&#8211;106&#160;Hz range, it is shown that operation principle of the sensor is dominated by resistance change rather than capacitance variations. The sensor transfer function allows to conclude that the Mo2CTx chemiresistance is mainly originating from electron transport through interflake potential barriers with heights up to 0.2&#160;eV. Density functional theory calculations, elucidating the Mo2C surface interaction with organic analytes and H2O, explain the experimental data as an energy shift of the density of states under the analyte's adsorption which induces increasing electrical resistance.

Current sulfide solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SE) membranes utilized in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASLBs) have a high thickness (0.5&#8211;1.0&#160;mm) and low ion conductance (&lt;25 mS), which limit the cell&#8208;level energy and power densities. Based on ethyl cellulose's unique amphipathic molecular structure, superior thermal stability, and excellent binding capability, this work fabricates a freestanding SE membrane with an ultralow thickness of 47&#160;&#181;m. With ethyl cellulose as an effective disperser and a binder, the Li6PS5Cl is uniformly dispersed in toluene and possesses superior film formability. In addition, an ultralow areal resistance of 4.32 &#937; cm&#8722;2 and a remarkable ion conductance of 291 mS (one order higher than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sulfide SE membrane) are achieved. The ASLBs assembled with this SE membrane deliver cell&#8208;level high gravimetric and volumetric energy densities of 175&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 675&#160;Wh L&#8722;1, individually.

         <title>The Importance of Surface Adsorbates in Solution&#8208;Processed Thermoelectric Materials: The Case of SnSe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycrystalline SnSe is prepared from surfactant&#8208;free particles prepared in solution. Ionic species adsorbed on the surface compensate for the particles&#8242; charge and remain during processing. The adsorbates affect the nano/microstructure of the final material and its transport properties. In the case of sodium, it remains as a dopant and forms secondary phases that induce energy&#8208;filtering effects.








Abstract
Solution synthesis of particles emerges as an alternative to prepare thermoelectric materials with less demanding processing conditions than conventional solid&#8208;state synthetic methods. However, solution synthesis generally involves the presence of additional molecules or ions belonging to the precursors or added to enable solubility and/or regulate nucleation and growth. These molecules or ions can end up in the particles as surface adsorbates and interfere in the material properties. This work demonstrates that ionic adsorbates, in particular Na+ ions, are electrostatically adsorbed in SnSe particles synthesized in water and play a crucial role not only in directing the material nano/microstructure but also in determining the transport properties of the consolidated material. In dense pellets prepared by sintering SnSe particles, Na remains within the crystal lattice as dopant, in dislocations, precipitates, and forming grain boundary complexions. These results highlight the importance of considering all the possible unintentional impurities to establish proper structure&#8211;property relationships and control material properties in solution&#8208;processed thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Interfacial Electrostatic&#8208;Interaction&#8208;Enhanced Photomultiplication for Ultrahigh External Quantum Efficiency of Organic Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to boost the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodiodes (OPDs) is suggested by stabilizing trapped electron states within the active layer via electrostatic interactions. By introducing an ionic electrolyte interfacial layer and by the resulting built&#8208;in electrostatic interaction, an ultrahigh EQE (&gt;2&#160;000&#160;000%), responsivity (&gt;10&#160;000 A W&#8722;1), and visible specific detectivity (&gt;1014 Jones) for OPDs is reported.








Abstract
A photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodiode (PM&#8208;OPD), where an electric double layer (EDL) is strategically embedded, is demonstrated, with an exceptionally high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2&#160;210&#160;000%, responsivity of 11&#160;200 A W&#8722;1, specific detectivity of 2.11 &#215; 1014 Jones, and gain&#8211;bandwidth product of 1.92 &#215; 107&#160;Hz, as well as high reproducibility. A polymer electrolyte, poly(9,9&#8208;bis(3&#8242;&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethyl)&#8208;N&#8208;ethylammoinium&#8208;propyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;fluorene)&#8208;alt&#8208;2,7&#8208;(9,9&#8208;dioctylfluorene))dibromide is employed as a work&#8208;function&#8208;modifying layer of indium tin oxide (ITO) to construct an EDL&#8208;embedded Schottky junction with p&#8208;type polymer semiconductor, poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene&#8208;diyl), resulting in not only advantageous tuning of the work function of ITO but also an enhancement of the electron&#8208;trapping efficiency due to electrostatic interaction between exposed cations and trapped electrons within isolated acceptor domains. The effects of the EDL on the energetics of the trapped electron states and thus on the gain generation mechanism are confirmed by numerical simulations based on the drift&#8211;diffusion approximation of charge carriers. The feasibility of the fabricated high&#8208;EQE PM&#8208;OPD especially for weak light detection is demonstrated via a pixelated prototype image sensor. It is believed that this new OPD platform opens up the possibility for the ultrahigh&#8208;sensitivity organic image sensors, while maintaining the advantageous properties of organics.

         <title>Polymorphic Phases of Metal Chlorides in the Confined 2D Space of Bilayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal chlorides intercalated in the van der Waals gap of bilayer graphene are found to have polymorphic phases. New phases and phase transformation of AlCl3, as well as new hybrid alloy of quasi&#8208;1D AlCl3 and CuCl2 are directly observed by scanning transmission electron microscopy.








Abstract
Unprecedented 2D metal chloride structures are grown between sheets of bilayer graphene through intercalation of metal and chlorine atoms. Numerous spatially confined 2D phases of AlCl3 and CuCl2 distinct from their typical bulk forms are found, and the transformations between these new phases under the electron beam are directly observed by in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The density functional theory calculations confirm the metastability of the atomic structures derived from the STEM experiments and provide insights into the electronic properties of the phases, which range from insulators to semimetals. Additionally, the co&#8208;intercalation of different metal chlorides is found to create completely new hybrid systems; in&#8208;plane quasi&#8208;1D AlCl3/CuCl2 heterostructures are obtained. The existence of polymorphic phases hints at the unique possibilities for fabricating new types of 2D materials with diverse electronic properties confined between graphene sheets.

         <title>Training the Polarization in Integrated La0.15Bi0.85FeO3&#8208;Based Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A persisting net in&#8208;plane polarization in highly La&#8208;substituted multiferroic BiFeO3 films is probed operando using non&#8208;invasive optical second&#8208;harmonic generation directly in prototypical magnetoelectric device architectures. A spontaneous domain structure reordering triggered by the first electrical cycles leads to an abrupt enhancement of this net in&#8208;plane polarization.








Abstract
The functionalities of BiFeO3&#8208;based magnetoelectric multiferroic heterostructures rely on the controlled manipulation of their ferroelectric domains and of the corresponding net in&#8208;plane polarization, as this aspect guides the voltage&#8208;controlled magnetic switching. Chemical substitution has emerged as a key to push the energy dissipation of the BiFeO3 into the attojoule range but appears to result in a disordered domain configuration. Using non&#8208;invasive optical second&#8208;harmonic generation on heavily La&#8208;substituted BiFeO3 films, it is shown that a weak net in&#8208;plane polarization remains imprinted in the pristine films despite the apparent domain disorder. It is found that this ingrained net in&#8208;plane polarization can be trained with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electric fields compatible with applications. Operando studies on capacitor heterostructures treated in this way show the full restoration of the domain configuration of pristine BiFeO3 along with a giant net in&#8208;plane polarization enhancement.

&lt;p&gt;A persisting net in-plane polarization in highly La-substituted multiferroic BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films is probed operando using non-invasive optical second-harmonic generation directly in prototypical magnetoelectric device architectures. A spontaneous domain structure reordering triggered by the first electrical cycles leads to an abrupt enhancement of this net in-plane polarization.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functionalities of BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based magnetoelectric multiferroic heterostructures rely on the controlled manipulation of their ferroelectric domains and of the corresponding net in-plane polarization, as this aspect guides the voltage-controlled magnetic switching. Chemical substitution has emerged as a key to push the energy dissipation of the BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; into the attojoule range but appears to result in a disordered domain configuration. Using non-invasive optical second-harmonic generation on heavily La-substituted BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films, it is shown that a weak net in-plane polarization remains imprinted in the pristine films despite the apparent domain disorder. It is found that this ingrained net in-plane polarization can be trained with out-of-plane electric fields compatible with applications. Operando studies on capacitor heterostructures treated in this way show the full restoration of the domain configuration of pristine BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; along with a giant net in-plane polarization enhancement. Thus, the experiments reveal a surprising robustness of the net in-plane polarization of BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; against chemical modification, an important criterion in ongoing attempts to integrate magnetoelectric materials into energy-efficient devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial Manipulation via In Situ Grown ZnSe Cultivator toward Highly Reversible Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ&#8208;grown ZnSe overlayer functioning as a cultivator can guide oriented growth of the Zn (002) plane at the infancy stage of stripping/plating cycles, thereby inhibiting the formation of Zn dendrites and the occurrence of side reactions.








Abstract
Zn metal anode has garnered growing scientific and industrial interest owing to its appropriate redox potential, low cost, and high safety. Nevertheless, the instability of Zn anode caused by dendrite formation, hydrogen evolution, and side reactions has greatly hampered its commercialization. Herein, an in situ grown ZnSe overlayer is crafted over one side of commercial Zn foil via chemical vapor deposition in a scalable manner, aiming to achieve optimized electrolyte/Zn interfaces with large&#8208;scale viability. Impressively, thus&#8208;derived ZnSe coating functions as a cultivator to guide oriented growth of Zn (002) plane at the infancy stage of stripping/plating cycles, thereby inhibiting the formation of Zn dendrites and the occurrence of side reactions. As a result, high cyclic stability (1530 h at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1.0&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2; 172 h at 30.0&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2/10.0 mAh cm&#8722;2) in symmetric cells is harvested. Meanwhile, when paired with V2O5 based cathode, assembled full cell achieves an outstanding capacity (194.5 mAh g&#8722;1) and elongated lifespan (a&#160;capacity retention of 84% after 1000 cycles) at 5.0 A g&#8722;1. The reversible Zn anode enabled by the interfacial manipulation strategy via ZnSe cultivator is anticipated to satisfy the demand of commercial use.

         <title>Ultralow Power Optical Synapses Based on MoS2 Layers by Indium&#8208;Induced Surface Charge Doping for Biomimetic Eyes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing electron&#8208;injection enhancement layers of indium, a synaptic device of indium (In)/molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) shows an ultralow power consumption of 68.9 aJ, short&#8208;term plasticity (STP), long&#8208;term plasticity (LTP), and good capability of transition between STP and LTP. Additionally, a biomimetic eye with a 5 &#215; 5 array of In/MoS2 synaptic devices is implemented, exhibiting excellent image sensing and learning functions.








Abstract
Biomimetic eyes, with their excellent imaging functions such as large fields of view and low aberrations, have shown great potentials in the fields of visual prostheses and robotics. However, high power consumption and difficulties in device integration severely restrict their rapid development. In this study, an artificial synaptic device consisting of a molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) film coated with an electron injection enhanced indium (In) layer is proposed to increase the channel conductivity and reduce the power consumption. This artificial synaptic device achieves an ultralow power consumption of 68.9 aJ per spike, which is several hundred times lower than those of the optical artificial synapses reported in literature. Furthermore, the multilayer and polycrystalline MoS2 film shows persistent photoconductivity performance, effectively resulting in short&#8208;term plasticity, long&#8208;term plasticity, and their transitions between each other. A 5 &#215; 5 In/MoS2 synaptic device array is constructed into a hemispherical electronic retina, demonstrating its impressive image sensing and learning functions. This research provides a new methodology for effective control of artificial synaptic devices, which have great opportunities used in bionic retinas, robots, and visual prostheses.

         <title>Ultrafast Digital Fabrication of Designable Architectured Liquid Crystalline Elastomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrafast (25 s) and remotely controllable digital method is reported to fabricate complex liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) without any physical alignment templates. Inspired by the cooperative actions of muscles, diverse motions of LCE are realized through the combination of different architectures. The architectured design offers a new dimension for preparing functionally diverse soft machines.








Abstract
The muscle&#8208;like activities of liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) offer great potential for designing future soft machines. Their motion complexity, however, relies on inflexible and cumbersome mesogen alignment techniques. Here, a digital photocuring method for ultrafast template&#8208;free fabrication of LCE artificial muscles capable of designable complex motions is reported. This method utilizes the intrinsic light attenuation in the through&#8208;plane direction to create mesogen alignment for reversible bending action. To turn this simple actuation into complex motions, the principles of muscles are borrowed which realize diverse motions through the cooperative actions of otherwise simple contraction/expansion of individual muscle bundles. Specifically, the spatiotemporal digital light is utilized to design LCE architectures composed of strategically arranged bending modules. As such, LCE capable of highly designable motions can be fabricated within 25 s light curing without employing any physical alignment templates, which offers an attractive option toward designing functionally diverse soft machines.

         <title>Elimination of Interfacial&#8208;Electrochemical&#8208;Reaction&#8208;Induced Polarization in Perovskite Single Crystals for Ultrasensitive and Stable X&#8208;Ray Detector Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing p&#8208; and n&#8208;type charge transport layers in the coplanar&#8208;structured perovskite X&#8208;ray detector to isolate the contact between the electrode and the perovskite, the interfacial electrochemical&#8208;reaction&#8208;induced polarization is effectively suppressed under large electric field up to 1000&#160;V cm&#8722;1, which results in superior device performance with a low X&#8208;ray detection limit down to 0.1 nGyair s&#8722;1.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites have exhibited bright prospects in high&#8208;sensitivity X&#8208;ray detection. However, they generally suffer from the severe field&#8208;driven polarization issue that remarkably deteriorates the detection performance. Here, it is demonstrated that the interfacial electrochemical reaction between Au electrodes and halogen in MAPbI3 single crystals (SCs) is the major source of the dark current polarization in the metal&#8211;semiconductor&#8211;metal (MSM)&#8208;structured perovskite X&#8208;ray detectors at the initial stage of biasing. By introducing the p&#8208; and n&#8208;type charge transport layers to isolate the electrodes from contacting the SC surface, the polarization is fully eliminated under a large electric field up to 1000&#160;V cm&#8722;1. Moreover, the resultant lateral p&#8211;i&#8211;n heterojunction suppresses the dark current of the devices by nearly 3 orders of magnitude as compared to the MSM counterparts and therefore enables a high sensitivity of 5.2 &#215; 106&#160;&#181;C Gy&#8722;1air cm&#8722;2 and a record low X&#8208;ray detection limit down to 0.1 nGyair s&#8722;1. The excellent biasing stability and sensitivity of the devices allow to prepare the linear detector arrays for X&#8208;ray imaging applications.

         <title>Natural Acidic Polysaccharide&#8208;Based Memristors for Transient Electronics: Highly Controllable Quantized Conductance for Integrated Memory and Nonvolatile Logic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural acidic polysaccharides are reported as promising materials to construct memristors for transient applications. The ion&#8208;confinement capability of acidic polysaccharides also enables atomic manipulation of conductive filament, which can produce 16 highly controllable and independent quantized conductance (QC) states. The controllable QC switching behavior is promising for integrated memory and nonvolatile logic applications.








Abstract
As a leading candidate for further memory and computing applications, memristors are being developed in an important direction of transient electronics. Herein, wafer&#8208;scale acidic polysaccharide thin films are reported as promising materials for memristors with remarkable transient characteristics. The memristor shows freestanding and lightweight features, and can be fully dissolved in deionized water within 3.5 s. More importantly, the ion&#8208;confinement capability of acidic polysaccharides where the cations can interact with the ionizable acid groups enables atomic manipulation of conductive filament. As a result, (i) a single device can produce 16 highly controllable and independent quantized conductance (QC) states with quasi&#8208;nonvolatile and nonvolatile characteristics and (ii) QC switching can be performed with ultrafast speed (2&#8211;5&#160;ns) and low energy consumption (0.6&#8211;16 pJ). These remarkable features make the memristor promising for fast, low&#8208;power, and high&#8208;density memory and computing applications. Based on QC switching, the encoding/decoding and nonvolatile basic Boolean logic are designed and implemented. More importantly, &#8220;stateful&#8221; material implication logic which is promising for future in&#8208;memory computing is demonstrated with QC switching. These results significantly advance acidic polysaccharides to develop nanodevices with quantum effects.

         <title>Highly Selective and Sensitive Detection of Volatile Sulfur Compounds by Ionically Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through systematical design and comparison, Cu&#8208;TCPP stands out from a series of ionically conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (IC&#8208;MOFs) for volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) detection. H2S and CH3SH can be detected at concentrations down to 1 ppb and 1 ppm, respectively. The sensors display outstanding selectivity toward VSCs, and their low&#8208;cost and facile preparation make the devices disposable.








Abstract
High selectivity to specific analyte is essential for chemical sensors but difficult to achieve. For most chemical sensors, although the response to the target analyte can be more significant than interference analytes, they still show obvious responses to the interference analytes. Here, highly selective chemical sensors are developed with negligible responses to other interference vapors. Instead of the widely investigated electronically conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (EC&#8208;MOFs), ionically conductive MOFs (IC&#8208;MOFs) are used as the sensing materials, and the unique interaction between the ion charge carrier and the analyte is utilized to achieve high sensing selectivity. Through the modulation of the metal nodes (Cu, Co, Ni, Zn, Mg) and organic ligands (H2TCPP, H2THPP, H4BTEC), sensor arrays based on a set of IC&#8208;MOFs are fabricated and achieve highly selective detection toward volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). H2S and CH3SH can be selectively detected at concentrations down to 1 ppb and 1&#160;ppm, respectively. The facile preparation and low cost endow the device with disposability. These results suggest new approaches for the development of highly selective chemical sensors.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Mediated Twinning&#8208;Induced Plasticity in a Fine Hexagonal Microstructure Generated by Additive Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deformation twinning is one of the most effective mechanisms for improving the strength&#8211;ductility trade&#8208;off of structural alloys. However, its activation in hexagonal&#8208;close&#8208;packed (hcp) metals is reduced with decreasing grain size. This work reports the discovery of the activation of deformation twinning in a fine&#8208;grained hcp microstructure obtained by laser&#8208;based metal additive manufacturing.








Abstract
The grain size is a determinant microstructural feature to enable the activation of deformation twinning in hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) metals. Although deformation twinning is one of the most effective mechanisms for improving the strength&#8211;ductility trade&#8208;off of structural alloys, its activation is reduced with decreasing grain size. This work reports the discovery of the activation of deformation twinning in a fine&#8208;grained hcp microstructure by introducing ductile body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) nano&#8208;layer interfaces. The fast solidification and cooling conditions of laser&#8208;based additive manufacturing are exploited to obtain a fine microstructure that, coupled with an intensified intrinsic heat treatment, permits to generate the bcc nano&#8208;layers. In situ high&#8208;energy synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction allows tracking the activation and evolution of mechanical twinning in real&#8208;time. The findings obtained show the potential of ductile nano&#8208;layering for the novel design of hcp damage tolerant materials with improved life spans.

Lithium&#8208;Metal Anodes
In article number 2105962, Jia&#8208;Qi Huang and co&#8208;workers report the fabrication of a highly reversible working  Li&#8208;metal anode by synergistically modulating the solid electrolyte interphase chemistry and Li nucleation. Combined techniques are employed to demystify the initial formation and evolution scenarios of the Li&#8208;metal interface, providing critical insights into the design guidelines of high&#8208;efficiency Li&#8208;metal batteries. A precisely designed interface enables highly reversible lithium deposition, analogous to the reliable shuttle of a spacecraft between the Earth and the moon.

SrTiO3 Nanoparticles
The surface properties of different facets of SrTiO3 nanoparticles are investigated by atomic force microscopy by Frieder Mugele and co&#8208;workers in article number 2106229. Facet&#8208;specific forces, atomic&#8208;level surface structure, defects, and charges are characterized in a liquid environment. Their measurements reveal substantial differences in isoelectric points and hydration between adjacent facets. These insights are important for the performance of anisotropic nano particles in (photoelectron&#8208;) catalysis and for their colloidal self&#8208;assembly.

Dimensional Confinement
In article number 2105898, Yung&#8208;Chang Lin, Kazu Suenaga, and co&#8208;workers report the discovery of a new AlCl3 structure in 2D form. Metal chlorides such as AlCl3 and CuCl2 intercalated in bilayer graphene are found to have polymorphic phases, which have not been previously expected in bulk. Utilizing dimensional confinement, the growth of further unexpected 2D materials in the nanospace between bilayer graphene is expected.

         <title>Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks for Energy Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) are porous crystalline polymeric materials where the backbone is composed of 100% covalent bonds and on which ionic groups are functionalized. iCOFs can transport ions rapidly and reliably through the pores. Thus, they are ideal materials for solid electrolytes. Examples prove iCOFs show excellent performance to make all&#8208;solid&#8208;state and single&#8208;ion&#8208;conducting Li&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of porous crystalline materials whose facile preparation, functionality, and modularity have led to their becoming powerful platforms for the development of molecular devices in many fields of (bio)engineering, such as energy storage, environmental remediation, drug delivery, and catalysis. In particular, ionic COFs (iCOFs) are highly useful for constructing energy devices, as their ionic functional groups can transport ions efficiently, and the nonlabile and highly ordered all&#8208;covalent pore structures of their backbones provide ideal pathways for long&#8208;term ionic transport under harsh electrochemical conditions. Here, current research progress on the use of iCOFs for energy devices, specifically lithium&#8208;based batteries and fuel cells, is reviewed in terms of iCOF backbone&#8208;design strategies, synthetic approaches, properties, engineering techniques, and applications. iCOFs are categorized as anionic COFs or cationic COFs, and how each of these types of iCOFs transport lithium ions, protons, or hydroxides is illustrated. Finally, the current challenges to and future opportunities for the utilization of iCOFs in energy devices are described. This review will therefore serve as a useful reference on state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art iCOF design and application strategies focusing on energy devices.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of porous crystalline materials whose facile preparation, functionality, and modularity have led to their becoming powerful platforms for the development of molecular devices in many fields of (bio)engineering, such as energy storage, environmental remediation, drug delivery, and catalysis. In particular, ionic COFs (iCOFs) are highly useful for constructing energy devices, as their ionic functional groups can transport ions efficiently, and the nonlabile and highly ordered all-covalent pore structures of their backbones provide ideal pathways for long-term ionic transport under harsh electrochemical conditions. Here, current research progress on the use of iCOFs for energy devices, specifically lithium-based batteries and fuel cells, is reviewed in terms of iCOF backbone-design strategies, synthetic approaches, properties, engineering techniques, and applications. iCOFs are categorized as anionic COFs or cationic COFs, and how each of these types of iCOFs transport lithium ions, protons, or hydroxides is illustrated. Finally, the current challenges to and future opportunities for the utilization of iCOFs in energy devices are described. This review will therefore serve as a useful reference on state-of-the-art iCOF design and application strategies focusing on energy devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ischemic Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Therapeutics for Cardiovascular Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ischemic microenvironment (IME)&#8208;responsive therapeutic modalities are defined and the fundamental principles and basic features of ischemic microenvironment are overviewed. Promising ischemic microenvironment&#8208;responsive therapeutic strategies are introduced and summarized. Perspectives toward the clinical practices based on the ischemic microenvironment&#8208;responsive biomaterials are discussed.








Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases caused by ischemia are attracting considerable attention owing to its high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although numerous agents with cardioprotective benefits have been identified, their clinical outcomes are hampered by their low bioavailability, poor drug solubility, and systemic adverse effects. Advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology provide a new opportunity to effectively deliver drugs for treating ischemia&#8208;related diseases. In particular, cardiac ischemia leads to a characteristic pathological environment called an ischemic microenvironment (IME), significantly different from typical cardiac regions. These remarkable differences between ischemic sites and normal tissues have inspired the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive systems for the targeted delivery of therapeutic drugs to damaged cardiomyocytes. Recently, many biomaterials with intelligent properties have been developed to enhance the therapeutic benefits of drugs for the treatment of myocardial ischemia. Strategies for stimuli&#8208;responsive drug delivery and release based on IME include reactive oxygen species, pH&#8208;, hypoxia&#8208;, matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;, and platelet&#8208;inspired targeting strategies. In this review, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art IME&#8208;responsive biomaterials for the treatment of myocardial ischemia are summarized. Perspectives, limitations, and challenges are also discussed for the further development of innovative and effective approaches to treat ischemic diseases with high effectiveness and biocompatibility.

         <title>Solid&#8211;Liquid Host&#8211;Guest Composites: The Marriage of Porous Solids and Functional Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8211;liquid host&#8211;guest composites have featured the ease of fabrication, long&#8208;term stability, and a broad spectrum of unprecedented properties, which cannot be fully met by conventional solid&#8211;solid composites or liquid&#8211;liquid composites. They have greatly evolved in a myriad of emerging applications. With new concepts in mind and persistent efforts, new functions and applications of the solid&#8211;liquid host&#8211;guest composites will appear.








Abstract
Composite materials can provide remarkable improvements over the individual constituents. Especially, with a liquid component introduced into a solid porous host, solid&#8211;liquid host&#8211;guest composites have recently come to the forefront with exceptional functions that promise them for a wealth of applications. Combining the unprecedented dynamic, transparent, omniphobic, self&#8208;healing, diffusive and adaptive nature of functional liquid with inherent solid host's property, solid&#8211;liquid host&#8211;guest composites can realize the ease of fabrication, long&#8208;term stability, and a broad spectrum of enhanced properties, which cannot be fully met by conventional solid&#8211;solid composites or liquid&#8211;liquid composites. This review presents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress in solid&#8211;liquid host&#8211;guest composites. Initially, the concept, classification, design strategy, as well as fabrication methods as a path forward to develop the composites are unraveled, and further it is elaborated on how the functionality of porous solid and functional liquid can be harnessed to create composites with a broad range of unique properties, especially, the optical, thermal, electric, mechanical, sorption, and separation properties. With these fascinating properties, a myriad of emerging applications such as optical devices, thermal management, electromagnetic&#8208;interference shielding, soft electronics, gas capture and release, and multiphase separations are touched upon, inspiring more frontier researches in materials science, interfacial chemistry, membrane science, engineering, and multidisciplinary. Finally, this review provides the perspective on the future directions of solid&#8211;liquid host&#8211;guest composites and assesses the challenges and opportunities ahead.

         <title>Transformation Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transformation optics and metamaterials are useful and interesting techniques to control wave propagation at will. A comprehensive overview on the manipulation of wave propagation based on the coordinate transformation method and metamaterials is provided. Selected experimental fabrications for diverse waves, such as electromagnetic waves and stationary fields, are presented to demonstrate frontiers of transformation metamaterials.








Abstract
Based on the form&#8208;invariance of Maxwell's equations under coordinate transformations, mathematically smooth deformation of space can be physically equivalent to inhomogeneous and anisotropic electromagnetic (EM) medium (called a transformation medium). It provides a geometric recipe to control EM waves at will. A series of examples of achieving transformation media by artificially structured units from conventional materials is summarized here. Such concepts are firstly implemented for EM waves, and then extended to other wave dynamics, such as elastic waves, acoustic waves, surface water waves, and even stationary fields. These shall be cataloged as transformation metamaterials. In addition, it might be conceptually attractive and practically useful to control diverse waves for multi&#8208;physics designs.

         <title>Monocrystalline Methylammonium Lead Halide Perovskite Materials for Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficiency of polycrystalline perovskite solar cells is approaching that of silicon, while being substantially higher than that of monocrystalline perovskite despite the optoelectronic properties following the opposite trend. This review questions the future of perovskite single crystals and proposes new strategies that unleash their full potential to achieve record solar cells.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskite solar cells have been gaining more and more interest. In only a decade, huge research efforts from interdisciplinary communities enabled enormous scientific advances that rapidly led to energy conversion efficiency near that of record silicon solar cells, at an unprecedented pace. However, while for most materials the best solar cells were&#160;achieved with single crystals (SC), for perovskite the best cells have been so far achieved with polycrystalline (PC) thin films, despite the optoelectronic properties of perovskite SC are undoubtedly superior. Here, by taking as example monocrystalline methylammonium lead halide, the authors elaborate the literature from material synthesis and characterization to device fabrication and testing, to provide with plausible explanations for the relatively low efficiency, despite the superior optoelectronics performance. In particular, the authors focus on how solar cell performance is affected by anisotropy, crystal orientation, surface termination, interfaces, and device architecture. It is argued that, to unleash the full potential of monocrystalline perovskite, a holistic approach is needed in the design of next&#8208;generation device architecture. This would unquestionably lead to power conversion efficiency higher than those of PC perovskites and silicon solar cells, with tremendous impact on the swift deployment of renewable energy on a large scale.

         <title>Photocatalytic Z&#8208;Scheme Overall Water Splitting: Recent Advances in Theory and Experiments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 52, December 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar&#8208;driven water splitting has attracted substantial attention over the past decades as it not only provides a clean and sustainable fuel but also promises to dramatically reduce CO2 emissions. The utmost possible form of artificial photosynthesis is a two&#8208;step photoexcitation known as &#8220;Z&#8208;scheme&#8221;, which mimics the natural photosystem, and considerably enhances the stability and efficiency of overall water splitting.








Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting is considered one of the most important and appealing approaches for the production of green H2 to address the global energy demand. The utmost possible form of artificial photosynthesis is a two&#8208;step photoexcitation known as &#8220;Z&#8208;scheme&#8221;, which mimics the natural photosystem. This process solely relies on the effective coupling and suitable band positions of semiconductors (SCs) and redox mediators for the purpose to catalyze the surface chemical reactions and significantly deter the backward reaction. In recent years, the Z&#8208;scheme strategies and their key role have been studied progressively through experimental approaches. In addition, theoretical studies based on density functional theory have provided detailed insight into the mechanistic aspects of some breathtakingly complex problems associated with hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. In this context, this critical review gives an overview of the fundamentals of Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysis, including both theoretical and experimental advancements in the field of photocatalytic water splitting, and suggests future perspectives.

&lt;p&gt;Solar-driven water splitting has attracted substantial attention over the past decades as it not only provides a clean and sustainable fuel but also promises to dramatically reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. The utmost possible form of artificial photosynthesis is a two-step photoexcitation known as &#8220;Z-scheme&#8221;, which mimics the natural photosystem, and considerably enhances the stability and efficiency of overall water splitting.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic water splitting is considered one of the most important and appealing approaches for the production of green H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to address the global energy demand. The utmost possible form of artificial photosynthesis is a two-step photoexcitation known as &#8220;Z-scheme&#8221;, which mimics the natural photosystem. This process solely relies on the effective coupling and suitable band positions of semiconductors (SCs) and redox mediators for the purpose to catalyze the surface chemical reactions and significantly deter the backward reaction. In recent years, the Z-scheme strategies and their key role have been studied progressively through experimental approaches. In addition, theoretical studies based on density functional theory have provided detailed insight into the mechanistic aspects of some breathtakingly complex problems associated with hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. In this context, this critical review gives an overview of the fundamentals of Z-scheme photocatalysis, including both theoretical and experimental advancements in the field of photocatalytic water splitting, and suggests future perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Artificial Nacre with High Toughness Amplification Factor: Residual Stress&#8208;Engineering Sparks Enhanced Extrinsic Toughening Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The high fracture toughness of mollusk nacre is predominantly attributed to the structure&#8208;associated extrinsic mechanisms such as platelet sliding and crack deflection. While the nacre&#8208;mimetic structures have been widely adopted in artificial ceramics, the extrinsic mechanisms are often weakened by the relatively low tensile strength of the platelets with a large aspect ratio, which makes the fracture toughness of these materials much lower than expected. Here we demonstrate the fracture toughness of artificial nacre materials with high inorganic contents can be improved by residual stress&#8208;induced platelet strengthening, which can catalyze more effective extrinsic toughening mechanisms that are specific to the nacre&#8208;mimetic structures. Thereby, while the absolute fracture toughness of the materials is not comparable with advanced ceramic&#8208;based composites, the toughness amplification factor of the material reaches 16.1&#160;&#177; 1.1, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biomimetic ceramics. Our results reveal that, with the merit of nacre&#8208;mimetic structural designs, the overall fracture toughness of the artificial nacre can be improved by the platelet strengthening through extrinsic toughening mechanisms, although the intrinsic fracture toughness may decrease due to the strengthening. We anticipate advanced structural ceramics with exceeding performance can be fabricated through these unconventional strategies.

         <title>Photopatternable Porous Separators for Micro Electrochemical Energy Storage Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The miniaturization of electrochemical energy storage systems (EES), one of the key challenges facing the rapid expansion of the Internet of Things, has been limited by poor performance of various energy storage components at the micron scale. In this paper, we report the development of a unique photopatternable porous separator which overcomes the electrolyte difficulties involving resistive losses at small dimensions. The separator is based on modifying the chemistry of SU&#8208;8, an epoxy derived photoresist, through the addition of a miscible ionic liquid. The ionic liquid serves as a templating agent which is selectively removed by solution methods, leaving the SU&#8208;8 scaffold whose interconnected porosity provides ion transport from the confined liquid electrolyte. The photopatternable separator exhibits good electrochemical, chemical, thermal and mechanical stability during the operation of electrochemical devices in both 2D and 3D formats. For the latter, the separator demonstrated the ability to form functional conformal coatings over 3D structures. The development of the photopatternable separator overcomes the electrolyte issues which have limited progress in the field of micro&#8208;EES.

         <title>Reconfiguring Colors of Single Relief Structures by Directional Stretching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relief structures in an elastomer that exhibit reconfigurable colors from individual micro&#8208;/nanostructures are designed and experimentally demonstrated. Distinct from Bragg diffraction effects from periodic structures, individual trench segments can act as a single color pixel with high resolution. Multiple sets of colorful microprints are accessible from monolithic reliefs by directional strains and capillary effects.








Abstract
Color changes can be achieved by straining photonic crystals or gratings embedded in stretchable materials. However, the multiple repeat units and the need for a volumetric assembly of nanostructures limit the density of information content. Inspired by surface reliefs on oracle bones and music records as a means of information archival, here, surface&#8208;relief elastomers are endowed with multiple sets of information that are accessible by mechanical straining along in&#8208;plane axes. Distinct from Bragg diffraction effects from periodic structures, trenches that generate color due to variations in trench depth, enabling individual trench segments to support a single color, are reported. Using 3D printed cuboids, trenches of varying geometric parameters are replicated in elastomers. These parameters determine the initial color (or lack thereof), the response to capillary forces, and the appearance when strained along or across the trenches. Strain induces modulation in trench depth or the opening and closure of a trench, resulting in surface reliefs with up to six distinct states, and an initially featureless surface that reveals two distinct images when stretched along different axes. The highly reversible structural colors are promising in optical data archival, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and strain&#8208;sensing applications.

         <title>Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Cathode with Dual Energy&#8208;Storage Mechanism for Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate and Ultralong&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual energy&#8208;storage mechanism is detected in an organic (ethylenediamine (EDA))&#8211;inorganic (vanadium oxide) hybrid cathode. Both the EDA ligand and the V&#8211;O layer can participate in Zn&#8208;ion storage synchronously. Benefiting from the advanced mechanism, this hybrid provides a high specific capacity, elevated voltage, and excellent long&#8208;term cycle stability.








Abstract
The exploitation of cathode materials with high capacity as well as high operating voltage is extremely important for the development of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Yet, the classical high&#8208;capacity materials (e.g., vanadium&#8208;based materials) provide a low discharge voltage, while organic cathodes with high operating voltage generally suffer from a low capacity. In this work, organic (ethylenediamine)&#8211;inorganic (vanadium oxide) hybrid cathodes, that is, EDA&#8208;VO, with a dual energy&#8208;storage mechanism, are designed for ultrahigh&#8208;rate and ultralong&#8208;life ZIBs. The embedded ethylenediamine (EDA) can not only increase the layer spacing of the vanadium oxide, with improved mobility of Zn ions in the V&#8211;O layered structure, but also act as a bidentate chelating ligand participating in the storage of Zn ions. This hybrid provides a high specific capacity (382.6&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1), elevated voltage (0.82&#160;V) and excellent long&#8208;term cycle stability (over 10&#160;000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1). Assistant density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate the cathode has remarkable electronic conductivity, with an ultralow diffusion barrier of 0.78&#160;eV for an optimal Zn&#8208;ion diffusion path in the EDA&#8208;VO. This interesting idea of building organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid cathode materials with a dual energy&#8208;storage mechanism opens a new research direction toward high&#8208;energy secondary batteries.

         <title>Two&#8208;Photon 3D Laser Printing Inside Synthetic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon 3D laser printing inside of giant unilamellar lipid vesicles is reported. 2D and 3D hydrogel architectures with high precision and nearly arbitrary shape, including transmembrane pores, are realized within the confinement of a synthetic cell.








Abstract
Toward the ambitious goal of manufacturing synthetic cells from the bottom up, various cellular components have already been reconstituted inside lipid vesicles. However, the deterministic positioning of these components inside the compartment has remained elusive. Here, by using two&#8208;photon 3D&#160;laser printing, 2D and 3D hydrogel architectures are manufactured with high precision and nearly arbitrary shape inside preformed giant unilamellar lipid vesicles (GUVs). The required water&#8208;soluble photoresist is brought into the GUVs by diffusion in a single mixing step. Crucially, femtosecond two&#8208;photon printing inside the compartment does not destroy the GUVs. Beyond this proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle demonstration, early functional architectures are realized. In particular, a transmembrane structure acting as a pore is 3D&#160;printed, thereby allowing for the transport of biological cargo, including DNA, into the synthetic compartment. These experiments show that two&#8208;photon 3D laser microprinting can be an important addition to the existing toolbox of synthetic&#160;biology.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward the ambitious goal of manufacturing synthetic cells from the bottom up, various cellular components have already been reconstituted inside lipid vesicles. However, the deterministic positioning of these components inside the compartment has remained elusive. Here, by using two-photon 3D&#160;laser printing, 2D and 3D hydrogel architectures are manufactured with high precision and nearly arbitrary shape inside preformed giant unilamellar lipid vesicles (GUVs). The required water-soluble photoresist is brought into the GUVs by diffusion in a single mixing step. Crucially, femtosecond two-photon printing inside the compartment does not destroy the GUVs. Beyond this proof-of-principle demonstration, early functional architectures are realized. In particular, a transmembrane structure acting as a pore is 3D&#160;printed, thereby allowing for the transport of biological cargo, including DNA, into the synthetic compartment. These experiments show that two-photon 3D laser microprinting can be an important addition to the existing toolbox of synthetic&#160;biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NIR&#8208;Responsive TiO2 Biometasurfaces: Toward In Situ Photodynamic Antibacterial Therapy for Biomedical Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metasurface is constructed on a Ti alloy by a newly invented alkaline&#8211;acid bidirectional hydrothermal (aaBH) strategy, which manipulates the light&#8211;matter interaction and induces the strong adsorption of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. The aaBH&#8208;treated Ti alloy implants show potent NIR&#8208;responsive antibacterial activity and possess a strong ability to promote the anchorage of human gingival fibroblasts on their surface.








Abstract
Implant&#8208;related microbial infection is a challenging clinical problem, and its treatment requires efficient eradication of the biofilm from the implant surface. Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;responsive strategies are proposed as an emerging efficient antibacterial therapy. However, the utilization of photosensitizers or photocatalytic/photothermal nanomaterials in the available approach likely induces high potential risks of interfacial deterioration and biosafety compromise. Herein, a TiO2/TiO2&#8722;x metasurface with potent NIR&#8208;responsive antibacterial activity is produced on a Ti alloy implant by a newly invented topochemical conversion&#8208;based alkaline&#8211;acid bidirectional hydrothermal method (aaBH). Electromagnetic simulations prove that NIR absorption and near&#8208;field distribution of the metasurface can be tuned by the dimension and arrangement of the nanostructural unit. Promising antibacterial efficacy is proved by both in vitro and in vivo tests, with low&#8208;power NIR irradiation for 10 min. Besides, the designed nanostructure in the metasurface itself also shows excellence in enhancing the adhesion&#8208;related gene expression of human gingival fibroblasts that are exposed to 10 min of NIR irradiation, proving the potent nanostructure&#8208;induced biological effects. This work provides a biosafe and upscalable metasurfacing approach with extraordinary capacity of manipulating light adsorption, photocatalysis, and biological properties.

         <title>Anomalous Superconducting Proximity Effect in Bi2Se3/FeSe0.5Te0.5 Thin&#8208;Film Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anomalous superconducting proximity effect (SPE) is unveiled in topological insulator (TI)/superconductor Bi2Se3/FeSe0.5Te0.5 heterostructures. In contrast with the normal SPE that decays with thickness, such an effect occurs in momentum space regardless of the TI film thickness, as long as the topologically protected surface states are robust and form a continuous conduction loop.








Abstract
The superconducting proximity effect (SPE) induces a superconductivity transition in otherwise non&#8208;superconducting thin films in proximity with a superconductor. The SPE usually occurs in real space and decays exponentially with film thickness. Herein, an abnormal SPE in a topological insulator (TI)/superconductor heterostructure is unveiled, which is attributed to the topologically protected surface state. Surprisingly, such abnormal SPE occurs in momentum space regardless of the TI film thickness, as long as the topological surface states are robust and form a continuous conduction loop. Combining transport measurements and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy techniques, the SPE in Bi2Se3/FeSe0.5Te0.5 heterostructures is explored, where Bi2Se3 is an ideal 3D topological insulator and FeSe0.5Te0.5 a typical iron&#8208;based superconductor. As the thickness of the Bi2Se3 thin film exceeds 400 nm, there still exists SPE&#8208;induced superconductivity on the surface of Bi2Se3 thin film with a transition temperature Tc not less than 10 K. Such an extraordinary behavior is induced by the unique properties of topologically protected surface states of Bi2Se3. This research deepens the understanding of the important role of topologically protected surface states in the SPE.

         <title>Paper without a Trail: Time&#8208;Dependent Encryption using Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Host&#8211;Guest Invisible Ink</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;erasing ink that can display information on time scales based on the incorporated photochromic spiropyran and host&#8211;guest crosslinkers is reported. Upon the addition of a competitive host or guest, disassembly of the crosslinks occurs. This reduces the extent of merocyanine aggregation and accelerates the decay periods that control the information displayed at various time points.








Abstract
A stimuli&#8208;responsive invisible ink for time&#8208;dependent encryption of information is reported. Consisting of a pillar[5]arene&#8208;based supramolecular network grafted with spiropyran moieties, these materials display time&#8208;dependent photochromic behavior with tailorable fading rates. Ultraviolet (UV) light results in isomerization of the colorless spiropyran to the corresponding colored merocyanine, while visible light or heat causes the reverse isomerization with a rate that is dependent on the density of host&#8211;guest crosslinks. The kinetics of discoloration are a function of merocyanine aggregation, which becomes more pronounced as the host&#8211;guest crosslink density is increased, leading to a reduced conversion rate and slower time&#8208;dependent fading. The degree of crosslinking, and hence the fading rate, may be modulated via the addition of unbound pillar[5]arene host or nitrile guest as competitors. Time&#8208;dependent information encryption is enabled by combining selective placement of host and guest competitors and UV patterning. UV patterning provides an initially &#8220;false&#8221; image that does not reveal the desired information, and it is only after a given time that the encrypted data appears. This work provides a unique approach to enhance the security of information storage associated with offline portable data encryption.

         <title>Supramolecular Reinforcement of Polymer&#8211;Nanoparticle Hydrogels for Modular Materials Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Moldable hydrogels are increasingly used as injectable or extrudable materials in biomedical and industrial applications owing to their ability to flow under applied stress (shear&#8208;thin) and reform a stable network (self&#8208;heal). Nanoscale components can be added to dynamic polymer networks to modify their mechanical properties and broaden the scope of applications. Viscoelastic polymer&#8211;nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogels comprise a versatile and tunable class of dynamic nanocomposite materials that form via reversible interactions between polymer chains and nanoparticles. However, PNP hydrogel formation is restricted to specific interactions between select polymers and nanoparticles, resulting in a limited range of mechanical properties and constraining their utility. Here, we&#160;introduce a facile strategy to reinforce PNP hydrogels through the simple addition of &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;CD) to the formulation. The formation of polypseudorotoxanes between &#945;CD and the hydrogel components resulted in a drastic enhancement of the mechanical properties. Furthermore, supramolecular reinforcement of CD&#8211;PNP hydrogels enabled us to decouple mechanical properties and material functionality. This allowed for modular exchange of structural components from a library of functional polymers and nanoparticles. We&#160;leveraged &#945;CD supramolecular binding motifs to form CD&#8211;PNP hydrogels with biopolymers for high fidelity 3D (bio)printing and drug delivery as well as with inorganic NPs to engineer magnetic or conductive&#160;materials.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Based Microwave Circuits: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Over the past two decades, the research on two&#8208;dimensional materials has received much interest. Graphene is the most promising candidate regarding high frequency applications thus far due to is high carrier mobility.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, the research on two-dimensional materials has received much interest. Graphene is the most promising candidate regarding high frequency applications thus far due to is high carrier mobility. This review discusses the research about the employment of graphene in micro- and millimetre-wave circuits. The review starts with the different methodologies to grow and transfer graphene before discussing the way graphene-based field-effect-transistors (GFETs) and diodes are built. A review on different approaches for realising these devices is provided before discussing the employment of both GFETs and graphene diodes in different micro- and millimetre-wave circuits, showing the possibilities but also the limitations of this 2D-material for high frequency&#160;applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Electronegativity Induced Charge Balancing to Boost Stability and Activity of Amorphous Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphization is an efficient strategy to activate intrinsically inert catalysts. However, the low crystallinity of amorphous catalysts often causes high solubility and poor electrochemical stability in the aqueous solution. Here, we develop a different mechanism to simultaneously stabilize and activate the water&#8208;soluble amorphous MoSxOy via a charge balancing strategy, which is induced by different electronegativity between co&#8208;dopants Rh (2.28) and Sn (1.96). The electron&#8208;rich Sn prefers to stabilize the unstable apical O sites in MoSxOy through the charge transfer, which can prevent the H from attacking. Meanwhile, the Rh as the charge regulator shifts the main active sites on basal plane from inert Sn to active apical Rh sites. As a result, the amorphous RhSn&#8208;MoSxOy exhibits drastic enhancement in electrochemical stability (&#951;10 increases only by 12&#160;mV) after 1000 cycles and a distinct activity (&#951;10: 26&#160;mV and Tafel: 30.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) for HER in acidic solution. This work paves a route for turning the impracticably water&#8208;soluble catalysts into treasure and inspires new ideas to design high&#8208;performance amorphous electrocatalysts.

         <title>A PF6&#8722;&#8208;Permselective Polymer Electrolyte with Anion Solvation Regulation Enabling Long&#8208;cycle Dual&#8208;ion Battery</title>

Abstract
Graphitic carbon that allows reversible anion (de&#8208;)intercalation is a promising cathode material for cost&#8208;efficient and high&#8208;voltage dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs). However, one notorious but overlooked issue is the incomplete interfacial anion desolvation, which not only reduces the oxidative stability of electrolytes, but also results in solvent co&#8208;intercalation into graphite layers. Here, we first develop an &#8220;anion&#8208;permselective&#8221; polymer electrolyte with abundant cationic quaternary ammonium motif to weaken the PF6&#8722;&#8211;solvent interaction and thus facilitate PF6&#8722; desolvation. This strategy significantly inhibits solvent co&#8208;intercalation as well as enhances the oxidation resistance of electrolyte, ensuring the structural integrity of graphite. As a result, the as&#8208;assembled graphite||Li cell achieves a superior cyclability with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.0% (versus 95.7% for baseline electrolyte) and 87.1% capacity retention after 2000 cycles even at a high cut&#8208;off potential of 5.4&#160;V versus Li+/Li. Besides, this polymer also forms a robust cathode electrolyte interface, working together to enable a long&#8208;life DIB. This strategy of tuning anion coordination environment provides a promising solution to regulate solvent co&#8208;intercalation chemistry for DIBs.

         <title>Emerging 4D printing strategies for next&#8208;generation tissue regeneration and medical devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The rapid development of 3D printing has led to considerable progress in the field of biomedical engineering. Notably, 4D printing provides a potential strategy to achieve a time&#8208;dependent physical change within tissue scaffolds or replicate the dynamic biological behaviors of native tissues for smart tissue regeneration and the fabrication of medical devices. The fabricated stimulus&#8208;responsive structures can offer dynamic, reprogrammable deformation or actuation to mimic complex physical, biochemical, and mechanical processes of native tissues. Although there has been notable progress made in the development of the 4D printing approach for various biomedical applications, its more broad&#8208;scale adoption for clinical use and tissue engineering purposes has been complicated by a notable limitation of printable smart materials and the simplistic nature of achievable responses possible with current sources of stimulation. In this review, we highlight the recent progress made in the field of 4D printing by discussing the various printing mechanisms that have been achieved with great emphasis on smart ink mechanisms of 4D actuation, construct structural design, and printing technologies. We then summarize recent 4D printing studies which focus on the applications of tissue/organ regeneration and medical devices. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives of 4D printing are also discussed.

         <title>Programmable Dual Regime Spray for Large&#8208;Scale and Custom&#8208;Designed Electronic Textiles</title>

Abstract
Increasing demand for wearable healthcare synergistically advances the field of electronic textiles, or e&#8208;textiles, allowing for the ambulatory monitoring of vital health signals. Despite great promises, the pragmatic deployment of e&#8208;textiles in clinical practice remains challenged due to the lack of a method in producing custom&#8208;designed e&#8208;textiles at high spatial resolution across a large area. To this end, we employ a programmable dual regime spray that enables the direct custom writing of functional nanoparticles into arbitrary fabrics at submillimeter resolution over meter scale. The resulting e&#8208;textiles retain the intrinsic fabric properties in terms of mechanical flexibility, water vapor permeability, and comfortability against multiple uses and laundry cycles. The e&#8208;textiles tightly fit various body sizes and shapes to support the high&#8208;fidelity recording of physiological and electrophysiological signals on the skin under ambulatory conditions. Pilot field tests in a remote health monitoring setting with a large animal, such as a horse, demonstrate the scalability and utility of the e&#8208;textiles beyond conventional devices. This approach will be suitable for the rapid prototyping of custom e&#8208;textiles tailored to meet various clinical needs.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Type SrVO3 as High&#8208;Performance Anode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite SrVO3 is investigated as a Li&#8208;ion battery anode material. Thanks to the high intrinsic electronic and ionic conductivities, commercial thick and conducting additive&#8208;free perovskite SrVO3 electrodes are constructed and electrochemical performance with high gravimetric/areal/volumetric capacities, high&#8208;rate capability, and high cycling stability is delivered.








Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;type oxides, characterized by excellent multifunctional physical and chemical properties, are widely used in ferroelectric, piezoelectric, energy conversion, and storage applications. It is shown here that the perovskite&#8208;type SrVO3 can achieve excellent electrochemical performance as lithium&#8208;ion battery anodes thanks to its high electrically and ionically conductivity. Conducting additive&#8208;free SrVO3 electrodes can deliver a high specific capacity of 324 mAh g&#8722;1 at a safe and low average working potential of &#8776;0.9 V vs Li/Li+ together with excellent high&#8208;rate performance. A high areal capacity of &#8776;5.4 mAh cm&#8722;2 is obtained using an ultrathick (&#8776;120 &#956;m) electrode. Moreover, the fully lithiated SrVO3 electrode exhibits only 2.3% volume expansion that is explained by a simple solid&#8208;solution Li+&#8208;storage mechanism, resulting in good cycling stability of the electrode. This study highlights the perovskite&#8208;type SrVO3 as a promising Li+&#8208;storage anode and provides opportunities for exploring a variety of perovskite oxides as next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;ion battery anodes.

This study highlights the perovskite-type SrVO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as a promising Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-storage anode and provides opportunities for exploring a variety of perovskite oxides as next-generation metal-ion battery anodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic Trachea Engineering via a Modular Ring Strategy Based on Bone&#8208;Marrow Stem Cells and Atelocollagen for Use in Extensive Tracheal Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chondroitin&#8208;sulfate&#8208;incorporating type&#8208;II atelocollagen scaffold repopulated with bone marrow stem cells for cartilaginous rings regeneration and type&#8208;I atelocollagen scaffold for vascularized fibrous tissue formation is fabricated; then, a modular ring strategy to develop a biomimetic trachea with cartilaginous rings alternately interspersed between the vascularized fibrous tissue architecture is adopted. The biomimetic trachea is used for extensive tracheal reconstruction.








Abstract
The fabrication of biomimetic tracheas with a architecture of cartilaginous rings alternately interspersed between vascularized fibrous tissue (CRVFT) has the potential to perfectly recapitulate the normal tracheal structure and function. Herein, the development of a customized chondroitin&#8208;sulfate&#8208;incorporating type&#8208;II atelocollagen (COL II/CS) scaffold with excellent chondrogenic capacity and a type&#8208;I atelocollagen (COL I) scaffold to facilitate the formation of vascularized fibrous tissue is described. An efficient modular ring strategy is then adopted to develop a CRVFT&#8208;based biomimetic trachea. The in vitro engineering of cartilaginous rings is achieved via the recellularization of ring&#8208;shaped COL II/CS scaffolds using bone marrow stem cells as a mimetic for native cartilaginous ring tissue. A CRVFT&#8208;based trachea with biomimetic mechanical properties, composed of bionic biochemical components, is additionally successfully generated in vivo via the alternating stacking of cartilaginous rings and ring&#8208;shaped COL I scaffolds on a silicone pipe. The resultant biomimetic trachea with pedicled muscular flaps is used for extensive tracheal reconstruction and exhibits satisfactory therapeutic outcomes with structural and functional properties similar to those of native trachea. This is the first study to utilize stem cells for long&#8208;segmental tracheal cartilaginous regeneration and this represents a promising method for extensive tracheal reconstruction.

Silica aerogels with accurate building&#8208;block control are realized by adjusting the surfactant concentration during the synthesis process. The resulting silica aerogels, serving as a diffuser, show an incredibly promising application in laser&#8208;driven lighting.








Abstract
Silica aerogels with accurate building&#8208;block control are realized by adjusting the surfactant concentration during the synthesis process. The resulting silica&#8208;aerogel monolith with spherical building blocks of &#8776;24&#8211;40&#160;nm, together with a deliberately created hole along the incident light direction, shows an incredibly promising application in monochromatic laser&#8208;driven lighting. The resulting coefficient of illuminance variation is as low as 8.1%, significantly outperforming commercially available ground&#8208;glass diffusers (139.0%) and polymer diffusers (249.1%); the speckle contrast is lower, as well as better, than that can be recognized by the human eye (4%), and the illuminance uniformity in the range of 0.770&#8211;0.862 is much better (higher) than that indoor workplace lighting required by the International Organization for Standardization. Lighting with any color in the visible spectrum, including white, can be obtained by using three primary color lasers (450, 532, and 638&#160;nm) with different powers simultaneously as the light source. The resulting silica aerogel, which has excellent thermal stability, high laser&#8208;damage threshold, outstanding mechanical performance, and superhydrophobicity, can be further applied to long&#8208;distance and noncontact laser&#8208;driven lighting in rain or underwater without any additional encapsulation components.

         <title>Sodium&#8208;Doped Titania Self&#8208;Rectifying Memristors for Crossbar Array Neuromorphic Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Na&#8208;doped TiO2&#160;memristor is fabricated using in&#160;situ doping with a custom&#8208;designed NaOH reactant during atomic layer deposition growth, where the resulting resistive&#8208;switching mechanism is based on Na migration. By applying these self&#8208;rectifying Na&#8208;doped TiO2&#160;memristors to a 6&#160;&#215;&#160;6&#160;crossbar array, each of the 36&#160;devices are operated individually without crosstalk disturbance.








Abstract
Memristors integrated into a crossbar&#8208;array architecture (CAA) are promising candidates for nonvolatile memory elements in artificial neural networks. However, the relatively low reliability of memristors coupled with crosstalk and sneak currents in CAAs have limited the realization of the full potential of this technology. Here, high&#8208;reliability Na&#8208;doped TiO2&#160;memristors grown in&#160;situ by atomic layer deposition (ALD) are demonstrated, where reversible Na migration underlies the resistive&#8208;switching mechanism. By employing ALD growth with an aqueous NaOH reactant in deionized water, uniform implantation of Na dopants is achieved in the crystallized TiO2&#160;thin films at 250&#160;&#176;C without post&#8208;annealing. The resulting Na&#8208;doped TiO2&#160;memristors show electroforming&#8208;free and self&#8208;rectifying resistive&#8208;switching behavior, and they are ideally suited for selectorless CAAs. Effective addressing of selectorless nodes is demonstrated via electrical measurement of individual memristors in a 6&#160;&#215;&#160;6&#160;crossbar using a read current of less than 1&#160;&#181;A with negligible sneak current at or below the noise level of &#8776;100&#160;pA. Finally, the long&#8208;term potentiation and depression synaptic behavior from these Na&#8208;doped TiO2&#160;memristors achieves greater than 99.1% accuracy for image&#8208;recognition tasks using a convolutional neural network based on the selectorless of crossbar arrays.

         <title>A General Strategy to Immobilize Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are immobilized in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by a general strategy with SnO2 as a mediator onto metal&#8211;oxo clusters via a two&#8208;step microwave&#8208;assisted modification approach. Remarkably, the H2 production efficiency of Pt1/SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 under visible light surpasses that of Cu1/SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 and Ni1/SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, surpassing that of their corresponding metal nanoparticles (NPs) by far.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are witnessing rapid development due to their high activity and selectivity toward diverse reactions. However, it remains a grand challenge in the general synthesis of SACs, particularly featuring an identical chemical microenvironment and on the same support. Herein, a universal synthetic protocol is developed to immobilize SACs in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Significantly, by means of SnO2 as a mediator or adaptor, not only different single&#8208;atom metal sites, such as Pt, Cu, and Ni, etc., can be installed, but also the MOF supports can be changed (for example, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, PCN&#8208;222, and DUT&#8208;67) to afford M1/SnO2/MOF architecture. Taking UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 as a representative, the Pt1/SnO2/MOF exhibits approximately five times higher activity toward photocatalytic H2 production than the corresponding Pt nanoparticles (&#8776;2.5&#160;nm) stabilized by SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Remarkably, despite featuring identical parameters in the chemical microenvironment and support in M1/SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, the Pt1 catalyst possesses a hydrogen evolution rate of 2167 &#181;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1, superior to the Cu1 and Ni1 counterparts, which is attributed to the differentiated hydrogen binding free energies, as supported by density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations. This is thought to be the first report on a universal approach toward the stabilization of SACs with identical chemical microenvironment on an identical support.

Remarkably, despite featuring identical parameters in the chemical microenvironment and support in M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/UiO-66-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst possesses a hydrogen evolution rate of 2167 &#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;, superior to the Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Ni&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; counterparts, which is attributed to the differentiated hydrogen binding free energies, as supported by density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. This is thought to be the first report on a universal approach toward the stabilization of SACs with identical chemical microenvironment on an identical support.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking Stabilized Nanophotosensitizers: Improving Tumor Retention for Enhanced Therapy for Large Tumors in Mice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoparticles encapsulating BODIPY photosensitizers with strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking are prepared, demonstrating long tumor retention of up to 10 days. The nanoparticles can completely suppress regular test size tumors (100 mm3) in mice by one&#8208;time radiation. Importantly, the nanoparticles also allow treatment of large&#8208;size tumors (350 mm3) via single&#8208;dose injection and three&#8208;time light treatments, resulting in a 90% inhibition rate.








Abstract
Conventional photosensitizers (PSs) often show poor tumor retention and are rapidly cleared from the bloodstream, which is one of the key hindrances to guarantee precise and efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT) in vivo. In this work, a photosensitizer assembly nanosystem that sharply enhances tumor retention up to &#8776;10 days is present. The PSs are synthesized by meso&#8208;substituting anthracene onto a BODIPY scaffold (AN&#8208;BDP), which then self&#8208;assembles into stable nanoparticles (AN&#8208;BDP NPs) with amphiphilic block copolymers due to the strong intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction of the anthracene. Additionally, the incorporated anthracene excites the PSs, producing singlet oxygen under red&#8208;light irradiation. Although AN&#8208;BDP NPs can completely suppress regular test size tumors (&#8776;100 mm3) by one&#8208;time radiation, only 12% tumor growth inhibition rate is observed in the case of large&#8208;size tumors (&#8776;350 mm3) under the same conditions. Due to the long&#8208;time tumor retention, AN&#8208;BDP NPs allow single&#8208;dose injection and three&#8208;time light treatments, resulting in an inhibition rate over 90%, much more efficient than single&#8208;time radiation of conventional clinically used PSs including chlorin&#8208;e6 (Ce6) and porphyrin with poor tumor retention. The results reveal the importance of long tumor retention time of PSs for efficient PDT, which can accelerate the clinical development of nanophotosensitizers.

         <title>Controlling and Focusing In&#8208;Plane Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 with a Curved Plasmonic Antenna</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Launching, controlling, and focusing in&#8208;plane hyperbolic phonon polaritons in van der Waals &#945;&#8208;MoO3 are realized with geometrically designed curved gold plasmonic antennas. By engineering the curvature of the antenna extremity, it is able to tune the focal lengths and lateral sizes of the focal points. This study can open up new avenues for planar nanophotonic devices in the mid&#8208;IR region.








Abstract
Hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) sustained in polar van der Waals (vdW) crystals exhibit extraordinary confinement of long&#8208;wave electromagnetic fields to the deep subwavelength scale. In stark contrast to uniaxial vdW hyperbolic materials, recently emerged biaxial hyperbolic materials, such as &#945;&#8208;MoO3 and &#945;&#8208;V2O5, offer new degrees of freedom for controlling light in two&#8208;dimensions due to their distinctive in&#8208;plane hyperbolic dispersions. However, the control and focusing of these in&#8208;plane HPhPs remain elusive. Here, a versatile technique is proposed for launching, controlling, and focusing in&#8208;plane HPhPs in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 with geometrically designed curved gold plasmonic antennas. It is found that the subwavelength manipulation and focusing behaviors are strongly dependent on the curvature of the antenna extremity. This strategy operates effectively in a broadband spectral region. These findings not only provide fundamental insights into the manipulation of light by biaxial hyperbolic crystals at the nanoscale but also open up new opportunities for planar nanophotonic applications.

         <dc:description>
This work presents a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly strategy to generate polysaccharide multilayers on the surface of an all&#8208;liquid microfluidic chip, significantly enhancing the mechanical properties of the microchannel, and offering a biocompatible microenvironment for enzyme immobilization. All&#8208;liquid microfluidic enzymatic or cascade reactors are constructed, and the crucial role of polysaccharide multilayers on enhancing the enzyme loading and catalytic efficiency is demonstrated.








Abstract
Enzyme immobilization in the confines of microfluidic chips, that promote enzyme activity and stability, has become a powerful strategy to enhance biocatalysis and biomass conversion. Here, based on a newly developed all&#8208;liquid microfluidic chip, fabricated by the interfacial assembly of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) in a biphasic system, a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly strategy to generate polysaccharide multilayers on the surface of a microchannel, greatly enhancing the mechanical properties of the microchannel and offering a biocompatible microenvironment for enzyme immobilization, is presented. Using horseradish peroxidase and glucose oxidase as model enzymes, all&#8208;liquid microfluidic enzymatic and cascade reactors have been constructed and the crucial role of polysaccharide multilayers on enhancing the enzyme loading and catalytic efficiency is demonstrated.

         <title>Record&#8208;High Superconductivity in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides Emerged in Compressed 2H&#8208;TaS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Pressure has always been an effective method for uncovering novel phenomena and properties in condensed matter physics. Here, we carried out an electrical transport study on 2H&#8208;TaS2 up to &#8764;208&#160;GPa, and found an unexpected superconducting state (SC&#8208;II) emerging around 86.1&#160;GPa with an initial critical temperature (Tc) of 9.6 K. As pressure increases, the Tc enhances rapidly and reaches the maximum of 16.4 K at 157.4&#160;GPa, which sets a new record for transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). The original superconducting state (SC&#8208;I) was found to be re&#8208;enhanced above 100&#160;GPa after the recession around 10&#160;GPa, and coexists with SC&#8208;II to the highest pressure applied in this work. In situ high&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray diffraction and Hall effect measurements reveal that the occurrence of SC&#8208;II is accompanied by a structural modification and a concurrent enhancement of hole carrier density. The new high&#8208;Tc superconducting state that emerged in 2H&#8208;TaS2 can be attributed to the electronic states change near the Fermi surface owing to the pressure&#8208;induced interlayer modulation. It is the first time finding this remarkable superconducting state in TMDs, which not only brings a new broad of perspective on layered materials but also expands the field of pressure&#8208;modified superconductivity.

         <title>Multiferroic Enabled Magnetic&#8208;exciton in 2D Quantum Entangled van der Waals Antiferromagnet NiI2</title>

Abstract
Matter&#8208;light interaction is at the center of diverse research fields from quantum optics to condensed matter physics, opening new fields like laser physics. A magnetic exciton is one such rare example found in magnetic insulators. However, it is relatively rare to observe that external variables control matter&#8208;light interaction. Here, we report that the broken inversion symmetry of multiferroicity can act as an external knob enabling the magnetic exciton in van der Waals antiferromagnet NiI2. We further discover that this magnetic exciton arises from a transition between Zhang&#8208;Rice&#8208;triplet and Zhang&#8208;Rice&#8208;singlet's fundamentally quantum entangled states. This quantum entanglement produces an ultra&#8208;sharp optical exciton peak at 1.384&#160;eV with a 5 meV linewidth. Our work demonstrates that NiI2 is two&#8208;dimensional magnetically ordered with an intrinsically quantum entangled ground state.

         <title>Treatment of Ruptured and Non&#8208;Ruptured Aneurysms Using a Semi&#8208;Solid Iodinated Embolic Agent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Saccular aneurysms (SAs) are focal outpouchings from the lateral wall of an artery. Depending on their morphology and location, minimally invasive treatment options include coil embolization, flow diverter stents, stent&#8208;assisted coiling and liquid embolics. Many drawbacks are associated with these treatment options including recanalization, delayed healing, rebleeding, malpositioning of the embolic or stent, stent stenosis and even rupture of the SA. To overcome these drawbacks, we developed a nanoclay&#8208;based shear&#8208;thinning hydrogel (STH) for the endovascular treatment of SAs. Extensive in vitro testing was performed to optimize STH performance, visualization, injectability and endothelialization in cell culture. Femoral artery saccular aneurysm (FASA) models in rats and in pigs were created to test stability, efficacy, immune response, endothelialization and biocompatibility of STH in both ruptured and unruptured SA. Fluoroscopy and computed tomography imaging consistently confirmed SA occlusion without recanalization, migration, or non&#8208;target embolization; STH was also shown to outperform coil embolization of porcine aneurysms. In pigs with catastrophic bleeding due to SA rupture, STH was able to achieve instant hemostasis rescuing the pigs in long&#8208;term survival experiments. STH is a promising semi&#8208;solid iodinated embolic agent that can change the standard of medical practice and potentially save lives.

         <title>Miniaturized Multispectral Detector Derived from Gradient Response Units on Single MAPbX3 Microwire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Miniaturized multispectral detector is urgently desired in the unprecedented prosperity of smart optoelectronic chips for the integrated functions including communication, imaging, scientific analysis, etc. However, multispectral detectors require complicated prisms optics or interference/interferometric filters for spectral recognition, which hampers the miniaturization and their subsequent integration in photonic integrated circuits. In this work, inspired by the advance of computational imaging, we report optical&#8208;component&#8208;free miniaturized multispectral detector on 4&#160;mm gradient bandgap MAPbX3 microwire with a diameter of 30&#160;&#956;m. With accurate composition engineering, halide ions in MAPbX3 microwire vary from Cl to I giving in the gradual variation of optical bandgap from 2.96 to 1.68&#160;eV along axis. The sensing units on MAPbX3 microwire offer the response edge ranging from 450&#160;nm to 790&#160;nm with the responsivity over 20&#160;mA/W, &#8208;3dB&#160;width over 450&#160;Hz, LDR of &#8764;60&#160;dB, and a noise current less than &#8764;1.4&#8729;10&#8211;12 A&#8729;Hz&#8211;0.5. As a result, our derived miniaturized detector achieves the function of multispectral sensing and discrimination with spectral resolution of &#8764;25&#160;nm and mismatch of &#8764;10&#160;nm. Finally, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept colorful imaging was successfully conducted with our miniaturized multispectral detector to further confirm its application in spectral recognition.

         <title>Polyprodrug Nanomedicines: An Emerging Paradigm for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyprodrug nanomedicines have great potential in cancer therapy owing to their well&#8208;controlled composition and high drug loading by direct polymerization of therapeutic monomers. Recent advances in the development of polyprodrug nanomedicines are summarized to provide deep insights into the design and preparation of polyprodrug nanomedicines for efficient cancer therapy.








Abstract
Nanomedicines have the potential to provide advanced therapeutic strategies in combating tumors. Polymer&#8208;prodrug&#8208;based nanomedicines are particularly attractive in cancer therapies owing to the maximum drug loading, prolonged blood circulation, and reduced premature leakage and side effects in comparison with conventional nanomaterials. However, the difficulty in precisely tuning the composition and drug loading of polymer&#8211;drug conjugates leads to batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variations of the prodrugs, thus significantly restricting their clinical translation. Polyprodrug nanomedicines inherit the numerous intrinsic advantages of polymer&#8211;drug conjugates and exhibit well&#8208;controlled composition and drug loading via direct polymerization of therapeutic monomers, representing a promising nanomedicine for clinical tumor therapies. In this review, recent advances in the development of polyprodrug nanomedicines are summarized for tumor elimination. Various types of polyprodrug nanomedicines and the corresponding properties are first summarized. The unique advantages of polyprodrug nanomedicines and their key roles in various tumor therapies are further highlighted. Finally, current challenges and the perspectives on future research of polyprodrug nanomedicines are discussed.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Free Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membrane for Precise Ion/Solvent Separation toward Highly Stable Magnesium Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase enabled by an intact metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membrane is constructed directly on Mg foils. Through precious solvent molecule/Mg ion sieve owing to the angstrom&#8208;sized aperture window, the MOF membrane suppresses the solvent reduction and enables a low migration barrier for Mg2+ transportation within this MOF&#8208;based solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase.








Abstract
Metallic magnesium batteries are promising candidates beyond lithium&#8208;ion batteries; however, a passive interfacial layer because of the electro&#8208;reduction of solvents on Mg surfaces usually leads to ultrahigh overpotential for the reversible Mg chemistry. Inspired by the excellent separation effect of permselective metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) at angstrom scale, a large&#8208;area and defect&#8208;free MOF membrane directly on Mg surfaces is here constructed. In this process, the electrochemical deprotonation of ligand can be facilitated to afford the self&#8208;correcting of intercrystalline voids until a seamless membrane formed, which can eliminate nonselective intercrystalline diffusion of electrolyte and realize selective Mg2+ transport but precisely separate the solvent molecules from the MOF channels. Compared with the continuous solvent reduction on bare Mg anode, the as&#8208;constructed MOF membrane is demonstrated to significantly stabilize the Mg electrode via suppressing the permeation of solvents, hence contributing to a low&#8208;overpotential plating/stripping in conventional electrolytes. The concept is demonstrated that membrane separation can serve as solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, which would be widely applicable to other energy&#8208;storage systems.

The combined results from solid&#8208;state NMR, crystallography, and modelling techniques highlight key differences in the Y6 morphology in PM6:Y6 blends cast from different solvents, which lead to different power conversion efficiencies in solar cells. By interpreting the experimental data step&#8208;by&#8208;step and using the results from each step, a more complete understanding of the underlying fundamental processes is reached.








Abstract
Fused&#8208;ring core nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), designated &#8220;Y&#8208;series,&#8221; have enabled high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs) achieving over 18% power conversion efficiency (PCE). Since the introduction of these NFAs, much effort has been expended to understand the reasons for their exceptional performance. While several studies have identified key optoelectronic properties that govern high PCEs, little is known about the molecular level origins of large variations in performance, spanning from 5% to 18% PCE, for example, in the case of PM6:Y6 OSCs. Here, a combined solid&#8208;state NMR, crystallography, and molecular modeling approach to elucidate the atomic&#8208;scale interactions in Y6 crystals, thin films, and PM6:Y6 bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends is introduced. It is shown that the Y6 morphologies in BHJ blends are not governed by the morphology in neat films or single crystals. Notably, PM6:Y6 blends processed from different solvents self&#8208;assemble into different structures and morphologies, whereby the relative orientations of the sidechains and end groups of the Y6 molecules to their fused&#8208;ring cores play a crucial role in determining the resulting morphology and overall performance of the solar cells. The molecular&#8208;level understanding of BHJs enabled by this approach will guide the engineering of next&#8208;generation NFAs for stable and efficient OSCs.

         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical route to prepare stoichiometric&#8208;pure and air&#8208;stable &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 powders is developed, which can be stored for more than 10 months in ambient environment. Redissolving the &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 powders can generate a high concentration of large&#8208;sized polyiodide colloids, which can serve as nuclei to promote heterogeneous nucleation for perovskite films. As a result, a competitive solar cell efficiency of 24.22% is achieved.








Abstract
A prerequisite for commercializing perovskite photovoltaics is to develop a swift and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis route, which guarantees the mass production of halide perovskites in the industry. Herein, a green&#8208;solvent&#8208;assisted mechanochemical strategy is developed for fast synthesizing a stoichiometric &#948;&#8208;phase formamidinium lead iodide (&#948;&#8208;FAPbI3) powder, which serves as a high&#8208;purity precursor for perovskite film deposition with low defects. The presynthesized &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 precursor possesses high concentration of micrometer&#8208;sized colloids, which are in favor of preferable crystallization by spontaneous nucleation. The resultant perovskite films own preferred crystal orientations of cubic (100) plane, which is beneficial for superior carrier transport compared to that of the films with isotropic crystal orientations using &#8220;mixture of PbI2 and FAI&#8221; as precursors. As a result, high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 24.2% are obtained. Moreover, the &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 powder shows superior storage stability for more than 10 months in ambient environment (40&#160;&#177; 10% relative humidity), being conducive to a facile and practical storage for further commercialization.

         <title>Unusual Site&#8208;Selective Doping in Layered Cathode Strengthens Electrostatic Cohesion of Alkali&#8208;Metal Layer for Practicable Sodium&#8208;Ion Full Cell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unusual site&#8208;selective doping with Cu ion at transition metal site (2a) and unusual Zn ion at Na site (2d) for P2&#8208; Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 can effectively restrain P2&#8211;O2 phase transition and prevent material crack due to the enhanced electrostatic cohesions between two transition metal layers, leading to ultralong life span sodium&#8208;ion full cell.








Abstract
P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 is a dominant cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and energy density. However, charging P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 to voltages higher than 4.2&#8201;V (vs. Na+/Na) can induce detrimental structural transformation and severe capacity fading. Herein, stable cycling and moisture resistancy of Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 at 4.35&#8201;V (vs. Na+/Na) are achieved through dual&#8208;site doping with Cu ion at transition metal site (2a) and unusual Zn ion at Na site (2d) for the first time. The Cu ion doping in 2a site stabilizes the metal layer, while more importantly, the unusual alkali&#8208;metal site doping by Zn ion serves as O2&#8208;&#63743;Zn2+&#63743;O2&#8208; &#8220;pillar&#8221; for enhancing electrostatic cohesion between two adjacent transition metal layers, preventing the crack of active material along the a&#8211;b&#8208;plane and restraining the generation of O2 phase upon deep desodiation. This unique dual&#8208;site&#8208;doped [Na0.67Zn0.05]Ni0.18Cu0.1Mn0.67O2 cathode exhibits a prominent cyclability with 80.6% capacity retention over 2000 cycles at an ultrahigh rate of 10C, demonstrating its great potential for practical applications. Impressively, the full cell devices with [Na0.67Zn0.05]Ni0.18Cu0.1Mn0.67O2 and commercial hard carbon as cathode and anode, respectively, can deliver a high energy density of 217.9&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 and excellent cycle life over 1000 cycles.

         <title>Smart Chemical Engineering&#8208;Based Lightweight and Miniaturized Attachable Systems for Advanced Drug Delivery and Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired by the natural world, versatile chemical engineering&#8208;based lightweight and miniaturized attachable systems have been fabricated and functionalized, and they exhibit excellent potential in biomedical applications by providing diverse prototypes/products. It is believed that such devices hold great promise to improve the lives by significantly improving patient/user comfort, convenience, and compliance, indicating high clinical and industrial values.








Abstract
Smart attachable systems have attracted much attention owing to their capabilities in terms of body performance evaluation, disease diagnostics, and drug delivery. Recent advances in chemical and engineering techniques provide many opportunities to improve device fabrication and applications owing to the advantages of being lightweight and easy to control as well as their battery absence and functional diversity. This review highlights the latest developments in the field of chemical engineering&#8208;based lightweight and miniaturized attachable systems, which are mainly inspired by the natural world. Their applications for real&#8208;time monitoring, point&#8208;of&#8208;care sampling, biomarker detection, and controlled release are discussed thoroughly with respect to specific products/prototypes. The perspectives of the field, including persistence guarantee, burden reduction, and personality improvement, are also discussed. It is believed that chemical engineering&#8208;based lightweight and miniaturized attachable systems have good potential in both clinical and industrial fields, indicating a large potential to improve human lives in the near future.

         <title>Reaching the Excitonic Limit in 2D Janus Monolayers by In Situ Deterministic Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deterministic conversion of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) to Janus quantum layers is achieved via a novel synthesis approach. Integrated in situ spectroscopy measurements enable detailed insights into classical TMDs to Janus layer conversion to reach excitonic&#8208;grade Janus layer.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Deterministic conversion of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) to Janus quantum layers is achieved via a novel synthesis approach. Integrated in situ spectroscopy measurements enable detailed insights into classical TMDs to Janus layer conversion to reach excitonic-grade Janus layer.

         <title>An Ultrahigh&#8208;Power Mesocarbon Microbeads|Na+&#8208;Diglyme|Na3V2(PO4)3 Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>

         <dc:description>
A prototype of ultrahigh power sodium ion battery (SIB), mesocarbon microbeads|Na+&#8208;diglyme|Na3V2(PO4)3, is assembled. The as&#8208;synthesized Na3V2(PO4)3@C@CNTs cathode and mesocarbon microbeads anode display the well&#8208;matched rate capability. The assembled full&#8208;cell delivers an energy density of 88&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at ultrahigh power density of &#8776;10&#160;kW kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) show practical applications in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. But, their power density is limited by the sluggish Na+ diffusion into the cathode and anode materials. Herein, the authors demonstrate a prototype of ultrahigh power SIB, consisting of the high&#8208;rate Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode, graphite&#8208;type mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) anode, and Na+&#8208;diglyme electrolyte. It is found that the overpotential of the NVP cathode obeys the Ohmic rule. Thus, the as&#8208;synthesized NVP@C@carbon nanotubes (CNTs) cathode with the high conductive CNTs networks displays high electronic conductivity, reducing the overpotential and charge transfer resistances and leading to the remarkable rate capability over 1000C. For the MCMB anode, the initial [Na&#8208;diglyme]+ co&#8208;intercalation step is pseudocapacitive dominated, and then the expanded graphite's layers ensure the subsequent fast ions diffusion. The rapid (de)intercalation kinetics in between the cathode and anode are well&#8208;matched. Thus, the assembled MCMB|1 m NaPF6 in diglyme|NVP@C@CNTs full&#8208;cell SIB delivers the energy density of 88&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at the high power density of &#8776;10&#160;kW kg&#8722;1. Even at the ultrahigh power density of 23&#160;kW kg&#8722;1, an energy density of 58&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 is obtained. The encouraging results of the full cell will promote the development of high&#8208;power SIB for large&#8208;scale applications in the future.

         <title>Orbital Gating Driven by Giant Stark Effect in Tunneling Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orbital gating is introduced driven by giant Stark effect in tunneling phototransistors based on 2H&#8208;MoTe2 without using external gating bias or slow charge trapping dynamics in conventional photogating, which realizes low dark current, practical photoresponsivity, and fast switching time simultaneously.








Abstract
Conventional gating in transistors uses electric fields through external dielectrics that require complex fabrication processes. Various optoelectronic devices deploy photogating by electric fields from trapped charges in neighbor nanoparticles or dielectrics under light illumination. Orbital gating driven by giant Stark effect is demonstrated in tunneling phototransistors based on 2H&#8208;MoTe2 without using external gating bias or slow charge trapping dynamics in photogating. The original self&#8208;gating by light illumination modulates the interlayer potential gradient by switching on and off the giant Stark effect where the dz2&#8208;orbitals of molybdenum atoms play the dominant role. The orbital gating shifts the electronic bands of the top atomic layer of the MoTe2 by up to 100 meV, which is equivalent to modulation of a carrier density of 7.3 &#215; 1011 cm&#8211;2 by electrical gating. Suppressing conventional photoconductivity, the orbital gating in tunneling phototransistors achieves low dark current, practical photoresponsivity (3357 AW&#8211;1), and fast switching time (0.5&#160;ms) simultaneously.

         <title>Structures and Materials in Stretchable Electroluminescent Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the challenges in fabricating stretchable electroluminescent (EL) devices, with focus on providing a basic understanding of the materials meeting both the mechanical and electronic requirements and introducing important techniques to fabricate the devices. The developments of stretchable transparent electrodes and EL materials relevant to intrinsically stretchable EL devices are described in detail.








Abstract
Stretchable electroluminescent (EL) devices are obtained by partitioning a large emission area into areas specifically for stretching and light&#8208;emission (island&#8211;bridge structure). Buckled and textile structures are also shown effective to combine the conventional light emitting diode fabrication with elastic substrates for structure&#8208;enabled stretchable EL devices. Meanwhile, intrinsically stretchable EL devices which are characterized with uniform stretchability down to microscopic scale are relatively less developed but promise simpler device structure and higher impact resistance. The challenges in fabricating intrinsically stretchable EL devices with high and robust performance are in many facets, including stretchable conductors, emissive materials, and compatible processes. For the stretchable transparent electrode, ionically conductive gel, conductive polymer coating, and conductor network in surface of elastomer are all proven useful. The stretchable EL materials are currently limited to conjugated polymers, conjugated polymers with surfactants and ionic conductors added to boost stretchability, and phosphor particles embedded in elastomer matrices. These emissive materials operate under different mechanisms, require different electrode materials and fabrication processes, and the corresponding EL devices face distinctive challenges. This review aims to provide a basic understanding of the materials meeting both the mechanical and electronic requirements and important techniques to fabricate the stretchable EL devices.

         <title>Resonance&#8208;Mediated Dynamic Modulation of Perovskite Crystallization for Efficient and Stable Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic strategy is proposed to fabricate high&#8208;quality perovskite films through resonance modulation, leading to a Voc of 1.16 V and high power conversion efficiencies approaching 22.0% and 19.5% for small&#8208;area (0.09&#160;cm2) and large&#8208;area (1.02&#160;cm2) inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), respectively. More importantly, the unencapsulated PSCs exhibit excellent long&#8208;term stability under various environmental conditions (moisture, light, and heat).








Abstract
Manipulating perovskite crystallization to prepare high&#8208;quality perovskite films is the key to achieving highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a dynamic strategy is proposed to modulate perovskite crystallization using a resonance hole&#8208;transporting material (HTM) capable of fast self&#8208;adaptive tautomerization between multiple electronic states with neutral and charged resonance forms for mediating perovskite crystal growth and defect passivation in situ. This approach, based on resonance variation with self&#8208;adaptive molecular interactions between the HTM and the perovskite, produces high&#8208;quality perovskite films with smooth surface, oriented crystallization, and low charge recombination, leading to high&#8208;performance inverted PSCs with power conversion efficiencies approaching 22% for small&#8208;area devices (0.09&#160;cm2) and up to 19.5% for large&#8208;area devices (1.02&#160;cm2). Also, remarkably high stability of the PSCs is observed, retaining over 90%, 88%, or 83% of the initial efficiencies in air with relative humidity of 40&#8211;50%, under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination, or at 75&#160;&#176;C&#160;annealing for 1000 h without encapsulation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manipulating perovskite crystallization to prepare high-quality perovskite films is the key to achieving highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a dynamic strategy is proposed to modulate perovskite crystallization using a resonance hole-transporting material (HTM) capable of fast self-adaptive tautomerization between multiple electronic states with neutral and charged resonance forms for mediating perovskite crystal growth and defect passivation in situ. This approach, based on resonance variation with self-adaptive molecular interactions between the HTM and the perovskite, produces high-quality perovskite films with smooth surface, oriented crystallization, and low charge recombination, leading to high-performance inverted PSCs with power conversion efficiencies approaching 22% for small-area devices (0.09&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and up to 19.5% for large-area devices (1.02&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Also, remarkably high stability of the PSCs is observed, retaining over 90%, 88%, or 83% of the initial efficiencies in air with relative humidity of 40&#8211;50%, under continuous one-sun illumination, or at 75&#160;&#176;C&#160;annealing for 1000 h without encapsulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fast Uncooled Mid&#8208;Wavelength Infrared Photodetectors with Heterostructures of van der Waals on Epitaxial HgCdTe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A van der Waals on epitaxial HgCdTe for uncooled mid&#8208;wavelength infrared photodetectors with fast response and high detectivity at spectral blackbody detection is introduced. Meaningfully, the device exhibits a fast response time of 13 ns, peak detectivity of 2 &#215; 1010 and 1011 cm Hz1/2 W&#8722;1 under blackbody radiation at 300 K and at 77 K.








Abstract
Uncooled infrared photodetectors have evoked widespread interest in basic research and military manufacturing because of their low&#8208;cost, compact detection systems. However, existing uncooled infrared photodetectors utilize the photothermoelectric effect of infrared radiation operating at 8&#8211;12&#160;&#181;m, with a slow response time in the millisecond range. Hence, the exploration of new uncooled mid&#8208;wavelength infrared (MWIR) heterostructures is conducive to the development of ultrafast and high&#8208;performance nano&#8208;optoelectronics. This study explores a van der Waals heterojunction on epitaxial HgCdTe (vdWs&#8208;on&#8208;MCT) as an uncooled MWIR photodetector, which achieves fast response as well as high detectivity for spectral blackbody detection. Specifically, the vdWs&#8208;on&#8208;MCT photodetector has a fast response time of 13&#160;ns (77&#160;MHz), which is approximately an order of magnitude faster than commercial uncooled MCT photovoltaic photodetectors. Importantly, the device exhibits a photoresponsivity of 2.5 A W&#8208;1, quantum efficiency as high as 85%, peak detectivity of 2 &#215; 1010&#160;cm Hz1/2 W&#8208;1 under blackbody radiation at room temperature, and peak detectivity of up to 1011&#160;cm Hz1/2 W&#8208;1 at 77 K. Thereby, this work facilitates the effective design of high&#8208;speed and high&#8208;performance heterojunction uncooled MWIR photodetectors.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Tin&#8211;Lead Mixed&#8208;Perovskite Solar Cells with Vertical Compositional Gradient</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4&#8208;Hydrazinobenzoic acid is introduced to enhance the efficiency and stability of Sn&#8211;Pb mixed&#8208;perovskite solar cells. Moreover, a vertical compositional gradient with a continuous change of the Pb/Sn ratio is found in the Sn&#8211;Pb mixed&#8208;perovskite films, leading to graded heterojunctions that are beneficial for photocarrier separation. The resultant devices show a record efficiency up to 22%.








Abstract
Sn&#8211;Pb mixed perovskites with bandgaps in the range of 1.1&#8211;1.4&#160;eV are ideal candidates for single&#8208;junction solar cells to approach the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit. However, the efficiency and stability of Sn&#8211;Pb mixed&#8208;perovskite solar cells (PSCs) still lag far behind those of Pb&#8208;based counterparts due to the easy oxidation of Sn2+. Here, a reducing agent 4&#8208;hydrazinobenzoic acid is introduced as an additive along with SnF2 to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+. Meanwhile, a vertical Pb/Sn compositional gradient is formed spontaneously after an antisolvent treatment due to different solubility and crystallization kinetics of Sn&#8208; and Pb&#8208;based perovskites and it can be finely tuned by controlling the antisolvent temperature. Because the band structure of a perovskite is dependent on its composition, graded vertical heterojunctions are constructed in the perovskite films with a compositional gradient, which can enhance photocarrier separation and suppress carrier recombination in the resultant PSCs. Under optimal fabrication conditions, the Sn&#8211;Pb mixed PSCs show power conversion efficiency up to 22% along with excellent stability during light soaking.

         <title>Optimizing Atomic Hydrogen Desorption of Sulfur&#8208;Rich NiS1+x Cocatalyst for Boosting Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient coupling strategy of active&#8208;site&#8208;enriched regulation and electronic structure modification of active S sites is developed to simultaneously increase the active S number and weaken the strong S&#63743;Hads bonds. The designed core&#8211;shell Au@NiS1+x cocatalyst with electron&#8208;enriched S&#948;&#8722; active centers can realize the facile adsorption and desorption of atomic hydrogen, thus achieving signally boosted photocatalytic H2&#8208;evolution activity on TiO2.








Abstract
Low&#8208;cost transition&#8208;metal chalcogenides (MSx) are demonstrated to be potential candidate cocatalyst for photocatalytic H2 generation. However, their H2&#8208;generation performance is limited by insufficient quantities of exposed sulfur (S) sites and their strong bonding with adsorbed hydrogen atoms (S&#63743;Hads). To address these issues, an efficient coupling strategy of active&#8208;site&#8208;enriched regulation and electronic structure modification of active S sites is developed by rational design of core&#8211;shell Au@NiS1+x nanostructured cocatalyst. In this case, the Au@NiS1+x cocatalyst can be skillfully fabricated to synthesize the Au@NiS1+x modified TiO2 (denoted as TiO2/Au@NiS1+x) by a two&#8208;step route. Photocatalytic experiments exhibit that the resulting TiO2/Au@NiS1+x(1.7:1.3) displays a boosted H2&#8208;generation rate of 9616&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 with an apparent quantum efficiency of 46.0%&#160; at 365&#160;nm, which is 2.9 and 1.7 times the rate over TiO2/NiS1+x and TiO2/Au, respectively. In situ/ex situ XPS characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that the free&#8208;electrons of Au can transfer to sulfur&#8208;enriched NiS1+x to induce the generation of electron&#8208;enriched S&#948;&#8722; active centers, which boosts the desorption of Hads for rapid hydrogen formation via weakening the strong S&#63743;Hads bonds. Hence, an electron&#8208;enriched S&#948;&#8722;&#8208;mediated mechanism is proposed. This work delivers a universal strategy for simultaneously increasing the active site number and optimizing the binding strength between the active sites and hydrogen adsorbates.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Band Engineering by Remote Doping of Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers Leads to High&#8208;Performance IGZO/p&#8208;Si Heterostructure Photodetectors</title>

         <dc:description>
A proposed octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA)&#8208;treated indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc oxide (IGZO)/p&#8208;Si heterostructure photodetector exhibits an excellent on/off current ratio of 4 &#215; 103 and unique negative differential resistance (NDR) current behavior, after implementation with a simple annealing process. Uniformity tests using 156 photodiodes and a 20&#160;000 cycle test demonstrate the reliability of the proposed photodiode.








Abstract
Metal oxide semiconductors are of great interest for enabling advanced photodetectors. However, operational instability and the absence of an appropriate doping technique hinder practical development and commercialization. Here, a strategy is proposed to dramatically increase the conventional photodetection performance, having superior stability in operational and environmental atmospheres. By performing energy&#8208;band engineering through an octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA) self&#8208;assembled&#8208;monolayer&#8208;based doping treatment, the proposed indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc oxide (IGZO)/p&#8208;Si heterointerface devices exhibit greatly enhance the photoresponsive characteristics, including a photoswitching current ratio with a 100&#8208;fold increase, and photoresponsivity and detectivity with a 15&#8208;fold increase each. The observed ODPA doping effects are investigated through comprehensive analysis with X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). Furthermore, the proposed photodetectors, fabricated at a 4 in. wafer scale, demonstrate its excellent operation robustness with consistent performance over 237 days and 20&#160;000 testing cycles.

         <title>Plasmonic Amyloid Tactoids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid liquid crystalline tactoids consisting of gold nanorods aligned by amyloid fibrils exhibit enhanced fluorescence with polarization and wavelength sensitivity. This work demonstrates how anisotropic colloidal self&#8208;assembly couples plasmonic nanoparticles with the intrinsic photonical properties of amyloids.








Abstract
Despite their link to neurodegenerative diseases, amyloids of natural and synthetic sources can also serve as building blocks for functional materials, while possessing intrinsic photonic properties. Here, it is demonstrated that orientationally ordered amyloid fibrils exhibit polarization&#8208;dependent fluorescence, and can mechanically align rod&#8208;shaped plasmonic nanoparticles codispersed with them. The coupling between the photonic fibrils in liquid crystalline phases and the plasmonic effect of the nanoparticles leads to selective activation of plasmonic extinctions as well as enhanced fluorescence from the hybrid material. These findings are consistent with numerical simulations of the near&#8208;field plasmonic enhancement around the nanoparticles. The study provides an approach to synthesize the intrinsic photonic and mechanical properties of amyloid into functional hybrid materials, and may help improve the detection of amyloid deposits based on their enhanced intrinsic luminescence.

         <title>2D Molecular Sheets of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Ultrastable Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D molecular sheets of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks are prepared using diaminotriazole linkers to form multi&#8208;site hydrogen bonds. The product has excellent chemical stability and diminished solubility in common organic solvents, and can enable superstable sodium&#8208;ion storage for 10 000 cycles.








Abstract
There has been growing research interest in hydrogen bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) by virtue of their great structural crystallinity, large surface areas and porosity. Their potential in electrochemical applications, unfortunately, remains elusive because weak hydrogen bonds would dissociate in solution that eventually compromises the structural integrity. Herein, it is demonstrated that this issue may be overcome by designing and introducing multisite hydrogen bonding within HOFs. 2D molecular sheets are prepared using diaminotriazole as the linkers for the first time. In spite of the molecular thickness (&#8776;1 nm), they are chemically stable and mechanically robust, and have diminished solubility in most polar or nonpolar organic solvents. This solution&#8208;stable HOF exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance for Na+ ion storage. In particular, it enables an exceptional cycle life of &gt;10&#160;000 cycles at 1 A g&#8208;1, which is far superior to most other organic electrode materials. Theoretical simulations indicate that the activation barrier for the intralayer or interlayer diffusion of Na+ ions within the organic frameworks is small.

         <title>Tuning the p&#8208;Orbital Electron Structure of s&#8208;Block Metal Ca Enables a High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst of s&#8208;block metal Ca&#8208;based single atom is realized by tuning the p&#8208;orbital electron structure of Ca active centers through coordinated N and O atoms, which exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction activity and durability, superior to a series of catalysts.








Abstract
Most previous efforts are devoted to developing transition metals as electrocatalysts guided by the d&#8208;band center model. The&#160;metals&#160;of&#160;the&#160;s&#8208;block&#160;of&#160;the&#160;periodic table have so far received little attention in the application of oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). Herein, a carbon catalyst with calcium (Ca) single atom coordinated with N and O is reported, which displays exceptional ORR activities in both acidic condition (E1/2&#160;= 0.77 V,&#160;0.1 m&#160;HClO4)&#160;and alkaline condition (E1/2&#160;= 0.90 V,&#160;0.1 m&#160;KOH).&#160;The Ca&#63743;N, O/C exhibits remarkable performance in zinc&#8211;air battery with a maximum power density of 218&#160;mW cm&#8211;2, superior to a series of catalysts reported so far. X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) characterization confirms the formation of N&#8208; and O&#8208;atom&#8208;coordinated Ca in the carbon matrix. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the high catalytic activity of main&#8208;group Ca is ascribed to the fact that its p&#8208;orbital electron structure is regulated by N and O coordination so that the highest peak (EP) of the projected density of states (PDOS) for the Ca atom is moved close to the Fermi level, thereby facilitating the adsorption of ORR intermediates and electron transfer.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Traction&#8208;Triggered On&#8208;Demand Electrical Stimulation for Neuron&#8208;Like Differentiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative loop feedback strategy between cells and biominic biomaterials is proposed for cell fate modulation. A piezoelectric fibrous network with mechanical stiffness similar to that of collagen can be trigged by cell traction for on&#8208;demand electrical stimulation to promote neuron&#8208;like differentiation. This in situ on&#8208;demand electrical stimulation paves the way for smart scaffold design and future bioelectronic therapies.








Abstract
Electromechanical interaction of cells and extracellular matrix are ubiquitous in biological systems. Understanding the fundamentals of this interaction and feedback is critical to design next&#8208;generation electroactive tissue engineering scaffold. Herein, based on elaborately modulating the dynamic mechanical forces in cell microenvironment, the design of a smart piezoelectric scaffold with suitable stiffness analogous to that of collagen for on&#8208;demand electrical stimulation is reported. Specifically, it generated a piezoelectric potential, namely a piezopotential, to stimulate stem cell differentiation with cell traction as a loop feedback signal, thereby avoiding the unfavorable effect of early electrical stimulation on cell spreading and adhesion. This is the first time to adapt to the dynamic microenvironment of cells and meet the electrical stimulation of cells in different states by a constant scaffold, diminishing the cumbersomeness of inducing material transformation or trigging by an external stimulus. This in situ on&#8208;demand electrical stimulation based on cell&#8208;traction&#8208;mediated piezopotential paves the way for smart scaffolds design and future bioelectronic therapies.

         <title>Low&#8208;Bandgap Organic Bulk&#8208;Heterojunction Enabled Efficient and Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible hybrid solar cell with extended photoresponse, high power conversion efficiency of 21.73%, and excellent mechanical durability is realized by incorporating a low&#8208;bandgap organic bulk heterojunction layer into perovskite solar cells. Taking advantage of these impressive device performance, the flexible solar cell&#8211;sensor integrated system is demonstrated for real&#8208;time temperature monitoring via on&#8208;body evaluation.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskite and organic solar cells (PSCs and OSCs) are considered as the prime candidates currently for clean energy applications due to their solution and low&#8208;temperature processibility. Nevertheless, the substantial photon loss in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region and relatively large photovoltage deficit need to be improved to enable their uses in high&#8208;performance solar cells. To mitigate these disadvantages, low&#8208;bandgap organic bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) layer into inverted PSCs to construct facile hybrid solar cells (HSCs) is integrated. By optimizing the BHJ components, an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.80%, with a decent open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.146&#160;V and extended photoresponse over 950&#160;nm for rigid HSCs is achieved. The resultant devices also exhibit superior long&#8208;term (over 1000 h) ambient&#8208; and photostability compared to those from single&#8208;component PSCs and OSCs. More importantly, a champion PCE of 21.73% and excellent mechanical durability can also be achieved in flexible HSCs, which is the highest efficiency reported for flexible solar cells to date. Taking advantage of these impressive device performances, flexible HSCs into a power source for wearable sensors to demonstrate real&#8208;time temperature monitoring are successfully integrated.

         <title>An Axially Continuous Graphene&#8211;Copper Wire for High&#8208;Power Transmission: Thermoelectrical Characterization and Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially continuous graphene layers on microscale&#8208;diameter copper wires offer significantly enhanced thermoelectrical properties including a 450% increase in the current density breakdown limit. The application of extremely large current densities (&gt;400 000 A cm&#8722;2) through these innovative graphene&#8211;metal wires is possibly due to 224% higher surface heat dissipation, 41% higher electrical conductivity, and improved thermal stability (i.e., 41.2% lower resistivity after thermal cycles up to 450 &#176;C).








Abstract
The demand for high&#8208;power electrical transmission continues to increase with technical advances in electric vehicles, unmanned drones, portable devices, and deployable military applications. In this study, significantly enhanced electrical properties (i.e., a 450% increase in the current density breakdown limit) are demonstrated by synthesizing axially continuous graphene layers on microscale&#8208;diameter wires. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the observed enhancements, the electrical properties of pure copper wires and axially continuous graphene&#8211;copper (ACGC) wires with three different diameters are characterized while controlling the experimental conditions, including ambient temperature, gases, and pressure. The study reveals that the main mechanism that allows the application of extremely large current densities (&gt;400 000 A cm&#8722;2) through the ACGC wires is threefold: the continuous graphene layers considerably improve: 1) surface heat dissipation (224% higher), 2) electrical conductivity (41% higher), and 3) thermal stability (41.2% lower resistivity after thermal cycles up to 450&#160;&#176;C), compared with pure copper wires. In addition, it is observed, through the use of high&#8208;speed camera images, that the ACGC wires exhibit very different failure behavior near the current density limit, compared with the pure copper wires.

         <title>Unraveling Strain Gradient Induced Electromechanical Coupling in Twisted Double Bilayer Graphene Moir&#233; Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsic flexoelectricity in twisted double bilayer graphene moir&#233; superlattices is presented. First, threefold symmetric polarizations are predicated based on density function theory and finite element analysis. Then, strain&#8208;gradient&#8208;induced polarizations are captured by piezoelectric force microscopy at room temperature with superior resolution. Finally, the 180&#176; phase change is determined using vector analysis, which matches well with theoretical predication.








Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices of 2D materials with a small twist angle are thought to exhibit appreciable flexoelectric effect, though unambiguous confirmation of their flexoelectricity is challenging due to artifacts associated with commonly used piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). For example, unexpectedly small phase contrast (&#8776;8&#176;) between opposite flexoelectric polarizations is reported in twisted bilayer graphene (tBG), though theoretically predicted value is 180&#176;. Here a methodology is developed to extract intrinsic moir&#233; flexoelectricity using twisted double bilayer graphene (tDBG) as a model system, probed by lateral PFM. For small twist angle samples, it is found that a vectorial decomposition is essential to recover the small intrinsic flexoelectric response at domain walls from a large background signal. The obtained threefold symmetry of commensurate domains with significant flexoelectric response at domain walls is fully consistent with the theoretical calculations. Incommensurate domains in tDBG with relatively large twist angles can also be observed by this technique. A general strategy is provided here for unraveling intrinsic flexoelectricity in van der Waals moir&#233; superlattices while providing insights into engineered symmetry breaking in centrosymmetric materials.

         <title>Piezo&#8208;Photocatalysis over Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Promoting Photocatalytic Activity by Piezoelectric Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two isostructural metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with distinctly different piezoelectric responses are used in piezo&#8208;photocatalysis. Remarkably, the H2 production efficiency of Hf&#8208;MOF is 2.2 times that of Zr&#8208;MOF under simultaneous light and ultrasonic irradiation. The role of the piezoelectric effect can be distinguished owing to their similar pore features and mass transfer behaviors.








Abstract
The built&#8208;in electric field can be generated in the piezoelectric materials under mechanical stress. The resulting piezoelectric effect is beneficial to charge separation in photocatalysis. Meanwhile, the mechanical stress usually gives rise to accelerated mass transfer and enhanced catalytic activity. Unfortunately, it remains a challenge to differentiate the contribution of these two factors to catalytic performance. Herein, for the first time, isostructural metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), i.e., UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2(Zr) and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2(Hf), are adopted for piezo&#8208;photocatalysis. Both MOFs, featuring the same structures except for diverse Zr/Hf&#8208;oxo clusters, possess distinctly different piezoelectric properties. Strikingly, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2(Hf) exhibits &#8776;2.2 times of activity compared with that of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2(Zr) under simultaneous light and ultrasonic irradiation, though both MOFs display similar activity in the photocatalytic H2 production without ultrasonic irradiation. Given their similar pore features and mass transfer behaviors, the activity difference is unambiguously assignable to the piezoelectric effect. As a result, the contributions of the piezoelectric effect to the piezo&#8208;photocatalysis can be clearly distinguished owing to the stronger piezoelectric property of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2(Hf).

         <title>A Transparent, Highly Stretchable, Solvent&#8208;Resistant, Recyclable Multifunctional Ionogel with Underwater Self&#8208;Healing and Adhesion for Reliable Strain Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A physically crosslinked multifunctional ionogel is designed and prepared via a simple one&#8208;step photoinitiated polymerization of a fluorinated monomer and a hydrogen bond enabling comonomer in a hydrophobic ionic liquid. The ionogels possess excellent comprehensive performance, including high transparency, robust mechanical properties, self&#8208;healing and self&#8208;adhesion in air/underwater, easy recyclability, solvent tolerance, and sensitive and reliable strain sensing.








Abstract
Ionogels have gained increasing attentions as a flexible conductive material. However, it remains a big challenge to integrate multiple functions into one gel that can be widely applied in various complex scenes. Herein, a kind of multifunctional ionogels with a combination of desirable properties, including transparency, high stretchability, solvent and temperature resistance, recyclability, high conductivity, underwater self&#8208;healing ability, and underwater adhesiveness is reported. The ionogels are prepared via one&#8208;step photoinitiated polymerization of 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl acrylate and acrylamide in a hydrophobic ionic liquid. The abundant noncovalent interactions including hydrogen bonding and ion&#8211;dipole interactions endow the ionogels with excellent mechanical strength, resilience, and rapid self&#8208;healing capability at room temperature, while the fluorine&#8208;rich polymeric matrix brings in high tolerance against water and various organic solvents, as well as tough underwater adhesion on different substrates. Wearable strain sensors based on the ionogels can sensitively detect and differentiate large body motions, such as bending of limbs, walking and jumping, as well as subtle muscle movements, such as pronunciation and pulse. It is believed that the designed ionogels will show great promises in wearable devices and ionotronics.

         <title>Conversion&#8208;Type Nonmetal Elemental Tellurium Anode with High Utilization for Mild/Alkaline Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tellurium (Te), a new conversion&#8208;type anode for zinc&#8208;ion batteries is developed, which is compatible in both mild and alkaline electrolytes. The as&#8208;assembled mild Te/MnO2 and alkaline Te/Ni(OH)2 cells thoroughly eliminate the dendrites and gassing issues in common zinc batteries, which deliver remarkable capacities, long cycling life, and high energy density with a high utilization of anode.








Abstract
Zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), generally established on an excessive metallic Zn anode and aqueous electrolytes, suffer from severe dendrites and gassing issues at Zn side, resulting in poor cycling life. Substituting Zn metal anode with non&#8208;Zn ones is a promising strategy for solving these problems, whereas this is still restricted by the limited anode alternatives. Herein, by replacing metal Zn with chalcogen element tellurium (Te), a conversion&#8208;type Te&#8208;based ZIB is reported that can work in both mild and alkaline electrolytes. As expected, the as&#8208;assembled mild Te/MnO2 and alkaline Te/Ni(OH)2 cells deliver remarkable capacities up to 106 and 161&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1anode+cathode, respectively, with a high utilization of anode (50.1% for the Te/MnO2 and 38.9% for the Te/Ni(OH)2), which surpass all ZIBs. Ultralong cycling life (over 75% capacity retention after 5000 cycles) is achieved in the two systems, benefiting from the stable conversion mechanisms (mild: Te to ZnTe2 to ZnTe; alkaline: ZnTe to Te to TeO2) with thoroughly eliminated dendrites and gassing. Moreover, high gravimetric energy density of ZIBs is also achieved, which are 176.3&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1anode+cathdoe (Te/Ni(OH)2) and 81&#160;Wh&#160;Kg&#8722;1anode+cathode (Te/MnO2), respectively. This work sheds light on the development of advanced conversion&#8208;type anode for high&#8208;performance batteries with superior stability.

         <title>Mechanistic Probing of Encapsulation and Confined Growth of Lithium Crystals in Carbonaceous Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium encapsulation and its confined growth kinetics in amorphous carbon nanotubes (aCNTs) are studied using in situ transmission electron microscopy. The carbon shells play dual roles, providing geometric/mechanical constraints and electron/ion transport channels, which profoundly alter the Li growth patterns, resulting in unusual Li nanostructures. Importantly, it is revealed that sufficient nitrogen/oxygen doping is critical for aCNTs to reliably encapsulate lithium.








Abstract
Encapsulation of lithium in the confined spaces within individual nanocapsules is intriguing and highly desirable for developing high&#8208;performance Li metal anodes. This work aims for a mechanistic understanding of Li encapsulation and its confined growth kinetics inside 1D enclosed spaces. To achieve this, amorphous carbon nanotubes are employed as a model host using in situ transmission electron microscopy. The carbon shells have dual roles, providing geometric/mechanical constraints and electron/ion transport channels, which profoundly alter the Li growth patterns. Li growth/dissolution takes place via atom addition/removal at the free surfaces through Li+ diffusion along the shells in the electric field direction, resulting in the formation of unusual Li structures, such as poly&#8208;crystalline nanowires and free&#8208;standing 2D ultrathin (1&#8211;2&#160;nm) Li membranes. Such confined front&#8208;growth processes are dominated by Li {110} or {200} growing faces, distinct from the root growth of single&#8208;crystal Li dendrites outside the nanotubes. Controlled experiments show that high lithiophilicity/permeability, enabled by sufficient nitrogen/oxygen doping or pre&#8208;lithiation, is critical for the stable encapsulation of lithium inside carbonaceous nanocapsules. First&#8208;principles&#8208;based calculations reveal that N/O doping can reduce the diffusion barrier for Li+ penetration, and facilitate Li filling driven by energy minimization associated with the formation of low&#8208;energy Li/C interfaces.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Droplet Electricity Generator Achieves an Ultrahigh Output Over 100&#160;V Without Pre&#8208;Charging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A droplet electricity generator (DEG) combining interfacial effect and switch effect is proposed to achieve an ultrahigh output without pre&#8208;charging, and the working mechanism is explained based on an equivalent circuit model. Compared with traditional electrostatic induction (TEI) electricity generation, the output is directly improved by two orders of magnitude, which provides insightful perspective and lays a solid foundation for large&#8208;scale DEG applications.








Abstract
The working principle of the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), contact electrification and electrostatic induction, has been used to harvest raindrop energy in recent years. However, the existing research is mainly concentrated on solid&#8211;liquid electrification, and adopts traditional electrostatic induction (TEI) for output. As a result, the efficiency of droplet electricity generators (DEGs) is severely constrained. Therefore, previous studies deem that the DEG output is limited by interfacial effects. This study reveals that this view is inappropriate and, in reality, the output strategy is the key bottleneck restricting the DEG performance. Here, a switch effect based on an electric&#8208;double&#8208;layer capacitor (EDLC) is introduced, and an equivalent circuit model is established to understand its working mechanism. Without pre&#8208;charging, a single droplet can generate high voltage over 100&#160;V and the output is directly improved by two&#8208;orders of magnitude compared with TEI, which is precisely utilizing the interfacial effect. This work provides insightful perspective and lays solid foundation for DEG applications in large scale.

         <title>Utilizing the Built&#8208;in Electric Field of p&#8211;n Junctions to Spatially Propel the Stepwise Polysulfide Conversion in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel hierarchical and defect&#8208;rich Co3O4/TiO2 p&#8211;n junctions with built&#8208;in electric field are designed as the host materials of sulfur electrodes for Li&#8211;S batteries. The elaborate p&#8211;n junctions not only induce the directional migration of lithium polysulfides to suppress the dissolution of sulfur intermediates into the electrolyte but also implement the spatially sequential catalysis to ensure the superior utilization of sulfur.








Abstract
Integrating sulfur cathodes with effective catalysts to accelerate polysulfide conversion is a suitable way for overcoming the serious shuttling and sluggish conversion of polysulfides in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. However, because of the sharp differences in the redox reaction kinetics and complicated phase transformation of sulfur, a single&#8208;component catalyst cannot consistently accelerate the entire redox process. Herein, hierarchical and defect&#8208;rich Co3O4/TiO2 p&#8211;n junctions (p&#8208;Co3O4/n&#8208;TiO2&#8208;HPs) are fabricated to implement the sequential catalysis of S8(solid)&#160;&#8594; Li2S4(liquid)&#160;&#8594; Li2S(solid). Co3O4 sheets physiochemically immobilize the pristine sulfur and ensure the rapid reduction of S8 to Li2S4, while TiO2 dots realize the effective precipitation of Li2S, bridged by the directional migration of polysulfides from p&#8208;type Co3O4 to n&#8208;type TiO2 attributed to the interfacial built&#8208;in electric field. As a result, the sulfur cathode coupled with p&#8208;Co3O4/n&#8208;TiO2&#8208;HPs delivers long&#8208;term cycling stability with a low capacity decay of 0.07% per cycle after 500 cycles at 10 C. This study demonstrates the synergistic effect of the built&#8208;in electric field and heterostructures in spatially enhancing the stepwise conversion of polysulfides, which provides novel insights into the interfacial architecture for rationally regulating the polysulfide redox reactions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating sulfur cathodes with effective catalysts to accelerate polysulfide conversion is a suitable way for overcoming the serious shuttling and sluggish conversion of polysulfides in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. However, because of the sharp differences in the redox reaction kinetics and complicated phase transformation of sulfur, a single-component catalyst cannot consistently accelerate the entire redox process. Herein, hierarchical and defect-rich Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; p&#8211;n junctions (p-Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/n-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-HPs) are fabricated to implement the sequential catalysis of S&lt;sub&gt;8(solid)&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;&#8594; Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4(liquid)&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;&#8594; Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;(solid)&lt;/sub&gt;. Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sheets physiochemically immobilize the pristine sulfur and ensure the rapid reduction of S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; to Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, while TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dots realize the effective precipitation of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, bridged by the directional migration of polysulfides from p-type Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to n-type TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; attributed to the interfacial built-in electric field.

         <title>Realization of an Artificial Visual Nervous System using an Integrated Optoelectronic Device Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sol&#8211;gel&#8208;derived neurotransistors integrated with perovskite&#8208;based photodetectors are designed to serve as an artificial optoelectronic device array, which experimentally demonstrates the emulation of the dynamic adaptation process of the biological visual nervous system. The fundamental properties of biological adaptation, such as accuracy and desensitization behaviors, are characterized. These results enable post&#8208;synaptic responses to be manipulated to obtain external&#8208;environment&#8208;dependent encoded images.








Abstract
Human behavior (e.g., the response to any incoming information) has very complex forms and is based on the response to consecutive external stimuli entering varied sensory receptors. Sensory adaptation is an elementary form of the sensory nervous system known to filter out irrelevant information for efficient information transfer from consecutive stimuli. As bioinspired neuromorphic electronic system is developed, the functionality of organs shall be emulated at a higher level than the cell. Because it is important for electronic devices to possess sensory adaptation in spiking neural networks, the authors demonstrate a dynamic, real&#8208;time, photoadaptation process to optical irradiation when repeated light stimuli are presented to the artificial photoreceptor. The filtered electrical signal generated by the light and the adapting signal produces a specific range of postsynaptic states through the neurotransistor, demonstrating changes in the response according to the environment, as normally perceived by the human brain. This successfully demonstrates plausible biological sensory adaptation. Further, the ability of this circuit design to accommodate changes in the intensity of bright or dark light by adjusting the sensitivity of the artificial photoreceptor is demonstrated. Thus, the proposed artificial photoreceptor circuits have the potential to advance neuromorphic device technology by providing sensory adaptation capabilities.

         <title>Quantifying Anionic Diffusion in 2D Halide Perovskite Lateral Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of 2D and quasi&#8208;2D halide perovskite lateral heterostructures is synthesized, and the platform is utilized to analyze the impact of organic cation and inorganic layer thickness on bromide&#8211;iodide interdiffusion kinetics. This quantitative halide diffusion study on perovskites will aid in driving future innovations toward novel material design and optoelectronic device applications.








Abstract
Anionic diffusion strongly impacts the stability of halide perovskite materials, but it is still not well understood. Here, a quantitative investigation of in&#8208;plane thermally driven anionic inter&#8208;diffusion in a series of novel 2D and quasi&#8208;2D halide perovskites lateral heterostructures is reported. The calculated diffusion coefficients (D) reveal the inhibition of Br&#8211;I inter&#8208;diffusion with bulky &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic cations compared with short&#8208;chain aliphatic organic cations. Furthermore, halide diffusion is found to be faster in quasi&#8208;2D (n&#160;&gt; 1) than 2D perovskites (n&#160;= 1). The increment becomes less apparent as the &#8220;n&#8221; number increases, akin to the quantum confinement effect observed for band gaps. These trends are rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations of free energy barriers for halide diffusion that reveal mechanisms for suppressing diffusion. This work provides important fundamental insights on the anionic migration and diffusion process in halide perovskite materials.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable Dion&#8722;Jacobson Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by Extended &#960;&#8208;Conjugation of Organic Spacer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic spacer, namely TTDMAI, is successfully developed as spacers for 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson perovskites. A champion efficiency of 18.82% is demonstrated due to the improved film quality and preferred crystal vertical orientation thanks to the templated grain growth by the large crystal nuclei size in the precursor solution.








Abstract
2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) perovskites have become an emerging photovoltaic material with excellent structure and environmental stability due to their lacking van der Waals gaps relative to 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites. Here, a fused&#8208;thiophene&#8208;based spacer, namely TTDMAI, is successfully developed for 2D DJ perovskite solar cells. It is found that the DJ perovskite using TTDMA spacer with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation length exhibits high film quality, large crystal size and preferred crystal vertical orientation induced by the large crystal nuclei in precursor solution, resulting in lower trap density, reduced exciton binding energy and oriented charge transport. As a result, the optimized 2D DJ perovskite device based on TTDMA (nominal n&#160;= 4) delivers a champion PCE up to 18.82%. Importantly, the unencapsulated device based on TTDMA can sustain average 99% of their original efficiency after being stored in N2 for 4400 h (over 6 months). Moreover, light, thermal, environmental and operational stabilities are also significantly improved in comparison with their 3D counterparts.

         <title>A Bioinspired Adhesive&#8208;Integrated&#8208;Agent Strategy for Constructing Robust Gas&#8208;Sensing Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adhesive&#8208;integrated&#8208;agent strategy enabled by integrating the adhesive unit with a gas&#8208;sensing unit into one chemistry entity for constructing ultrarobust gas sensors to essentially solve the challenge of sensor stability at the molecular level is proposed. The fabricated sensors possess extremely strong interfacial adhesion and efficient gas sensitivity for outputting stable and reliable sensing signals even under harsh conditions.








Abstract
Gas sensors based on organic molecules are attractive for their tailored molecular structures and controllable functions, but weak interfacial adhesion between sensing materials and supporting substrates has severely hampered their practical applications, particularly in harsh environments. Here, inspired by the combined anchoring&#8208;recognizing feature of natural olfactory systems, an adhesive&#8208;integrated&#8208;agent strategy to integrate the adhesive unit (poly(dimethylsiloxane)) with the sensing unit (organoplatinum(II)) into one chemistry entity, creating robust and sensitive nanobelt array gas sensors is demonstrated. Systematic theoretical and experimental studies reveal that incorporating adhesive units significantly enhances the interfacial adhesion of the array sensors and gas&#8208;bridged super&#8208;exchange electronic couplings of sensing units ensure their efficient gas&#8208;sensing performance. The high shear strength of &#8776;7.05 &#215; 106 N m&#8722;2 allows these arrays to resist aggressive ultrasonication, tape peeling, or repeated bending without compromising their sensing performance. This molecular engineering strategy opens a new guideline to develop robust gas sensors.

Systematic theoretical and experimental studies reveal that incorporating adhesive units significantly enhances the interfacial adhesion of the array sensors and gas-bridged super-exchange electronic couplings of sensing units ensure their efficient gas-sensing performance. The high shear strength of &#8776;7.05 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; N m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; allows these arrays to resist aggressive ultrasonication, tape peeling, or repeated bending without compromising their sensing performance. This molecular engineering strategy opens a new guideline to develop robust gas sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functionalized Iron&#8211;Nitrogen&#8211;Carbon Electrocatalyst Provides a Reversible Electron Transfer Platform for Efficient Uranium Extraction from Seawater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel adsorption&#8211;electrocatalysis system is developed for efficiently extracting uranium from seawater. Amidoxime groups impart Fe&#8211;Nx&#8211;C&#8211;R with hydrophilicity and a high binding affinity for uranyl ions, whilst the iron sites provides a reversible electron&#8208;transfer platform for the eventual production of Na2O(UO3&#183;H2O)x in the presence of Na+, thus allowing facile uranium recovery and Fe&#8211;Nx&#8211;C&#8211;R reuse.








Abstract
Uranium extraction from seawater provides an opportunity for sustainable fuel supply to nuclear power plants. Herein, an adsorption&#8211;electrocatalysis strategy is demonstrated for efficient uranium extraction from seawater using a functionalized iron&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (Fe&#8211;Nx&#8211;C&#8211;R) catalyst, comprising N&#8208;doped carbon capsules supporting FeNx single&#8208;atom sites and surface chelating amidoxime groups (R). The amidoxime groups bring hydrophilicity to the adsorbent and offer surface&#8208;specific binding sites for UO22+ capture. The site&#8208;isolated FeNx centres reduce adsorbed UO22+ to UO2+. Subsequently, through electrochemical reduction of the FeNx sites, unstable U(V) ions are reoxidized to U(VI) in the presence of Na+ resulting in the generation of solid Na2O(UO3&#183;H2O)x, which can easily be collected. Fe&#8211;Nx&#8211;C&#8211;R reduced the uranium concentration in seawater from &#8776;3.5 ppb to below 0.5 ppb with a calculated capacity of &#8776;1.2 mg g&#8208;1 within 24 h. To the best of the knowledge, the developed system is the first to use the adsorption of uranyl ions and electrodeposition of solid Na2O(UO3.H2O)x for the extraction of uranium from seawater. The important discoveries guide technology development for the efficient extraction of uranium from seawater.

         <title>Dynamic Nanoconfinement Enabled Highly Stretchable and Supratough Polymeric Materials with Desirable Healability and Biocompatibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the nanoconfinement effect of &#946;&#8208;sheet crystalline in spider silk, highly stretchable, supratough yet strong polymer nanocomposites are developed through creating dynamic H&#8208;bonded nanoconfinement. As&#8208;fabricated polymer nanocomposite film demonstrates a world&#8208;record toughness of 425 (&#177;31)&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8211;3 and a large break strain of 550%, which holds great promise for industrial applications, such as tissue engineering.








Abstract
Lightweight polymeric materials are highly attractive platforms for many potential industrial applications in aerospace, soft robots, and biological engineering fields. For these real&#8208;world applications, it is vital for them to exhibit a desirable combination of great toughness, large ductility, and high strength together with desired healability and biocompatibility. However, existing material design strategies usually fail to achieve such a performance portfolio owing to their different and even mutually exclusive governing mechanisms. To overcome these hurdles, herein, for the first time a dynamic hydrogen&#8208;bonded nanoconfinement concept is proposed, and the design of highly stretchable and supratough biocompatible poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) with well&#8208;dispersed dynamic nanoconfinement phases induced by hydrogen&#8208;bond (H&#8208;bond) crosslinking is demonstrated. Because of H&#8208;bond crosslinking and dynamic nanoconfinement, the as&#8208;prepared PVA nanocomposite film exhibits a world&#8208;record toughness of 425&#160;&#177; 31&#160;MJ m&#8722;3 in combination with a tensile strength of 98&#160;MPa and a large break strain of 550%, representing the best of its kind and even outperforming most natural and artificial materials. In addition, the final polymer exhibits a good self&#8208;healing ability and biocompatibility. This work affords new opportunities for creating mechanically robust, healable, and biocompatible polymeric materials, which hold great promise for applications, such as soft robots and artificial ligaments.

         <title>Compensating Electronic Effect Enables Fast Site&#8208;to&#8208;Site Electron Transfer over Ultrathin RuMn Nanosheet Branches toward Highly Electroactive and Stable Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast site&#8208;to&#8208;site electron transfer is achieved over ultrathin Mn&#8208;doped Ru nanosheet branches due to the compensating electronic effect. Benefiting from the electronic modification and structural merits, high electroactivity, and durable stability for overall water splitting in acidic media are realized for the Mn&#8208;doped Ru nanosheet branches.








Abstract
To improve the electroactivity and stability of electrocatalysts, various modulation strategies have been applied in nanocatalysts. Among different methods, heteroatom doping has been considered as an effective method, which modifies the local bonding environments and the electronic structures. Meanwhile, the design of novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanostructures also offers new opportunities for achieving efficient electrocatalysts. In this work, Mn&#8208;doped ultrathin Ru nanosheet branches (RuMn NSBs), a newly reported 2D nanostructure, is synthesized. With the ultrathin and naturally abundant edges, the RuMn NSBs have exhibited bifunctionalities of hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction with high electroactivity and durability in different electrolytes. Experimental characterizations have revealed that Ru&#63743;O bonds are shortened due to Mn doping, which is the key factor that leads to improved electrochemical performances. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have confirmed that the introduction of Mn enables flexible modulations on the valence states of Ru sites. The inversed redox state evolutions of Ru and Mn sites not only improve the electroactivity for the water splitting but also the long&#8208;term stability due to the pinning effect of Ru sites. This work has provided important inspirations for the design of future advanced Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts with high performances and durability.

         <title>Large Tunneling Magnetoresistance in van der Waals Ferromagnet/Semiconductor Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large tunneling magnetoresistance is observed in all van der Waals spin valves based on a Fe3GeTe2/InSe/Fe3GeTe2 (ferromagnet/semiconductor/ferromagnet) heterojunction. Devices with the same thickness of the InSe layer reveal either a tunneling or a metallic transport behavior due to pinholes. This finding suggests opportunities for further development of this spin valve as a platform for nonvolatile memories and spin&#8208;logic applications.








Abstract
2D layered chalcogenide semiconductors have been proposed as a promising class of materials for low&#8208;dimensional electronic, optoelectronic, and spintronic devices. Here, all&#8208;2D van der Waals vertical spin&#8208;valve devices, that combine the 2D layered semiconductor InSe as a spacer with the 2D layered ferromagnetic metal Fe3GeTe2 as spin injection and detection electrodes, are reported. Two distinct transport behaviors are observed: tunneling and metallic, which are assigned to the formation of a pinhole&#8208;free tunnel barrier at the Fe3GeTe2/InSe interface and pinholes in the InSe spacer layer, respectively. For the tunneling device, a large magnetoresistance (MR) of 41% is obtained under an applied bias current of 0.1 &#181;A at 10 K, which is about three times larger than that of the metallic device. Moreover, the tunneling device exhibits a lower operating bias current but a more sensitive bias current dependence than the metallic device. The MR and spin polarization of both the metallic and tunneling devices decrease with increasing temperature, which can be fitted well by Bloch's law. These findings reveal the critical role of pinholes in the MR of all&#8208;2D van der Waals ferromagnet/semiconductor heterojunction devices.

&lt;p&gt;A large tunneling magnetoresistance is observed in all van der Waals spin valves based on a Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/InSe/Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (ferromagnet/semiconductor/ferromagnet) heterojunction. Devices with the same thickness of the InSe layer reveal either a tunneling or a metallic transport behavior due to pinholes. This finding suggests opportunities for further development of this spin valve as a platform for nonvolatile memories and spin-logic applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D layered chalcogenide semiconductors have been proposed as a promising class of materials for low-dimensional electronic, optoelectronic, and spintronic devices. Here, all-2D van der Waals vertical spin-valve devices, that combine the 2D layered semiconductor InSe as a spacer with the 2D layered ferromagnetic metal Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as spin injection and detection electrodes, are reported. Two distinct transport behaviors are observed: tunneling and metallic, which are assigned to the formation of a pinhole-free tunnel barrier at the Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/InSe interface and pinholes in the InSe spacer layer, respectively. For the tunneling device, a large magnetoresistance (MR) of 41% is obtained under an applied bias current of 0.1 &#181;A at 10 K, which is about three times larger than that of the metallic device. Moreover, the tunneling device exhibits a lower operating bias current but a more sensitive bias current dependence than the metallic device. The MR and spin polarization of both the metallic and tunneling devices decrease with increasing temperature, which can be fitted well by Bloch's law. These findings reveal the critical role of pinholes in the MR of all-2D van der Waals ferromagnet/semiconductor heterojunction devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Facile Strategy of Boosting Photothermal Conversion Efficiency through State Transformation for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy of improving photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) is presented through transforming photothermal agents from aggregated to dispersed state, where the intramolecular motions are completely liberated, allowing for supra&#8208;efficient heat generation. This state transformation can be achieved by virtue of a releasing process from nanoparticles in cancer cells, demonstrating a distinct photothermal therapeutic performance for cancer ablation.








Abstract
Improving photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) is critical to facilitate therapeutic performance during photothermal therapy (PTT). However, current strategies of prompting PCE always involve complex synthesis or modification of photothermal agents, thereby significantly inhibiting the practical applications and fundamental understanding of photothermal conversion. A facile strategy is herein present for boosting PCE by transforming photothermal agents from aggregated state to dispersed state. Compared to aggregated state, the developed photothermal agents with semiconducting nature can rotate freely in dispersed state, which allows for an efficient nonradiative dissipation through twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) effect, consequentially offering excellent photothermal performance. Noteworthy, the state transformation can be achieved by virtue of releasing photothermal molecules from nanoparticles on the basis of a pH&#8208;responsive polymer nanocarrier, and the PCE is elevated from 43% to 60% upon changing the pH values from 7.4 to 5.0. Moreover, the nanoparticle disassembly and state transformation behaviors can also smoothly proceed in lysosome of cancer cells, demonstrating a distinct photothermal therapeutic performance for cancer ablation. It is hoped that this strategy of transforming state to boost PCE would be a new platform for practical applications of PTT technique.

         <title>Elemental Topological Dirac Semimetal &#945;&#8208;Sn with High Quantum Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elemental topological Dirac semimetal &#945;&#8208;Sn is epitaxially grown with the highest quality thus far. The very high quantum mobilities in these samples allow a quantitative characterization of the nontrivial interfacial and bulk band structure of &#945;&#8208;Sn via quantum transport. The results establish &#945;&#8208;Sn as an excellent model system to study novel topological phases and device applications.








Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Sn provides an ideal avenue to investigate novel topological properties owing to its rich diagram of topological phases and simple elemental material structure. Thus far, however, the realization of high&#8208;quality&#160;&#945;&#8208;Sn remains a challenge, which limits the understanding of its quantum transport properties and device applications. Here, epitaxial growth of &#945;&#8208;Sn on InSb (001) with the highest quality thus far is presented. The studied samples exhibit unprecedentedly high quantum mobilities of both the surface state (30&#8201;000 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1), which is ten times higher than the previously reported values, and the bulk heavy&#8208;hole state (1800 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1), which is never obtained experimentally. These excellent features allow quantitative characterization of the nontrivial interfacial and bulk band structure of &#945;&#8208;Sn via a thorough investigation of Shubnikov&#8211;de Haas oscillations combined with first&#8208;principles calculations. The results firmly identify that &#945;&#8208;Sn grown on InSb (001) is a topological Dirac semimetal (TDS). Furthermore, a crossover from the TDS to a 2D topological insulator and a subsequent phase transition to a trivial insulator when varying the thickness of &#945;&#8208;Sn are demonstrated. This work indicates that &#945;&#8208;Sn is an excellent model system to study novel topological phases and a prominent material candidate for topological devices.

         <title>Suppressing High&#8208;Current&#8208;Induced Phase Separation in Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Oxides by Electrochemically Manipulating Dynamic Lithium Distribution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast&#8208;charging&#8208;induced phase&#8208;transformation pathways in a conventional Ni&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode are demonstrated to be controlled by the solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;diffusion kinetics. Electrochemical manipulation of the initial lithium concentration and distribution within a particle redirects the phase transformation of the Ni&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode and enables the solid&#8208;solution pathway during extreme fast charging.








Abstract
Understanding the cycling rate&#8208;dependent kinetics is crucial for managing the performance of batteries in high&#8208;power applications. Although high cycling rates may induce reaction heterogeneity and affect battery lifetime and capacity utilization, such phase transformation dynamics are poorly understood and uncontrollable. In this study, synchrotron&#8208;based operando X&#8208;ray diffraction is performed to monitor the high&#8208;current&#8208;induced phase transformation kinetics of LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2. The sluggish Li diffusion at high Li content induces different phase transformations during charging and discharging, with strong phase separation and homogeneous phase transformation during charging and discharging, respectively. Moreover, by exploiting the dependence of Li diffusivity on the Li content and electrochemically tuning the initial Li content and distribution, phase separation pathway can be redirected to solid solution kinetics at a high charging rate of 7 C. Finite element analysis further elucidates the effect of the Li&#8208;content&#8208;dependent diffusion kinetics on the phase transformation pathway. The findings suggest a new direction for optimizing fast&#8208;cycling protocols based on the intrinsic properties of the materials.

         <title>2D Piezoelectric Bi2MoO6 Nanoribbons for GSH&#8208;Enhanced Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
As&#8208;constructed Bi2MoO6&#8211;poly(ethylene glycol) (BMO&#8208;PEG) nanoribbons (NRs) with piezoelectric properties provide a double&#8208;upgrading sonodynamic therapy. The BMO NRs consume endogenous glutathione (GSH) to disrupt redox homeostasis. Furthermore, it is discovered that the GSH&#8208;activated BMO NRs indicate a higher ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered reactive oxygen species generation efficiency owing to internal oxygen defects, which predominantly traps electrons to delay the recombination of e&#8722;&#8211;h+ pairs. Unlike conventional sonosensitizers, ultrathin GSH&#8208;activated BMO NRs are piezoelectric, which can maximize the use of US energy to induce polarization, thereby facilitating e&#8722;&#8211;h+ separation and improving the efficiency of sonodynamic therapy.








Abstract
Reducing the scavenging capacity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and elevating ROS production are two primary goals of developing novel sonosensitizers for sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Hence, ultrathin 2D Bi2MoO6&#8211;poly(ethylene glycol) nanoribbons (BMO NRs) are designed as piezoelectric sonosensitizers for glutathione (GSH)&#8208;enhanced SDT. In cancer cells, BMO NRs can consume endogenous GSH to disrupt redox homeostasis, and the GSH&#8208;activated BMO NRs (GBMO) exhibit an oxygen&#8208;deficient structure, which can promote the separation of electron&#8211;hole pairs, thereby enhancing the efficiency of ROS production in SDT. The ultrathin GBMO NRs are piezoelectric, in which ultrasonic waves introduce mechanical strain to the nanoribbons, resulting in piezoelectric polarization and band tilting, thus accelerating toxic ROS production. The as&#8208;synthesized BMO NRs enable excellent computed tomography imaging of tumors and significant tumor suppression in vitro and in vivo. A piezoelectric Bi2MoO6 sonosensitizer&#8208;mediated two&#8208;step enhancement SDT process, which is activated by endogenous GSH and amplified by exogenous ultrasound, is proposed. This process not only provides new options for improving SDT but also broadens the application of 2D piezoelectric materials as sonosensitizers in SDT.

In cancer cells, BMO NRs can consume endogenous GSH to disrupt redox homeostasis, and the GSH-activated BMO NRs (GBMO) exhibit an oxygen-deficient structure, which can promote the separation of electron&#8211;hole pairs, thereby enhancing the efficiency of ROS production in SDT. The ultrathin GBMO NRs are piezoelectric, in which ultrasonic waves introduce mechanical strain to the nanoribbons, resulting in piezoelectric polarization and band tilting, thus accelerating toxic ROS production. The as-synthesized BMO NRs enable excellent computed tomography imaging of tumors and significant tumor suppression in vitro and in vivo. A piezoelectric Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MoO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; sonosensitizer-mediated two-step enhancement SDT process, which is activated by endogenous GSH and amplified by exogenous ultrasound, is proposed. This process not only provides new options for improving SDT but also broadens the application of 2D piezoelectric materials as sonosensitizers in SDT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deep&#8208;Red Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on One&#8208;Step&#8208;Formed &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3 Cuboid Crystallites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile one&#8208;step method to in situ deposit &#947;&#8208;phase 3D CsPbI3 films consisting of cuboid crystallites is achieved by introducing 1,3&#8208;propanediamine dihydriodide (PDAI). The PDAI&#8211;perovskite light&#8208;emitting diode (PeLED) can reach a record efficiency of 15.03% for 3D CsPbI3 PeLEDs and a peak efficiency of 10.30% of a 9 cm2 PeLED.








Abstract
Inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite with high chemical stability is attractive for efficient deep&#8208;red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with high color purity. Compared to PeLEDs based on ex&#8208;situ&#8208;synthesized CsPbI3 nanocrystals/quantum dots suffering from low conductivity and efficiency droop under high current densities, in situ deposited 3D CsPbI3 films from precursor solutions can maintain high conductivity but show high trap density. Here, it is demonstrated that introducing diammonium iodide can increase the size of colloids in the precursor solution, retard the phase&#8208;transition rate, and passivate trap states of the in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed cuboid crystallites. The PeLED based on the one&#8208;step&#8208;formed 3D CsPbI3 cuboid crystallite films shows a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) value up to 15.03% because of the high conductivity and reduced trap states. Furthermore, this one&#8208;step method also has a wide processing window, which is attractive for flow&#8208;line production of large&#8208;area PeLED modules. The fabrication of a 9 cm2 PeLED that exhibits a peak EQE of 10.30% is successfully demonstrated.

         <title>Corrosion Resistance of Sulfur&#8211;Selenium Alloy Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8211;Se is demonstrated as a universal anticorrosive coating, which is easily processed, mechanically robust, and effective in biotic and abiotic environments. S&#8211;Se coatings are effective due to their unique combination of properties, including insulating and impermeable nature, viscoelasticity, and intrinsic antimicrobial properties. The coating also exhibits an ability to recover defects and damage with minimal intervention.








Abstract
Despite decades of research, metallic corrosion remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in many engineering applications. Specifically, designing a material that can resist corrosion both in abiotic as well as biotic environments remains elusive. Here a lightweight sulfur&#8211;selenium (S&#8211;Se) alloy is designed with high stiffness and ductility that can serve as an excellent corrosion&#8208;resistant coating with protection efficiency of &#8776;99.9% for steel in a wide range of diverse environments. S&#8211;Se coated mild steel shows a corrosion rate that is 6&#8211;7 orders of magnitude lower than bare metal in abiotic (simulated seawater and sodium sulfate solution) and biotic (sulfate&#8208;reducing bacterial medium) environments. The coating is strongly adhesive, mechanically robust, and demonstrates excellent damage/deformation recovery properties, which provide the added advantage of significantly reducing the probability of a defect being generated and sustained in the coating, thus improving its longevity. The high corrosion resistance of the alloy is attributed in diverse environments to its semicrystalline, nonporous, antimicrobial, and viscoelastic nature with superior mechanical performance, enabling it to successfully block a variety of diffusing species.

A cost&#8208;efficient, high&#8208;performance piezo&#8208;electrocatalytic sensor is designed for detecting l&#8208;ascorbic acid (AA), a critical chemical for many organisms, metabolic processes, and medical treatments. The electrocatalytic efficacy of AA is significantly boosted by the piezoelectric polarization induced in nanostructured semiconducting zinc oxide catalysts.








Abstract
Nanostructured piezoelectric semiconductors offer unprecedented opportunities for high&#8208;performance sensing in numerous catalytic processes of biomedical, pharmaceutical, and agricultural interests, leveraging piezocatalysis that enhances the catalytic efficiency with the strain&#8208;induced piezoelectric field. Here, a cost&#8208;efficient, high&#8208;performance piezo&#8208;electrocatalytic sensor for detecting l&#8208;ascorbic acid (AA), a critical chemical for many organisms, metabolic processes, and medical treatments, is designed and demonstrated. Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods and nanosheets are prepared to characterize and compare their efficacy for the piezo&#8208;electrocatalysis of AA. The electrocatalytic efficacy of AA is significantly boosted by the piezoelectric polarization induced in the nanostructured semiconducting ZnO catalysts. The charge transfer between the strained ZnO nanostructures and AA is elucidated to reveal the mechanism for the related piezo&#8208;electrocatalytic process. The low&#8208;temperature synthesis of high&#8208;quality ZnO nanostructures allows low&#8208;cost, scalable production, and integration directly into wearable electrocatalytic sensors whose performance can be boosted by otherwise wasted mechanical energy from the working environment, for example, human&#8208;generated mechanical signals.

         <title>Elastomeric Nanodielectrics for Soft and Hysteresis&#8208;Free Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elastomeric nanodielectrics are fabricated by the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of oppositely charged polyurethanes in aqueous solutions, showing high area capacitances, low leakage currents, high humidity immunity, and low densities of charge traps. These robust nanodielectrics are demonstrated in stretchable capacitors and flexible low&#8208;voltage and hysteresis&#8208;free field&#8208;effect transistors with uniform performance and fatigue resistance.








Abstract
Elastomeric dielectrics are crucial for reliably governing the carrier densities in semiconducting channels during deformation in soft/stretchable field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). Uncontrolled stacking of polymeric chains renders elastomeric dielectrics poorly insulated at nanoscale thicknesses, thereby thick films are usually required, leading to high voltage or power consumption for on/off operations of FETs. Here, layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly is exploited to build 15&#8208;nm&#8208;thick elastomeric nanodielectrics through alternative adsorption of oppositely charged polyurethanes (PUs) for soft and hysteresis&#8208;free FETs. After mild thermal annealing to heal pinholes, such PU multilayers offer high areal capacitances of 237&#160;nF cm&#8722;2 and low leakage current densities of 3.2 &#215; 10&#8722;8 A cm&#8722;2 at 2&#160;V. Owing to the intrinsic ductility of the elastomeric PUs, the nanofilms possess excellent dielectric properties at a strain of 5% or a bending radius of 1.5&#160;mm, while the wrinkled counterparts show mechanical stability with negligible changes of leakage currents after repeated stretching to a strain of 50%. Besides, these nanodielectrics are immune to high humidity and conserve their properties when immersed into water, despite their assembly occurs aqueously. Furthermore, the PU dielectrics are implemented in carbon nanotube FETs, demonstrating low&#8208;voltage operations (&lt; 1.5&#160;V) and negligible hysteresis without any encapsulations.

         <title>Controllable Nonclassical Conductance Switching in Nanoscale Phase&#8208;Separated (PbI2)1&#8722;x(BiI3)x Layered Crystals</title>

The combination of 2D semiconductors PbI2 and BiI3 unveils nonlinear electronic behavior. The behavior manifests in a &#8220;switch&#8208;like&#8221; fashion yielding &#8220;on&#8221; and &#8220;off&#8221; type states. This behavior is found to arise from phase&#8208;boundary formation induced by minute lattice&#8208;parameter differences. An ionic transport mechanism to describe the origin of this novel behavior is proposed.








Abstract
Layered 2D (PbI2)1&#8722;x(BiI3)x materials exhibit a nonlinear dependence in structural and charge transport properties unanticipated from the combination of PbI2 and BiI3. Within (PbI2)1&#8722;x(BiI3)x crystals, phase integration yields deceptive structural features, while phase boundary separation leads to new conductance switching behavior observed as large peaks in current during current&#8211;voltage (I&#8211;V) measurements (&#177;100&#160;V). Temperature&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent electrical measurements demonstrate that the behavior is attributed to ionic transport perpendicular to the layers. High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy reveals that the structure of (PbI2)1&#8722;x(BiI3)x is a &#8220;brick wall&#8221; consisting of two phases, Pb&#8208;rich and Bi&#8208;rich. These brick&#8208;like features are 10s nm a side and it is posited that iodide ion transport at the interfaces of these regions is responsible for the conductance switching action.

         <title>Guiding Drug Through Interrupted Bloodstream for Potentiated Thrombolysis by C&#8208;Shaped Magnetic Actuation System In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manipulation of magnetic nanoparticle swarms (MNSs) for thrombolysis is validated in in vivo experiments with an autonomously developed C&#8208;shaped magnetic actuation system. Accompanied by the locomotion of MNSs, a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) can be transported along with the swarms through the interrupted bloodstream to the clots, thus improving the thrombolysis efficacy and quickly opening a channel for achieving time&#8208;critical recanalization.








Abstract
Fast and effective thrombolysis using tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is limited by the poor delivery efficiency of thrombolytic drugs, which is induced by an interrupted bloodstream and delayed recanalization. Existing magnetic micro/nanodrug&#8208;loaded robots used for targeted thrombotic therapy are limited by the complexity of the clinical verification of nanodrugs and the limited space of magnetic actuation systems. Herein, a general drug delivery strategy based on mass transportation theory for thrombolysis is presented, and an open space C&#8208;shaped magnetic actuation system with laser location and ultrasound imaging navigation for in vivo evaluation is developed. tPA can be guided through an interrupted bloodstream to the thrombi by the locomotion of magnetic nanoparticle swarms (MNSs), thereby improving the thrombolysis efficacy. Notably, this strategy is able to quickly establish a life channel to achieve time&#8208;critical recanalization, which is typically inaccessible using native tPA. Both in vitro and in vivo thrombolysis experiments demonstrate that the thrombus lysis efficacy significantly increases after the application of the MNS under a rotating magnetic field. This study provides an anticipated C&#8208;shaped magnetic actuation system for in vivo validation and also presents a clinically feasible drug delivery strategy for targeted thrombolytic therapy with minimal systemic tPA exposure.

         <title>Predictably Engineering the Viscoelastic Behavior of Dynamic Hydrogels via Correlation with Molecular Parameters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular parameters of dynamic covalent hydrogels are independently varied to investigate their effects on the viscoelastic behavior of hydrogels. Universal correlations are identified to quantitatively predict the viscoelastic properties of dynamic hydrogels with different network topologies based on the exchange rate of crosslinks and the number of effective crosslinks per polymer chain.








Abstract
Rational design of dynamic hydrogels with desirable viscoelastic behaviors relies on an in&#8208;depth understanding of the principles correlating molecular parameters and macroscopic properties. To quantitatively elucidate such principles, a series of dynamic covalent hydrogels crosslinked via hydrazone bonds is designed. The exchange rate of the hydrazone bond is tuned by varying the concentration of an organic catalyst, while maintaining the crosslinking density unchanged. This strategy of independently tuning exchange dynamics of crosslinks and crosslinking density allows unambiguous analysis of the viscoelastic response of the dynamic hydrogels as a function of their network parameters. It is found that the terminal relaxation time of the dynamic hydrogels is primarily determined by two factors: the exchange rate of crosslinks and the number of effective crosslinks per polymer chain, and is independent of the network architecture. Furthermore, a universal correlation is identified between the terminal relaxation time determined from stress relaxation and the exchange rate determined via reaction kinetics, which can be generalized to any viscoelastic hydrogel network, in principle. This quantitative correlation facilitates the development of dynamic hydrogels with a variable desired viscoelastic response based on molecular design.

         <title>Inverse Domain&#8208;Size Dependence of Piezoelectricity in Ferroelectric Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theoretical simulation reveals that the piezoelectricity of ferroelectric crystals does not necessarily increase with smaller domain size as conventionally believed. A simple thermodynamic model applicable to ferroelectrics of arbitrary symmetry is proposed to guide the design of high&#8208;performance piezoelectrics.








Abstract
Piezoelectricity of ferroelectric crystals is widely utilized in electromechanical devices such as sensors and actuators. It is broadly believed that the smaller the ferroelectric domain size, the higher the piezoelectricity, arising from the commonly assumed larger contributions from the domain walls. Herein, the domain&#8208;size dependence of piezoelectric coefficients of prototypical ferroelectric crystals is theoretically studied based on thermodynamic analysis and phase&#8208;field simulations. It is revealed that the inverse domain&#8208;size effect, i.e., the larger the domain size, the higher the piezoelectricity, is entirely possible and can be just as common. The nature of the domain&#8208;size dependence of piezoelectricity is shown to be determined by the propensity of polarization rotation inside the domains instead of the domain wall contributions. A simple, unified, analytical model for predicting the domain&#8208;size dependence of piezoelectricity is established, which is valid regardless of the crystalline symmetry, the materials chemistry, and the domain structures of a ferroelectric crystal, and thus can serve as a guiding tool for optimizing piezoelectricity of ferroelectric materials beyond the &#8220;nanodomain&#8221; engineering. In addition, the theoretical approach can be extended to understand the microstructural size effect of multifunctional properties in ferroic and multiferroic materials.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Based Slow Release of a Receptor&#8208;Binding Domain Subunit Vaccine Elicits Neutralizing Antibody Responses Against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable hydrogel&#8208;based COVID&#8208;19 vaccine is developed using the receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) antigen of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus and clinically de&#8208;risked adjuvants. Sustained delivery of the subunit vaccine containing a CpG/Alum complex as an adjuvant from this hydrogel depot increases titers, provides broader protection against spike variants, and leads to more robust neutralization compared to a dose&#8208;matched bolus control.








Abstract
The development of effective vaccines that can be rapidly manufactured and distributed worldwide is necessary to mitigate the devastating health and economic impacts of pandemics like COVID&#8208;19. The receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein, which mediates host cell entry of the virus, is an appealing antigen for subunit vaccines because it is efficient to manufacture, highly stable, and a target for neutralizing antibodies. Unfortunately, RBD is poorly immunogenic. While most subunit vaccines are commonly formulated with adjuvants to enhance their immunogenicity, clinically&#8208;relevant adjuvants Alum, AddaVax, and CpG/Alum are found unable to elicit neutralizing responses following a prime&#8208;boost immunization. Here, it has been shown that sustained delivery of an RBD subunit vaccine comprising&#160;CpG/Alum&#160;adjuvant in an injectable polymer&#8208;nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogel&#160;elicited potent&#160;anti&#8208;RBD and&#160;anti&#8208;spike&#160;antibody titers, providing broader protection against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants of concern compared to bolus administration of the same vaccine and vaccines comprising other clinically&#8208;relevant adjuvant systems. Notably, a SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike&#8208;pseudotyped lentivirus neutralization assay revealed that hydrogel&#8208;based vaccines elicited potent neutralizing responses when bolus vaccines did&#160;not. Together, these results suggest that slow delivery of RBD subunit vaccines with PNP hydrogels can significantly enhance the immunogenicity of RBD and induce neutralizing humoral immunity.

     alt="Hydrogel-Based Slow Release of a Receptor-Binding Domain Subunit Vaccine Elicits Neutralizing Antibody Responses Against SARS-CoV-2"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An injectable hydrogel-based COVID-19 vaccine is developed using the receptor-binding domain (RBD) antigen of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and clinically de-risked adjuvants. Sustained delivery of the subunit vaccine containing a CpG/Alum complex as an adjuvant from this hydrogel depot increases titers, provides broader protection against spike variants, and leads to more robust neutralization compared to a dose-matched bolus control.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of effective vaccines that can be rapidly manufactured and distributed worldwide is necessary to mitigate the devastating health and economic impacts of pandemics like COVID-19. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which mediates host cell entry of the virus, is an appealing antigen for subunit vaccines because it is efficient to manufacture, highly stable, and a target for neutralizing antibodies. Unfortunately, RBD is poorly immunogenic. While most subunit vaccines are commonly formulated with adjuvants to enhance their immunogenicity, clinically-relevant adjuvants Alum, AddaVax, and CpG/Alum are found unable to elicit neutralizing responses following a prime-boost immunization. Here, it has been shown that sustained delivery of an RBD subunit vaccine comprising&#160;CpG/Alum&#160;adjuvant in an injectable polymer-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogel&#160;elicited potent&#160;anti-RBD and&#160;anti-spike&#160;antibody titers, providing broader protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern compared to bolus administration of the same vaccine and vaccines comprising other clinically-relevant adjuvant systems. Notably, a SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentivirus neutralization assay revealed that hydrogel-based vaccines elicited potent neutralizing responses when bolus vaccines did&#160;not. Together, these results suggest that slow delivery of RBD subunit vaccines with PNP hydrogels can significantly enhance the immunogenicity of RBD and induce neutralizing humoral immunity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Dirac Semimetals
In article number 2104645, Le Duc Anh, Masaaki Tanaka, and co&#8208;workers report the epitaxial growth of elemental topological Dirac semimetal &#945;&#8208;Sn with the highest quality thus far. The very high quantum mobilities in these samples allow a quantitative characterization of the nontrivial interfacial and bulk band structure of &#945;&#8208;Sn via quantum transport in combination with first&#8208;principles calculations. The results establish &#945;&#8208;Sn as an excellent model system to study novel topological phases and device applications.

Anode Materials
In article number 2105228, Ming&#8208;Sheng Wang and co&#8208;workers reveal the encapsulation mechanism and confined growth kinetics of lithium crystals in carbonaceous nanotubes by in situ transmission electron microscopy. Unusual Li nanostructures such as 2D membranes and multi&#8208;crystal nanowires are discovered. Importantly, sufficient nitrogen/oxygen doping or pre&#8208;lithiation would be critical for the carbon hosts to reliably encapsulate Li metal in a battery anode.

         <title>Engineering Nano&#8208; and Microparticles as Oral Delivery Vehicles to Promote Intestinal Lymphatic Drug Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational engineering of effective vehicles for lymphatic delivery of drugs, through targeting enterocytes or M cells, prevents their first&#8208;pass metabolism by the liver, markedly increasing the bioavailability of oral drugs. By achieving increased bioavailability, high drug concentrations are attainable at the lesions of interest with beneficial therapeutic effects, making intestinal lymphatic transport a unique modality of drug delivery.








Abstract
Targeted oral delivery of a drug via the intestinal lymphatic system (ILS) has the advantages of protecting against hepatic first&#8208;pass metabolism of the drug and improving its pharmacokinetic performance. It is also a promising route for the oral delivery of vaccines and therapeutic agents to induce mucosal immune responses and treat lymphatic diseases, respectively. This article describes the anatomical structures and physiological characteristics of the ILS, with an emphasis on enterocytes and microfold (M) cells, which are the main gateways for the transport of particulate delivery vehicles across the intestinal epithelium into the lymphatics. A comprehensive overview of recent advances in the rational engineering of particulate vehicles, along with the challenges and opportunities that they present for improving ILS drug delivery, is provided, and the mechanisms by which such vehicles target and transport through enterocytes or M cells are discussed. The use of naturally sourced materials, such as yeast microcapsules and their derived polymeric &#946;&#8208;glucans, as novel ILS&#8208;targeting delivery vehicles is also reviewed. Such use is the focus of an emerging field of research. Their potential use in the oral delivery of nucleic acids, such as mRNA vaccines, is proposed.

         <title>Cellulose&#8208;Based Hybrid Aerogels: Strategies toward Design and Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently developed cellulose&#8208;based hybrid aerogels provide a powerful material platform with synergistic and enhanced functionalities for diverse applications brought about by combining the inherent attributes of cellulose with organic/inorganic components. The design, characterization, and performance of predominant types of cellulose&#8208;hybrid aerogels are examined with an eye toward future perspectives to make these materials achieve even greater heights.








Abstract
The brittle nature of early aerogels developed from inorganic precursors fueled the discovery of their organic counterparts. Prominent among these organics are cellulose aerogels because of their natural abundance, biocompatibility, sustainable precursors, and tunable properties. The hierarchical structure of cellulose, from polymers to nano/microfibers, further facilitates fabrication of materials across multiple length scales with added applicability. However, the inherent flammability, structural fragility, and low thermal stability have limited their use. Recently developed cellulose&#8208;based hybrid aerogels offer strong potential owing to their tunability and enhanced functionality brought about by combining the inherent properties of cellulose with organic and inorganic components. A survey of the historical background and scientific achievements in the design and development of cellulose&#8208;based hybrid aerogel materials is encompassed here. The impacts of incorporating organic and inorganic ingredients with cellulose and the corresponding synergistic effects are discussed in terms of their design and functionality. The underlying principles governing the structural integration and functionality enhancement are also analyzed. The latest developments of cellulose&#8208;based hybrid aerogels fabricated from nontraditional incipient aerogels, such as fibrous webs, are also explored. Finally, future opportunities that could make these materials achieve even greater impacts through improved scalability, rationally designed synthesis, and multifunctional properties are discussed.

         <title>A Systematic Review of Metal Halide Perovskite Crystallization and Film Formation Mechanism Unveiled by In Situ GIWAXS</title>

How to obtain and understand in situ GIWAXS data is highlighted, and recent results of in situ GIWAXS studies on versatile perovskite photovoltaic systems that elucidate crystallization and film formation mechanisms in terms of material compositions, film deposition methods, and film treatment procedures are summarized and assessed.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are of fundamental interest in the research of modern thin&#8208;film optoelectronic devices, owing to their widely tunable optoelectronic properties and solution processability. To obtain high&#8208;quality perovskite films and ultimately high&#8208;performance perovskite devices, it is crucial to understand the film formation mechanisms, which, however, remains a great challenge, due to the complexity of perovskite composition, dimensionality, and processing conditions. Nevertheless, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) technique enables one to bridge the complex information with device performance by revealing the crystallization pathways during the perovskite film formation process. In this review, the authors illustrate how to obtain and understand in situ GIWAXS data, summarize and assess recent results of in situ GIWAXS studies on versatile perovskite photovoltaic systems, aiming at elucidating the distinct features and common ground of film formation mechanisms, and shedding light on future opportunities of employing in situ GIWAXS to study the fundamental working mechanisms of highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells toward mass production.

         <title>Advances in Catalytic Applications of Zeolite&#8208;Supported Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent research progress on the catalytic applications of zeolite&#8208;supported metal catalysts for diverse reactions (e.g., hydrogenation reactions, dehydrogenation reactions, oxidation reactions, hydroisomerization, and selective catalytic reduction of NOx with ammonia) are comprehensively summarized. Some current limitations and future perspectives on challenges and opportunities for this subject are also highlighted.








Abstract
Zeolites possessing large specific surface areas, ordered micropores, and adjustable acidity/basicity have emerged as ideal supports to immobilize metal species with small sizes and high dispersities. In recent years, the zeolite&#8208;supported metal catalysts have been widely used in diverse catalytic processes, showing excellent activity, superior thermal/hydrothermal stability, and unique shape&#8208;selectivity. In this review, a comprehensive summary of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art achievements in catalytic applications of zeolite&#8208;supported metal catalysts are presented for important heterogeneous catalytic processes in the last five years, mainly including 1) the hydrogenation reactions (e.g., CO/CO2 hydrogenation, hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds, and hydrogenation of nitrogenous compounds); 2) dehydrogenation reactions (e.g., alkane dehydrogenation and dehydrogenation of chemical hydrogen storage materials); 3) oxidation reactions (e.g., CO oxidation, methane oxidation, and alkene epoxidation); and 4) other reactions (e.g., hydroisomerization reaction and selective catalytic reduction of NOx with ammonia reaction). Finally, some current limitations and future perspectives on the challenge and opportunity for this subject are pointed out. It is believed that this review will inspire more innovative research on the synthesis and catalysis of zeolite&#8208;supported metal catalysts and promote their future developments to meet the emerging demands for practical applications.

         <title>Precise Subcellular Organelle Targeting for Boosting Endogenous&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Mediated Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The properties of the tumor microenvironment, the principle, methods, and the advantages of endogenous chemical substances stimulated tumor therapies and subcellular&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeting nanoplatforms are emphasized, which will provide attractive points toward the exploitation of precise medicines and clinical translation of multifunctional nanomedicines.








Abstract
Though numerous external&#8208;stimuli&#8208;triggered tumor therapies, including phototherapy, radiotherapy, and sonodynamic therapy have made great progress in cancer therapy, the low penetration depth of the laser, safety concerns of radiation, the therapeutic resistance, and the spatio&#8208;temporal constraints of the specific equipment restrict their convenient clinical applications. What is more, the inherent physiological barriers of the tumor microenvironment (TME), including hypoxia, heterogeneity, and high expression of antioxidant molecules also restrict the efficiency of tumor therapy. As a result, the development of nanoplatforms responsive to endogenous stimuli (such as glucose, acidic pH, cellular redox events, and etc.) has attracted great attention for starvation therapy, ion therapy, prodrug&#8208;mediated chemotherapy, or enzyme&#8208;catalyzed therapy. In addition, nanomedicines can be modified by some targeted units for precisely locating in subcellular organelles and boosting the destroying of tumor tissue, decreasing the dosage of nanoagents, reducing side effects, and enhancing the therapeutic efficiency. Herein, the properties of the TME, the advantages of endogenous stimuli, and the principles of subcellular&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted strategies will be emphasized. Some necessary considerations for the exploitation of precision medicine and clinical translation of multifunctional nanomedicines in the future are also pointed out.

         <title>Molecular Cleavage of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks and Application to Energy Storage and Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 51, December 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods to prepare post&#8208;synthesis metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by molecular cleavage of coordination bonds based on distinct functions and fundamental design principles are critically reviewed. Applications toward electrocatalysis and renewable batteries for energy storage and conversion are highlighted. A critical perspective on understanding and development of molecular cleavage of MOFs is provided.








Abstract
The physicochemical properties of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) significantly depend on composition, topology, and porosity, which can be tuned via synthesis. In addition to a classic direct synthesis, postsynthesis modulations of MOFs, including ion exchange, installation, and destruction, can significantly expand the application. Because of a limitation of the qualitative hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) theory, posttreatment permits regulation of MOF structure by cleaving chemical bonds at the molecular level. Here, methods of coordination bond scission to tailor the structure are critically appraised and the application to energy storage and conversion is assessed. MOF structures synthesized by molecular&#8208;level coordination bond cleavage are described and the corresponding MOFs for electrocatalysis and renewable battery applications are evaluated. Significant emphasis is placed on various coordination bond cleavage to tune properties, including chemical groups, electronic structures, and morphologies. The review concludes with a critical perspective on practical application, together with challenges and future outlook for this emerging field.

         <title>Achieving Efficient NIR&#8208;II Type I Photosensitizers for Photodynamic/Photothermal Therapy upon Regulating Chalcogen Elements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The second near infrared (NIR II) type I photosensitizer has the intrinsic advantages in photodynamic/photothermal therapy (PDT/PTT) of some malignant tumors (MTs) with deep infiltration, large size, complicated location, and low possibility of surgery/radiotherapy. Herein, three chalcogen&#8208;elements based donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type semiconducting polymers (PTS, PTSe, and PTTe) have been synthesized and fully characterized, demonstrating strong absorption in near infrared (NIR) II region. Upon adjusting the chalcogen elements, the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) characteristics and the heavy atom effect are tuned to enhance the intersystem crossing rate, improving the photodynamic effect. Moreover, the energy levels and Gibbs free energies are tuned to facilitate the type I photodynamic process. As a result, PTTe NPs produce superoxide anion radicals (O2&#8226;&#8213;) more efficiently and demonstrate higher photothermal conversion efficiency than PTS and PTSe NPs upon a NIR II (1064&#160;nm) laser irradiation, exhibiting unprecedented NIR&#8208;II type I PDT/PTT performance in vitro and in vivo. This work provides ideas for achieving high performance NIR&#8208;II type I PDT/PTT SPs for hypoxic oncotherapy.

         <title>Commensurate Stacking Phase Transitions in an Intercalated Transition Metal Dichalcogenide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;step first&#8208;order structural phase transitions at around 230 K in Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2 are solely associated with the stacking degree of freedom, evolving from a high&#8208;temperature phase with ABC stacking and R3m symmetry to an intermediate phase with AB stacking and P3m1, and finally to a low temperature phase again with R3m symmetry, but with ACB stacking. Each step involves a rigid slide of building blocks by a vector [1/3, 2/3, 0].








Abstract
Intercalation and stacking&#8208;order modulation are two active ways in manipulating the interlayer interaction of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), which lead to a variety of emergent phases and allow for engineering material properties. Herein, the growth of Pb&#8208;intercalated TMDCs&#8211;Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2, the first 124&#8208;phase, is reported. Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2 exhibits a unique two&#8208;step first&#8208;order structural phase transition at around 230 K. The transitions are solely associated with the stacking degree of freedom, evolving from a high&#8208;temperature (high&#8208;T) phase with ABC stacking and R3m symmetry to an intermediate phase with AB stacking and P3m1, and finally to a low&#8208;temperature (low&#8208;T) phase again with R3msymmetry, but with ACB stacking. Each step involves a rigid slide of building blocks by a vector [1/3, 2/3, 0]. Intriguingly, gigantic lattice contractions occur at the transitions on warming. At low&#8208;T, bulk superconductivity with Tc&#160;&#8776; 1.8 K is observed. The underlying physics of the structural phase transitions are discussed from first&#8208;principle calculations. The symmetry analysis reveals topological nodal lines in the band structure. The results demonstrate the possibility of realizing higher&#8208;order metal&#8208;intercalated phases of TMDCs and advance the knowledge of polymorphic transitions, and may inspire stacking&#8208;order engineering in TMDCs and&#160;beyond.

         <title>Perovskite Solar Cells Go Bifacial&#8212;Mutual Benefits for Efficiency and Durability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide perovskites are an ideal candidate for fabricating bifacial thin&#8208;film solar cells because of their outstanding optoelectronic properties and unique features of device physics. Bifacial perovskite solar cells hold the potential to simultaneously achieve higher energy yield and longer device stability than their monofacial equivalent, which provides a commercialization path for perovskite photovoltaics in the future.








Abstract
Bifacial solar cells hold the potential to achieve a higher power output per unit area than conventional monofacial devices without significantly increasing manufacturing costs. However, efficient bifacial designs are challenging to implement in inorganic thin&#8208;film solar cells because of their short carrier lifetimes and high rear surface recombination. The emergence of perovskite photovoltaic (PV) technology creates a golden opportunity to realize efficient bifacial thin&#8208;film solar cells, owing to their outstanding optoelectronic properties and unique features of device physics. More importantly, transparent conducting oxide electrodes can prevent electrode corrosion by halide ions, mitigating one major instability issue of the perovskite devices. Here, the theory of bifacial PV devices is summarized and the advantages of bifacial perovskite solar cells, such as high power output, enhanced device durability, and low economic and environmental costs, are reviewed. The limitations and challenges for bifacial perovskite solar cells are also discussed. Finally, the awareness of bifacial solar cells as a feasible commercialization pathway of perovskite PV for mainstream solar power generation and building&#8208;integrated PV is advocated and future research directions are suggested.

         <title>Support Bath&#8208;Free Vertical Extrusion Cryo(bio)printing for Anisotropic Tissue Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Due to poor mechanical properties of many hydrogel bioinks, conventional three&#8208;dimensional (3D) extrusion bioprinting is usually conducted based on the X&#8208;Y plane, where the deposited layers are stacked in the Z direction with or without the support of prior layers. Herein, we report a technique taking advantage of a cryoprotected bioink to enable direct extrusion bioprinting in the vertical direction in the presence of cells, using a freezing plate with precise temperature&#8208;control. Of interest, vertical 3D cryobioprinting concurrently allows the user to create freestanding filamentous constructs containing interconnected, anisotropic microchannels featuring gradient sizes aligned in the vertical direction, also associated with enhanced mechanical performances. Skeletal myoblasts within the 3D&#8208;cryobioprinted hydrogel constructs show enhanced cell viability, spreading, and alignment, compared to the same cells in the standard hydrogel constructs. This method is further extended to a multi&#8208;material format, finding potential applications in interface tissue engineering, such as creation of the muscle&#8208;tendon unit and the muscle&#8208;microvascular unit. The unique vertical 3D cryobioprinting technique presented here suggests improvements in robustness and versatility to engineer certain tissue types especially those anisotropic in nature, and may extend broad utilities in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, drug discovery, and personalized therapeutics.

         <title>Strong Metal Phosphide&#8211;Phosphate Support Interaction for Enhanced Non&#8208;Noble Metal Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong metal support interaction (SMSI) is crucial for heterogeneous catalysis but limited by reducible oxide supports and the activity and stability contradiction. A new strong metal phosphide&#8211;phosphate support interaction (SMPSI) induced by P activation is reported for the non&#8208;noble metal catalyst with superior hydrogenation activity, stability, anti&#8208;oxidant and anti&#8208;acid capacity.








Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) is crucial for supported catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. Here is the first report on strong metal phosphide&#8208;phosphate support interaction (SMPSI). The key to SMPSI is the activation of P species on the support, which leads to simultaneous generation of metal phosphide nanoparticles (NPs) and core&#8211;shell nanostructures formed by support migration onto the NPs. The encapsulation state of metal phosphide and charge transfer are identical to those of classical SMSIs and can be optimally regulated. Furthermore, the strong interactions of Co2PL/MnP&#8208;3 not only significantly enhance the anti&#8208;oxidation and anti&#8208;acid capability of non&#8208;noble metal but also exhibit excellent catalytic activity and stability toward hydrogenating a wide range of compounds into value&#8208;added fine chemicals with 100% selectivity, which is even better than Pd/C and Pt/C. The SMPSI construction can be generally extended to other systems such as Ni2PL/Mn3(PO4)2, Co2PL/LaPO4, and CoPL/CePO4. This study provides a new approach for the rational design of advanced non&#8208;noble metal catalysts and introduce a novel paradigm for the strong interaction between NPs and support.

         <title>Inorganic&#8208;Cation Pseudohalide 2D Cs2Pb(SCN)2Br2 Perovskite Single Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cs2Pb(SCN)2Br2, an all&#8208;inorganic pseudo&#8208;halide 2D phase perovskite single crystal, is grown by an antisolvent vapor&#8208;assisted crystallization method at room temperature. It exhibits a reversible first&#8208;order phase transformation to CsPbBr3 at 450 K. Cs2Pb(SCN)2Br2 has a low exciton binding energy (160 meV). The demonstrated photodetector produces respectable responsivity (8.46 mA W&#8722;1) and detectivity (1.2 &#215; 1010 Jones) at 0.5 V.








Abstract
Most of the reported 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) lead halide perovskites with the general formula of An+1BnX3n+1 (n&#160;= 1, 2, &#8230;) comprise layered perovskites separated by A&#8208;site&#8208;substituted organic spacers. To date, only a small number of X&#8208;site&#8208;substituted RP perovskites have been reported. Herein, the first inorganic&#8208;cation pseudohalide 2D phase perovskite single crystal, Cs2Pb(SCN)2Br2, is reported. It is synthesized by the antisolvent vapor&#8208;assisted crystallization (AVC) method at room temperature. It exhibits a standard single&#8208;layer (n&#160;= 1) Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper structure described in space group of Pmmn (#59) and has a small separation (d&#160;= 1.69 &#197;) between the perovskite layers. The SCN&#8722; anions are found to bend the 2D Pb(SCN)2Br2 framework slightly into a kite&#8208;shaped octahedron, limiting the formation of a quasi&#8208;2D perovskite structure (n&#160;&gt; 1).&#160;This 2D single crystal exhibits a reversible first&#8208;order phase transformation to 3D CsPbBr3 (Pm3m #221) at 450 K. It has a low exciton binding energy of 160 meV&#8212;one of the lowest for 2D perovskites (n&#160;= 1). A Cs2Pb(SCN)2Br2&#8208;single&#8208;crystal photodetector is demonstrated with respectable responsivity of 8.46&#160;mA W&#8722;1 and detectivity of &#8776;1.2 &#215; 1010 Jones at a low bias voltage of 0.5&#160;V.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer Twist Fibers towards Rotating Microengines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Untethered twist fibers do not require end&#8208;anchoring structures to hold their twist orientation and offer simple designs and convenient operation. The reversible responsiveness of these fibers allows them to generate torque and rotational deformation continuously upon the application of external stimuli. The fibers therefore have potential in rotating microengines. In practical applications, high torque and rotational deformation are desirable to meet work capacity requirements. However, the simultaneous endowment of reversible responsiveness and high rotational performance to untethered twist fibers remains a challenge. In this study, a liquid crystal elastomer twist fiber (LCETF) was designed and developed with a fixed twisting alignment of mesogens to provide untethered and reversible responsiveness. Outstanding rotational performance can be achieved when the mesogenic orientation is disrupted through heat triggering. Owing to the significant intrinsic contractile ratio of the LCE material, the rotational deformation of the LCETF can reach 243.6&#176; mm&#8722;1. More importantly, the specific torque can reach 10.1 N m kg&#8722;1, which exceeds previously reported values. In addition, the LCETF can be exploited in a rotating microengine to convert heat into electricity with an induction voltage as high as 9.4&#160;V. This work broadens the applications of LCEs for energy harvesters, micromachines, and soft robots.

         <title>Assembly of Bioactive Nanoparticles via Metal&#8211;Phenolic Complexation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The integration of bioactive materials (e.g., proteins and genes) into nanoparticles holds promise in fields ranging from catalysis to biomedicine. However, it has been challenging to develop a simple and broadly applicable nanoparticle platform that can readily incorporate distinct biomacromolecules without affecting their intrinsic activity. Herein, a metal&#8211;phenolic assembly approach is presented whereby diverse functional nanoparticles can be readily assembled in water from combining various synthetic and natural building blocks, including poly(ethylene glycol), phenolic ligands, metal ions, and bioactive macromolecules. The assembly process is primarily mediated by metal&#8211;phenolic complexes through coordination and hydrophobic interactions, which yields uniform and spherical nanoparticles (mostly &lt;200&#160;nm),&#160;while preserving the function of the incorporated biomacromolecules (siRNA and 5 different proteins used). The functionality of the assembled nanoparticles is demonstrated through cancer cell apoptosis, RNA degradation, catalysis, and gene downregulation studies. Furthermore, the resulting nanoparticles can be used as building blocks for the secondary engineering of superstructures via templating and cross&#8208;linking with metal ions. The bioactivity and versatility of the platform can potentially be used for the streamlined and rational design of future bioactive materials.

         <title>Intracellular Self&#8208;Immolative Polyprodrug with Near&#8208;Infrared Light Guided Accumulation and in Vivo Visualization of Drug Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The selective accumulation and real&#8208;time monitoring of drug release at tumor site are the key bottlenecks to the clinical translation of polyprodrug. Herein, we exploit an intracellular self&#8208;immolative polyprodrug (PMTO), which not only shows the enhanced cellular internalization and selective accumulation in tumor site under the mild hyperthermia triggered by laser irradiation, but also possesses the self&#8208;monitoring drug release ability in vivo. The polyprodrug amphiphiles are synthesized by sequential esterification reaction, and hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) serves as blocking agent. On account of the mild hyperthermia produced by PMTO under the laser irradiation at tumor site, the cell membranous permeability increases, resulting in the enhanced cellular internalization and drug accumulation in tumor. After internalized by cells, the self&#8208;immolative PMTO nanoparticles can release free mitoxantrone (MTO) in intracellular reductive environment, and ratiometric photoacoustic (RPA) imaging based on distinct signals between MTO and PMTO is presented to trace the drug release in vivo. Finally, this self&#8208;monitoring polyprodrug presents significant tumor suppression efficacy, which exhibits great potential for guiding the clinical medication in cancer treatment.

         <title>All Solution&#8208;Processed van der Waals Heterostructures for Wafer&#8208;Scale Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials have been considered as potential building blocks for use in fundamental elements of electronic and optoelectronic devices, such as electrodes, channels, and dielectrics, because of their diverse and remarkable electrical properties. Furthermore, two or more building blocks of different electronic types can be stacked vertically to generate vdW heterostructures with desired electrical behaviors. However, such fundamental approaches cannot directly be applied practically because of issues such as precise alignment/positioning and large&#8208;quantity material production. Here, we overcome these limitations and demonstrate wafer&#8208;scale vdW heterostructures by exploiting the lateral and vertical assembly of solution&#8208;processed 2D vdW materials. The high exfoliation yield of the molecular intercalation&#8208;assisted approach enables the production of micron&#8208;sized nanosheets in large quantities and its lateral assembly in a wafer&#8208;scale via vdW interactions. Subsequently, the laterally assembled vdW thin&#8208;films were vertically assembled to demonstrate various electronic device applications, such as transistors and photodetectors. Furthermore, multi&#8208;dimensional vdW heterostructures were demonstrated by integrating one&#8208;dimensional carbon nanotubes as a p&#8208;type semiconductor to fabricate p&#8211;n diodes and complementary logic gates. Lastly, electronic devices were fabricated via inkjet printing as a lithography&#8208;free manner based on the stable nanomaterial dispersions.

         <title>Anisotropic Rod&#8208;Shaped Particles Influence Injectable Granular Hydrogel Properties and Cell Invasion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Granular hydrogels have emerged as a new class of injectable and porous biomaterials that improve integration with host tissue when compared to solid hydrogels. Granular hydrogels are typically prepared using spherical particles and this study considers whether particle shape (i.e., isotropic spheres versus anisotropic rods) influences granular hydrogel properties and cellular invasion. Simulations predict that anisotropic rods influence pore shape and interconnectivity, as well as bead transport through granular assemblies. Photocrosslinkable norbornene&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid is used to produce spherical and rod&#8208;shaped particles using microfluidic droplet generators and formed into shear&#8208;thinning and self&#8208;healing granular hydrogels, with particle shape influencing mechanics and injectability. Rod&#8208;shaped particles form granular hydrogels that have anisotropic and interconnected pores, with pore size and number influenced by particle shape and degree of packing. Robust in vitro sprouting of endothelial cells from embedded cellular spheroids is observed with rod&#8208;shaped particles, including higher sprouting densities and sprout lengths when compared to hydrogels with spherical particles. Cell and vessel invasion into granular hydrogels when injected subcutaneously in vivo is significantly greater with rod&#8208;shaped particles, whereas a gradient of cellularity is observed with spherical particles. Overall, this work demonstrates potentially superior functional properties of granular hydrogels with rod&#8208;shaped particles for tissue repair.

         <title>The Meniscus&#8208;assisted&#8208;coating with Optimized Active Layer Morphology towards Highly Efficient All&#8208;polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Morphology control is the key to engineering highly efficient solution&#8208;processed solar cells. Focusing on the most promising application&#8208;oriented photovoltaic all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs), herein we report a facile and effective meniscus&#8208;assisted&#8208;coating (MAC) strategy for preparing high&#8208;quality blend films with enhanced crystallinity and inter&#8208;penetrating nanofibers network morphology. The all&#8208;PSCs based on MAC exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties with efficiencies exceeding 15%, which is the best performance of solution&#8208;printing&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs, as well as better stability. The crystallization kinetics of polymer blend film was investigated by in situ UV&#8208;visible absorption spectroscopy, and the result explains the linear relationship between the meniscus advance speed and the crystallinity (crystallization rate) of the polymer. To verify the compatibility and universality of this strategy, we applied the MAC strategy to the other three binary systems. By precisely controlling the meniscus advancing speed, we fabricated 1 cm2 all&#8208;PSC devices whose efficiencies exceeded 12%. Such progress demonstrates that the application of MAC strategy is a promising approach for the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency all&#8208;PSCs.

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, such as MoS2 and WSe2, with adequate bandgaps are promising channel materials for ultrascaled logic transistors. This scalability study of two&#8208;dimensional material (2DM)&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) and static random&#8208;access memory (SRAM) cells analyzing the impact of layer thickness revealed that the monolayer 2DM FET with superior electrostatics is beneficial for its ability to mitigate the read&#8211;write conflict in an SRAM cell at scaled technology nodes (1&#8211;2.1&#160;nm). Moreover, the monolayer 2DM SRAM exhibited lower cell read access time and write time than the bilayer and trilayer 2DM SRAM cells at fixed leakage power. Our simulation predicted that the optimization of 2DM SRAM designed with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art contact resistance, mobility, and equivalent oxide thickness leads to excellent stability and operation speed at the 1&#8208;nm node. Applying the nanosheet gate&#8208;all&#8208;around (GAA) structure to 2DM further reduced cell read access time and write time and improved the area density of the SRAM cells, demonstrating a feasible scaling path beyond Si technology using 2DM nanosheet FETs. In addition to the device design, the process challenges for 2DM nanosheet FETs, including the cost&#8208;effective stacking of 2DM layers, formation of electrical contacts, suspended 2DM channels, and GAA structures, have also been discussed.

         <title>Inverse Design of Ferroelectric&#8208;order in Perovskite Crystal for Self&#8208;powered Ultraviolet Photodetection</title>

Abstract
It has always been a hot topic to design an orderly mesoscopic structure in functional materials to tailor the macroscopic properties or realize new functions. The existence of domains in ferroelectric materials has been proven to affect the macroscopic properties, being actively studied in nonlinear optical conversion and piezoelectric effects. However, the high&#8208;efficiency photoelectric conversion capability of ferroelectric crystals has not yet been explored. Here, we studied the orderly arrangement of ferroelectric order in KTa1&#8208;xNbxO3 (KTN) perovskite crystals, and designed the &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;head&#8221; domains by tuning the Curie temperature Tc, thereby generating abundant charged domain walls (CDWs) and robust conductive channels for electrons and holes. An ultrahigh ultraviolet photoresponsivity was achieved in the KTN crystal under zero bias voltage, being about four orders magnitude higher than that of the well&#8208;known ferroelectric materials. The substantial improvement can be attributed to the judiciously designed ferroelectric order, as demonstrated by the conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM). In addition, KTN detector exhibits high stability and reliability after high&#8208;temperature and fatigue treatment. KTN crystal features giant photoresponsivity, high electric&#8208;optical coefficient and large &#967;(2) nonlinearity concurrently, indicating its great potential for application of all&#8208;optical devices on photonic chips.

         <title>Full synthetic 3D fibrous scaffolds for stromal tissues &#8211; replacement of animal&#8208;derived scaffold materials demonstrated by multilayered skin</title>

Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) of soft tissues in vivo has remarkable biological and structural properties. Thereby, the ECM provides mechanical stability while it still can be rearranged via cellular remodeling during tissue maturation or healing processes. However, modern synthetic alternatives fail to provide these key features among basic properties. Synthetic matrices are usually completely degraded or are inert regarding cellular remodeling. Based on a refined electrospinning process, we developed a method to generate synthetic scaffolds with high porous fibrous structures and enhanced fiber&#8208;to&#8208;fiber distances. Since this approach allows for cell migration, matrix remodeling and ECM synthesis, the scaffold provides an ideal platform for the generation of soft tissue equivalents. Using this Matrix, we were able to generate a electrospun&#8208;based multilayered skin equivalent composed of a stratified epidermis, a dermal compartment, and a subcutis without the use of animal matrix components for the first time.The extension of classical dense electrospun scaffolds with high porosities and motile fibers generates a fully synthetic and defined alternative to collagen gel&#8208;based tissue models and is a promising system for the construction of tissue equivalents as in vitro models or in vivo implants.

         <dc:description>
A biological self&#8208;assembly technology to fabricate Rhizopus hyphae carbon fibre (RHCF) and its derivatives is proposed. The RHCFs are multifunctional as the hosts to combine with metal oxide (CoO) and S, Li metal, and a polypropylene (PP) separator to form an RHCF&#8208;based cathode, anode, and separator, respectively. The as&#8208;assembled RHCF&#8208;based full cell shows excellent cycling capacity and high&#8208;rate performance.








Abstract
Biotechnology can bring new breakthroughs on design and fabrication of energy materials and devices. In this work, a novel and facile biological self&#8208;assembly technology to fabricate multifunctional Rhizopus hyphae carbon fiber (RHCF) and its derivatives on a large scale for electrochemical energy storage is proposed. Crosslinked hollow carbon fibers are successfully prepared by conversion of Rhizopus hyphae, and macroscopic production of centimeter&#8208;level carbon balls consisting of hollow RHCFs is further realized. Moreover, the self&#8208;assembled RHCF balls show strong adsorption characteristics on metal ions and can be converted into a series of derivatives such as RHCF/metal oxides. Notably, the designed RHCF derivatives are demonstrated with powerful multifunctionability as cathode, anode, and separator for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). The RHCF can act as the host material to combine with metal oxide (CoO) and S, Li metal, and a polypropylene (PP) separator to form a new RHCF/CoO&#8208;S cathode, an RHCF/Li anode, and an RHCF/PP separator, respectively. Consequently, the optimized LSB full cell presents excellent cycling performance and superior high&#8208;rate capacity (881.3&#160;mA h g&#8211;1 at 1 C). This work provides a new method for large&#8208;scale preparation of hollow carbon fibers and derivatives for advanced energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Sequential Activation of Molecular and Macroscopic Spin&#8208;State Switching within the Hysteretic Region Following Pulsed Light Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of an exceptionally reversible bidirectional switching in a molecular spin&#8208;crossover crystal, pump&#8211;probe optical microscopy is used to explore the dynamics of the spin&#8208;state switching within the hysteretic region. Remarkably, before the millisecond timescale, the response of the crystal to the laser excitation involves a gradual and homogeneous molecular conversion process, as if there were&#160;no hysteresis loop.








Abstract
Molecular spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) compounds constitute a promising class of photoactive materials exhibiting efficient photoinduced phase transitions (PIPTs). Taking advantage of the unique, picture&#8208;perfect reproducibility of the spin&#8208;transition properties in the compound [Fe(HB(1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)3)2], the spatiotemporal dynamics of the PIPT within the thermodynamic metastability (hysteretic) region of a single crystal is dissected, using pump&#8211;probe optical microscopy. Beyond a threshold laser&#8208;excitation density, complete PIPTs are evidenced, with conversion rates up to 200 switched molecules per absorbed photon. It is shown that the PIPT takes place through the sequential activation of two (molecular and macroscopic) switching mechanisms, occurring on sub&#8208;microsecond and millisecond timescales, governed by the intramolecular and free energy barriers of the system, respectively. The main finding here is that the thermodynamic metastability has strictly no influence on the sub&#8208;millisecond switching dynamics. Indeed, before this millisecond timescale, the response of the crystal to the laser excitation involves a gradual, molecular conversion process, as if there were&#160;no hysteresis loop. Consequently, in this regime, even a 100% photoinduced conversion may not give rise to a PIPT. These results provide new insight on the intrinsic dynamical limits of the PIPT, which is an important issue from a technological perspective.

         <title>Homologous Bromides Treatment for Improving the Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite surface treatment by homologous bromide salts is investigated. It is found that bromides not only passivate surface defects but also penetrate into the perovskite providing bulk passivation. This leads to a large voltage&#160;of 1.24 V&#160;in a 1.63&#160;eV bandgap device and an efficiency of 23.7%&#160;in a 1.56&#160;eV bandgap device.








Abstract
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solution&#8208;processed organic&#8211;inorganic mixed halide perovskite solar cells has achieved rapid improvement. However, it is imperative to minimize the voltage deficit (Woc&#160;= Eg/q&#160;&#8722; Voc) for their PCE to approach the theoretical limit. Herein, the strategy of depositing homologous bromide salts on the perovskite surface to achieve a surface and bulk passivation for the fabrication of solar cells with high open&#8208;circuit voltage is reported. Distinct from the conclusions given by previous works, that homologous bromides such as FABr only react with PbI2 to form a large&#8208;bandgap perovskite layer on top of the original perovskite, this work shows that the bromide also penetrates the perovskite film and passivates the perovskite in the bulk. This is confirmed by the small&#8208;bandgap enlargement observed by absorbance and photoluminescence, and the bromide element ratio increasing in the bulk by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry and depth&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Furthermore, a clear suppression of non&#8208;radiative recombination is confirmed by a variety of characterization methods. This work provides a simple and universal way to reduce the Woc of single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells and it will also shed light on developing other high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices, including perovskite&#8208;based tandems and light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>Auxetics&#8208;Inspired Tunable Metamaterials for Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Auxetics refers to structures or materials identified by a negative Poisson's ratio and exhibiting a counterintuitive geometrical behavior. Inspired by auxetics, mechanically tunable magnetic metamaterials in both planar and hemispherical configurations operating at megahertz frequencies are proposed, which serve to enhance local magnetic fields and increase signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (&#8776;4.5&#215;) in their application to magnetic resonance imaging.








Abstract
Auxetics refers to structures or materials with a negative Poisson's ratio, thereby capable of exhibiting counterintuitive behaviors. Herein, auxetic structures are exploited to design mechanically tunable metamaterials in both planar and hemispherical configurations operating at megahertz (MHz) frequencies, optimized for their application to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Specially, the reported tunable metamaterials are composed of arrays of interjointed unit cells featuring metallic helices, enabling auxetic patterns with a negative Poisson's ratio. The deployable deformation of the metamaterials yields an added degree of freedom with respect to frequency tunability through the resultant modification of the electromagnetic interactions between unit cells. The metamaterials are fabricated using 3D printing technology and an &#8776;20&#160;MHz frequency shift of the resonance mode is enabled during deformation. Experimental validation is performed in a clinical (3.0 T) MRI system, demonstrating that the metamaterials enable a marked boost in radiofrequency field strength under resonance&#8208;matched conditions, ultimately yielding a dramatic increase in the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (&#8776;4.5&#215;) of MRI. The tunable metamaterials presented herein offer a novel pathway toward the practical utilization of metamaterials in MRI, as well as a range of other emerging applications.

         <title>Brain&#8208;Targeted Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Nanoparticles with Near&#8208;Infrared Imaging at 1550&#160;nm Boosts Orthotopic Glioblastoma Theranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II)&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) of nanofluorophores is a promising approach for theranostic of orthotopic glioma. Brain&#8208;targeting nanofluorophores featuring novel molecular design of &#8220;backbone distortion + molecular rotor&#8221; are prepared. They can balance the photon energy flow to achieve advanced NIR&#8208;II imaging at 1550&#160;nm and photo&#8208;to&#8208;heat ratio for PTT in orthotopic&#8208;glioma&#8208;bearing mice.








Abstract
A remaining challenge in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is surmounting the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB). Such a challenge prevents the development of efficient theranostic approaches that combine reliable diagnosis with targeted therapy. In this study, brain&#8208;targeted near&#8208;infrared IIb (NIR&#8208;IIb) aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission (AIE) nanoparticles are developed via rational design, which involves twisting the planar molecular backbone with steric hindrance. The resulting nanoparticles can balance competing responsiveness demands for radiation&#8208;mediated NIR fluorescence imaging at 1550&#160;nm and non&#8208;radiation NIR photothermal therapy (NIR&#8208;PTT). The brain&#8208;targeting peptide apolipoprotein E peptide (ApoE) is grafted onto these nanoparticles (termed as ApoE&#8208;Ph NPs) to target glioma and promote efficient BBB traversal. A long imaging wavelength 1550&#160;nm band&#8208;pass filter is utilized to monitor the in vivo biodistribution and accumulation of the nanoparticles in a model of orthotopic glioma, which overcomes previous limitations in wavelength range and equipment. The results demonstrate that the ApoE&#8208;Ph NPs have a higher PTT efficiency and significantly enhanced survival of mice bearing orthotopic GBM with moderate irradiation (0.5&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2). Collectively, the work highlights the smart design of a brain&#8208;targeted NIR&#8208;II AIE theranostic approach that opens new diagnosis and treatment options in the photonic therapy of GBM.

         <title>Assessing the Photovoltaic Quality of Vacuum&#8208;Thermal Evaporated Organic Semiconductor Blends</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors asses state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art vacuum thermal&#8208;evaporated organic solar cells (VTE OSCs) in their photovoltaic material quality. The comprehensive optoelectronic characterization yields four key metrics governing OSC performance&#8212;a new methodology that equally applies to solution&#8208;processed OSCs. The five studied material blends give a representative overview of today's VTE OSCs and needs for improvement are identified for this industrially leading OSC technology.








Abstract
Vacuum&#8208;thermal evaporation (VTE) is a highly relevant fabrication route for organic solar cells (OSCs), especially on an industrial scale as proven by the commercialization of organic light emitting diode&#8208;based displays. While OSC performance is reported for a range of VTE&#8208;deposited molecules, a comprehensive assessment of donor:acceptor blend properties with respect to their photovoltaic performance is scarce. Here, the organic thin films and solar cells of three select systems are fabricated and ellipsometry, external quantum efficiency with high dynamic range, as well as OTRACE are measured to quantify absorption, voltage losses, and charge carrier mobility. These parameters are key to explain OSC performance and will help to rationalize the performance of other material systems reported in literature as the authors&#8217; methodology is applicable beyond VTE systems. Furthermore, it can help to judge the prospects of new molecules in general. The authors find large differences in the measured values and find that today's VTE OSCs can reach high extinction coefficients, but only moderate mobility and voltage loss compared to their solution&#8208;processed counterparts. What needs to be improved for VTE OSCs is outlined to again catch up with their solution&#8208;processed counterparts in terms of power conversion efficiency.

New polymer acceptors (PAs) are developed by embedding flexible conjugation&#8208;break spacer (FCBS) units into the rigid backbones. The incorporation of FCBS affords effective modulation of the crystallinity and pre&#8208;aggregation of the PA and attains optimal blend morphology. As a result, the all&#8208;polymer solar cells exhibit both a high efficiency of 14.68% and excellent mechanical robustness with a crack onset strain of 21.64%.








Abstract
High efficiency and mechanical robustness are both crucial for the practical applications of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) in stretchable and wearable electronics. In this regard, a series of new polymer acceptors (PAs) is reported by incorporating a flexible conjugation&#8208;break spacer (FCBS) to achieve highly efficient and mechanically robust all&#8208;PSCs. Incorporation of FCBS affords the effective modulation of the crystallinity and pre&#8208;aggregation of the PAs, and achieves the optimal blend morphology with polymer donor (PD), increasing both the photovoltaic and mechanical properties of all&#8208;PSCs. In particular, an all&#8208;PSC based on PYTS&#8208;0.3 PA incorporated with 30% FCBS and PBDB&#8208;T PD demonstrates a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.68% and excellent mechanical stretchability with a crack onset strain (COS) of 21.64% and toughness of 3.86&#160;MJ m&#8208;3, which is significantly superior to those of devices with the PA without the FCBS (PYTS&#8208;0.0, PCE = 13.01%, and toughness = 2.70&#160;MJ m&#8208;3). To date, this COS is the highest value reported for PSCs with PCEs of over 8% without any insulating additives. These results reveal that the introduction of FCBS into the conjugated backbone is a highly feasible strategy to simultaneously improve the PCE and stretchability of PSCs.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of 2D Nanomaterial Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Sensors: Fundamentals and Translation across the Innovation Spectrum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D nanomaterials are analyzed fundamentally for their field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) and tunneling FET (TFET) sensor applications. With molecular engineering of specific probes, they hold great potential for intelligent management of water by detecting water contaminants with both high sensitivity and high selectivity. Major challenges and opportunities for designing and fabricating 2D nanomaterial FET/TFET sensors with superior performance are also outlined.








Abstract
Over the last decade, 2D layered nanomaterials have attracted significant attention across the scientific community due to their rich and exotic properties. Various nanoelectronic devices based on these 2D nanomaterials have been explored and demonstrated, including those for environmental applications. Here, the fundamental attributes of 2D layered nanomaterials for field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) sensors and tunneling FET (TFET) sensors, which provide versatile detection of water contaminants such as heavy&#8208;metal ions, bacteria, nutrients, and organic pollutants, are discussed. The major challenges and opportunities are also outlined for designing and fabricating 2D nanomaterial FET/TFET sensors with superior performance. Translation of these FET/TFET sensors from fundamental research to applied technology is illustrated through a case study on graphene&#8208;based real&#8208;time FET water sensors. A second case study centers on large&#8208;scale sensor networks for water&#8208;quality monitoring to enable intelligent drinking water and river&#8208;water systems. Overall, 2D nanomaterial FET sensors have significant potential for enabling a human&#8208;centered intelligent water system that can likely be applied to other precarious water supplies around the globe.

         <title>Decoupling Complex Multi&#8208;Length&#8208;Scale Morphology in Non&#8208;Fullerene Photovoltaics with Nitrogen K&#8208;Edge Resonant Soft X&#8208;ray Scattering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale morphology in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is complex and difficult to analyze. An innovative approach is provided by nitrogen K&#8208;edge resonant soft X&#8208;ray scattering, utilizing the spatial and orientational contrast from the cyano groups in the acceptor materials, chemically determining the phase separation, which decouples the mesoscale complexity for understanding the structure&#8211;property relationship in high&#8208;efficiency OPVs.








Abstract
Complex morphology in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and other functional soft materials commonly dictates performance. Such complexity in OPVs originates from the mesoscale kinetically trapped non&#8208;equilibrium state, which governs device charge generation and transport. Resonant soft X&#8208;ray scattering (RSoXS) has been revolutionary in the exploration of OPV morphology in the past decade due to its chemical and orientation sensitivity. However, for non&#8208;fullerene OPVs, RSoXS analysis near the carbon K&#8208;edge is challenging, due to the chemical similarity of the materials used in active layers. An innovative approach is provided by nitrogen K&#8208;edge RSoXS (NK&#8208;RSoXS), utilizing the spatial and orientational contrasts from the cyano groups in the acceptor materials, which allows for determination of phase separation. NK&#8208;RSoXS clearly visualizes the combined feature sizes in PM6:Y6 blends from crystallization and liquid&#8211;liquid demixing, while PM6:Y6:Y6&#8208;BO ternary blends with reduced phase&#8208;separation size and enhanced material crystallization can lead to current amplification in devices. Nitrogen is common in organic semiconductors and other soft materials, and the strong and directional N 1s &#8594; &#960;* resonances make NK&#8208;RSoXS a powerful tool to uncover the mesoscale complexity and open opportunities to understand heterogeneous systems.

         <title>Lateral Fully Organic P&#8211;N Diodes Created in a Single Donor&#8211;Acceptor Copolymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lateral fully organic P&#8211;N diodes can be created in a single polymer, which exhibits a high rectification ratio &#8776;2100 and a high current density 3.83 A cm&#8722;2. This work opens the opportunities to create P&#8211;N junctions in ways of silicon&#8208;based inorganic semiconductors and promises new opportunities for integrating organic materials for flexible and printable organic devices.








Abstract
P&#8211;N junctions exist in many solid&#8208;state organic devices, such as light&#8208;emitting diodes, solar cells, and thermoelectric devices. Creating P&#8211;N junctions by bulk chemical doping in a single organic material (like silicon doped by boron and phosphorus) may capitalize the vast scientific and technological groundwork established in the inorganic semiconducting field. However, high&#8208;performance single&#8208;organic&#8208;material P&#8211;N junctions are seldom reported, because the diffusion of the dopant counterions often leads to transient rectification properties. Herein, a new type of lateral fully organic diodes created in single donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) copolymer films with only one P&#8208;type dopant is reported. The achieved lateral devices exhibit high current densities of &#8776;3.83 A cm&#8722;2 and a high rectification ratio of &#8776;2100, which are beyond the requirements for high&#8208;frequency identification tags. The P&#8208; to N&#8208;type polarity switching mechanism is proposed after spectroscopic and structural tests. Decent stability of the organic diode is obtained, which is due to the long channel length and low diffusion speed of the large size of dopants. This work opens the opportunities to create P&#8211;N junctions in ways of silicon&#8208;based inorganic semiconductors and promises new opportunities for integrating organic materials for flexible and printable organic devices.

         <title>Macrocycle&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers for Separation, Sensing, and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycles as an emerging class of building blocks are used for porous organic polymers owing to their easy functionalization, unique host&#8211;guest properties, modifiable conformations, and tunable chemistry. Facilitated by these features, macrocycle&#8208;based porous organic polymers have attracted considerable attentions in the construction of advanced porous materials and excelled in adsorptive separation, optical sensing, and heterogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
With the rapid development of materials science, porous organic polymers (POPs) have received remarkable attentions because of their unique properties such as the exceptionally high surface area and flexible molecular design. The ability to incorporate specific functions in a precise manner makes POPs promising platforms for a myriad of applications in molecular adsorption, separation, and catalysis. Therefore, many different types of POPs have been rationally designed and synthesized to expand the scope of advanced materials, endowing them with distinct structures and properties. Recently, supramolecular macrocycles with excellent host&#8211;guest complexation abilities are emerging as powerful crosslinkers for developing novel POPs with hierarchical structures and improved performance, which can be well&#8208;organized at different spatial scales. Macrocycle&#8208;based POPs could have unusual porous, adsorptive, and optical properties when compared to their nonmacrocycle&#8208;incorporated counterparts. This cooperation provides valuable insights for the molecular&#8208;level understanding of skeletal complexity and diversity. Here, the research advances of macrocycle&#8208;based POPs are aptly summarized by showing their syntheses, properties, and applications in terms of separation, sensing, and catalysis. Finally, the current challenging issues in this exciting research field are delineated and a comprehensive outlook is offered for their future directions.

Recently, supramolecular macrocycles with excellent host&#8211;guest complexation abilities are emerging as powerful crosslinkers for developing novel POPs with hierarchical structures and improved performance, which can be well-organized at different spatial scales. Macrocycle-based POPs could have unusual porous, adsorptive, and optical properties when compared to their nonmacrocycle-incorporated counterparts. This cooperation provides valuable insights for the molecular-level understanding of skeletal complexity and diversity. Here, the research advances of macrocycle-based POPs are aptly summarized by showing their syntheses, properties, and applications in terms of separation, sensing, and catalysis. Finally, the current challenging issues in this exciting research field are delineated and a comprehensive outlook is offered for their future directions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
This review discusses the preparation, unique capabilities, and advantages of biomimetic micromotors, leveraging the attractive properties of cell membrane&#8208;derived natural biomaterials and the dynamic movement of synthetic micromotors. Such cell membrane&#8208;functional micromotors enable important biomedical operations across a wide range of applications, including drug delivery, decontamination, immunotherapy, and phototherapy.








Abstract
There has been considerable interest in developing synthetic micromotors with biofunctional, versatile, and adaptive capabilities for biomedical applications. In this perspective, cell membrane&#8208;functionalized micromotors emerge as an attractive platform. This new class of micromotors demonstrates enhanced propulsion and compelling performance in complex biological environments, making them suitable for various in vivo applications, including drug delivery, detoxification, immune modulation, and phototherapy. This article reviews various proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies based on different micromotor designs and cell membrane coatings in these areas. The review focuses on the motor structure and performance relationship and highlights how cell membrane functionalization overcomes the obstacles faced by traditional synthetic micromotors while imparting them with unique capabilities. Overall, the cell membrane&#8208;functionalized micromotors are expected to advance micromotor research and facilitate its translation towards practical uses.

This review presents a critical assessment of lignocellulosics for engineering optically functional materials for smart devices. It discusses the effects of fibrillation, fibril alignment, densification, self&#8208;assembly, surface&#8208;patterning, and compositing on targeted optical properties, such as transparency, haze, luminescence, UV&#8208;absorption, and structural colors. The scope covers the main plant&#8208;based structural materials, as well as non&#8208;lignocellulosic additives bearing an optical function.








Abstract
This review addresses the reconstruction of structural plant components (cellulose, lignin, and hemicelluloses) into materials displaying advanced optical properties. The strategies to isolate the main building blocks are discussed, and the effects of fibrillation, fibril alignment, densification, self&#8208;assembly, surface&#8208;patterning, and compositing are presented considering their role in engineering optical performance. Then, key elements that enable lignocellulosic to be translated into materials that present optical functionality, such as transparency, haze, reflectance, UV&#8208;blocking, luminescence, and structural colors, are described. Mapping the optical landscape that is accessible from lignocellulosics is shown as an essential step toward their utilization in smart devices. Advanced materials built from sustainable resources, including those obtained from industrial or agricultural side streams, demonstrate enormous promise in optoelectronics due to their potentially lower cost, while meeting or even exceeding current demands in performance. The requirements are summarized for the production and application of plant&#8208;based optically functional materials in different smart material applications and the review is concluded with a perspective about this active field of knowledge.

         <title>Overcoming Intensity Saturation in Nonlinear Multiple&#8208;Quantum&#8208;Well Metasurfaces for High&#8208;Efficiency Frequency Upconversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlinear multi&#8208;quantum&#8208;well&#8208;based metasurfaces for frequency upconversion are enhanced by taking advantage of a pumping scheme coherently coupled with unpopulated upper electron subbands. This pumping scheme, combined with optimized material and metasurface designs, avoids saturation at practical levels of continuous&#8208;wave pump intensities, yielding larger upconversion efficiencies than in conventional approaches.








Abstract
Engineered intersubband transitions in semiconductor heterostructures featuring multiple quantum wells (MQWs) are shown to support record&#8208;high second&#8208;order nonlinear susceptibilities. By integrating these materials in metasurfaces with tailored optical resonances, it is possible to further enhance photonic interactions, yielding giant nonlinear responses in ultrathin devices. These metasurfaces form a promising platform for efficient nonlinear processes, including frequency upconversion of low&#8208;intensity thermal infrared radiation and harmonic generation, free of phase&#8208;matching constraints intrinsic to bulk nonlinear crystals. However, nonlinear saturation at moderately large pump intensities due to the transfer of electron population into excited subbands facilitated by strongly enhanced light&#8211;matter interactions in metasurfaces fundamentally limits their overall efficiency for various nonlinear processes. Here, the saturation limits of nonlinear MQW&#8208;based metasurfaces for mid&#8208;infrared frequency upconversion are significantly extended by optimizing their designs for excitation with a strong pump coherently coupled with unpopulated upper electron subbands. This counterintuitive pumping scheme, combined with tailored material and photonic engineering of the metasurface, avoids saturation at practical levels of continuous&#8208;wave pump intensities, yielding significantly larger upconversion efficiencies than in conventional approaches. The present results open new opportunities for nonlinear metasurfaces, less limited by saturation mechanisms, with important implications for night&#8208;vision imaging and compact nonlinear wave mixing&#160;systems.

         <title>A Logic&#8208;based Diagnostic and Therapeutic Hydrogel with Multi&#8208;stimuli Responsiveness to Orchestrate Diabetic Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The regeneration of diabetic bone defects remains challenging as the innate healing process is impaired by glucose fluctuation (GF), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and over&#8208;expression of proteinases (such as matrix metalloproteinases, MMPs). A &#8220;diagnostic&#8221; and therapeutic dual logic&#8208;based hydrogel for diabetic bone regeneration is therefore developed through the design of a double&#8208;network hydrogel consisting of phenyboronic acid&#8208;crosslinked polyvinyl alcohol and gelatin colloids. It exhibited a &#8220;diagnostic&#8220; logic to interpret pathological cues (GF, ROS, MMPs) and determine when to release drug in a diabetic microenvironment and a therapeutic logic to program different cargo release to match immune&#8208;osteo cascade for better tissue regeneration. The hydrogel was also shown to be mechanically adaptable to the local complexity at the bone defect. Furthermore, the underlying therapeutic mechanism was elucidated whereby the logic&#8208;based cargo release enabled the regulation of macrophage polarization by remodeling the mitochondria&#8208;related antioxidative system, resulting in enhanced osteogenesis in diabetic bone defects. In conclusion, our study provides critical insight into the design and biological mechanism of dual logic&#8208;based tissue engineering strategies for diabetic bone regeneration.

         <title>Highly Bright AIE Nanoparticles by Regulating the Substituent of Rhodanine for Precise Early Detection of Atherosclerosis and Drug Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fluorescent probes capable of precise detection of atherosclerosis (AS) at an early stage and fast assessment of anti&#8208;AS drugs in animal level are particularly valuable. Herein, we introduce a highly bright aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) nanoprobe by regulating the substituent of rhodanine for early detection of atherosclerotic plaque and screening of anti&#8208;AS drugs in a precise, sensitive and rapid manner. With dicyanomethylene&#8208;substituted rhodanine as the electron&#8208;withdrawing unit, the AIE luminogen named TPE&#8208;T&#8208;RCN shows the highest molar extinction coefficient, the largest photoluminescence quantum yield and the most red&#8208;shifted absorption/emission spectra simultaneously as compared to the control compounds. The nanoprobes are obtained with an amphiphilic co&#8208;polymer as the matrix encapsulating TPE&#8208;T&#8208;RCN molecules, which are further surface functionalized with anti&#8208;CD47 antibody for specifically binding to CD47 overexpressed in AS plaques. Such nanoprobes allow efficient recognition of AS plaques at different stages in apolipoprotein E&#8208;deficient (apoE&#8211;/&#8211;) mice, especially for the recognition of early&#8208;stage AS plaques prior to Micro&#8208;CT and MRI imaging. These features impel us to apply the nanoprobes in monitoring the therapeutic effects of anti&#8208;AS drugs, providing a powerful tool for anti&#8208;AS drug screening. Their potential use in targeted imaging of human carotid plaque is further demonstrated.

A new wide&#8208;bandgap nonfused nonfullerene acceptor named GS&#8208;ISO is designed and synthesized. GS&#8208;ISO exhibits a very flat molecular backbone and stable molecular conformation. Based on GS&#8208;ISO, outstanding power conversion efficiencies of over 19% (AM 1.5G, 100&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) for a tandem organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell and over 28% (500&#160;lux, 2700&#160;K LED) for an indoor OPV cell are achieved.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) with nonfused conjugated structures play a critical role in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Here, NFAs named GS&#8208;OEH, GS&#8208;OC6, and GS&#8208;ISO, with optical bandgaps larger than 1.70&#160;eV, are synthesized without using the fused ring structures. Compared with GS&#8208;OEH and GS&#8208;OC6, GS&#8208;ISO exhibits much stronger crystallinity, leading to a smaller energetic disorder and a larger exciton diffusion coefficient. GS&#8208;ISO also possesses a higher electroluminescence external quantum efficiency of 1.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2. The OPV cell based on PBDB&#8208;TF:GS&#8208;ISO demonstrates a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.62% under the standard one sun illumination. Besides, the PBDB&#8208;TF:GS&#8208;ISO&#8208;based cell with effective area of 1.0&#160;cm2&#160;exhibits a PCE of 28.37% under 2700&#160;K illumination of 500&#160;lux. A tandem OPV cell using PBDB&#8208;TF:GS&#8208;ISO as the front subcell shows an outstanding efficiency of 19.10%. Importantly, the GS&#8208;ISO&#8208;based OPV cell exhibits promising stability under the continuous illumination of simulated sunlight. This study indicates that the molecular design strategy demonstrated in this work has great superiority in developing nonfused NFAs and also that GS&#8208;ISO is a promising WBG acceptor for versatile photovoltaic applications.

         <title>Designing Angstrom&#8208;Scale Asymmetric MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF Cavities for High Monovalent Ion Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Biological ion channels feature angstrom&#8208;scale asymmetrical cavity structures, which are the key to achieving highly efficient separation and sensing of alkali metal ions from aqueous resources. The clean energy future and lithium&#8208;based energy storage systems heavily rely on highly efficient ionic separations. However, artificial recreation of such a sophisticated biostructure has been technically challenging. Here, we introduced a highly tunable design concept to fabricate monovalent ion&#8208;selective membranes with asymmetric sub&#8208;nanometer pores in which energy barriers are implanted. The energy barriers act as walls and baffles against ionic movements, which holds the target ion while facilitating the transport of competing ions. The membrane is consisted of bilayer metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF), possessing a 6 to 3.4&#8208;angstrom passable converting cavity structure. The ionic current measurements exhibited an unprecedented ionic current rectification ratio of above 100 with exceptionally high selectivity ratios of 84 and 80 for K+/Li and Na+/ Li, respectively (1.14 Li+ mol.m&#8722;2.h&#8722;1). Furthermore, using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics, we showed that the combined effect of spatial hindrance that creates energy surge walls and nucleophilic entrapment induces energy surge baffles and is responsible for the ultrahigh selectivity and rectifying performance of the membranes. This work demonstrates a striking advance in developing monovalent ion&#8208;selective channels and has implications in sensing, energy storage and separation technologies.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale and Wide&#8208;Gamut Coloration at the Diffraction Limit in Flexible, Self&#8208;Assembled Hierarchical Nanomaterials</title>

Abstract
Unveiling physical phenomena that generate controllable structural coloration are at the center of significant research efforts due to the platform potential for the next generation of printing, sensing, displays, wearable optoelectronics components, and smart fabrics. Colors based on e&#8208;beam facilities possess high resolutions above 100K DPI, but limit manufacturing scales up to 4.37&#160;cm2, while requiring rigid substrates that are not flexible. State&#8208;of&#8208;art scalable techniques, on the contrary, provide either narrow gamuts or small resolutions. A common issue of current methods is also a heterogeneous resolution, which typically changes with the color printed. Here we&#160;demonstrate a structural coloration platform with broad gamuts exceeding the red, green, and blue (RGB) spectrum in inexpensive, thermal resistant, flexible and metallic&#8208;free structures at constant 101600 DPI (at the diffraction limit), obtained via mass&#8208;production manufacturing. This platform exploits a previously unexplored physical mechanism, which leverages the interplay between strong scattering modes and optical resonances excited in fully three&#8208;dimensional dielectric nanostructures with suitably engineered longitudinal profiles. The colors obtained with this technology are scalable to any area, demonstrated up to the single wafer (4&#8208;inch). These results open real&#8208;world applications of inexpensive, high&#8208;resolution, large&#8208;scale structural colors with broad chromatic spectra.

         <title>Boosting Reversibility and Stability of Li Storage in SnO2&#8208;Mo Multilayers: Introduction of Interfacial Oxygen Redistribution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Among the promising high capacity anode materials, tin dioxide (SnO2) represents a classic and important candidate that involves both conversion and alloying reactions toward Li storage. However, the inferior reversibility of conversion reactions usually results in low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE, &#8764;60%), small reversible capacity and poor cycling stability of electrodes. Here, we demonstrate that by carefully designing the interface structure of SnO2&#8208;Mo, a breakthrough comprehensive performance with ultrahigh average ICE up to 92.6%, large capacity of 1067&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 and 100% capacity retention after 700 cycles can be realized in a multilayer Mo/SnO2/Mo electrode. Furthermore, high capacity retentions can also be achieved in pouch&#8208;type Mo/SnO2/Mo||Li half cells and Mo/SnO2/Mo||LiFePO4 full cells. The amorphous SnO2/Mo interfaces, which are induced by redistribution of oxygen atoms between SnO2 and Mo, can precisely adjust the reversible capacity and cycling stability of the multilayers, while the stable capacities of electrodes are parabolic with the interfacial density. Theoretical calculations and in/ex&#8208;situ experimental investigation clearly reveal that oxygen redistribution in the SnO2/Mo hetero&#8208;interfaces boosts the Li ions transport kinetics by inducing a built&#8208;in electric field and improves the reaction reversibility of SnO2. This work provides a new understanding of the interface&#8208;performance relationship of metal&#8208;oxide hybrid electrodes and pivotal guidance for creating high performance Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Resolving the Spatial Variation and Correlation of Hyperfine Spin Properties in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Devices which exploit the quantum properties of materials are widespread, with quantum information processors and quantum sensors showing significant progress. Organic materials offer interesting opportunities for quantum technologies owing to their engineerable spin properties, with spintronic operation and spin resonance magnetic&#8208;field sensing demonstrated in research grade devices, as well as proven compatibility with large scale fabrication techniques. Yet several important challenges remain as we move toward scaling these proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle quantum devices to larger integrated logic systems or spatially smaller sensing elements, particularly those associated with the variation of quantum properties both within and between devices. Here, spatially resolved magnetoluminescence is used to provide the first two&#8208;dimensional map of a hyperfine spin property &#8211; the Overhauser field &#8211; in traditional organic light emitting diodes. We find intra&#8208;device variabilities exceeding 20% while spatially correlated behavior is exhibited on lengths beyond 7&#160;&#956;m, similar in size to pixels in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art AMOLED arrays, which has implications for the reproducibility and integration of organic quantum devices.

Yet several important challenges remain as we move toward scaling these proof-of-principle quantum devices to larger integrated logic systems or spatially smaller sensing elements, particularly those associated with the variation of quantum properties both within and between devices. Here, spatially resolved magnetoluminescence is used to provide the first two-dimensional map of a hyperfine spin property &#8211; the Overhauser field &#8211; in traditional organic light emitting diodes. We find intra-device variabilities exceeding 20% while spatially correlated behavior is exhibited on lengths beyond 7&#160;&#956;m, similar in size to pixels in state-of-the-art AMOLED arrays, which has implications for the reproducibility and integration of organic quantum devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Prussian blue analogues for sodium&#8208;ion batteries: past, present and future</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have attracted wide attention for their application in the energy storage and conversion field due to their low cost, facile synthesis, and appreciable electrochemical performance. At the present stage, most research on PBAs is focused on their material&#8208;level optimization, whereas their properties in practical battery systems are seldom considered. This review aims to first provide an overview of the history and parameters of PBA materials and analyze the fundamental principles toward rational design of PBAs, and then evaluate the prospects and challenges for PBAs for practical sodium&#8208;ion batteries, hoping to bridge the gap between laboratory research and commercial reality.

         <title>Reversible Manipulation of Photoconductivity Caused by Surface Oxygen Vacancies in Perovskite Stannates with Ultraviolet Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8211;matter interaction under different oxygen pressure can reversibly manipulate photoconductivity from surface oxygen vacancies of perovskite stannate semiconductors. Utilizing surface&#8208;selective photochemical reaction combined with the low oxygen&#8208;diffusion coefficient, ultraviolet&#8208;light&#8208;excited electron&#8211;hole pairs of the perovskite compound under low oxygen pressure accelerate the unprecedented formation of spatially&#160;confined and optically&#160;programmable in&#8208;gap states induced by oxygen vacancies at room temperature.








Abstract
Programmable optoelectronic devices call for the reversible control of the photocarrier recombination process by in&#8208;gap states in oxide semiconductors. However, previous approaches to produce oxygen vacancies as a source of in&#8208;gap states in oxide semiconductors have hampered the reversible formation of oxygen vacancies and their related phenomena. Here, a new strategy to manipulate the 2D photoconductivity from perovskite stannates is demonstrated by exploiting spatially&#160;selective photochemical reaction under ultraviolet illumination at room temperature. Remarkably, the ideal trap&#8208;free photocurrent of air&#8208;illuminated BaSnO3 (&#8776;200&#160;pA) is reversibly switched into three orders of magnitude higher photocurrent of vacuum&#8208;illuminated BaSnO3 (&#8776;335&#160;nA) with persistent photoconductivity depending on ambient oxygen pressure under illumination. Multiple characterizations elucidate that ultraviolet illumination of BaSnO3&#160;under low oxygen pressure induces surface oxygen vacancies as a result of surface photolysis combined with the low oxygen&#8208;diffusion coefficient of BaSnO3; the concentrated oxygen vacancies are likely to induce a two&#8208;step transition of photocurrent response by changing the characteristics of in&#8208;gap states from the shallow level to the deep level. These results suggest a novel strategy that uses light&#8211;matter interaction in a reversible and spatially&#160;confined way to manipulate functionalities related to surface defect states, for the emerging applications using newly discovered oxide semiconductors.

         <title>Toward Perfect Optical Diffusers: Dielectric Huygens&#8217; Metasurfaces with Critical Positional Disorder</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metasurfaces based on disordered arrangements of silicon nanoresonators are used to implement wavelength&#8208;selective optical diffusers with nearly Lambertian scattering profiles and a high tolerance for incidence angles and polarizations. Their working principles and scattering performances are discussed on the basis of exhaustive experimental and numerical studies. Such diffusers open new opportunities in applications like fluorescence microscopy, augmented reality displays, or wavefront&#8208;shaping.








Abstract
Conventional optical diffusers, such as thick volume scatterers (Rayleigh scattering) or microstructured surface scatterers (geometric scattering), lack the potential for on&#8208;chip integration and are thus incompatible with next&#8208;generation photonic devices. Dielectric Huygens&#8217; metasurfaces, on the other hand, consist of 2D arrangements of resonant dielectric nanoparticles and therefore constitute a promising material platform for ultrathin and highly efficient photonic devices. When the nanoparticles are arranged in a random but statistically specific fashion, diffusers with exceptional properties are expected to come within reach. This work explores how dielectric Huygens&#8217; metasurfaces can implement wavelength&#8208;selective diffusers with negligible absorption losses and nearly Lambertian scattering profiles that are largely independent of the angle and polarization of incident waves. The combination of tailored positional disorder with a carefully balanced electric and magnetic response of the nanoparticles is shown to be an integral requirement for the operation as a diffuser. The proposed metasurfaces&#8217; directional scattering performance is characterized both experimentally and numerically, and their usability in wavefront&#8208;shaping applications is highlighted. Since the metasurfaces operate on the principles of Mie scattering and are embedded in a glassy environment, they may easily be incorporated in integrated photonic devices, fiber optics, or mechanically robust augmented reality displays.

         <title>Boosting Piezoelectricity under Illumination via the Bulk Photovoltaic Effect and the Schottky Barrier Effect in BiFeO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancement of piezoelectricity by external stimuli is advantageous for its simple and in situ control, and compatibility with other functionalities. In this work, light is shown to be a powerful control parameter to induce a sevenfold enhancement of piezoelectric coefficient in BiFeO3 single crystals due to the bulk photovoltaic and Schottky barrier effects, offering potential for multifunctional optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Piezoelectricity is a key functionality induced by conversion between mechanical and electrical energy. Enhancement of piezoelectricity in ferroelectrics often has been realized by complicated synthetical approaches to host unique structural boundaries, so&#8208;called morphotropic phase boundaries. While structural approaches are well&#8208;known, enhancing piezoelectricity by external stimuli has yet to be clearly explored, despite their advantages of offering not only simple and in situ control without any prior processing requirement, but compatibility with other functionalities. Here, it is shown that light is a powerful control parameter to enhance the piezoelectric property of BiFeO3 single crystals. A series of measurements based on piezoresponse force microscopy and conductive atomic force microscopy, under illumination, reveal a locally enhanced effective piezoelectric coefficient, dzz, eventually showing almost a sevenfold increase. This phenomenon is explained with theoretical models by introducing the two main underlying mechanisms attributed to the bulk photovoltaic effect and Schottky barrier effect, involving the role of open&#8208;circuit voltage and photocharge carrier density. These results provide key insights to light&#8208;induced piezoelectricity enhancement, offering its potential for multifunctional optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Covalent&#8208;Linking&#8208;Enabled Superior Compatibility of ZIF&#8208;8 Hybrid Membrane for Efficient Propylene Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superior interfacial compatibility in metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) hybrid membranes is achieved by linking functionalized ZIF&#8208;8 and polymeric PIM&#8208;1 through chemical bonds. The fabricated membrane exhibits the highest C3H6 permeability and remarkable selectivity for C3H6 over C3H8 among ZIF analogs, potentially for efficient propylene separation.








Abstract
The interface is a critical issue for metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework hybrid membranes in propylene separation. Here, a covalent&#8208;linking strategy is reported for strikingly reinforcing the interfacial compatibility in a ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;based membrane. A functionalized ZIF&#8208;8 material named ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN is synthesized using the mixed&#8208;ligand approach. ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN has an identical crystalline structure to ZIF&#8208;8, and the 4,5&#8208;dicyanoimidazole ligand is available for further functionalization. Covalent linkage of ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN with PIM&#8208;1 is driven by the thermal reaction of the cyano groups on both entities, which strengthens the filler&#8211;polymer connection in the ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN@tPIM&#8208;1 membrane. ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN@tPIM&#8208;1 exhibits remarkably enhanced propylene permeation property with C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of &#8776;28, which is 350% and 180% higher than those on non&#8208;treated ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN/PIM&#8208;1 and non&#8208;functionalized ZIF&#8208;8@tPIM&#8208;1, respectively. Additionally, ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN@tPIM&#8208;1 shows the highest C3H6 permeability of &#8776;370 Barrer among all relevant ZIF&#8208;8 membranes. This strategy opens an avenue for precise interface engineering in membranes and the resultant high performance is appealing in the propylene separation industry.

The fabricated membrane exhibits the highest C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; permeability and remarkable selectivity for C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; over C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; among ZIF analogs, potentially for efficient propylene separation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interface is a critical issue for metal&#8211;organic-framework hybrid membranes in propylene separation. Here, a covalent-linking strategy is reported for strikingly reinforcing the interfacial compatibility in a ZIF-8-based membrane. A functionalized ZIF-8 material named ZIF-8-CN is synthesized using the mixed-ligand approach. ZIF-8-CN has an identical crystalline structure to ZIF-8, and the 4,5-dicyanoimidazole ligand is available for further functionalization. Covalent linkage of ZIF-8-CN with PIM-1 is driven by the thermal reaction of the cyano groups on both entities, which strengthens the filler&#8211;polymer connection in the ZIF-8-CN@tPIM-1 membrane. ZIF-8-CN@tPIM-1 exhibits remarkably enhanced propylene permeation property with C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of &#8776;28, which is 350% and 180% higher than those on non-treated ZIF-8-CN/PIM-1 and non-functionalized ZIF-8@tPIM-1, respectively. Additionally, ZIF-8-CN@tPIM-1 shows the highest C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; permeability of &#8776;370 Barrer among all relevant ZIF-8 membranes. This strategy opens an avenue for precise interface engineering in membranes and the resultant high performance is appealing in the propylene separation industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
An aqueous Ti3C2&#8208;MXene&#8208;functionalized poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate ink is developed for 3D printing to precisely create 3D architectures with high design freedom and a post&#8208;printing freeze&#8211;thawing treatment protocol is proposed to transform the as&#8208;printed objects into highly conductive and robust hydrogels with high fidelity on both the macro&#8208; and microscale, enabling customizable applications.








Abstract
The ongoing miniaturization of devices and development of wireless and implantable technologies demand electromagnetic interference (EMI)&#8208;shielding materials with customizability. Additive manufacturing of conductive polymer hydrogels with favorable conductivity and biocompatibility can offer new opportunities for EMI&#8208;shielding applications. However, simultaneously achieving high conductivity, design freedom, and shape fidelity in 3D printing of conductive polymer hydrogels is still very challenging. Here, an aqueous Ti3C2&#8208;MXene&#8208;functionalized poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate ink is developed for extrusion printing to create 3D objects with arbitrary geometries, and a freeze&#8211;thawing protocol is proposed to transform the printed objects directly into highly conductive and robust hydrogels with high shape fidelity on both the macro&#8208; and microscale. The as&#8208;obtained hydrogel exhibits a high conductivity of 1525.8 S m&#8211;1 at water content up to 96.6 wt% and also satisfactory mechanical properties with flexibility, stretchability, and fatigue resistance. Furthermore, the use of the printed hydrogel for customizable EMI&#8208;shielding applications is demonstrated. The proposed easy&#8208;to&#8208;manufacture approach, along with the highlighted superior properties, expands the potential of conductive polymer hydrogels in future customizable applications and represents a real breakthrough from the current state of the art.

         <title>Single&#8208;, Dual&#8208;, Triple, and Quad&#8208;wavelength Surface&#8208;emitting Lasing in Blue Phase Liquid Crystal</title>

Abstract
Soft organic lasers with multi&#8208;wavelength output and high spectral purity are of crucial importance for versatile photonic devices owing to their monochromaticity, coherence, and high intensity.&#160;However, there remain challenges for the achievement of&#160;surface&#8208;emitting multi&#8208;wavelength lasing in soft photonic crystals, and the relative mechanisms need to be investigated. Herein, single&#8208;, dual&#8208;, triple&#8208;, and quad&#8208;wavelength lasers are successfully achieved in dye&#8208;doped blue phase liquid crystal (BPLC) film. The number and wavelength of lasing peaks can be manipulated by tuning the center of the bandgap, order parameter of the laser dye, quality of the resonance cavity, temperature, and even the pump energy of the pump light. For single&#8208;wavelength lasing, &#160;a lasing peak with&#160;an ultra&#8208;narrow linewidth of 0.04&#160;nm (Q factor of 13454) is achieved. The multi&#8208;wavelength lasing is attained based on the following aspects: (i) narrow bandgaps of BPLCs with&#160;full width at half maximum of 14&#8211;20&#160;nm; (ii) a laser dye with high gain over a wide wavelength band, having a low&#8208;order parameter in the liquid crystal matrix; (iii) appropriate relative positions between the reflection and fluorescence peaks; and (iv) highly ordered crystal lattice of BPLC film. The proposed single&#8208;to&#8208;quad&#8208;wavelength surface&#8208;emitting lasers can be employed as coherent light sources for next&#8208;generation optical devices.

         <title>Engineering Multienzyme&#8208;mimicking Covalent Organic Frameworks as Pyroptosis Inducers for Boosting Antitumor Immunity</title>

Abstract
We report the engineering of a series of multienzyme&#8208;mimicking covalent organic frameworks (COFs), COF&#8208;909&#8208;Cu, COF&#8208;909&#8208;Fe, and COF&#8208;909&#8208;Ni, as pyroptosis inducers remodeling the tumor microenvironment to boost cancer immunotherapy. Mechanistic studies revealed that these COFs could serve as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) homeostasis disruptors to elevate intracellular H2O2 levels, and they not only exhibited excellent superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;mimic activity and converted superoxide radicals (O2&#8226;&#8259;) to H2O2 to facilitate H2O2 generation; but also possessed outstanding glutathione peroxidase (GPx)&#8208;mimic activity and depleted glutathione (GSH) to alleviate the scavenging of H2O2. Meanwhile, the outstanding photothermal therapy properties of these COFs could accelerate the Fenton&#8208;like ionization process to facilitate their chemodynamic therapy efficiency. One member, COF&#8208;909&#8208;Cu, can robustly induce gasdermin E (GSDME)&#8208;dependent pyroptosis and remodel the tumor microenvironment to trigger durable antitumor immunity, thus promoting the response rate of &#945;PD&#8208;1 checkpoint blockade and successfully restraining tumor metastasis and recurrence.

         <title>Surfaces decorated with enantiomorphically pure polymer nanohelices via hierarchical chirality transfer across multiple length scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Mesoscale chiral materials have been prepared by lithographic methods, assembly of chiral building blocks, and through syntheses in the presence of polarised light. Typically, these processes result in micrometer&#8208;sized structures, require complex top&#8208;down manipulation, or rely on tedious asymmetric separation. We discovered that the chemical vapor deposition of chiral precursors into supported films of liquid crystals (LCs) results in superhierarchical arrangements of enantiomorphically pure nanofibers. Depending on the molecular chirality of the 1&#8208;hydroxyethyl [2.2]paracyclophane precursor, extended arrays of enantiomorphic nanohelices are formed from achiral nematic templates. Arrays of chiral nanohelices extend over hundreds of microns and consistently display enantiomorphic micropatterns. The pitch of individual nanohelices depend on the enantiomeric excess and the purity of the chiral precursor, consistent with the theoretical model of a doubly&#8208;twisted LC director configuration. During CVD of chiral precursors into cholesteric LC films, aspects of molecular and mesoscale asymmetry combine constructively to form regularly twisted nanohelices. Enantiomorphic surfaces permit the tailoring of a wide range of functional properties, such as the asymmetric induction of weak chiral systems.

         <title>Wearable Microneedle&#8208;Based Extended Gate Transistor for Real&#8208;Time Detection of Sodium in Interstitial Fluids</title>

Abstract
Dysnatremia, a disorder in the concentration of sodium levels, possesses a clinical challenge leading to adverse health complications. Using biosensors for online sodium monitoring can be a promising approach to overcome this condition. In this regard, biosensors based on field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) have promising advantages, including high sensitivity, quick response, and easy fabrication. Most of the currently developed FET designs are used only for sensing sweat and in&#8208;vitro blood/interstitial fluids (ISF). Using ISF for online detection of biomarkers and long&#8208;term health monitoring with FETs has not yet been fully resolved. Herein we propose an innovative stretchable skin&#8208;conformal fast&#8208;response microneedle extended&#8208;gate FET (MN&#8208;EGFET) biosensor for real&#8208;time detection of sodium in the ISF for minimally invasive health monitoring along with high sensitivity, low limit of detection, excellent biocompatibility, and on&#8208;body mechanical stability. This platform can, furthermore, be integrated with wireless&#8208;data transmitter and the Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things (IoT) cloud for real&#8208;time monitoring and long&#8208;term analysis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysnatremia, a disorder in the concentration of sodium levels, possesses a clinical challenge leading to adverse health complications. Using biosensors for online sodium monitoring can be a promising approach to overcome this condition. In this regard, biosensors based on field-effect transistors (FETs) have promising advantages, including high sensitivity, quick response, and easy fabrication. Most of the currently developed FET designs are used only for sensing sweat and in-vitro blood/interstitial fluids (ISF). Using ISF for online detection of biomarkers and long-term health monitoring with FETs has not yet been fully resolved. Herein we propose an innovative stretchable skin-conformal fast-response microneedle extended-gate FET (MN-EGFET) biosensor for real-time detection of sodium in the ISF for minimally invasive health monitoring along with high sensitivity, low limit of detection, excellent biocompatibility, and on-body mechanical stability. This platform can, furthermore, be integrated with wireless-data transmitter and the Internet-of-Things (IoT) cloud for real-time monitoring and long-term analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>
3D printing offers an unparalleled freedom in the design and fabrication of anisotropic polymer materials with controlled compositions and complex architecture. This article provides a comprehensive review on recent developments in the 3D printing techniques and relevant implementing strategies for fabricating anisotropic polymer materials. The potential applications, existing challenges, and future perspectives are discussed.








Abstract
Anisotropy is the characteristic of a material to exhibit variations in its mechanical, electrical, thermal, optical properties, etc. along different directions. Anisotropic materials have attracted great research interest because of their wide applications in aerospace, sensing, soft robotics, and tissue engineering. 3D printing provides exceptional advantages in achieving controlled compositions and complex architecture, thereby enabling the manufacture of 3D objects with anisotropic functionalities. Here, a comprehensive review of the recent progress on 3D printing of anisotropic polymer materials based on different techniques including material extrusion, vat photopolymerization, powder bed fusion, and sheet lamination is presented. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies implemented in manipulating anisotropic structures are highlighted with the discussion of material categories, functionalities, and potential applications. This review is concluded with analyzing the current challenges and providing perspectives for further development in this field.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Mediated Intracellular Polymerization of AIEgens for Light&#8208;Up Tumor Localization and Theranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation&#8208;induced emission fluorogen&#8208;peptide conjugates (D2P1) and 3CBT that can undergo in situ polymerization to form aggregates in tumor cells are rationally designed. Upon tumor&#8208;specific cathepsin B enzyme reactions, the peptide cleavage on D2P1 induces covalent polymerization between 3CBT, which triggers aggregation and accumulation of D2P1 into the tumor site, resulting in enhanced fluorescence signal and tumor treatment efficacy.








Abstract
Improving the enrichment of drugs or theranostic agents within tumors is vital to achieve effective cancer diagnosis and therapy with reduced dosage and damage to normal tissues. In this work, an enzyme&#8208;mediated aggregation&#8208;induced emission fluorogen (AIEgen) intracellular polymerization strategy that can simultaneously promote the accumulation and retention of the AIEgen in the tumor for prolonged imaging and enhanced tumor growth inhibition is described. An AIEgen&#8208;peptide conjugate (D2P1) and cyanobenzothiazole&#8208;cysteine (3CBT) that can undergo rapid condensation reaction to form nanoaggregates in tumor cells are rationally designed. Upon tumor&#8208;specific cathepsin protease reaction, the cleavage of peptides induces condensate polymerization between the exposed cysteine and 2&#8208;cyanobenzothiazole on 3CBT, triggering accumulation of D2P1 into the tumor site, leading to fluorescence light&#8208;up. Such enzyme&#8208;mediated polymerization of D2P1 and 3CBT alters cellular motility via disrupting actin organization and in turn inhibiting cell proliferation. In addition, due to the built&#8208;in intrinsic photosensitization property of the AIEgen, the accumulation of D2P1 can remarkably promote the tumor photodynamic therapy effect in vivo under light irradiation. This study thus represents the enzyme&#8208;mediated intracellular polymerization system with high potential to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes of tumors in vivo.

         <title>Activatable 19F MRI Nanoprobes for Visualization of Biological Targets in Living Subjects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
19F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with activatable nanoprobes enables real&#8208;time, deep&#8208;tissue, and background&#8208;free imaging of cells and biomolecules in living subjects. Recent progress on activatable 19F MRI nanoprobes made from three major 19F&#8208;containing compounds as well as present challenges and potential opportunities are discussed, giving more insights into activatable probe design for this emerging and encouraging field.








Abstract
Visualization of biological targets such as crucial cells and biomolecules in living subjects is critical for the studies of important biological processes. Though 1H magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has demonstrated its power in offering detailed anatomical and pathological information, its capacity for in vivo tracking of biological targets is limited by the high biological background of 1H. 19F distinguishes itself from its competitors as an exceptional complement to 1H in MRI through its high sensitivity, low biological background, and broad chemical shift range. The specificity and sensitivity of 19F MRI can be further boosted with activatable nanoprobes. The advantages of 19F MRI with activatable nanoprobes enable in vivo detection and imaging at the cellular or even molecular level in deep tissues, rendering this technique appealing as a potential solution for visualization of biological targets in living subjects. Here, recent progress over the past decades on activatable 19F MRI nanoprobes made from three major 19F&#8208;containing compounds, as well as present challenges and potential opportunities, are summarized to provide a panoramic prospective for the people who are interested in this emerging and exciting field.

         <title>Electron Matters: Recent Advances in Passivation and Applications of Black Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Besides the 2D structure, the unique feature of black phosphorus (BP) is the lone&#8208;pair electrons on each P atom. The interaction between the lone&#8208;pair electrons of BP and the acceptor component can be utilized for passivation of BP and contributes toward BP&#8208;based applications, either indirectly or directly.








Abstract
2D materials have experienced rapid and explosive development in the past decades. Among them, black phosphorus (BP) is one of the most promising materials on account of its thickness&#8208;dependent bandgap, high charge&#8208;carrier mobility, in&#8208;plane anisotropic structure, and excellent biocompatibility, as well as the broad applications brought by the properties. In view of the electron configuration, the most unique feature of BP is the lone&#8208;pair electrons on each P atom. The lone&#8208;pair electrons inevitably cause high reactivity of BP, particularly toward water/oxygen, which greatly limits the practical application of BP under ambient conditions. The other side of the coin is that BP can serve as an electron donor to promote the construction of BP&#8208;based hybrid materials and/or to boost the performance of BP or BP&#8208;based hybrid materials in applications. Here, recent advances in passivation and application of BP by addressing the interaction between the lone&#8208;pair electrons of BP and the other materials are discussed, and prospects for future research on BP are also proposed.

         <title>Recent Advances in Inorganic Chiral Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imposing chirality onto inorganic nanomaterials is essentially required for developing prominent biomedical applications intrinsically associated with homochirality, as well as for advanced light polarization. Recent investigations in inorganic chiral nanomaterials are summarized, paving the way to fully understanding the important chiral effects and prospectively exploring diverse applications with enhanced functionalities.








Abstract
Inorganic nanoparticles offer a multifunctional platform for biomedical applications in drug delivery, biosensing, bioimaging, disease diagnosis, screening, and therapies. Homochirality prevalently exists in biological systems composed of asymmetric biochemical activities and processes, so biomedical applications essentially favor the usage of inorganic chiral nanomaterials, which have been widely studied in the past two decades. Here, the latest investigations are summarized including the characterization of 3D stereochirality, the bionic fabrication of hierarchical chirality, extension of the compositional space to poly&#8208;elements, studying optical activities with the (sub&#8208;)single&#8208;particle resolution, and the experimental demonstration in biomedical applications. These advanced studies pave the way toward fully understanding the two important chiral effects (i.e., the chiroptical and enantioselective effects), and prospectively promote the flexible design and fabrication of inorganic chiral nanoparticles with engineerable functionalities to solve diverse practical problems closely associated with environment and public health.

         <title>Thermally Stable Single&#8208;Atom Heterogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalysts have attracted extensive interest recently, especially for material synthesis and catalytic performance. Their thermal stability under reaction conditions is closely related to the application of these materials in industry in the future. Recent progress in developing thermally stable single&#8208;atom catalysts, including preparation strategies, coordination structure of single atoms, and catalytic performance, is summarized.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted extensive attention in fields related to energy, environment, and material sciences because of the high atom efficiency and the unique properties of these materials. Many approaches have hitherto been successfully established to prepare SACs, including impregnation, pyrolysis&#8208;involved processes, atom trapping, and coprecipitation. However, under typical reaction conditions, single atoms on catalysts tend to migrate or agglomerate, forming nanoclusters or nanoparticles, which lowers their surface free energy. Efforts are required to develop strategies for improving the thermal stability of SACs while achieving excellent catalytic performance. In this Progress Report, recent advances in the development of thermally durable single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalysts are discussed. Several important preparation approaches for thermally stable SACs are described in this article. Fundamental understanding of the coordination structures of thermally stable single atom prepared by these methods is discussed. Furthermore, the catalytic performances of these thermally stable SACs are reviewed, including their activity and stability. Finally, a perspective of this important and rapidly evolving research field is provided.

The highly localized and strong electromagnetic fields generated by plasmonic nanomaterials, when excited by incident lasers with suitable wavelengths, can greatly boost the excitation and/or radiation processes of various spectroscopies, including Raman, fluorescence, or nonlinear spectroscopies, giving enhanced signals and improved spectral sensitivity.








Abstract
Plasmonic core&#8211;shell nanostructures have attracted considerable attention in the scientific community recently due to their highly tunable optical properties. Plasmon&#8208;enhanced spectroscopies are one of the main applications of plasmonic nanomaterials. When excited by an incident laser of suitable wavelength, strong and highly localized electromagnetic (EM) fields are generated around plasmonic nanomaterials, which can significantly boost excitation and/or radiation processes that amplify Raman, fluorescence, or nonlinear signals and improve spectroscopic sensitivity. Herein, recent developments in plasmon&#8208;enhanced spectroscopies utilizing core&#8211;shell nanostructures are reviewed, including shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS), plasmon&#8208;enhanced fluorescence spectroscopy, and plasmon&#8208;enhanced nonlinear spectroscopy.

         <title>Chemical Insights into Interfacial Effects in Inorganic Nanomaterials</title>

The interfaces between inorganic functional nanomaterials and their surface modifiers play important roles in determining their chemical and physical properties. Strategies toward the fabrication of model inorganic nanomaterials with well&#8208;defined and detectable interfaces for deep understanding of complicated interfacial effects at the molecular level are highlighted.








Abstract
The interfaces between inorganic functional nanomaterials and their surface modifiers play important roles in determining their chemical and physical properties. In numerous situations, interfaces created by organic ligands or secondary inorganic components on inorganic nanomaterials induce significant effects to promote their performances. However, it still remains challenging to understand those interfacial effects at the molecular level. Herein, strategies via the design of model inorganic nanomaterials with well&#8208;defined and detectable interfaces to simplify the investigation of interfacial effects in inorganic nanomaterials are summarized. While atomically precise metal nanoclusters enable &#8220;seeing&#8221; how organic ligands are coordinated on metal surface to create nanoscale metal&#8211;organic interfaces, ultrathin low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials modified with organic ligands make it possible to extract the metal&#8211;organic interface structure from the average signal to investigate how steric and electronic effects enhance catalysis. The molecular mechanisms of the interfacial effects in supported metal catalysts are disclosed by designing two unique structures of supported catalysts. The interfacial engineering approach will be further extended to optimize the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. Finally, a perspective on the development of operando characterization techniques is provided to track the dynamic interfacial structures during catalysis.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Based Adaptive Structural Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;based adaptive structural materials have been demonstrated to possess both dynamic adaptivity (from the active liquid part) and stable mechanical structure (from the fixed solid part). The recent progress in the development of liquid&#8208;based adaptive structural materials, including liquid with particles, liquid with surfaces, and liquid with membranes, along with their structure&#8211;function relationship and applications is summarized.








Abstract
Structural materials are used to provide stable mechanical architectures and transmit or support forces, and they play an important role in materials science and technology. During the long process of the exploitation of structural materials, the functionality of structural materials has gained prominence. Adaptive structures responding to external stimuli have come to the fore with significant advantages in structural materials. However, many solid adaptive structural materials still suffer from their single function and the lack of dynamic performance, such as issue around fouling and energy consumption, defects present everywhere in materials at the microscale, etc. To meet the increasing demands, more and more researchers have started turning their attention to liquid&#8208;based materials owing to their intrinsic spontaneous, dynamic, and functional properties. Liquid&#8208;based adaptive structural materials (LASMs) have been proposed and developed. Building upon both dynamic liquids and fixed solids, LASMs have been demonstrated to possess both dynamic adaptivity (from the active liquid part) and stable mechanical structure (from the fixed solid part), which are desired in many applications such as 3D printing, droplet manipulation, omniphobic surfaces, microfluidics, mass separation, etc. A unifying view of the recent progress of LASMs is presented, including liquid with particles, liquid with surfaces, as well as liquid with membranes. In addition, the discussion of the prospects and challenges are provided for promoting the development of LASMs.

         <dc:description>
Metallic plasmonic array structures provide a powerful platform to control light&#8211;matter interactions and have found wide applications due to their fascinating, rich, and tunable optical properties through morphology and parameter engineering. The recent progress of metallic plasmonic arrays is reviewed, including their optical properties, nanofabrication techniques, and applications for plasmonic sensing, surface&#8208;enhanced spectroscopies, nanolasing, and perfect light absorption. The challenges and perspectives are also discussed.








Abstract
The vast development of nanofabrication has spurred recent progress for the manipulation of light down to a region much smaller than the wavelength. Metallic plasmonic array structures are demonstrated to be the most powerful platform to realize controllable light&#8211;matter interactions and have found wide applications due to their rich and tunable optical performance through the morphology and parameter engineering. Here, various light&#8208;management mechanisms that may exist on metallic plasmonic array structures are described. Then, the typical techniques for fabrication of metallic plasmonic arrays are summarized. Next, some recent applications of plasmonic arrays are reviewed, including plasmonic sensing, surface&#8208;enhanced spectroscopies, plasmonic nanolasing, and perfect light absorption. Lastly, the existing challenges and perspectives for metallic plasmonic arrays are discussed. The aim is to provide guidance for future development of metallic plasmonic array structures.

         <title>Metal Sulfide Photocatalysts for Lignocellulose Valorization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in metal&#8208;sulfide&#8208;based photocatalytic valorization of lignocellulose are reviewed. Structures, roles, and functioning mechanisms of metal sulfides in biomass conversions are carefully analyzed. The unique properties of metal sulfides in catalyzing C&#63743;O&#8208;bond cleavage, selective oxidation, C&#63743;C coupling, and C&#63743;H activation under light irradiation are highlighted and discussed to inspire future breakthroughs.








Abstract
Transition metal sulfides are an extraordinarily vital class of semiconductors with a wide range of applications in the photocatalytic field. A great number of recent advances in photocatalytic transformations of lignocellulosic biomass, the largest renewable carbon resource, into high&#8208;quality fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals has been achieved over metal sulfide semiconductors. Herein, the progress and breakthroughs in metal&#8208;sulfide&#8208;based photocatalytic systems for lignocellulose valorization with an emphasis on selective depolymerization of lignin and oxidative coupling of some important bioplatforms are highligted. The key issues that control reaction pathways and mechanisms are carefully examined. The functions of metal sulfides in the elementary reactions, including C&#63743;O&#8208;bond cleavage, selective oxidations, C&#63743;C coupling, and C&#63743;H activation, are discussed to offer insights to guide the rational design of active and selective photocatalysts for sustainable chemistry. The prospects of sulfide photocatalysts in biomass valorization are also analyzed and briefly discussed.

         <title>Cell/Bacteria&#8208;Based Bioactive Materials for Cancer Immune Modulation and Precision Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell/bacteria&#8208;based bioactive materials are summarized in terms of their structural components, engineered strategies, bioproperties, and functions. An overview of the biomedical applications of bioactive materials in tumor targeting delivery, immune modulation, and precise therapy is given, along with a series of successful case studies on tiny robots derived from cell/bacteria materials.








Abstract
Numerous clinical trials for cancer precision medicine research are limited due to the drug resistance, side effects, and low efficacy. Unsatisfactory outcomes are often caused by complex physiologic barriers and abnormal immune events in tumors, such as tumor target alterations and immunosuppression. Cell/bacteria&#8208;derived materials with unique bioactive properties have emerged as attractive tools for personalized therapy in cancer. Naturally derived bioactive materials, such as cell and bacterial therapeutic agents with native tropism or good biocompatibility, can precisely target tumors and effectively modulate immune microenvironments to inhibit tumors. Here, the recent advances in the development of cell/bacteria&#8208;based bioactive materials for immune modulation and&#160;precision therapy in cancer are summarized. Cell/bacterial constituents, including cell membranes, bacterial vesicles, and other active substances have inherited their unique targeting properties and antitumor capabilities. Strategies for engineering living cell/bacteria to overcome complex biological barriers and immunosuppression to promote antitumor efficacy are also summarized. Moreover, past and ongoing trials involving personalized bioactive materials and promising agents such as cell/bacteria&#8208;based micro/nano&#8208;biorobotics are further discussed, which may become another powerful tool for treatment in the near future.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State NMR and MRI Spectroscopy for Li/Na Batteries: Materials, Interface, and In Situ Characterization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex and coupled (electro) chemical processes complicate the investigation of the working and decay mechanisms of batteries. Solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR) and magnetic resonance imaging techniques exhibit unique capability in studying both the local environment and ionic dynamic issues in electrochemi cal energy materials and devices, including three key aspects: electrode/electrolyte materials, electrode/electrolyte interfaces, and in situ ssNMR.








Abstract
Enhancing the electrochemical performance of batteries, including the lifespan, energy, and power densities, is an everlasting quest for the rechargeable battery community. However, the dynamic and coupled (electro)chemical processes that occur in the electrode materials as well as at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces complicate the investigation of their working and decay mechanisms. Herein, the recent developments and applications of solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in Li/Na batteries are reviewed. Several typical cases including the applications of NMR spectroscopy for the investigation of the pristine structure and the dynamic structural evolution of materials are first emphasized. The NMR applications in analyzing the solid electrolyte interfaces (SEI) on the electrode are further concluded, involving the identification of SEI components and investigation of ionic motion through the interfaces. Beyond, the new development of in situ NMR and MRI techniques are highlighted, including their advantages, challenges, applications and the design principle of in situ cell. In the end, a prospect about how to use ssNMR in battery research from the perspectives of materials, interface, and in situ NMR, aiming at obtaining deeper insight of batteries with the assistance of ssNMR is represented.

         <title>Recent Progress in Advanced Electrocatalyst Design for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acidic oxygen evolution reaction is the key to realizing the application of proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzers. The most recent advances in advanced electrocatalysts for enhancing the acidic oxygen evolution reaction, including Ir&#8208;based, Ru&#8208;based, nonprecious&#8208;metal&#8208;based, and carbon&#8208;based nanostructures, are comprehensively summarized. The strategies summarized are of benefit for more advanced electrocatalysts design.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers hold great significance for renewable energy storage and conversion. The acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the main roadblocks that hinder the practical application of PEM water electrolyzers. Highly active, cost&#8208;effective, and durable electrocatalysts are indispensable for lowering the high kinetic barrier of OER to achieve boosted reaction kinetics. To date, a wide spectrum of advanced electrocatalysts has been designed and synthesized for enhanced acidic OER performance, though Ir and Ru based nanostructures still represent the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. In this Progress Report, recent research progress in advanced electrocatalysts for improved acidic OER performance is summarized. First, fundamental understanding about acidic OER including reaction mechanisms and atomic understanding to acidic OER for rational design of efficient electrocatalysts are discussed. Thereafter, an overview of the progress in the design and synthesis of advanced acidic OER electrocatalysts is provided in terms of catalyst category, i.e., metallic nanostructures (Ir and Ru based), precious metal oxides, nonprecious metal oxides, and carbon based nanomaterials. Finally, perspectives to the future development of acidic OER are provided from the aspects of reaction mechanism investigation and more efficient electrocatalyst design.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The links between the intrinsic charge&#8208;carrier behaviors of polyoxometalates (POMs) from a chemistry&#8208;oriented view are discussed and their recent ground&#8208;breaking developments in related areas, including molecular&#8208;level electronic devices, solar&#8208;driven, thermally driven, and electrochemically driven energy generation, conversion, and storage systems are  reviewed. Finally, present challenges and the fundamental insights for advanced design and self&#8208;assembly of POM building blocks are also discussed.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a series of molecular metal oxide clusters, which span the two domains of solutes and solid metal oxides. The unique characters of POMs in structure, geometry, and adjustable redox properties have attracted widespread attention in functional material synthesis, catalysis, electronic devices, and electrochemical energy storage and conversion. This review is focused on the links between the intrinsic charge carrier behaviors of POMs from a chemistry&#8208;oriented view and their recent ground&#8208;breaking developments in related areas. First, the advantageous charge transfer behaviors of POMs in molecular&#8208;level electronic devices are summarized. Solar&#8208;driven, thermal&#8208;driven, and electrochemical&#8208;driven charge carrier behaviors of POMs in energy generation, conversion and storage systems are also discussed. Finally, present challenges and fundamental insights are discussed as to the advanced design of functional systems based upon POM building blocks for their possible emerging application areas.

         <title>New Silk Road: From Mesoscopic Reconstruction/Functionalization to Flexible Meso&#8208;Electronics/Photonics Based on Cocoon Silk Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to the mesoscopic multi&#8208;levels of structures and the intermolecular nucleation control mechanism, a revolutionary materials strategy from mesoscopic reconstruction to the fabrication of new conceptual meso&#8208;electronic/photonic devices based on silk fibroin materials is presented. This development turns out to be very crucial in the field of flexible electronics, optics/photonics, and biomedical/healthcare, which leads to a New Silk Road in big health and the artificial intelligence era.








Abstract
Two of the key questions to be addressed are whether and how one can turn cocoon silk into fascinating materials with different electronic and optical functions so as to fabricate the flexible devices. In this review, a comprehensive overview of the unique strategy of mesoscopic functionalization starting from silk fibroin (SF) materials to the fabrication of various meso flexible SF devices is presented. Notably, SF materials with novel and enhanced properties can be achieved by mesoscopically reconstructing the hierarchical structures of SF materials. This is based on rerouting the refolding process of SF molecules by meso&#8208;nucleation templating. As&#8208;acquired functionalized SF materials can be applied to fabricate bio&#8208;compatible/degradable flexible/implantable meso&#8208;optical/electronic devices of various types. Consequently, functionalized SF can be fabricated into optical elements, that is, nonlinear photonic and fluorescent components, and make it possible to construct silk meso&#8208;electronics with high&#8208;performance. These advances enable the applications of SF&#8208;material based devices in the areas of physical and biochemical sensing, meso&#8208;memristors, transistors, brain electrodes, and energy generation/storage, applicable to on&#8208;skin long&#8208;term monitoring of human physiological conditions, and in&#8208;body sensing, information processing, and storage.

         <title>Conversion of Waste Plastics into Value&#8208;Added Carbonaceous Fuels under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several strategies including solar&#8208;driven conversion, enzyme&#8208;driven conversion, and low&#8208;temperature&#8208;driven catalytic conversion are developed for converting non&#8208;recyclable plastic wastes into value&#8208;added fuels under mild conditions.








Abstract
Owing to the extremely difficult breakage of the adamant cross&#8208;linked structures, converting non&#8208;recyclable plastic wastes into valuable fuels usually demands rigorous conditions, wherein the required high temperature and pressure is inevitably energy&#8208;wasting and environment&#8208;polluting. Given this aspect, herein, the recent achievements in the conversion of plastics into value&#8208;added carbonaceous fuels under mild conditions are summarized. In detail, solar&#8208;driven conversion of commercial plastics into liquid fuels in alkaline solutions or pure water at ambient temperature and pressure are surveyed; also, enzyme&#8208;driven conversion of polyethylene terephthalate into terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol at a mild temperature are emphasized; and low&#8208;temperature&#8208;driven catalytic conversion of polyethylene into oils and waxes with the help of a light alkane are reviewed. Finally, other potentially used strategies and in situ characterization technologies in plastics degradation under moderate conditions are presented.

         <title>Mechanoluminescence Rebrightening the Prospects of Stress Sensing: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanoluminescence&#8208;based stress sensing exhibits many advantages, including remoteness, spatial distribution, stretchability, biocompatibility, and self&#8208;powering. With great potential in wearable device, biomechanics, and engineering structure diagnosis applications, it is reasonable to believe that mechanoluminescence&#8208;based stress sensing may rebrighten the prospects of stress sensing.








Abstract
The emergence of new applications, such as in artificial intelligence, the internet of things, and biotechnology, has driven the evolution of stress sensing technology. For these emerging applications, stretchability, remoteness, stress distribution, a multimodal nature, and biocompatibility are important performance characteristics of stress sensors. Mechanoluminescence (ML)&#8208;based stress sensing has attracted widespread attention because of its characteristics of remoteness and having a distributed response to mechanical stimuli as well as its great potential for stretchability, biocompatibility, and self&#8208;powering. In the past few decades, great progress has been made in the discovery of ML materials, analysis of mechanisms, design of devices, and exploration of applications. One can find that with this progress, the focus of ML research has shifted from the phenomenon in the earliest stage to materials and recently toward devices. At the present stage, while showing great prospects for advanced stress sensing applications, ML&#8208;based sensing still faces major challenges in material optimization, device design, and system integration.

         <title>Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Battery Cathode Design: Tailoring Metal&#8208;Based Nanostructures for Robust Polysulfide Adsorption and Catalytic Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lithium&#8211;sulfur battery is the frontrunner technology for potential large&#8208;scale energy storage stemming from its high specific energy capacity and superior energy density. The transition metals, metal dichalcogenides, metal phosphides, metal oxides, metal carbides, metal nitrides, and others (e.g., metal phosphosulfides, metal hydroxides, metal&#8211;organic frameworks and hybrids), which can serve as robust cathodes for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries, are presented.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have a high specific energy capacity and density of 1675 mAh g&#8722;1 and 2670&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, respectively, rendering them among the most promising successors for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, there are myriads of obstacles in the practical application and commercialization of Li&#8208;S batteries, including the low conductivity of sulfur and its discharge products (Li2S/Li2S2), volume expansion of sulfur electrode, and the polysulfide shuttle effect. Hence, immense attention has been devoted to rectifying these issues, of which the application of metal&#8208;based compounds (i.e., transition metal, metal phosphides, sulfides, oxides, carbides, nitrides, phosphosulfides, MXenes, hydroxides, and metal&#8208;organic frameworks) as sulfur hosts is profiled as a fascinating strategy to hinder the polysulfide shuttle effect stemming from the polar&#8211;polar interactions between the metal compounds and polysulfides. This review encompasses the fundamental electrochemical principles of Li&#8208;S batteries and insights into the interactions between the metal&#8208;based compounds and the polysulfides, with emphasis on the intimate structure&#8211;activity relationship corroborated with theoretical calculations. Additionally, the integration of conductive carbon&#8208;based materials to ameliorate the existing adsorptive abilities of the metal&#8208;based compound is systematically discussed. Lastly, the challenges and prospects toward the smart design of catalysts for the future development of practical Li&#8208;S batteries are presented.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide perovskite nanocrystal (PNC)/polymer nanocomposites that combine the unique optoelectronic properties of PNCs and outstanding stability, flexibility, and processability enabled by polymers are an appealing class of material with many promising applications. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic strategies and intriguing properties of PNC/polymer nanocomposites, as well as their wide&#8208;ranging applications in light emision, sensing, and energy conversion areas are summarized.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) have recently garnered tremendous research interest due to their unique optoelectronic properties and promising applications in photovoltaics and optoelectronics. Metal halide PNCs can be combined with polymers to create nanocomposites that carry an array of advantageous characteristics. The polymer matrix can bestow stability, stretchability, and solution&#8208;processability while the PNCs maintain their size&#8208;, shape&#8208; and composition&#8208;dependent optoelectronic properties. As such, these nanocomposites possess great promise for next&#8208;generation displays, lighting, sensing, biomedical technologies, and energy conversion. The recent advances in metal halide PNC/polymer nanocomposites are summarized here. First, a variety of synthetic strategies for crafting PNC/polymer nanocomposites are discussed. Second, their array of intriguing properties is examined. Third, the broad range of applications of PNC/polymer nanocomposites is highlighted, including light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, and scintillators. Finally, an outlook on future research directions and challenges in this rapidly evolving field are presented.

         <title>Emerging Materials and Methods toward Ammonia&#8208;Based Energy Storage and Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>

The application of ammonia for energy storage and conversion raises demands for the improvement of existing technologies and development of new methods and materials. The recent advances of materials and methods toward ammonia synthesis, storage or separation, and utilization are presented. Key scientific challenges and perspectives are provided to stimulate further studies enabling ammonia&#8208;based sustainable energy supply in the future.








Abstract
Efficient storage and conversion of renewable energies is of critical importance to the sustainable growth of human society. With its distinguishing features of high hydrogen content, high energy density, facile storage/transportation, and zero&#8208;carbon emission, ammonia has been recently considered as a promising energy carrier for long&#8208;term and large&#8208;scale energy storage. Under this scenario, the synthesis, storage, and utilization of ammonia are key components for the implementation of ammonia&#8208;mediated energy system. Being different from fossil fuels, renewable energies normally have intermittent and variable nature, and thus pose demands on the improvement of existing technologies and simultaneously the development of alternative methods and materials for ammonia synthesis and storage. The energy release from ammonia in an efficient manner, on the other hand, is vital to achieve a sustainable energy supply and complete the nitrogen circle. Herein, recent advances in the thermal&#8208;, electro&#8208;, plasma&#8208;, and photocatalytic ammonia synthesis, ammonia storage or separation, ammonia thermal/electrochemical decomposition and conversion are summarized with the emphasis on the latest developments of new methods and materials (catalysts, electrodes, and sorbents) for these processes. The challenges and potential solutions are discussed.

         <title>Wide Bandgap Oxide Semiconductors: from Materials Physics to Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;bandgap oxide semiconductors uniquely combine electrical conductivity and optical transparency and are widely used in optoelectronic devices. The  materials physics of wide&#8208;bandgap oxide semiconductors, the recent progress in the design of new materials and novel thin&#8208;film transistor (TFT) devices, and current challenges and perspectives are reviewed.








Abstract
Wide bandgap oxide semiconductors constitute a unique class of materials that combine properties of electrical conductivity and optical transparency. They are being widely used as key materials in optoelectronic device applications, including flat&#8208;panel displays, solar cells, OLED, and emerging flexible and transparent electronics. In this article, an up&#8208;to&#8208;date review on both the fundamental understanding of materials physics of oxide semiconductors, and recent research progress on design of new materials and high&#8208;performing thin film transistor (TFT) devices in the context of fundamental understanding is presented. In particular, an in depth overview is first provided on current understanding of the electronic structures, defect and doping chemistry, optical and transport properties of oxide semiconductors, which provide essential guiding principles for new material design and device optimization. With these principles, recent advances in design of p&#8208;type oxide semiconductors, new approaches for achieving cost&#8208;effective transparent (flexible) electrodes, and the creation of high mobility 2D electron gas (2DEG) at oxide surfaces and interfaces with a wealth of fascinating physical properties of great potential for novel device design are then reviewed. Finally, recent progress and perspective of oxide TFT based on new oxide semiconductors, 2DEG, and low&#8208;temperature solution processed oxide semiconductor for flexible electronics will be reviewed.

         <title>Excited State Energy Transfer in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excited&#8208;state energy transfer in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) plays an important role in using these materials for photocatalysis, fluorescence sensing, and emission. Study of the energy transfer mechanism helps to design efficient and directional energy transfer paths in MOFs to meet the needs of artificial photosynthesis, high&#8208;performance chemical sensors, and novel exciton&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Excited state energy transfer in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is of great interest due to potential application of these materials in photocatalysis and fluorescence sensing. In photocatalysis, a light&#8208;harvesting antenna of MOFs can collect energy from a much larger area than a single reaction center and efficiently transport the energy to the active site to enhance photocatalytic efficiency, mimicking nature photosynthesis. In fluorescence sensing, excited state traveling on the framework can search for analyte quencher molecules to give amplified fluorescence quenching, so that one quencher turns off multiple excited states to enhance signal. Key to these designer performances is highly efficient energy transfer on these framework materials that are determined by types of excited states, dimension of the materials, and structure of the frameworks. Advancement of MOF synthetic chemistry provides new tools to control the rate and directionality of energy transfer in these materials, opening opportunities in manipulating excited states at an unprecedented level.

         <title>Challenges and Recent Advances in High Capacity Li&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials for High Energy Density Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 50, December 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The practical applications of Li&#8208;rich cathode materials, especially Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based (LRM) cathodes, are hindered by their inherent shortcomings. In this case, the recent understanding of complex reaction mechanisms, the novel modification methods, and the corresponding development trends are comprehensively reviewed. Additionally, other branches and the future opportunities of the Li&#8208;rich cathode materials are also summarized.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich cathode materials have attracted increasing attention because of their high reversible discharge capacity (&gt;250&#160;mA h g&#8722;1), which originates from transition metal (TM) ion redox reactions and unconventional oxygen anion redox reactions. However, many issues need to be addressed before their practical applications, such as their low kinetic properties and inefficient voltage fading. The development of cutting&#8208;edge technologies has led to cognitive advances in theory and offer potential solutions to these problems. Herein, a recent in&#8208;depth understanding of the mechanisms and the frontier electrochemical research progress of Li&#8208;rich cathodes are reviewed. In addition, recent advances associated with various strategies to promote the performance and the development of modification methods are discussed. In particular, excluding Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based (LRM) cathodes, other branches of the Li&#8208;rich cathode materials are also summarized. The consistent pursuit is to obtain energy storage devices with high capacity, reliable practicability, and absolute safety. The recent literature and ongoing efforts in this area are also described, which will create more opportunities and new ideas for the future development of Li&#8208;rich cathode materials.

         <title>Microbially Catalyzed Biomaterials for Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Urease&#8208;producing haloalkalophilic&#160;bacteria can be used as biocatalyst adhered to the surface of bioceramics to form a biomineral layer: urea as the substrate is converted to carbonate by bacterial catalysis, and the subsequently increased CO32&#8722; reacts with the Ca2+ existing around the bacterial cells, leading to the formation of micro/nanostructures on the biomaterials. The newly generated micro/nanostructures facilitated by bacteria promote bone&#8208;forming bioactivity.








Abstract
Bone is a complex mineralized tissue composed of various organic (proteins, cells) and inorganic (hydroxyapatite, calcium carbonate) substances with micro/nanoscale structures. To improve interfacial bioactivity of bone&#8208;implanted biomaterials, extensive efforts are being made to fabricate favorable biointerface via surface modification. Inspired by microbially catalyzed mineralization, a novel concept to biologically synthesize the micro/nanostructures on bioceramics, microbial&#8208;assisted catalysis, is presented. It involves three processes: bacterial adhesion on biomaterials, production of CO32&#8722; assisted by bacteria, and nucleation and growth of CaCO3 nanocrystals on the surface of bioceramics. The microbially catalyzed biominerals exhibit relatively uniform micro/nanostructures on the surface of both 2D and 3D &#945;&#8208;CaSiO3 bioceramics. The topographic and chemical cues of the grown micro/nanostructures present excellent in vitro and in vivo bone&#8208;forming bioactivity. The underlying mechanism is closely related to the activation of multiple biological processes associated with bone regeneration. The study offers a microbially catalytic concept and strategy of fabricating micro/nanostructured biomaterials for tissue regeneration.

         <title>Atmospheric Hygroscopic Ionogels with Dynamically Stable Cooling Interfaces Enable a Durable Thermoelectric Performance Enhancement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hygroscopic ionogel (RIG) is developed to dissipate waste heat from working thermoelectric generators (TEGs) through self&#8208;sustained evaporative cooling to efficiently enhance their electric output. Moreover, the well&#8208;designed adhesive property of the RIG ensures a stable cooling interface with the targeted TEGs surface either in static or dynamic conditions for a durable improvement of thermoelectric performance.








Abstract
In thermoelectric generator (TEG) systems, heat dissipation from their cold sides is an accessible, low&#8208;cost, and effective way to increase the temperature gap for their thermoelectric performance enhancement. Although significant efforts have been dedicated mediated by hygroscopic hydrogel coolers as self&#8208;sustained alternatives for effective heat removal, it still remains a challenge for overcoming instabilities in their cooling process. The inevitable mechanical deformation of these conventional hydrogels induced by excessive water desorption may cause a detached cooling interface with the targeted substrates, leading to undesirable cooling failure. Herein, a self&#8208;sustained and durable evaporative cooling approach for TEG enabled by atmospheric hygroscopic ionogels (RIGs) with stable interfaces to efficiently improve its thermoelectric performance is proposed. Owing to its superior hygroscopicity, the RIGs can achieve higher heat dissipation for TEG through water evaporation than that of common commercial metal heat sinks. Moreover, its favorable adhesion enables the RIG closely interact with the TEG surface either in static or dynamic conditions for a durable thermoelectric performance enhancement. It is believed that such a self&#8208;sustained evaporative cooling strategy based on the RIG will have great implications for the enhancement of TEG's efficiency, demonstrating a great promise in intermittent thermal&#8208;energy utilizations.

         <title>Thermoplastic Elastomer Tunes Phase Structure and Promotes Stretchability of High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of introducing low&#8208;cost commercial thermoplastic elastomer in the active layer is put forward to address the long&#8208;standing challenge of mechanical properties improvement of organic solar cells. Meanwhile, the morphology and mechanical performance of ternary blend films are effectively modulated and characterized with advanced scattering and microscopic techniques. This approach is effective to many kinds of high&#8208;efficiency polymer:nonfullerene systems.








Abstract
Top&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs) consisting of conjugated polymer donors and nonfullerene small molecule acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs) deliver rapid increases in efficiencies. Nevertheless, many of the polymer donors exhibit high stiffness and small molecule acceptors are very brittle, which limit their applications in wearable devices. Here, a simple and effective strategy is reported to improve the stretchability and reduce the stiffness of high&#8208;efficiency polymer:NF&#8208;SMA blends and simultaneously maintain the high efficiency by incorporating a low&#8208;cost commercial thermoplastic elastomer, polystyrene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(ethylene&#8208;ran&#8208;butylene)&#8208;block&#8208;polystyrene (SEBS). The microstructure, mechanical properties, and photovoltaic performance of PM6:N3 with varied SEBS contents and the molecular weight dependence of SEBS on microstructure and mechanical properties are thoroughly characterized. This strategy for mechanical performance improvement exhibits excellent applicability in some other OSC blend systems, e.g., PBQx&#8208;TF:eC9&#8208;2Cl and PBDB&#8208;T:ITIC. More crucially, the elastic modulus of such complex ternary blends can be nicely predicted by a mechanical model. Therefore, incorporating thermoplastic elastomers is a widely applicable and cost&#8208;effective strategy to improve mechanical properties of nonfullerene OSCs and beyond.

         <title>Amorphous VO2: A Pseudocapacitive Platform for High&#8208;Rate Symmetric Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide&#8208;window pseudocapacitive behavior in amorphous VO2 is reported, which allows the construction of a new pseudocapacitive&#8208;mechanism&#8208;enabled symmetric battery to mitigate the slow kinetics and cycling limitations of previous phase&#8208;transition&#8208;mechanism&#8208;based symmetric devices. Attractive safety superiority is illustrated in the new symmetric device, including high tolerance in overcharging, overdischarging, polarity reversal, and large&#8208;current operation.








Abstract
Among the various VO2 polymorphs, the layered compound, VO2(B), has been the most widely investigated lithium&#8208;ion battery electrode material. For sodium&#8208;ion electrodes, however, an amorphous solid may be more advantageous as a result of the open framework to facilitate ion insertion and the ability to tolerate volumetric changes. Herein, it is shown that the Na+ insertion properties of amorphous VO2 (a&#8208;VO2) are superior to those of crystalline VO2(B). Amorphous VO2 exhibits a linear voltage characteristic over a 3 V range (4.0 to 1.0&#160;V vs Na/Na+) leading to a reversible capacity as high as 400 mAh g&#8722;1 and rapid redox kinetics, which is attributed to its pseudocapacitive nature. The linear voltage characteristic over 3 V affords the opportunity of fabricating a symmetric Na&#8208;ion battery in which the a&#8208;VO2 material serves as both the positive electrode and the negative electrode. Such a symmetric battery offers safer operation in terms of overcharging, overdischarging, polarity reversal, high charge/discharge current abuse, and long&#8208;term usage. The results suggest that amorphous transition metal oxides may offer advantageous attributes for rapid, safe, and energy&#8208;dense storage.

         <title>Optimized Photoclick (Bio)Resins for Fast Volumetric Bioprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Volumetric printing enables the generation of centimeter&#8208;sized free&#8208;form 3D objects within seconds. Optimized photoclick&#8208;based photoresins show ideal biophysical and photochemical properties resulting in fast and biocompatible volumetric bioprinting. Thiol&#8211;norbornene photo&#8208;crosslinking outperforms chain&#8208;growth systems permitting significant reduction of radical generation and polymer concentration. This simple and scalable synthesis method opens new avenues for widespread use of photoclick resins in light&#8208;mediated biofabrication.








Abstract
Volumetric printing (VP) is a light&#8208;mediated technique enabling printing of complex, low&#8208;defect 3D objects within seconds, overcoming major drawbacks of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer additive manufacturing. An optimized photoresin is presented for VP in the presence of cells (volumetric bioprinting) based on fast thiol&#8211;ene step&#8208;growth photoclick crosslinking. Gelatin&#8208;norbornene (Gel&#8208;NB) photoresin shows superior performance, both in physicochemical and biocompatibility aspects, compared to (meth&#8208;)acryloyl resins. The extremely efficient thiol&#8211;norbornene reaction produces the fastest VP reported to date (&#8776;10 s), with significantly lower polymer content, degree of substitution (DS), and radical species, making it more suitable for cell encapsulation.

     alt="Optimized Photoclick (Bio)Resins for Fast Volumetric Bioprinting"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volumetric printing enables the generation of centimeter-sized free-form 3D objects within seconds. Optimized photoclick-based photoresins show ideal biophysical and photochemical properties resulting in fast and biocompatible volumetric bioprinting. Thiol&#8211;norbornene photo-crosslinking outperforms chain-growth systems permitting significant reduction of radical generation and polymer concentration. This simple and scalable synthesis method opens new avenues for widespread use of photoclick resins in light-mediated biofabrication.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volumetric printing (VP) is a light-mediated technique enabling printing of complex, low-defect 3D objects within seconds, overcoming major drawbacks of layer-by-layer additive manufacturing. An optimized photoresin is presented for VP in the presence of cells (volumetric bioprinting) based on fast thiol&#8211;ene step-growth photoclick crosslinking. Gelatin-norbornene (Gel-NB) photoresin shows superior performance, both in physicochemical and biocompatibility aspects, compared to (meth-)acryloyl resins. The extremely efficient thiol&#8211;norbornene reaction produces the fastest VP reported to date (&#8776;10 s), with significantly lower polymer content, degree of substitution (DS), and radical species, making it more suitable for cell encapsulation. This approach enables the generation of cellular free-form constructs with excellent cell viability (&#8776;100%) and tissue maturation potential, demonstrated by development of contractile myotubes. Varying the DS, polymer content, thiol&#8211;ene ratio, and thiolated crosslinker allows fine-tuning of mechanical properties over a broad stiffness range (&#8776;40&#160;Pa to &#8776;15&#160;kPa). These properties are achieved through fast and scalable methods for producing Gel-NB with inexpensive, off-the-shelf reagents that can help establish it as the gold standard for light-mediated biofabrication techniques. With potential applications from high-throughput bioprinting of tissue models to soft robotics and regenerative medicine, this work paves the way for exploitation of VPs unprecedented capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Motivated SnO2/TiO2 Heterojunctions Enabling the Breakthrough in Energy Density for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoaccelerated rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) employing SnO2/TiO2 heterojunction nanoarrays as a multifunctional anode is demonstrated. The lithiation kinetics and reversibility are greatly enhanced, leading to 1.8 times increase in areal specific capacity without attenuation even for 100 cycles. This finding exhibits a feasible pathway to break the energy density of LIBs by conversion and storage of solar energy.








Abstract
Powering lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) by light&#8208;irradiation will bring a paradigm shift in energy&#8208;storage technologies. Herein, a photoaccelerated rechargeable LIB employing SnO2/TiO2 heterojunction nanoarrays as a multifunctional anode is developed. The electron&#8211;hole pairs generated by the LixTiO2 (x&#160;&#8805; 0) under light irradiation synergistically enhance the lithiation kinetics and electrochemical reversibility of both SnO2 and TiO2. Specifically, the electrons can quickly pour into the SnO2 and the generated Sn due to the more positive conduction band potentials (vs TiO2), and mean while the holes also promote the intercalation of Li+ into TiO2 by reaching charge balance. A remarkable increase in areal specific capacity is therefore achieved from 1.91 to 3.47 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. More impressively, there is no capacity loss even through 100 cycles, which is the best report for photorechargeable LIBs to date, owing to the strong and stable photoresponse current. This finding exhibits a feasible pathway to break the limitation in the energy density of LIBs by the efficient conversion and storage of solar energy.

         <title>A Morphologically Stable Li/Electrolyte Interface for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries Enabled by 3D&#8208;Micropatterned Garnet</title>

         <dc:description>
Morphological degradation at the Li/solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) interface is a prevalent issue causing performance fading of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. A novel 3D&#8208;micropatterned SSE that can stabilize the morphology of the Li/SSE interface under relatively high current density and limited stack pressure is reported. The stabilization is achieved by utilizing the synergistic effect of electrochemical and mechanical modifications at the Li/SSE interface.








Abstract
Morphological degradation at the Li/solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) interface is a prevalent issue causing performance fading of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). To maintain the interfacial integrity, most ASSBs are operated under low current density with considerable stack pressure, which significantly limits their widespread usage. Herein, a novel 3D&#8208;micropatterned SSE (3D&#8208;SSE) that can stabilize the morphology of the Li/SSE interface even under relatively high current density and limited stack pressure is reported. Under the pressure of 1.0&#160;MPa, the Li symmetric cell using a garnet&#8208;type 3D&#8208;SSE fabricated by laser machining shows a high critical current density of 0.7&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 and stable cycling over 500 h under 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8211;2. This excellent performance is attributed to the reduced local current density and amplified mechanical stress at the Li/3D&#8208;SSE interface. These two effects can benefit the flux balance between Li stripping and creep at the interface, thereby preventing interfacial degradation such as void formation and dendrite growth.

         <title>Rippling Ferroic Phase Transition and Domain Switching In 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ripples are strongly coupled with ferroic orders in 2D ferroics. Taking monolayer ferroelectric&#8211;ferroelastic GeSe as an example, it is shown that rippling ferroic phase transition and domain switching can render ultrahigh piezoelectric performance over a broad temperature range in 2D materials. This provides valuable guidance for ripple engineering in 2D materials with potential applications in 2D flexible electronics.








Abstract
Ripples are a class of native structural defects widely existing in 2D materials. They originate from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane flexibility of 2D materials introducing spatially evolving electronic structure and friction behavior. However, the effect of ripples on 2D ferroics has not been reported. Here a molecular dynamics study of the effect of ripples on the temperature&#8208;induced ferroic phase transition and stress&#8208;induced ferroic domain switching in ferroelastic&#8208;ferroelectric monolayer GeSe is presented. Ripples stabilize the short&#8208;range ferroic orders in the high&#8208;temperature phase with stronger ferroicity and longer lifetime, thereby increasing the transition temperature upon cooling. In addition, ripples significantly affect the domain switching upon loading, changing it from a highly correlated process into a ripple&#8208;driven localized one where ripples act as source of dynamical random stress. These results reveal the fundamental role of ripples on 2D ferroicity and provide theoretical guidance for ripple engineering of controlled phase transition and domain switching with potential applications in flexible 2D electronics.

         <title>An Antipulverization and High&#8208;Continuity Lithium Metal Anode for High&#8208;Energy Lithium Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
An antipulverization and high&#8208;continuity lithium metal anode comprising a small number of solid&#8208;state electrolyte nanoparticles as conformal/sacrificial fillers and a copper foil as supporting current collector is proposed to improve the lithium electrode stability and extend the cyclability of batteries.








Abstract
Lithium metal is one of the most promising anode candidates for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy batteries. Nevertheless, lithium pulverization and associated loss of electrical contact remain significant challenges. Here, an antipulverization and high&#8208;continuity lithium metal anode comprising a small number of solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) nanoparticles as conformal/sacrificial fillers and a copper (Cu) foil as the supporting current collector is reported. Guiding by the SSE, this new anode facilitates lithium nucleation, contributing to form a roundly shaped, micro&#8208;sized, and dendrite&#8208;free electrode during cycling, which effectively mitigates the lithium dendrite growth. The embedded Cu current collector in the hybrid anode not only reinforces the mechanical strength but also improves the efficient charge transfer among active lithium filaments, affording good electrode structural integrity and electrical continuity. As a result, this antipulverization and high&#8208;continuity lithium anode delivers a high average Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99.6% for 300 cycles under a current density of 1 mA cm&#8722;2. Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (elemental sulfur or sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathodes) equipped with this anode show high&#8208;capacity retentions in their corresponding ether&#8208;based or carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, respectively. This new electrode provides important insight into the design of electrodes that may experience large volume variation during operations.

         <title>High&#8208;Specificity In Vivo Tumor Imaging Using Bioorthogonal NIR&#8208;IIb Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal lanthanide&#8208;based nanoprobes are developed for deep&#8208;tissue NIR&#8208;IIb imaging and MRI with high tumor&#8208;targeting specificity. These bioorthogonal nanoprobes offer a 20&#8208;fold increase in the NIR&#8208;IIb imaging signal and a 2&#8208;fold increase in the MRI signal, compared with non&#8208;orthogonal probes.








Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;based NIR&#8208;IIb nanoprobes are ideal for in vivo imaging. However, existing NIR&#8208;IIb nanoprobes often suffer from low tumor&#8208;targeting specificity, limiting their widespread use. Here the application of bioorthogonal nanoprobes with high tumor&#8208;targeting specificity for in vivo NIR&#8208;IIb luminescence imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is reported. These dual&#8208;modality nanoprobes can enhance NIR&#8208;IIb emission by 20&#8208;fold and MRI signal by twofold, compared with non&#8208;bioorthogonal nanoprobes in murine subcutaneous tumors. Moreover, these bioorthogonal probes enable orthotopic brain tumor imaging. Implementation of bio&#8208;orthogonal chemistry significantly reduces the nanoprobe dose and hence cytotoxicity, providing a paradigm for real&#8208;time in vivo visualization of tumors.

         <title>ZnS@BSA Nanoclusters Potentiate Efficacy of Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnS@BSA (bovine serum albumin) nanoclusters can promote reactive oxygen species accumulation and activate cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8211;adenosine monophosphate synthase/interferon gene stimulator signals in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), further suppressing tumor growth with more immune cells infiltration, which can serve as a new strategy for immunotherapy of HCC.








Abstract
Although immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint inhibitors has shown promising efficacy in cancer treatment, the responsiveness among patients is relatively limited. Activation of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8208;adenosine monophosphate synthase/interferon gene stimulator (cGAS/STING) signaling pathway to upregulate innate immunity has become an emerging strategy for enhancing tumor immunotherapy. Herein, ZnS@BSA (bovine serum albumin) nanoclusters synthesized via a self&#8208;assembly approach are reported, where the released zinc ions under acidic tumor microenvironment significantly enhance cGAS/STING signals. Meanwhile, intracellular zinc ions can produce reactive oxygen species, which is further facilitated by the generated H2S gas from ZnS@BSA via specifically inhibiting catalase in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. It is found that the nanoclusters activate the cGAS/STING signals in mice, which promotes the infiltration of CD8+ T cells at the tumor site and cross&#8208;presentation of dendritic cells, leading to an improved immunotherapy efficacy against hepatocellular carcinoma.

         <title>Construction of Carbon Dots with Color&#8208;Tunable Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission by Nitrogen&#8208;Induced Intramolecular Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots (CDs) with multicolor aggregation&#8208;induced emission exhibit dual fluorescence emission at 480 and 580&#160;nm, which is related to the S&#63743;S bonds of DTSA and the conjugated structure attached to C&#63742;O/C&#63742;N bonds, respectively. With the increase of C&#63742;N content from 35.6% to 58.4%, the intramolecular charge transfer efficiency increases from 8.71% to 45.94%, changing the fluorescence of the CDs from green to red.








Abstract
As one of the most promising fluorescent nanomaterials, the fluorescence of carbon dots (CDs) in solution is extensively studied. Nevertheless, the synthesis of multicolor solid&#8208;state fluorescence (SSF) CDs is rarely reported. Herein, CDs with multicolor aggregation&#8208;induced emission are prepared using amine molecules, all of them exhibiting dual fluorescence emission at 480&#160;nm (Em&#8208;1) and 580&#8211;620&#160;nm (Em&#8208;2), which is related to the S&#63743;S bonds of dithiosalicylic acid and the conjugated structure attached to C&#63742;O/C&#63742;N bonds, respectively. As a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing group, the increase of C&#63742;N content makes dual&#8208;fluorescent groups on the surface of CDs produce push and pull electrons, which determines intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the double emission. With the increase in C&#63742;N content from 35.6% to 58.4%, the ICT efficiency increases from 8.71% to 45.94%, changing the fluorescence of CDs from green to red. The increase of ICT efficiency causes fluorescence quantum yield enhancement by nearly five times and redshift of the fluorescence peak. Finally, based on the multicolor luminescence properties induced by the aggregation of CDs, pattern encryption and white&#8208;LED devices are realized. Based on the fat solubility and strong ultraviolet absorption characteristics of CDs, fingerprint detection and leaf anti&#8208;UV hazards are applied.

         <title>Dynamically Tuneable Reflective Structural Coloration with Electroactive Conducting Polymer Nanocavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemically tuneable structural coloration is demonstrated based on an optical cavity with a conducting polymer based on thienothiophene as an electroactive spacer layer. Synergistic effects of optical properties and thickness changes enable low&#8208;voltage tuning of the structural color across the whole visible range with high and similar reflectance for all the redox states.








Abstract
Dynamic control of structural colors across the visible spectrum with high brightness has proven to be a difficult challenge. Here, this is addressed with a tuneable reflective nano&#8208;optical cavity that uses an electroactive conducting polymer (poly(thieno[3,4&#8208;b]thiophene)) as spacer layer. Electrochemical doping and dedoping of the polymer spacer layer provides reversible tuning of the cavity's structural color throughout the entire visible range and beyond. Furthermore, the cavity provides high peak reflectance that varies only slightly between the reduced and oxidized states of the polymer. The results indicate that the polymer undergoes large reversible thickness changes upon redox tuning, aided by changes in optical properties and low visible absorption. The electroactive cavity concept may find particular use in reflective displays, by opening for tuneable monopixels that eliminate limitations in brightness of traditional subpixel&#8208;based systems.

         <title>N&#8208;Type Surface Design for p&#8208;Type CZTSSe Thin Film to Attain High Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An n&#8208;type surface is realized successfully on p&#8208;type CZTSSe thin film by controlling the Ag distribution using Ag2ZnSnS4/Al2O3/CZTS precursors. The photogenerated charge collection is improved and the interface recombination is suppressed, thus significantly improving the conversion efficiency of the CZTSSe solar cells.








Abstract
As a low&#8208;cost substitute that uses no expensive rare&#8208;earth elements for the high&#8208;efficiency Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 solar cell, the Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cell has borrowed optimization strategies used for its predecessor to improve its device performance, including a profiled band gap and surface inversion. Indeed, there have been few reports of constructing CZTSSe absorber layers with surface inversion to improve efficiency. Here, a strategy that designs the CZTSSe absorber to attain surface modification by using n&#8208;type Ag2ZnSnS4 is demonstrated. It has been discovered that Ag plays two major roles in the kesterite thin film devices: surface inversion and front gradient distribution. It has not only an excellent carrier transport effect and reduced probability of electron&#8208;hole recombination but also results in increased carrier separation by increasing the width of the depletion region, leading to much improved VOC and JSC. Finally, a champion CZTSSe solar cell renders efficiency as high as 12.55%, one of the highest for its type, with the open&#8208;circuit voltage deficit reduced to as low as 0.306&#160;V (63.2% Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit). The band engineering for surface modification of the absorber and high efficiency achieved here shine a new light on the future of the CZTSSe solar cell.

The photogenerated charge collection is improved and the interface recombination is suppressed, thus significantly improving the conversion efficiency of the CZTSSe solar cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a low-cost substitute that uses no expensive rare-earth elements for the high-efficiency Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solar cell, the Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnSn(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (CZTSSe) solar cell has borrowed optimization strategies used for its predecessor to improve its device performance, including a profiled band gap and surface inversion. Indeed, there have been few reports of constructing CZTSSe absorber layers with surface inversion to improve efficiency. Here, a strategy that designs the CZTSSe absorber to attain surface modification by using n-type Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnSnS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is demonstrated. It has been discovered that Ag plays two major roles in the kesterite thin film devices: surface inversion and front gradient distribution. It has not only an excellent carrier transport effect and reduced probability of electron-hole recombination but also results in increased carrier separation by increasing the width of the depletion region, leading to much improved &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;. Finally, a champion CZTSSe solar cell renders efficiency as high as 12.55%, one of the highest for its type, with the open-circuit voltage deficit reduced to as low as 0.306&#160;V (63.2% Shockley-Queisser limit). The band engineering for surface modification of the absorber and high efficiency achieved here shine a new light on the future of the CZTSSe solar cell.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multifunctional Macroassembled Graphene Nanofilms with High Crystallinity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crystalline macroassembled graphene nanofilms prepared by a camphor&#8208;assisted cooling&#8211;contraction strategy show excellent physical properties and advantages in high&#8208;performance electronic and optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
A &#8220;cooling&#8211;contraction&#8221; method to separate large&#8208;area (up to 4.2&#160;cm in lateral size) graphene oxide (GO)&#8208;assembled films (of nanoscale thickness) from substrates is reported. Heat treatment at 3000&#160;&#176;C of such free&#8208;standing macroscale films yields highly crystalline &#8220;macroassembled graphene nanofilms&#8221; (nMAGs) with 16&#8211;48&#160;nm thickness. These nMAGs present tensile strength of 5.5&#8211;11.3&#160;GPa (with &#8776;3&#160;&#181;m gauge length), electrical conductivity of 1.8&#8211;2.1 MS m&#8722;1, thermal conductivity of 2027&#8211;2820 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, and carrier relaxation time up to &#8776;23&#160;ps. As a demonstration application, an nMAG&#8208;based sound&#8208;generator shows a 30 &#181;s response and sound pressure level of 89&#160;dB at 1 W cm&#8722;2. A THz metasurface fabricated from nMAG has a light response of 8.2% for 0.159 W mm&#8722;2 and can detect down to 0.01&#160;ppm of glucose. The approach provides a straightforward way to form highly crystallized graphene nanofilms from low&#8208;cost GO sheets.

         <title>Conductive CuCo&#8208;Based Bimetal Organic Framework for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductive bimetal&#8208;based catecholate (CAT) nanorod arrays show excellent hydrogen evolution reaction activities in both alkaline and neutral electrolyte, comparable to that of the benchmark Pt/C. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the incorporation of Co not only optimizes the &#916;GH* and the adsorption energy of water (&#916;EH2O) of Cu&#8208;CAT, but also increases the electrical conductivity of Cu&#8208;CAT.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with intrinsically porous structures and well&#8208;dispersed metal sites are promising candidates for electrocatalysis; however, the catalytic efficiencies of most MOFs are significantly limited by their impertinent adsorption/desorption energy of intermediates formed during electrocatalysis and very low electrical conductivity. Herein, Co is introduced into conductive Cu&#8208;catecholate (Cu&#8208;CAT) nanorod arrays directly grown on a flexible carbon cloth for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Electrochemical results show that the Co&#8208;incorporated Cu&#8208;CAT nanorod arrays only need 52 and 143&#160;mV overpotentials to drive a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline and neutral media for HER, respectively, much lower than most of the reported non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts and comparable to the benchmark Pt/C electrocatalyst. Density functional theory calculations show that the introduction of Co can optimize the adsorption energy of hydrogen (&#916;GH*) of Cu sites, almost close to that of Pt (111). Furthermore, the adsorption energy of water (&#916;EH2O) of Co sites in the CuCo&#8208;CAT is significantly lower than that of Cu sites upon coupling Cu with Co, effectively accelerating the Volmer step in the HER process. The findings, synergistic effect of bimetals, open a new avenue for the rational design of highly efficient MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Co2&#8211;N6 and Fe&#8211;N4 Costructures Boost Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Both Alkaline and Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ternary&#8208;atom electrocatalyst, in which atomically dispersed Co2&#8211;N6 and Fe&#8211;N4 sites are coanchored on N&#8208;doped carbon hosts (derived from reaction with ZIF&#8208;8), is synthesized. Synergistic effect is explicitly unraveled, which induces higher filling degree of Fe d&#8208;orbitals and outstanding oxygen reduction reaction activity in both alkaline and acidic media.








Abstract
Polynary transition&#8208;metal atom catalysts are promising to supersede platinum (Pt)&#8208;based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Regulating the local configuration of atomic catalysts is the key to catalyst performance enhancement. Different from the previously reported single&#8208;atom or dual&#8208;atom configurations, a new type of ternary&#8208;atom catalyst, which consists of atomically dispersed, nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Co&#8211;Co dimers, and Fe single sites (i.e., Co2&#8211;N6 and Fe&#8211;N4 structures) that are coanchored on highly graphitized carbon supports is developed. This unique atomic ORR catalyst outperforms the catalysts with only Co2&#8211;N6 or Fe&#8211;N4 sites in both alkaline and acid conditions. Density functional theory calculations clearly unravels the synergistic effect of the Co2&#8211;N6 and Fe&#8211;N4 sites, which can induce higher filling degree of Fe&#8211;d orbitals and favors the binding capability to *OH intermediates (the rate determining step). This ternary&#8208;atom catalyst may be a promising alternative to Pt to drive the cathodic ORR in zinc&#8211;air batteries.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered InP Nanowire Photodetector for Single&#8208;Photon Level Detection at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;powered InP nanowire array photodetector that can achieve single&#8208;photon&#8208;level light detection at room temperature without an external bias is reported. This is enabled by an optimized radial p&#8211;n heterojunction nanowire array design to realize near&#8208;ideal broadband absorption, extremely low dark current, and highly efficient charge carrier separation.








Abstract
Highly sensitive photodetectors with single&#8208;photon level detection are one of the key components to a range of emerging technologies, in particular the ever&#8208;growing field of optical communication, remote sensing, and quantum computing. Currently, most of the single&#8208;photon detection technologies require external biasing at high voltages and/or cooling to low temperatures, posing great limitations for wider applications. Here, InP nanowire array photodetectors that can achieve single&#8208;photon level light detection at room temperature without an external bias are demonstrated. Top&#8208;down etched, heavily doped p&#8208;type InP nanowires and n&#8208;type aluminium&#8208;doped zinc oxide (AZO)/zinc oxide (ZnO) carrier&#8208;selective contact are used to form a radial p&#8211;n junction with a built&#8208;in electric field exceeding 3 &#215; 105&#160;V cm&#8722;1&#160;at 0&#160;V. The device exhibits broadband light sensitivity and can distinguish a single photon per pulse from the dark noise at 0&#160;V, enabled by its design to realize near&#8208;ideal broadband absorption, extremely low dark current, and highly efficient charge carrier separation. Meanwhile, the bandwidth of the device reaches above 600&#160;MHz with a timing jitter of 538&#160;ps. The proposed device design provides a new pathway toward low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;sensitivity, self&#8208;powered photodetectors for numerous future applications.

This is enabled by an optimized radial p&#8211;n heterojunction nanowire array design to realize near-ideal broadband absorption, extremely low dark current, and highly efficient charge carrier separation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly sensitive photodetectors with single-photon level detection are one of the key components to a range of emerging technologies, in particular the ever-growing field of optical communication, remote sensing, and quantum computing. Currently, most of the single-photon detection technologies require external biasing at high voltages and/or cooling to low temperatures, posing great limitations for wider applications. Here, InP nanowire array photodetectors that can achieve single-photon level light detection at room temperature without an external bias are demonstrated. Top-down etched, heavily doped p-type InP nanowires and n-type aluminium-doped zinc oxide (AZO)/zinc oxide (ZnO) carrier-selective contact are used to form a radial p&#8211;n junction with a built-in electric field exceeding 3 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;at 0&#160;V. The device exhibits broadband light sensitivity and can distinguish a single photon per pulse from the dark noise at 0&#160;V, enabled by its design to realize near-ideal broadband absorption, extremely low dark current, and highly efficient charge carrier separation. Meanwhile, the bandwidth of the device reaches above 600&#160;MHz with a timing jitter of 538&#160;ps. The proposed device design provides a new pathway toward low-cost, high-sensitivity, self-powered photodetectors for numerous future applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Enzyme Mixtures to Realize Near&#8208;Complete Depolymerization in Biodegradable Polymer/Additive Blends</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
When enzymes with deep, narrow active sites are embedded inside of plastics, chain&#8208;end&#8208;mediated processive depolymerization is realized. However, polymer additives can induce bending in crystalline lamellae, which causes chain ends to preferentially segregate at the crystal/amorphous interface where they are inaccessible for enzyme binding. Synergistic enzyme mechanisms can be exploited to create new chain ends and facilitate near&#8208;complete depolymerization.








Abstract
Embedding catalysts inside of plastics affords accelerated chemical modification with programmable latency and pathways. Nanoscopically embedded enzymes can lead to near&#8208;complete degradation of polyesters via chain&#8208;end mediated processive depolymerization. The overall degradation rate and pathways have a strong dependence on the morphology of semicrystalline polyesters. Yet, most studies to date focus on pristine polymers instead of mixtures that contain additives and other components despite their nearly universal use in plastic production. Here, additives are introduced to purposely change the morphology of polycaprolactone (PCL) by increasing the bending and twisting of crystalline lamellae. These morphological changes immobilize chain ends preferentially at the crystalline/amorphous interfaces and limit chain&#8208;end accessibility by the embedded processive enzyme. This chain&#8208;end redistribution reduces the polymer&#8208;to&#8208;monomer conversion from &gt;95%&#160;to less than 50%, causing formation of highly crystalline plastic pieces, including microplastics. By synergizing both random chain scission and processive depolymerization, it is feasible to navigate morphological changes in polymer/additive blends and to achieve near&#8208;complete depolymerization. The random scission enzymes in the amorphous domains create new chain ends that are subsequently bound and depolymerized by processive enzymes. Present studies further highlight the importance to consider how the host polymer's morphologies affect the reactions catalyzed by embedded catalytic species.

         <title>Physical Disruption of Solid Tumors by Immunostimulatory Microrobots Enhances Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micromotors coated with bacterial membrane are utilized for combinatorial cancer therapy. Upon intratumoral administration, the micromotors induce irreversible physical damage to the tumor tissue, while the immunostimulatory membrane recruits host immune cells to process tumor antigens in situ. Treatment of solid tumors using this platform results in robust antitumor immunity that can also control the growth of distant secondary tumors.








Abstract
The combination of immunotherapy with other forms of treatment is an emerging strategy for boosting antitumor responses. By combining multiple modes of action, these combinatorial therapies can improve clinical outcomes through unique synergisms. Here, a microrobot&#8208;based strategy that integrates tumor tissue disruption with biological stimulation is shown for cancer immunotherapy. The microrobot is fabricated by loading bacterial outer membrane vesicles onto a self&#8208;propelling micromotor, which can react with water to generate a propulsion force. When administered intratumorally to a solid tumor, the disruption of the local tumor tissue coupled with the delivery of an immunostimulatory payload leads to complete tumor regression. Additionally, treatment of the primary tumor results in the simultaneous education of the host immune system, enabling it to control the growth of distant tumors. Overall, this work introduces a distinct application of microrobots in cancer immunotherapy and offers an attractive strategy for amplifying cancer treatment efficacy when combined with conventional therapies.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Dependent Intermediate Adsorption Modulation on Iridium&#8208;Modified Black Phosphorus Electrocatalysts for Efficient pH&#8208;Universal Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient iridium&#8208;modified 2D black phosphorus electrocatalyst is rationally designed to achieve the desired adsorption energies toward catalytic intermediates, and the resultant catalyst demonstrates outstanding pH&#8208;universal water splitting performances, surpassing the commercially dominating catalysts. Furthermore, an interesting surface&#8208;dependent activity enhancement mechanism is identified.








Abstract
2D black phosphorus (BP) is one promising electrocatalyst toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis. The too strong adsorption of oxygen intermediates during OER, while the too weak adsorption of hydrogen intermediate during HER, however, greatly compromise its practical water splitting applications with overpotentials as high as 450&#160;mV for OER and 420&#160;mV for HER to achieve 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 under alkaline conditions. Herein, by rationally introducing the nanosized iridium (Ir) modifier together with optimized exposing surface toward electrolytes, an efficient Ir&#8208;modified BP electrocatalyst with much favorable adsorption energies toward catalytic intermediates possesses an outstanding pH&#8208;universal water splitting performance, surpassing the nearly all reported BP&#8208;based catalysts and the commercial noble&#8208;metal catalysts. The Ir&#8208;modified BP catalyst with the optimized exposed surfaces only requires an overall cell voltage of 1.54 and 1.57&#160;V to achieve 10 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acidic and alkaline electrolysers, respectively. This design uncovers the potential applications of 2D BP in practical electrocatalysis fields via decreasing reaction intermediate adsorption energy barriers and promoting the interfacial electron coupling for heterostructured catalysts, and offers new insights into the surface&#8208;dependent activity enhancement mechanism.

         <title>Fluorescent Nanozeolite Receptors for the Highly Selective and Sensitive Detection of Neurotransmitters in Water and Biofluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent artificial receptors that bind neurotransmitters with unprecedented affinity and selectivity in biofluids are introduced. They are based on nanozeolite hybrid materials and can be used for emission&#8208; and absorbance&#8208;based detection of serotonin and dopamine in urine at physiological relevant concentration, for (two&#8208;photon) imaging, and for label&#8208;free enzymatic reaction monitoring in real time.








Abstract
The design and preparation of synthetic binders (SBs) applicable for small biomolecule sensing in aqueous media remains very challenging. SBs designed by the lock&#8208;and&#8208;key principle can be selective for their target analyte but usually show an insufficient binding strength in water. In contrast, SBs based on symmetric macrocycles with a hydrophobic cavity can display high binding affinities but generally suffer from indiscriminate binding of many analytes. Herein, a completely new and modular receptor design strategy based on microporous hybrid materials is presented yielding zeolite&#8208;based artificial receptors (ZARs) which reversibly bind the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine with unprecedented affinity and selectivity even in saline biofluids. ZARs are thought to uniquely exploit both the non&#8208;classical hydrophobic effect and direct non&#8208;covalent recognition motifs, which is supported by in&#8208;depth photophysical, and calorimetric experiments combined with full atomistic modeling. ZARs are thermally and chemically robust and can be readily prepared at gram scales. Their applicability for the label&#8208;free monitoring of important enzymatic reactions, for (two&#8208;photon) fluorescence imaging, and for high&#8208;throughput diagnostics in biofluids is demonstrated. This study showcases that artificial receptor based on microporous hybrid materials can overcome standing limitations of synthetic chemosensors, paving the way towards personalized diagnostics and metabolomics.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Palladium&#8208;Based Nanocrystals with Different Crystal Phases and a Comparison of Their Catalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is a strong interest in developing phase&#8208;controlled metal nanocrystals to enhance their catalytic activity. In this work, template&#8208;directed growth is used to synthesize Ru@Pd nanocrystals with the Pd shells in either an fcc or hcp phase, and their catalytic properties are compared.








Abstract
A relatively unexplored aspect of noble&#8208;metal nanomaterials is polymorphism, or their ability to crystallize in different crystal phases. Here, a method is reported for the facile synthesis of Ru@Pd core&#8211;shell nanocrystals featuring polymorphism, with the core made of hexagonally close&#8208;packed (hcp)&#8208;Ru while the Pd shell takes either an hcp or face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phase. The polymorphism shows a dependence on the shell thickness, with shells thinner than &#8776;1.4&#160;nm taking the hcp phase whereas the thicker ones revert to fcc. The injection rate provides an experimental knob for controlling the phase, with one&#8208;shot and drop&#8208;wise injection of the Pd precursor corresponding to fcc&#8208;Pd and hcp&#8208;Pd shells, respectively. When these nanocrystals are tested as catalysts toward formic acid oxidation, the Ru@Pdhcp nanocrystals outperform Ru@Pdfcc in terms of both specific activity and peak potential. Density functional theory calculations are also performed to elucidate the origin of this performance enhancement.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Carbon Superstructures Achieving Ultra&#8208;Stable and Fast Proton&#8208;Coupled Charge Storage Kinetics</title>

Complementary acceptor&#8211;donor molecules of 2,4,6&#8208;trichloro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone form a porous organic polymer with &#8220;protic salt&#8221;&#8208;type rigid skeleton linked by &#8722;NH2+Cl&#8722;&#8722; &#8220;rivets&#8221;, which offers the cornerstone for H&#8208;bonding self&#8208;assembly of the organic backbone to carbon superstructures by &#960;&#8722;&#960; plane stacking. The superstructures achieve ultrastable and fast proton&#8208;coupled charge storage kinetics, giving unprecedented lifespan (1&#160;000&#160;000 cycles) and high energy density for carbon (zinc) supercapacitors.








Abstract
Designing ingenious and stable carbon nanostructures is critical but still challenging for use in energy storage devices with superior electrochemistry kinetics, durable capacitive activity, and high rate survivability. To pursue the objective, a simple self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed to access carbon superstructures built of nanoparticle embedded plates. The carbon precursors, 2,4,6&#8208;trichloro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone can form porous organic polymer with &#8220;protic salt&#8221;&#8208;type rigid skeleton linked by &#8722;NH2+Cl&#8722;&#8722; &#8220;rivets&#8221;, which provides the cornerstone for hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;guided self&#8208;assembly of the organic backbone to superstructures by &#960;&#8722;&#960; plane stacking. The ameliorative charge density distribution and decreased adsorption energy in as&#8208;fabricated carbon superstructures allow the high accessibility of the build&#8208;in protophilic sites and efficient ion diffusion with a low energy barrier. Such superstructures thus deliver ultra&#8208;stable charge storage and fast proton&#8208;coupled kinetics at the structural&#8722;chemical defects, contributing to unprecedented lifespan (1&#160;000&#160;000 cycles), high&#8208;rate capability (100 A g&#8722;1) for carbon&#8208;based supercapacitors, and an ultrahigh energy density (128&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) for Zn&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors. The self&#8208;assembled carbon superstructures significantly improve the all&#8208;round electrochemical performances, and hold great promise for efficient energy storage.

         <title>A Regioselectively Oxidized 2D Bi/BiOx Lateral Nano&#8208;Heterostructure for Hypoxic Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bismuthene/bismuth oxide (Bi/BiOx)&#8208;based lateral nano&#8208;heterostructure is fabricated to effectively generate 1O2 under normoxia but produce cytotoxic &#8226;OH and H2 under hypoxia, which synergistically enhances photodynamic therapy. Furthermore, this Bi/BiOx nano&#8208;heterostructure is biocompatible and biodegradable, and, with surface molecular engineering, it improves tumor tissue penetration and increases cellular uptake, yielding excellent oxygen&#8208;independent tumor ablation.








Abstract
Optoelectronic science and 2D nanomaterial technologies are currently at the forefront of multidisciplinary research and have numerous applications in electronics and photonics. The unique energy and optically induced interfacial electron transfer in these nanomaterials, enabled by their relative band alignment characteristics, can provide important therapeutic modalities for healthcare. Given that nano&#8208;heterostructures can facilitate photoinduced electron&#8211;hole separation and enhance generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 2D nano&#8208;heterostructure&#8208;based photosensitizers can provide a major advancement in photodynamic therapy (PDT), to overcome the current limitations in hypoxic tumor microenvironments. Herein, a bismuthene/bismuth oxide (Bi/BiOx)&#8208;based lateral nano&#8208;heterostructure synthesized using a regioselective oxidation process is introduced, which, upon irradiation at 660&#160;nm, effectively generates 1O2 under normoxia but produces cytotoxic &#8226;OH and H2 under hypoxia, which synergistically enhances PDT. Furthermore, this Bi/BiOx nano&#8208;heterostructure is biocompatible and biodegradable, and, with the surface molecular engineering used here, it improves tumor tissue penetration and increases cellular uptake during in vitro and in vivo experiments, yielding excellent oxygen&#8208;independent tumor ablation with 660&#160;nm irradiation, when compared with traditional PDT agents.

Gradient alloyed CdSe/ZnxCd1&#8722;xS/ZnS and CdSe/CdS/ZnS core/shell/shell quantum&#8208;rod downconverters showing high&#8208;efficacy light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) covering a wide color gamut are reported. The engineered shell thickness suppresses energy transfer and Auger recombination and maintains the high quantum yield in the solid&#8208;state (81%). These LEDs show luminous efficacy of 149&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1 and wide color gamut.








Abstract
Efficient white light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with an efficacy of 200&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1 are much desirable for lighting and displays. The phosphor&#8208;based LEDs in use today for display applications offer poor color saturation. Intensive efforts have been made to replace the phosphor with quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;based downconverters, but the efficiency and stability of these devices are still in their infancy. Quantum rods (QRs), nanoparticles with an elongated shape, show superior properties such as relatively larger Stokes shifts, polarized emission, and high light out&#8208;coupling efficiency in the solid&#8208;state. However, these QRs usually suffer from poor optical quality for PL wavelengths &lt;&#160;550&#160;nm. Herein, a gradient alloyed CdSe/ZnxCd1&#8722;xS/ZnS and CdSe/CdS/ZnS core/shell/shell QR downconverters showing high efficacy LEDs covering a wide color gamut are reported. These QRs show high stability and a precisely tunable photoluminescence peak. The engineered shell thickness suppresses energy transfer and thus maintains the high quantum yield in the solid&#8208;state (81%). These QR&#8208;based LEDs attain an efficacy of 149&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1 (@10mA) and&#160;wide color gamut (118% NTSC), which is exceedingly higher than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum dots and phosphor&#8208;based on&#8208;chip LEDs.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Tailoring with Bifunctional Integration for High&#8208;Performance CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8211;Ru dual&#8208;atoms inside conjugated porous carbon nitride polymer are designed for regulation of outstanding synergistic photocatalysis during light&#8208;driven CO2 conversion, of which the bifunctionalized Co&#8211;Ru sites feature atom&#8208;specific functions with Co for dynamic carrier mobility and Ru for selective CO2 surface&#8208;bound interaction.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom photocatalysis has been demonstrated as a novel strategy to promote heterogeneous reactions. There is a diversity of monoatomic metal species with specific functions; however, integrating representative merits into dual&#8208;single&#8208;atoms and regulating cooperative photocatalysis remain a pressing challenge. For dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts, enhanced photocatalytic activity would be realized through integrating bifunctional properties and tuning the synergistic effect. Herein, dual&#8208;single&#8208;atoms supported on conjugated porous carbon nitride polymer are developed for effective photocatalytic CO2 reduction, featuring the function of cobalt (Co) and ruthenium (Ru). A series of in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations are conducted for quantitative analysis of structure&#8211;performance correlation. It is concluded that the active Co sites facilitate dynamic charge transfer, while the Ru sites promote selective CO2 surface&#8208;bound interaction during CO2 photoreduction. The combination of atom&#8208;specific traits and the synergy between Co and Ru lead to the high photocatalytic CO2 conversion with corresponding apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 2.8% at 385&#160;nm, along with a high turnover number (TON) of more than 200 without addition of any sacrificial agent. This work presents an example of identifying the roles of different single&#8208;atom metals and regulating the synergy, where the two metals with unique properties collaborate to further boost the photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Ion Bolted VOPO4&#8729;2H2O as an Aqueous Fe&#8208;Ion Battery Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;ion batteries are promising for grid energy storage due to their low cost and compatibility with aqueous electrolytes. This work demonstrates vanadium oxyphosphate as a capable cathode to host Fe2+. Vanadium oxyphosphate exhibits structural stability favoring Fe2+ to Zn2+ due to the bolting effect by the pre&#8208;intercalated Fe3+ before battery cycling.








Abstract
Iron ion batteries using Fe2+ as a charge carrier have yet to be widely explored, and they lack high&#8208;performing Fe2+ hosting cathode materials to couple with the iron metal anode. Here, it is demonstrated that VOPO4&#8729;2H2O can reversibly host Fe2+ with a high specific capacity of 100 mAh g&#8722;1 and stable cycling performance, where 68% of the initial capacity is retained over 800 cycles. In sharp contrast, VOPO4&#8729;2H2O's capacity of hosting Zn2+ fades precipitously over tens of cycles. VOPO4&#8729;2H2O stores Fe2+ with a unique mechanism, where upon contacting the electrolyte by the VOPO4&#8729;2H2O electrode, Fe2+ ions from the electrolyte get oxidized to Fe3+ ions that are inserted and trapped in the VOPO4&#8729;2H2O structure in an electroless redox reaction. The trapped Fe3+ ions, thus, bolt the layered structure of VOPO4&#8729;2H2O, which prevents it from dissolution into the electrolyte during (de)insertion of Fe2+. The findings offer a new strategy to use a redox&#8208;active ion charge carrier to stabilize the layered electrode materials.

         <title>Towards High Performance Li&#8211;S Batteries via Sulfonate&#8208;Rich COF&#8208;Modified Separator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy of a sulfonate&#8208;rich covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;modified separator is proposed for Li&#8211;S batteries, which provides a solution for tackling the issues of polysulfide shuttling and dendrite growth simultaneously. Benefiting from the chemical merits of strong electronegativity and large interlayer spacing for SCOF&#8208;2, the capacity and stability of rechargeable Li&#8211;S batteries are greatly improved.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are held great promise for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density devices; however, polysulfide shuttle and Li&#8208;dendrite growth severely hinders their commercial production. Herein, a sulfonate&#8208;rich COF (SCOF&#8208;2) is designed, synthesized, and used to modify the separator of Li&#8211;S batteries, providing a solution for the above challenges. It is found that the SCOF&#8208;2 features stronger electronegativity and larger interlayer spacing than that of none/monosulfonate COFs, which can facilitate the Li+ migration and alleviate the formation of Li&#8208;dendrites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in situ Raman analysis demonstrate that the SCOF&#8208;2 possesses a narrow bandgap and strong interaction on sulfur species, thereby suppressing self&#8208;discharge behavior. As a result, the modified batteries deliver an ultralow attenuation rate of 0.047% per cycle over 800 cycles at 1 C, and excellent anti&#8208;self&#8208;discharge performance by a low&#8208;capacity attenuation of 6.0% over one week. Additionally, even with the high&#8208;sulfur&#8208;loading cathode (3.2&#8211;8.2 mgs cm&#8208;2) and lean electrolyte (5&#160;&#181;L&#160;mgs&#8208;1), the batteries still exhibit &#8776;80% capacity retention over 100 cycles, showing great potential for practical application.

         <title>Enzymatically Transformable Polymersome&#8208;Based Nanotherapeutics to Eliminate Minimal Relapsable Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatically transformable nanotherapeutics is presented to improve the targeted delivery of old drugs&#8212;MMP inhibitor and colchicine&#8212;into minimal relapsable cancer. This distinct combination therapy not only ensures direct killing of residual cancer cells but also disrupts the premetastatic microenvironment to prevent distant seeding/outgrowth, which radically reduces metastatic and local&#8208;regional recurrence after surgery.








Abstract
Prevention of metastatic and local&#8208;regional recurrence of cancer after surgery remains difficult. Targeting postsurgical premetastatic niche and microresiduals presents an excellent prospective opportunity but is often challenged by poor therapeutic delivery into minimal residual tumors. Here, an enzymatically transformable polymer&#8208;based nanotherapeutic approach is presented that exploits matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) overactivation in tumor&#8208;associated tissues to guide the codelivery of colchicine (microtubule&#8208;disrupting and anti&#8208;inflammatory agent) and marimastat (MMP inhibitor). The dePEGylation of polymersomes catalyzed by MMPs not only exposes the guanidine moiety to improve tissue/cell&#8208;targeting/retention to increase bioavailability, but also differentially releases marimastat and colchicine to engage their extracellular (MMPs) and intracellular (microtubules) targets of action, respectively. In primary tumors/overt metastases, the vasculature&#8208;specific targeting of nanotherapeutics can function synchronously with the enhanced permeability and retention effect to deter malignant progression of metastatic breast cancer. After the surgical removal of large primary tumors, nanotherapeutic agents are localized in the premetastatic niche and at the site of the postsurgical wound, disrupting the premetastatic microenvironment and eliminating microresiduals, which radically reduces metastatic and local&#8208;regional recurrence. The findings suggest that nanotherapeutics can safely widen the therapeutic window to resuscitate colchicine and MMP inhibitors for other inflammatory disorders.

         <title>Engineering Extracellular Vesicles Enriched with Palmitoylated ACE2 as COVID&#8208;19 Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered EVs enriched with palmitoylated ACE2 (PM&#8208;ACE2) efficiently capture SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 viruses and block their interaction with the cell surface ACE2, leading to reduced infection both in vitro and in vivo. This work identifies a novel palmitoylation&#8208;dependent mechanism whereby human cells package ACE2 into EVs, meanwhile developing PM&#8208;ACE2&#8208;EVs as a novel candidate for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment against COVID&#8208;19.








Abstract
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a key receptor present on cell surfaces that directly interacts with the viral spike (S) protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2). It is proposed that inhibiting this interaction can be promising in treating COVID&#8208;19. Here, the presence of ACE2 in extracellular vesicles (EVs) is reported and the EV&#8208;ACE2 levels are determined by protein palmitoylation. The Cys141 and Cys498 residues on ACE2 are S&#8208;palmitoylated by zinc finger DHHC&#8208;Type Palmitoyltransferase 3 (ZDHHC3) and de&#8208;palmitoylated by acyl protein thioesterase 1 (LYPLA1), which is critical for the membrane&#8208;targeting of ACE2 and their EV secretion. Importantly, by fusing the S&#8208;palmitoylation&#8208;dependent plasma membrane (PM) targeting sequence with ACE2, EVs enriched with ACE2 on their surface (referred to as PM&#8208;ACE2&#8208;EVs) are engineered. It is shown that PM&#8208;ACE2&#8208;EVs can bind to the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 S&#8208;RBD with high affinity and block its interaction with cell surface ACE2 in vitro. PM&#8208;ACE2&#8208;EVs show neutralization potency against pseudotyped and authentic SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in human ACE2 (hACE2) transgenic mice, efficiently block viral load of authentic SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, and thus protect host against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;induced lung inflammation. The study provides an efficient engineering protocol for constructing a promising, novel biomaterial for application in prophylactic and therapeutic treatments against COVID&#8208;19.

         <title>Self&#8208;Supporting 3D Carbon Nitride with Tunable n &#8594; &#960;* Electronic Transition for Enhanced Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;supporting 3D (SSD) polymeric carbon nitride (PCN), with tunable n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition, is successfully synthesized via a facile stepwise pyrolytic strategy. The synergistic optimization of the SSD structure and n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition in PCN significantly advance the exciton dissociation and optical absorption, leading to enhanced visible&#8208;light H2 evolution activity in the spectral region above 500&#160;nm.








Abstract
Self&#8208;supporting 3D (SSD) carbon nitrides (UCN&#8208;X, X&#160;= 600&#8211;690; where X represents the pyrolytic temperature) consisting of curved layers, with plenty of wrinkles and enlarged size, are synthesized via a facile stepwise pyrolytic strategy. Such unique features of the SSD structure exhibiting dramatically improved charge mobility, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated aromatic system, and partial distortion of heptazine&#8208;based skeleton can not only keep the easier activation of the intrinsic &#960;&#160;&#8594; &#160;&#960;* electronic transition but also awaken the n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition in carbon nitride. The n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition of UCN&#8208;X can be controllably tuned through changing the pyrolytic temperature, which can greatly extend the photoresponse range to 600&#160;nm. More importantly, the change regularity of H2 evolution rates is highly positive, correlated with the change tendency of n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition in UCN&#8208;X, suggesting the positive contribution of n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition to enhancing photocatalytic activity. The UCN&#8208;670, with optimal structural and optical properties, presents enhanced H2 evolution rate up to 9230&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 (Pt 1.1 wt%). This work realizes the synergistic optimization of optical absorption and exciton dissociation via fabricating an SSD structure. It offers a new strategy for the development of novel carbon nitride materials for efficient photocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Spacer Cation Alloying in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskites for Efficient Red Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Precisely Tunable Wavelengths</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and general strategy of spacer cation alloying is developed to modulate the thickness distribution of quantum wells in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite films. Based on this method, efficient perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with tunable emissions between pure red (626&#160;nm) and deep red (671&#160;nm) are achieved with peak external quantum efficiencies up to 11.5%.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have recently shown significant progress with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) exceeding 20%. However, PeLEDs with pure&#8208;red (620&#8722;660&#160;nm) light emission, an essential part for full&#8208;color displays, remain a great challenge. Herein, a general approach of spacer cation alloying is employed in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites (RPPs) for efficient red PeLEDs with precisely tunable wavelengths. By simply tuning the alloying ratio of dual spacer cations, the thickness distribution of quantum wells in the RPP films can be precisely modulated without deteriorating their charge&#8208;transport ability and energy funneling processes. Consequently, efficient PeLEDs with tunable emissions between pure red (626&#160;nm) and deep red (671&#160;nm) are achieved with peak EQEs up to 11.5%, representing the highest values among RPP&#8208;based pure&#8208;red PeLEDs. This work opens a new route for color tuning, which will spur future developments of pure&#8208;red or even pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs with high performance.

         <title>Ultrafast Thermal Imprinting of Plasmonic Hotspots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmonic heating ordinarily leads to isotropic heating of the material. However, through nanoparticle shaping, pulsed illumination, and the right choice of material (e.g., HfN), plasmonic absorption hotspots can be directly imprinted on the lattice as heat. This approach results in extreme thermal hotspots, lasting hundreds of picoseconds, which can boost the chemical reactivity of catalytic nanoreactors by orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Plasmonic photochemistry is driven by a rich collection of near&#8208;field, hot charge carrier, energy transfer, and thermal effects, most often accomplished by continuous wave illumination. Heat generation is usually considered undesirable, because noble metal nanoparticles heat up isotropically, losing the extreme energy confinement of the optical resonance. Here it is demonstrated through optical and heat&#8208;transfer modelling that the judicious choice of nanoreactor geometry and material enables the direct thermal imprint of plasmonic optical absorption hotspots onto the lattice with high fidelity. Transition metal nitrides (TMNs, e.g., TiN/HfN) embody the ideal material requirements, where ultrafast electron&#8211;phonon coupling prevents fast electronic heat dissipation and low thermal conductivity prolongs the heat confinement. The extreme energy confinement leads to unprecedented peak temperatures and internal heat gradients (&gt;10 K nm&#8722;1) that cannot be achieved using noble metals or any current heating method. TMN nanoreactors consequently yield up to ten thousand times more product in pulsed photothermal chemical conversion compared with noble metals (Ag, Au, Cu). These findings open up a completely unexplored realm of nano&#8208;photochemistry, where adjacent reaction centers experience substantially different temperatures for hundreds of picoseconds, long enough for bond breaking to occur.

Cancer Therapy
In article number 2104037, Xiang Li, Zhen Gu, Xiujun Cai, and co&#8208;workers report that the generated H2S and released zinc ions from ZnS@BSA nanoclusters promote accumulation of reactive oxygen species to activate cGAS/STING signals in tumor cells. ZnS@BSA nanoclusters are further demonstrated to facilitate antitumor immunotherapy by immune cell infiltration, showing potential for clinical translation.

Detection of Neurotransmitters
So far, only modestly performing synthetic binders have been accessible for small bioactive molecules such as serotonin and dopamine. In article number 2104614, Luisa De Cola, Frank Biedermann, and co&#8208;workers introduce zeolite&#8208;based artificial receptors (ZARs), which are microporous inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid materials applicable for the optical&#8208;based detection of serotonin and dopamine in urine at physiological relevant concentrations. These ZARs outperform protein receptors with respect to response times, robustness and scalability.

Organic Electrochemical Transistors
Among other merits, the ability of organic electrochemical transistors to form an intimate interface with a biological environment, enabling efficient ion&#8208;to&#8208;electron transduction, makes them particularly desirable for operation within a living organism (in vivo). In article number 2101874, Ali Nawaz, Prashant Sonar, and co&#8208;workers comprehensively review the wide range of in vivo bioelectronic applications that have been addressed for organic electrochemical transistor technology and discuss the future challenges in the field.

COVID&#8208;19 Therapy
In their work reported in article number 2103471, Long Zhang, Fangfang Zhou, and co&#8208;workers fuse the S&#8208;palmitoylation&#8208;dependent plasma membrane (PM) targeting sequence with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and engineer extracellular vesicles (EVs) on their surface enriched with palmitoylated ACE2 (PM&#8208;ACE2&#8208;EVs). The PM&#8208;ACE2&#8208;EVs can bind to the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 S&#8208;RBD with high affinity and block its interaction with cell&#8208;surface ACE2, thereby preventing SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 from entering the host cell. This study provides a novel EV&#8208;based candidate for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment against COVID&#8208;19.

         <title>Nanophotonic Color Routing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale color routing is reviewed with a focus on the emerging concepts and the technology development trend, in particular for the applications in high&#8208;resolution imaging. Nanophotonic methods to manipulate light in both frequency&#8208;domain and spatial&#8208;domain with high&#8208;efficiency utilization of the full spectrum are presented. The remaining challenges and the potential solutions are also discussed.








Abstract
Recent advances in low&#8208;dimensional materials and nanofabrication technologies have stimulated many breakthroughs in the field of nanophotonics such as metamaterials and plasmonics that provide efficient ways of light manipulation at a subwavelength scale. The representative structure&#8208;induced spectral engineering techniques have demonstrated superior design of freedom compared with natural materials such as pigment/dye. In particular, the emerging spectral routing scheme enables extraordinary light manipulation in both frequency&#8208;domain and spatial&#8208;domain with high&#8208;efficiency utilization of the full spectrum, which is critically important for various applications and may open up entirely new operating paradigms. In this review, a comparative introduction on the operating mechanisms of spectral routing and spectral filtering schemes is given and recent progress on various color nanorouters based on metasurfaces, plasmonics, dielectric antennas is reviewed with a focus on the potential application in high&#8208;resolution imaging. With a thorough analysis and discussion on the advanced properties and drawbacks of various techniques, this report is expected to provide an overview and vision for the future development and application of nanophotonic color (spectral) routing techniques.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest advances in carbon&#8208;based hybrid catalysts toward hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production are reviewed. In particular, the design of functional groups and the dependence of electrolyte pH play important roles to further improve the selectivity of H2O2 production via the oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an environment&#8208;friendly and efficient oxidant with a wide range of applications in different industries. Recently, the production of hydrogen peroxide through direct electrosynthesis has attracted widespread research attention, and has emerged as the most promising method to replace the traditional energy&#8208;intensive multi&#8208;step anthraquinone process. In ongoing efforts to achieve highly efficient large&#8208;scale electrosynthesis of H2O2, carbon&#8208;based materials have been developed as 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction catalysts, with the benefits of low cost, abundant availability, and optimal performance. This review comprehensively introduces the strategies for optimizing carbon&#8208;based materials toward H2O2 production, and the latest advances in carbon&#8208;based hybrid catalysts. The active sites of the carbon&#8208;based materials and the influence of coordination heteroatom doping on the selectivity of H2O2 are extensively analyzed. In particular, the appropriate design of functional groups and understanding the effect of the electrolyte pH are expected to further improve the selective efficiency of producing H2O2 via the oxygen reduction reaction. Methods for improving catalytic activity by interface engineering and reaction kinetics are summarized. Finally, the challenges carbon&#8208;based catalysts face before they can be employed for commercial&#8208;scale H2O2 production are identified, and prospects for designing novel electrochemical reactors are proposed.

         <title>Emerging Technologies in Multi&#8208;Material Bioprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of the available 3D bioprinting technologies for fabricating multi&#8208;material constructs is presented. The technologies are classified into four major categories, and their advantages and shortcomings are compared. Available multi&#8208;material commercial bioprinters are reviewed, concluding with a perspective of the future path for developing multi&#8208;material technologies.








Abstract
Bioprinting, within the emerging field of biofabrication, aims at the fabrication of functional biomimetic constructs. Different 3D bioprinting techniques have been adapted to bioprint cell&#8208;laden bioinks. However, single&#8208;material bioprinting techniques oftentimes fail to reproduce the complex compositions and diversity of native tissues. Multi&#8208;material bioprinting as an emerging approach enables the fabrication of heterogeneous multi&#8208;cellular constructs that replicate their host microenvironments better than single&#8208;material approaches. Here, bioprinting modalities are reviewed, their being adapted to multi&#8208;material bioprinting is discussed, and their advantages and challenges, encompassing both custom&#8208;designed and commercially available technologies are analyzed. A perspective of how multi&#8208;material bioprinting opens up new opportunities for tissue engineering, tissue model engineering, therapeutics development, and personalized medicine is offered.

         <title>Organic Electrochemical Transistors for In Vivo Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of organic electrochemical transistors in different in vivo bioelectronic applications, ranging from human electrophysiology to plant interfacing, is discussed. Particular emphasis is given on analyzing the key materials  design and device design aspects that make these devices ideal for addressing future in vivo biological systems. Finally, some challenges, limitations, and future applications are critically assessed.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are presently a focus of intense research and hold great potential in expanding the horizons of the bioelectronics industry. The notable characteristics of OECTs, including their electrolyte&#8208;gating, which offers intimate interfacing with biological environments, and aqueous stability, make them particularly suitable to be operated within a living organism (in vivo). Unlike the existing in vivo bioelectronic devices, mostly based on rigid metal electrodes, OECTs form a soft mechanical contact with the biological milieu and ensure a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio because of their powerful amplification capability. Such features make OECTs particularly desirable for a wide range of in vivo applications, including electrophysiological recordings, neuron stimulation, and neurotransmitter detection, and regulation of plant processes in vivo. In this review, a systematic compilation of the in vivo applications is presented that are addressed by the OECT technology. First, the operating mechanisms, and the device design and materials design principles of OECTs are examined, and then multiple examples are provided from the literature while identifying the unique device properties that enable the application progress. Finally, one critically looks at the future of the OECT technology for in vivo bioelectronic applications.

         <title>Controlled Vertically Aligned Structures in Polymer Composites: Natural Inspiration, Structural Processing, and Functional Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in polymer composites with vertically oriented structures is summarized, with an emphasis on natural prototypes, processing methods, and multifunctional applications. Like the fairy tale, the Magpie bridge (processing methods) should be highlighted to connect the gap between the Weaver Girl (natural prototypes of vertical structures) and the Cowherd (functional polymeric composites) for close correlations from inspirations to implementations.








Abstract
Vertically aligned structures, which are a series of characteristic conformations with thickness&#8208;direction alignment, interconnection, or assembly of filler in polymeric composite materials that can provide remarkable structural performance and advanced anisotropic functions, have attracted considerable attention in recent years. The past two decades have witnessed extensive development with regard to universal fabrication methods, subtle control of morphological features, improvement of functional properties, and superior applications of vertically aligned structures in various fields. However, a systematic review remains to be attempted. The various configurations of vertical structures inspired from biological samples in nature, such as vertically aligned structures with honeycomb, reed, annual ring, radial, and lamellar configurations are summarized here. Additionally, relevant processing methods, which include the transformation of oriented direction, external&#8208;field inducement, template method, and 3D printing method, are discussed in detail. The diverse applications in mechanical, thermal, electric, dielectric, electromagnetic, water treatment, and energy fields are also highlighted by providing representative examples. Finally, future opportunities and prospects are listed to identify current issues and potential research directions. It is expected that perspectives on the vertically aligned structures presented here will contribute to the research on advanced multifunctional composites.

         <title>Anisotropic Nodal&#8208;Line&#8208;Derived Large Anomalous Hall Conductivity in ZrMnP and HfMnP</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomalous Hall conductivity appears in metallic ferromagnets due to the anomalous velocity of charge carriers in the presence of a magnetic field. In ferromagnets ZrMnP and HfMnP, the abundance of mirror planes forming nodal lines at the Fermi energy guides and enhances such velocity, resulting in both the compounds exhibiting large value of anomalous Hall conductivity.








Abstract
The nontrivial band structure of semimetals has attracted substantial research attention in condensed matter physics and materials science in recent years owing to its intriguing physical properties. Within this class, a group of nontrivial materials known as nodal&#8208;line semimetals is particularly important. Nodal&#8208;line semimetals exhibit the potential effects of electronic correlation in nonmagnetic materials, whereas they enhance the contribution of the Berry curvature in magnetic materials, resulting in high anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC). In this study, two ferromagnetic compounds, namely ZrMnP and HfMnP, are selected, wherein the abundance of mirror planes in the crystal structure ensures gapped nodal lines at the Fermi energy. These nodal lines result in one of the largest AHC values of 2840 &#937;&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1, with a high anomalous Hall angle of 13.6% in these compounds. First&#8208;principles calculations provide a clear and detailed understanding of nodal line&#8208;enhanced AHC. The finding suggests a guideline for searching large AHC compounds.

         <title>Atomic Structure Evolution of Pt&#8211;Co Binary Catalysts: Single Metal Sites versus Intermetallic Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Key factors determining whether the alloying or atomization of Pt NPs on a single Co site rich carbon support are dynamically revealed, including initial Pt loadings, particle sizes, the nature of the carbon supports, and the annealing conditions. The corresponding ordered Pt3Co intermetallic and single Pt/Co site (i.e., PtC3N/CoN4) catalysts are evaluated for the oxygen reduction reaction. The established structure&#8211;property correlations shed light on the design of advanced Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Due to their exceptional catalytic properties for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and other crucial electrochemical reactions, PtCo intermetallic nanoparticle (NP) and single atomic (SA) Pt metal site catalysts have received considerable attention. However, their formation mechanisms at the atomic level during high&#8208;temperature annealing processes remain elusive. Here, the thermally driven structure evolution of Pt&#8211;Co binary catalyst systems is investigated using advanced in situ electron microscopy, including PtCo intermetallic alloys and single Pt/Co metal sites. The pre&#8208;doping of CoN4 sites in carbon supports and the initial Pt NP sizes play essential roles in forming either Pt3Co intermetallics or single Pt/Co metal sites. Importantly, the initial Pt NP loadings against the carbon support are critical to whether alloying to L12&#8208;ordered Pt3Co NPs or atomizing to SA Pt sites at high temperatures. High Pt NP loadings (e.g., 20%) tend to lead to the formation of highly ordered Pt3Co intermetallic NPs with excellent activity and enhanced stability toward the ORR. In contrast, at a relatively low Pt loading (&lt;6&#160;wt%), the formation of single Pt sites in the form of PtC3N is thermodynamically favorable, in which a synergy between the PtC3N and the CoN4 sites could enhance the catalytic activity for the ORR, but showing insufficient stability.

         <title>Design Principles of Sodium/Potassium Protection Layer for High&#8208;Power High&#8208;Energy Sodium/Potassium&#8208;Metal Batteries in Carbonate Electrolytes: a Case Study of Na2Te/K2Te</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Na2Te (K2Te) protection layer with high ionic conductivity, low electronic conductivity, and high mechanical stability on a Na (K) metal anode is designed and prepared. The Na@Na2Te (K@K2Te) realizes excellent electrochemi cal performance for sodium&#8208;metal (potassiummetal) batteries of both symmetrical cells and full batteries in widely used carbonate electrolytes.








Abstract
The sodium (potassium)&#8208;metal anodes combine low&#8208;cost, high theoretical capacity, and high energy density, demonstrating promising application in sodium (potassium)&#8208;metal batteries. However, the dendrites&#8217; growth on the surface of Na (K) has impeded their practical application. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) results predict Na2Te/K2Te is beneficial for Na+/K+ transport and can effectively suppress the formation of the dendrites because of low Na+/K+ migration energy barrier and ultrahigh Na+/K+ diffusion coefficient of 3.7 &#215; 10&#8722;10 cm2 s&#8722;1/1.6 &#215; 10&#8722;10 cm2 s&#8722;1 (300 K), respectively. Then a Na2Te protection layer is prepared by directly painting the nanosized Te powder onto the sodium&#8208;metal surface. The Na@Na2Te anode can last for 700 h in low&#8208;cost carbonate electrolytes (1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 1 mAh cm&#8722;2), and the corresponding Na3V2 (PO4)3//Na@Na2Te full cell exhibits high energy density of 223&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at an unprecedented power density of 29687 W kg&#8722;1 as well as an ultrahigh capacity retention of 93% after 3000 cycles at 20 C. Besides, the K@K2Te&#8208;based potassium&#8208;metal full battery also demonstrates high power density of 20 577 W kg&#8722;1 with energy density of 154&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. This work opens up a new and promising avenue to stabilize sodium (potassium)&#8208;metal anodes with simple and low&#8208;cost interfacial layers.

&lt;p&gt;A Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te) protection layer with high ionic conductivity, low electronic conductivity, and high mechanical stability on a Na (K) metal anode is designed and prepared. The Na@Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te (K@K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te) realizes excellent electrochemi cal performance for sodium-metal (potassiummetal) batteries of both symmetrical cells and full batteries in widely used carbonate electrolytes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sodium (potassium)-metal anodes combine low-cost, high theoretical capacity, and high energy density, demonstrating promising application in sodium (potassium)-metal batteries. However, the dendrites&#8217; growth on the surface of Na (K) has impeded their practical application. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) results predict Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te/K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te is beneficial for Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport and can effectively suppress the formation of the dendrites because of low Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration energy barrier and ultrahigh Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion coefficient of 3.7 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;10&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;/1.6 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;10&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (300 K), respectively. Then a Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te protection layer is prepared by directly painting the nanosized Te powder onto the sodium-metal surface. The Na@Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te anode can last for 700 h in low-cost carbonate electrolytes (1&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 1 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and the corresponding Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;//Na@Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te full cell exhibits high energy density of 223&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at an unprecedented power density of 29687 W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; as well as an ultrahigh capacity retention of 93% after 3000 cycles at 20 C. Besides, the K@K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te-based potassium-metal full battery also demonstrates high power density of 20 577 W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with energy density of 154&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work opens up a new and promising avenue to stabilize sodium (potassium)-metal anodes with simple and low-cost interfacial layers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Atomic&#8208;Scale Structure and Electric Field Imaging of Triazine&#8208;Based Crystalline Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy technique reveals the local atomic configuration and also directly determines the atomic electric field of poly(triazine imide) crystal, the triazine&#8208;based crystalline carbon nitride. These findings offer a fundamental insight on the electronic structure for photoabsorption and the migration of charge carriers in photocatalysis with this material.








Abstract
Crystalline carbon nitrides (CNs) have recently attracted considerable attention owing to their superior photocatalytic activity. However, the electron&#8208;beam&#8208;sensitive nature of crystalline CNs hinders atomic&#8208;resolution imaging of their local structures by conventional (scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM) techniques. Here, the atomic structure of a triazine&#8208;based crystalline CN, poly(triazine imide) (PTI) incorporated with lithium and chloride ions, is unambiguously revealed using the emerging imaging technique of differential phase contrast STEM under a low dose. The lightest&#8208;element Li/H configuration is resolved within framework cavities of PTI and significantly affects the electronic structure for photoabsorption. The atomic electric field of PTI crystal directly determined in real space provides a fundamental evidence for the chemical bonding of Li ions and adjacent atoms for the migration of photogenerated carriers. These results facilitate the comprehension on local atomic configuration and chemical bonding state of crystalline CNs and can lead to a deeper understanding of the photocatalytic mechanism.

         <title>Managing Growth and Dimensionality of Quasi 2D Perovskite Single&#8208;Crystalline Flakes for Tunable Excitons Orientation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;sized quasi 2D&#8208;perovskites with tunable number of inorganic layers are synthesized by an innovative synthetic approach based on the use of a reactant, potassium iodide, that can modulate the supersaturation levels of the perovskite precursors solution without being part of the final products. Exciton orientation is changed from &#8220;in&#8208;plane&#8221; to &#8220;out&#8208;of&#8208;plane&#8221; by increasing the &#8220;n&#8221; value.








Abstract
Hybrid perovskites are among the most promising materials for optoelectronic applications. Their 2D crystalline form is even more interesting since the alternating inorganic and organic layers naturally forge a multiple quantum&#8208;well structure, leading to the formation of stable excitonic resonances. Nevertheless, a controlled modulation of the quantum well width, which is defined by the number of inorganic layers (n) between two organic ones, is not trivial and represents the main synthetic challenge in the field. Here, a conceptually innovative approach to easily tune n in lead iodide perovskite single&#8208;crystalline flakes is presented. The judicious use of potassium iodide is found to modulate the supersaturation levels of the precursors solution without being part of the final products. This allows to obtain a fine tuning of the n value. The excellent optical quality of the as synthesized flakes guarantees an in&#8208;depth analysis by Fourier&#8208;space microscopy, revealing that the excitons orientation can be manipulated by modifying the number of inorganic layers. Excitonic out&#8208;of&#8208;plane component, indeed, is enhanced when &#8220;n&#8221; is increased. The combined advances in the synthesis and optical characterization fill in the picture of the exciton behavior in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite, paving the way to the design of materials with improved optoelectronic characteristics.

         <title>Promoting Oral Mucosal Wound Healing with a Hydrogel Adhesive Based on a Phototriggered S&#8208;Nitrosylation Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a new coupling reaction, an easily operated hydrogel adhesive that features thin&#8208;layer fabrication, ultrafast gelation, appropriate elasticity, and excellent tissue adhesion is developed. This hydrogel adhesive matches the material requirements for oral mucosal treatment and establishes a conducive microenvironment for tissue growth, thus notably shortening the healing time of mucosal wounds.








Abstract
The wet and highly dynamic environment of the mouth makes local treatment of oral mucosal diseases challenging. To overcome this, a photo&#8208;crosslinking hydrogel adhesive is developed inspired by the success of light&#8208;curing techniques in dentistry. The adhesive operates on a fast (within 5 s) phototriggered S&#8208;nitrosylation coupling reaction and employs imine anchoring to connect to host tissues. Unlike other often&#8208;used clinical agents that adhere weakly and for short durations, this thin, elastic, adhesive, and degradable cyclic o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid gel protects mucosal wounds from disturbance by liquid rinsing, oral movement, and friction for more than 24 h. The results from both rat and pig oral mucosa repair models demonstrate that this new gel adhesive creates a favorable microenvironment for tissue repair and can shorten tissue healing time. This study thus illustrates a therapeutic strategy with the potential to advance the treatment of oral mucosal defects in the clinic.

         <title>Crystal Phase Transition Creates a Highly Active and Stable RuCX Nanosurface for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal phase&#8208;transition of Ru/C from cubic&#8208;close&#8208;packing to hexagonal&#8208;close&#8208;packing creates a ruthenium carbide (RuCX, X&#160;&lt;&#160;1) nanosurface on Ru nanocrystal. The as&#8208;created RuCX nanosurface presents a highly active and stable performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. Density functional theory calculations predict the RuCX sites as bifunctional configurations for improving alkaline HER kinetics.








Abstract
Although metastable crystal structures have received much attention owing to their utilization in various fields, their phase&#8208;transition to a thermodynamic structure has attracted comparably little interest. In the case of nanoscale crystals, such an exothermic phase&#8208;transition releases high energy within a confined surface area and reconstructs surface atomic arrangement in a short time. Thus, this high&#8208;energy nanosurface may create novel crystal structures when some elements are supplied. In this work, the creation of a ruthenium carbide (RuCX, X&#160;&lt;&#160;1) phase on the surface of the Ru nanocrystal is discovered during phase&#8208;transition from cubic&#8208;close&#8208;packed to hexagonal&#8208;close&#8208;packed structure. When the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is tested in alkaline media, the RuCX exhibits a much lower overpotential and good stability relative to the counterpart Ru&#8208;based catalysts and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C catalyst. Density functional theory calculations predict that the local heterogeneity of the outermost RuCX surface promotes the bifunctional HER mechanism by providing catalytic sites for both H adsorption and facile water dissociation.

&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;1) phase on the surface of the Ru nanocrystal is discovered during phase-transition from cubic-close-packed to hexagonal-close-packed structure. When the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is tested in alkaline media, the RuC&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;/sub&gt; surface promotes the bifunctional HER mechanism by providing catalytic sites for both H adsorption and facile water dissociation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Measurement of Oxygen Mass Transport at the Nanoscale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method based on atom probe tomography for the direct measurement of ion kinetics at the nanoscale is reported. Extremely high 3D resolution (&lt;1&#160;nm) and straight correlation with local cation distribution are demonstrated for the exemplary case of a mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductor exhibiting enhanced grain boundary oxygen diffusivity.








Abstract
Tuning oxygen mass transport properties at the nanoscale offers a promising approach for developing high performing energy materials. A number of strategies for engineering interfaces with enhanced oxygen diffusivity and surface exchange have been proposed. However, the origin and the magnitude of such local effects remain largely undisclosed to date due to the lack of direct measurement tools with sufficient resolution. In this work, atom probe tomography with sub&#8208;nanometer resolution is used to study oxygen mass transport on oxygen&#8208;isotope exchanged thin films of lanthanum chromite. A direct 3D visualization of nanoscaled highly conducting oxygen incorporation pathways along grain boundaries, with reliable quantification of the oxygen kinetic parameters and correlative link to local chemistries, is presented. Combined with finite element simulations of the exact nanostructure, isotope exchange&#8208;atom probe tomography allowed quantifying an enhancement in the grain boundary oxygen diffusivity and in the surface exchange coefficient of lanthanum chromite of about 4 and 3 orders of magnitude, respectively, compared to the bulk. This remarkable increase of the oxygen kinetics in an interface&#8208;dominated material is unambiguously attributed to grain boundary conduction highways thanks to the use of a powerful technique that can be straightforwardly extended to the study of currently inaccessible multiple nanoscale mass transport phenomena.

         <title>Engineering Photoresponsive Ligand Tethers for Mechanical Regulation of Stem Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is developed to regulate the behaviors and functions of stem cells by switching the states of light&#8208;switchable tethers. This method offers the chance to study mechanotransduction via cellular tethers and realize spatiotemporal regulation of differential cell fates.








Abstract
Regulating stem cell functions by precisely controlling the nanoscale presentation of bioactive ligands has a substantial impact on tissue engineering and regenerative medicine but remains a major challenge. Here it is shown that bioactive ligands can become mechanically &#8220;invisible&#8221; by increasing their tether lengths to the substrate beyond a critical length, providing a way to regulate mechanotransduction without changing the biochemical conditions. Building on this finding, light switchable tethers are rationally designed, whose lengths can be modulated reversibly by switching a light&#8208;responsive protein, pdDronpa, in between monomer and dimer states. This allows the regulation of the adhesion, spreading, and differentiation of stem cells by light on substrates of well&#8208;defined biochemical and physical properties. Spatiotemporal regulation of differential cell fates on the same substrate is further demonstrated, which may represent an important step toward constructing complex organoids or mini tissues by spatially defining the mechanical cues of the cellular microenvironment with light.

         <title>Volatilizable Solid Additive&#8208;Assisted Treatment Enables Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency over 18.8% and Fill Factor Exceeding 80%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new morphology control approach is developed to fabricate high&#8208;performance organic solar cells by utilizing the synergistic effect of 1&#8208;chloronaphthalene (CN) and dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene (DTT) additives. This approach exhibits general application in various active layer systems to achieve well&#8208;developed morphology, enabling outstanding power&#8208;conversion efficiency over 18.8% and fill factor exceeding 80% for the device based on PTQ10:m&#8208;BTP&#8208;PhC6:PC71BM.








Abstract
Controlling the self&#8208;assembling of organic semiconductors to form well&#8208;developed nanoscale phase separation in the bulk&#8208;heterojunction active layer is critical yet challenging for building high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). Particularly, the similar anisotropic conjugated structures between nonfullerene acceptors and p&#8208;type organic semiconductor donors raise more complexity on manipulating their aggregation toward appropriate phase separation. Herein, a new approach to tune the morphology of photoactive layer is developed by utilizing the synergistic effect of dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene (DTT) and 1&#8208;chloronaphthalene (CN). The volatilizable solid additive DTT with high crystallinity can restrict the over self&#8208;assembling of nonfullerene acceptors during the film casting process, and then allowing the refining of phase separation and molecular packing with the simultaneous volatilization of DTT under thermal annealing. Consequently, the PTQ10:m&#8208;BTP&#8208;PhC6:PC71BM&#8208;based ternary OSCs processed by the dual additives of CN and DTT record a notable power&#8208;conversion efficiency of 18.89%, with a remarkable FF of 80.6%.

Abstract
Organic single crystals with excellent optical and electrical properties are critical for the development of organic optoelectronics.

Single crystals based on TPA&#8208;An and TBA&#8208;An with a ribbon morphology obtained through the slow solvent&#8208;evaporation method exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 98% and 99% at room temperature, and remarkable hole mobilities of 0.45 and 0.15 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in single&#8208;crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistors (SC&#8208;OFETs). Furthermore, UV phototransistors based on the two single crystals obtain photosensitivities of 1.03 &#215; 103 and 3.45 &#215; 104, ultrahigh photoresponsivities of 7.19 &#215; 105 and 1.50&#160;&#215; 105 A W&#8722;1, and the detectivities exceeding 1.40 &#215; 1016 and 1.60 &#215; 1017 Jones.

         <title>Photoinduced Halide Segregation in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper 2D Mixed Halide Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D mixed halide perovskites with bandgap tunability and increased stability are employed in photovoltaics, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and optoelectronics. Inherent halide ion mobility (instability) of mixed halides drives photoinduced halide ion segregation. The important role of dimensionality across 3D to 2D perovskites governs the excited&#8208;state dynamics and the kinetics of halide segregation and dark recovery.








Abstract
2D lead halide perovskites, which exhibit bandgap tunability and increased chemical stability, have been found to be useful for designing optoelectronic devices. Reducing dimensionality with decreasing number of layers (n&#160;=&#160;10&#8211;1) also imparts resistance to light&#8208;induced ion migration as seen from the halide ion segregation and dark recovery in mixed halide (Br:I&#160;=&#160;50:50) perovskite films. The light&#8208;induced halide ion segregation efficiency, as determined from difference absorbance spectra, decreases from 20% to &lt;1%&#160;as the dimensionality is decreased for 2D perovskite film from n&#160;=&#160;10 to 1. The segregation rate constant (ksegregation), which decreases from 5.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;s&#8722;1 (n&#160;=&#160;10) to 3.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;s&#8722;1 (n&#160;=&#160;1), correlates well with nearly an order of magnitude decrease observed in charge&#8208;carrier lifetime (&#964;average&#160;=&#160;233&#160;ps for n&#160;=&#160;10&#160;vs &#964;avg&#160;=&#160;27&#160;ps for n&#160;=&#160;1). The tightly bound excitons in 2D perovskites make charge separation less probable, which in turn decreases the halide mobility and resulting phase segregation. The importance of controlling the dimensionality of the 2D architecture in suppressing halide ion mobility is discussed.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Capacitive Pressure Sensors over a Wide Pressure Range Enabled by the Hybrid Responses of a Highly Porous Nanocomposite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low sensitivity at large pressure is a long&#8208;standing obstacle of capacitive pressure sensors. A novel soft capacitive pressure sensor that employs an electrically conductive porous nanocomposite is a promising solution for resolving this chronic challenge. This hybrid&#8208;response pressure sensor exhibits unprecedented sensitivity up to 50 kPa. An analytical model explains its mechanism and enables selection of optimal manufacturing parameters.








Abstract
Past research aimed at increasing the sensitivity of capacitive pressure sensors has mostly focused on developing dielectric layers with surface/porous structures or higher dielectric constants. However, such strategies have only been effective in improving sensitivities at low pressure ranges (e.g., up to 3&#160;kPa). To overcome this well&#8208;known obstacle, herein, a flexible hybrid&#8208;response pressure sensor (HRPS) composed of an electrically conductive porous nanocomposite (PNC) laminated with an ultrathin dielectric layer is devised. Using a nickel foam template, the PNC is fabricated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs)&#8208;doped Ecoflex to be 86% porous and electrically conductive. The PNC exhibits hybrid piezoresistive and piezocapacitive responses, resulting in significantly enhanced sensitivities (i.e., more than 400%) over wide pressure ranges, from 3.13 kPa&#8722;1 within 0&#8211;1 kPa to 0.43 kPa&#8722;1 within 30&#8211;50 kPa. The effect of the hybrid responses is differentiated from the effect of porosity or high dielectric constants by comparing the HRPS with its purely piezocapacitive counterparts. Fundamental understanding of the HRPS and the prediction of optimal CNT doping are achieved through simplified analytical models. The HRPS is able to measure pressures from as subtle as the temporal arterial pulse to as large as footsteps.

A metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;sacrificed in situ acid&#8208;etching strategy to bring about the controllable synthesis of a series of covalent organic framework based multicomponent nanocomposites from core&#8211;shell, yolk&#8211;shell, and hollow&#8208;sphere structures is presented. Combining the unique yolk&#8211;shell structure with the synergistic effects of the three components, the MTCN&#8208;H (ys) demon strates remarkable catalytic performance in photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O.








Abstract
The precise tuning and multi&#8208;dimensional processing of covalent organic frameworks (COFs)&#8208;based materials into multicomponent superstructures with appropriate diversity are essential to maximize their advantages in catalytic reactions. However, up to now, it remains an ongoing challenge for the precise design of COFs&#8208;based multicomponent nanocomposites with diverse architectures. Herein, a metal organic framework (MOF)&#8208;sacrificed in situ acid&#8208;etching (MSISAE) strategy that enables continuous synthesis of core&#8208;shell, yolk&#8208;shell, and hollow&#8208;sphere COFs&#8208;based nanocomposites through tuning of core decomposition (NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 into TiO2) rate is developed. More importantly, due to the multiple active sites, fast transfer of carriers, increased light utilization ability, et al, one of the obtained samples, NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125/TiO2@COF&#8208;366&#8208;Ni&#8208;OH&#8208;HAc (yolk&#8208;shell) with special three components, exhibits high photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion efficiency in the gas&#8208;solid mode. The MSISAE strategy developed in this work achieves the precise morphology design and control of multicomponent hybrid composites based on COFs, which may pave a new way in devealoping porous crystalline materials with powerful superstructures for multifunctional catalytic reactions.

         <title>A Conductive Network and Dipole Field for Harnessing Photogenerated Charge Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TiO2 network exhibits two orders of magnitude enhancement in electric conductivity, which will greatly suppress electron&#8211;hole (e&#8211;h) recombination by reducing the charge&#8208;transfer resistance. In addition, 2D MXene induces a dipole at the interface. The dipole field pushes charge extraction and suppresses charge recombination by inducing band bending.








Abstract
Photogenerated charge separation and directional transfer to active sites are pivotal steps in photocatalysis, which limit the efficiency of redox reactions. Here, a conductive network and dipole field are employed to harness photogenerated charge kinetics by using a Ti3C2/TiO2 network (TTN). The TTN exhibits a prolonged charge&#8208;carrier lifetime (1.026&#160;ns) and an 11.76&#8208;fold increase in hexavalent chromium photoreduction reaction kinetics compared to TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs). This super photocatalytic performance is derived from the efficient photogenerated charge kinetics, which is steered by the conductive network and dipole field. The conductivity enhancement of the TiO2 network is achieved by continuous chemical bonds, which promotes electron&#8211;hole (e&#8211;h) separation. In addition, at the interface of Ti3C2 and TiO2, band bending induced by the dipole field promotes photogenerated electron spatially directed transfer to the catalytic sites on Ti3C2. This study demonstrates that a conductive network and dipole field offer a new concept to harness charge kinetics for photocatalysis.

The conductivity enhancement of the TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; network is achieved by continuous chemical bonds, which promotes electron&#8211;hole (e&#8211;h) separation. In addition, at the interface of Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, band bending induced by the dipole field promotes photogenerated electron spatially directed transfer to the catalytic sites on Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This study demonstrates that a conductive network and dipole field offer a new concept to harness charge kinetics for photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coupling Glucose&#8208;Assisted Cu(I)/Cu(II) Redox with Electrochemical Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach is proposed to achieve low&#8208;voltage and continuous hydrogen production using glucose&#8208;assisted Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox as the anode reaction. Glucose in the electrolyte can reduce the Cu(II) into Cu(I) spontaneously, thus completing the cycle of Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox. The assembled electrolyzer only requires a voltage input of 0.92 V to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Water electrolysis is a sustainable technology for hydrogen production since this process can utilize the intermittent electricity generated by renewable energy such as solar, wind, and hydro. However, the large&#8208;scale application of this process is restricted by the high electricity consumption due to the large potential gap (&gt;1.23&#160;V) between the anodic oxygen evolution reaction and the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a novel and efficient hydrogen production system is developed for coupling glucose&#8208;assisted Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox with HER. The onset potential of the electrooxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II) is as low as 0.7 VRHE (vs reversible hydrogen electrode). In situ Raman spectroscopy, ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculation demonstrates that glucose in the electrolyte can reduce the Cu(II) into Cu(I) instantaneously via a thermocatalysis process, thus completing the cycle of Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox. The assembled electrolyzer only requires a voltage input of 0.92&#160;V to achieve a current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Consequently, the electricity consumption for per cubic H2 produced in the system is 2.2&#160;kWh, only half of the value for conventional water electrolysis (4.5&#160;kWh). This work provides a promising strategy for the low&#8208;cost, efficient production of high&#8208;purity H2.

         <title>Physiologically Self&#8208;Regulated, Fully Implantable, Battery&#8208;Free System for Peripheral Nerve Restoration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A physiologically self&#8208;regulated, fully implantable, battery&#8208;free neural electrical stimulation system is successfully constructed to produce physiologically electrical signals for the acceleration of regeneration and functional recovery of peripheral nerve injury.








Abstract
The long&#8208;segment peripheral nerve injury (PNI) represents a global medical challenge, leading to incomplete nerve tissue recovery and unsatisfactory functional reconstruction. However, the current electrical stimulation (ES) apparatuses fail perfect nerve repair due to their inability of the variable synchronous self&#8208;regulated function with physiological states. It is urgent to develop an implantable ES platform with physiologically adaptive function to provide instantaneous and nerve&#8208;preferred ES. Here, a physiologically self&#8208;regulated electrical signal is generated by integrating a novel tribo/piezoelectric hybrid nanogenerator with a nanoporous nerve guide conduit to construct a fully implantable neural electrical stimulation (FI&#8208;NES) system. The optimal neural ES parameters completely originate from the body itself and are highly self&#8208;responsive to different physiological states. The morphological evaluation, representative protein expression level, and functional reconstruction of the regenerated nerves are conducted to assess the PNI recovery process. Evidence shows that the recovery effect of 15&#160;mm length nerve defects under the guidance of the FI&#8208;NES system is significantly close to the autograft. The designed FI&#8208;NES system provides an effective method for long&#8208;term accelerating the recovery of PNI in vivo and is also appropriate for other tissue injury or neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Construction of Six&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Coordinated Single Ni Sites on g&#8208;C3N4 with Boron&#8208;Oxo Species for Photocatalytic Water&#8208;Activation&#8208;Induced CO2 Reduction</title>

         <dc:description>
Six&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated single Ni (II) sites are successfully anchored by highly dispersed boron&#8208;oxo species on g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets. The as&#8208;fabricated single&#8208;atom Ni photocatalyst can realize efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction, where single Ni atoms can effectively capture photoelectrons and preferentially reduce absorbed water to produce H atoms as active species eventually inducing the reduction of CO2.








Abstract
The configuration regulation of single&#8208;atom photocatalysts (SAPCs) can significantly influence the interfacial charge transfer and subsequent catalytic process. The construction of conventional SAPCs for aqueous CO2 reduction is mainly devoted toward favorable activation and photoreduction of CO2, however, the role of water is frequently neglected. In this work, single Ni atoms are successfully anchored by boron&#8208;oxo species on g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets through a facile ion&#8208;exchange method. The dative interaction between the B atom and the sp2 N atom of g&#8208;C3N4 guarantees the high dispersion of boron&#8208;oxo species, where O atoms coordinate with single Ni (II) sites to obtain a unique six&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated configuration. The optimized single&#8208;atom Ni photocatalyst, rivaling Pt&#8208;modified g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets, provides excellent CO2 reduction rate with CO and CH4 as products. Quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra, transient absorption spectra, isotopic labeling, and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectra reveal that as&#8208;fabricated six&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated single Ni (II) sites can effectively capture the photoelectrons of CN along the B&#63743;O bridges and preferentially activate adsorbed water to produce H atoms to eventually induce a hydrogen&#8208;assisted CO2 reduction. This work diversifies the synthetic strategies for single&#8208;atom catalysts and provides insight on correlation between the single&#8208;atom configuration and reaction pathway.

         <title>High&#8208;Speed Fabrication of All&#8208;Inkjet&#8208;Printed Organometallic Halide Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes on Elastic Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inkjet&#8208;printing approaches are used to fabricate flexible organometallic halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes on elastic substrates from the bottom anode to the top cathode under ambient conditions. The fabrication time is significantly shortened by at least tenfold. The device has a novel simplified 4&#8208;layer structure without conventional electron&#8208; and hole&#8208;transport&#8208;layer, but still exhibits extremely high performance even under aggressive bending tests.








Abstract
Halide perovskites have great potential for use in high&#8208;performance light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and displays. Here, a perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) fabricated directly on an elastomer substrate, in which every single layer in the device from bottom anode to top cathode is patterned solely using a highly scalable inkjet printing process, is reported. Compared to PeLEDs made using conventional microfabrication processes, the printing process significantly shortens the fabrication time by at least tenfold (from over 5 h to less than 25 min). The all&#8208;printed PeLEDs have a novel 4&#8208;layer structure (bottom electrode, perovskite emissive layer, buffer layer, top electrode) without separate electron or hole transporting layers. For flexible PeLEDs printed directly in ambient conditions, a turn&#8208;on voltage, maximum luminance intensity, and maximum current efficiency of 3.46&#160;V, 10227&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, and 2.01&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1, respectively, is achieved. The devices also exhibit excellent robustness and stability even when bent to a curvature radius of 2.5&#160;mm. The reported device structure and fabrication processes can enable high&#8208;performance flexible PeLEDs to be manufactured over a larger area at extremely low cost and fast speed, which can facilitate the adoption of the promising PeLED technology in the emerging foldable displays, smart wearables, and many other applications.

The devices also exhibit excellent robustness and stability even when bent to a curvature radius of 2.5&#160;mm. The reported device structure and fabrication processes can enable high-performance flexible PeLEDs to be manufactured over a larger area at extremely low cost and fast speed, which can facilitate the adoption of the promising PeLED technology in the emerging foldable displays, smart wearables, and many other applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Printing Scaffold Vaccine for Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D printed scaffolds loaded with immunoregulators are developed for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. The implantable 3D scaffold vaccine with porous structure endows similar functions compared with lymphoid organs by recruiting immune cells and promoting antigen presentation, as well as inducing robust antitumor immune responses. This 3D scaffold vaccine is also capable of customized manufacturing and personalized treatment.








Abstract
Cancer vaccine platform has attracted great interest in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Here, 3D printed scaffolds loaded with immunoregulators are developed for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. The rapid manufacturing and precise molding based on 3D printing can realize the mass manufacturing of cancer vaccines and personalized design. Meanwhile, compared to the traditional hydrogel, the 3D&#8208;scaffold with porous structure endows its similar functions compared with real lymphoid organs by recruitment of a great number of immune cells, leading to the formation of &#8220;artificial tertiary lymphoid structures,&#8221; where there is a promising site to enhance both humoral and cellular immune responses. Efficient anticancer immunity is induced when combined with immune checkpoint blockade to inhibit the tumor growth. Personalized antitumor scaffold vaccines are further demonstrated for filling of tumor site after surgery to prevent cancer metastasis. Taken together, these results promise the 3D printing scaffold vaccine as the potential strategy for cancer vaccine therapy in the future.

         <title>Superior High&#8208;Temperature Strength in a Supersaturated Refractory High&#8208;Entropy Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural materials with exceptional high&#8208;temperature strengths are highly desirable for high&#8208;temperature applications. In this work, three alloy&#8208;design principles of the large atomic&#8208;size and elastic&#8208;modulus mismatches, the insensitive temperature&#8208;dependence of elastic properties, and the dominance of non&#8208;screw dislocations are used to design a CrMoNbV refractory high&#8208;entropy alloy, which exhibits outperforming high&#8208;temperature strengths.








Abstract
Refractory high&#8208;entropy alloys (RHEAs) show promising applications at high temperatures. However, achieving high strengths at elevated temperatures above 1173K is still challenging due to heat softening. Using intrinsic material characteristics as the alloy&#8208;design principles, a single&#8208;phase body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) CrMoNbV RHEA with high&#8208;temperature strengths (beyond 1000&#160;MPa at 1273 K) is designed, superior to other reported RHEAs as well as conventional superalloys. The origin of the high&#8208;temperature strength is revealed by in situ neutron scattering, transmission&#8208;electron microscopy, and first&#8208;principles calculations. The CrMoNbV's elevated&#8208;temperature strength retention up to 1273 K arises from its large atomic&#8208;size and elastic&#8208;modulus mismatches, the insensitive temperature dependence of elastic constants, and the dominance of non&#8208;screw character dislocations caused by the strong solute pinning, which makes the solid&#8208;solution strengthening pronounced. The alloy&#8208;design principles and the insights in this study pave the way to design RHEAs with outstanding high&#8208;temperature strength.

         <title>In&#8208;Materio Reservoir Computing in a Sulfonated Polyaniline Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfonated polyaniline (SPAN) organic electrochemical network device (OEND) that exhibits ionic conduction in a humid environment is used as an in materio reservoir for reservoir computing (RC). The output behavior indicates wide variations for each electrode, which improves RC performance. Practical spoken&#8208;digit classification is realized with 60% accuracy, demonstrating that SPAN OEND can manage time&#8208;series data operation in RC.








Abstract
A sulfonated polyaniline (SPAN) organic electrochemical network device (OEND) is fabricated using a simple drop&#8208;casting method on multiple Au electrodes for use in reservoir computing (RC). The SPAN network has humidity&#8208;dependent electrical properties. Under high humidity, the SPAN OEND exhibits mainly ionic conduction, including charging of an electric double layer and ionic diffusion. The nonlinearity and hysteresis of the current&#8211;voltage characteristics progressively increase with increasing humidity. The rich dynamic output behavior indicates wide variations for each electrode, which improves the RC performance because of the disordered network. For RC, waveform generation and short&#8208;term memory tasks are realized by a linear combination of outputs. The waveform task accuracy and memory capacity calculated from a short&#8208;term memory task reach 90% and 33.9, respectively. Improved spoken&#8208;digit classification is realized with 60% accuracy by only 12 outputs, demonstrating that the SPAN OEND can manage time series dynamic data operation in RC owing to a combination of rich dynamic and nonlinear electronic properties. The results suggest that SPAN&#8208;based electrochemical systems can be applied for material&#8208;based computing, by exploiting their intrinsic physicochemical behavior.

         <title>Controllable Doping in 2D Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable doping by modulating the thickness is realized in 2D layered materials. The decreasing thickness&#8208;induced lattice deformation makes defects in PtSSe transit from Pt vacancies in thicker PtSSe to anion vacancies in thinner PtSSe, which leads to controllable doping. Thickness&#8208;modulated doping shows great potential in novel electronics and optoelectronics, especially including diodes and photodetectors.








Abstract
For each generation of semiconductors, the issue of doping techniques is always placed at the top of the priority list since it determines whether a material can be used in the electronic and optoelectronic industry or not. When it comes to 2D materials, significant challenges have been found in controllably doping 2D semiconductors into p&#8208; or n&#8208;type, let alone developing a continuous control of this process. Here, a unique self&#8208;modulated doping characteristic in 2D layered materials such as PtSSe, PtS0.8Se1.2, PdSe2, and WSe2 is reported. The varying number of vertically stacked&#8208;monolayers is the critical factor for controllably tuning the same material from p&#8208;type to intrinsic, and to n&#8208;type doping. Importantly, it is found that the thickness&#8208;induced lattice deformation makes defects in PtSSe transit from Pt vacancies to anion vacancies based on dynamic and thermodynamic analyses, which leads to p&#8208; and n&#8208;type conductance, respectively. By thickness&#8208;modulated doping, WSe2 diode exhibits a high rectification ratio of 4400 and a large open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.38&#160;V. Meanwhile, the PtSSe detector overcomes the shortcoming of large dark&#8208;current in narrow&#8208;bandgap optoelectronic devices. All these findings provide a brand&#8208;new perspective for fundamental scientific studies and applications.

         <dc:description>
Protonated 3d transition&#8208;metal oxides often display low electronic conduction, which hampers their application in electric, magnetic, thermoelectric, and catalytic fields. In this work, a thermal hydration synthesis of conductive protonated oxides from 3d transition&#8208;metal oxides is introduced. By incorporating H2O into the lattice frame, the insulating brownmillerite SrCoO2.5 transforms to a novel layered&#8208;oxide SrCoO3H, which demonstrates a highly improved electric conduction.








Abstract
Protonated 3d transition&#8208;metal oxides often display low electronic conduction, which hampers their application in electric, magnetic, thermoelectric, and catalytic fields. Electronic conduction can be enhanced by co&#8208;inserting oxygen acceptors simultaneously. However, the currently used redox approaches hinder protons and oxygen ions co&#8208;insertion due to the selective switching issues. Here, a thermal hydration strategy for systematically exploring the synthesis of conductive protonated oxides from 3d transition&#8208;metal oxides is introduced. This strategy is illustrated by synthesizing a novel layered&#8208;oxide SrCoO3H from the brownmillerite SrCoO2.5. Compared to the insulating SrCoO2.5, SrCoO3H exhibits an unprecedented high electronic conductivity above room temperature, water uptake at 250&#160;&#176;C, and a thermoelectric power factor of up to 1.2&#160;mW K&#8722;2 m&#8722;1 at 300 K. These findings open up opportunities for creating high&#8208;conductive protonated layered oxides by protons and oxygen ions co&#8208;doping.

         <title>Polymerized Hybrid Perovskites with Enhanced Stability, Flexibility, and Lattice Rigidity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid perovskite with unsaturated  organoammoniums is demonstrated to be able to undergo solid&#8208;state polymerization without damaging the perovskite structure. The polymerized perovskite behaves like a polymer with enhanced stability and flexi bility. The lattice rigidity is also enhanced due to the polymerized covalent C&#63743;C bonding. As a result, a stable and efficient polymerized perovskite light&#8208;emitting diode with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.2% is demonstrated.








Abstract
The intrinsic soft lattice nature of organometal halide perovskites (OHPs) makes them very tolerant to defects and ideal candidates for solution&#8208;processed optoelectronic devices. However, the soft lattice results in low stability towards external stresses such as heating and humidity, high density of phonons and strong electron&#8211;phonon coupling (EPC). Here, it is demonstrated that the OHPs with unsaturated 4&#8208;vinylbenzylammonium (VBA) as organoammonium cations can be polymerized without damaging the perovskite structure and its tolerance to defects. The polymerized perovskites show enhanced stability and flexibility compared to regular three&#8208;dimensional and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites. Furthermore, the polymerized 4&#8208;vinylbenzylammonium group improves perovskite lattice rigidity substantially, resulting in a reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination rate because of suppressed electron&#8211;phonon coupling, and enhanced carrier mobility because of suppressed phonon scattering. 2D polymerized perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with strong electroluminescence at room temperature, and quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.2% and enhanced operation stability are demonstrated. The work has opened a new way of enhancing the intrinsic stability and optoelectronic properties of OHPs.

         <title>Understanding the Synergistic Oxidation in Dichalcogenides through Electrochemiluminescence Blinking at Millisecond Resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic oxidation in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is revealed through electrochemiluminescence blinking. The formation of sulfur vacancies at MoS2, by the edge activation of hydrogen peroxide and the oxygen migration to the basal plane, is more conducive to oxygen doping, which favors the formation of Mo&#8211;O&#8211;Mo, as active sites. This mechanism is universal to transition metal dichalcogenides containing sulfur atoms.








Abstract
The oxidation of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) has been extensively studied and applied in electronics, optics, and energy sources because of its tunable structure and performance. However, due to the lack of appropriate technology, dynamically observe the oxidation process remains an arduous task. Herein, the synergistic oxidation between edge and basal plane in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is observed through electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) blinking with a millisecond resolution. In addition, the ECL method provides a simple, convenient, and quick way to judge structural changes. The transient elevation of the ECL intensity proved the intermittent doping of oxygen at MoS2, which generates O&#8208;atom active sites. High ECL intensity enhanced from the produced hydroperoxide intermediates eases the monitoring of MoS2 particles. Further study shows that the formation of sulfur vacancies at MoS2, by the edge activation of hydrogen peroxide and the migration of oxygen to the basal plane, is more conducive to oxygen doping that favors the formation of Mo&#63743;O&#63743;Mo as new active sites to induce bursts. The revealing of sulfur vacancy&#8208;governed blinking from MoS2 indicates a complex interaction between oxygen and MoS2. The same phenomenon is observed on tungsten disulfide (WS2), which provides new information about the oxidation feature of 2D dichalcogenides.

3D graphene (3DG) is repeatedly crushed and reshaped to upgrade its overall performance like &#8220;Phoenix Nirvana.&#8221; 3DG is reborn to a higher self as NvG, making it emerge with unprecedented advantages in areas such as capacitive deionization and becoming a new engine to initiate the development of innovative 3D structures for carbon materials.








Abstract
The constructing of 3D materials with optimal performance is urgently needed to meet the growing demand of advanced materials in the high&#8208;tech sector. A distinctive 3D graphene (3DG) is designed based on a repeated rebirth strategy to obtain a better body and performance after each round of rebirth, as if it is Phoenix Nirvana. The properties of reborn graphene, namely 3DG after Nirvana (NvG), has been dramatically upgraded compared to 3DG, including high density (3.36 times) together with high porosity, as well as better electrical conductivity (1.41 times), mechanical strength (32.4 times), and ultrafast infiltration behavior. These advantages of NvG make it a strong intrinsic motivation for application in capacitive deionization (CDI). Using NvG directly as the CDI electrode, it has an extremely high volumetric capacity of 220&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3 at 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;3 and a maximum salt absorption capacity of 8.02~9.2&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;3 (8.9&#8211;10.2 times), while the power consumption for adsorption of the same mass of salt is less than a quarter of 3DG. The &#8220;Phoenix Nirvana&#8221;&#8208;like strategy of manufacturing 3D structures will undoubtedly become the new engine to kick&#8208;start the development of innovative carbon materials through an overall performance upgrade.

         <title>Revamping Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries for High Cell&#8208;Level Energy Density by Synergistic Utilization of Polysulfide Additives and Artificial Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical approach for achieving a high &#8220;cell&#8208;level&#8221; energy density using lithium polysulfides (LPS)&#8208;containing electrolytes and Li2S&#8208;phobic artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (A&#8208;SEI) layers is presented. The synergistic effects from the LPS and A&#8208;SEI result in superior cell&#8208;level volumetric energy densities (&#8776;650&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1) and large cumulative energy densities considering cycling life. 








Abstract
Despite the high theoretical capacity of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, a high cell&#8208;level energy density and a long cycling life are barely achieved, mainly due to the large electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio, polysulfide (PS) shuttle causing the loss of active sulfur, and the formation of passivation layers on the Li anode. To raise the energy density, holding PS in the cathode has been the most popular approach. Still, it has failed, particularly, when the sulfur loading is high enough to have energy densities similar to those of commercial Li&#8208;ion batteries. Here, a practical approach of achieving high &#8220;cell&#8208;level&#8221; energy densities is attempted using lithium PS (LPS)&#8208;containing electrolytes instead of a pure electrolyte, reducing the electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio and PS diffusion out of the cathode due to concentration differences.

&lt;p&gt;A practical approach for achieving a high &#8220;cell-level&#8221; energy density using lithium polysulfides (LPS)-containing electrolytes and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S-phobic artificial solid-electrolyte interphase (A-SEI) layers is presented. The synergistic effects from the LPS and A-SEI result in superior cell-level volumetric energy densities (&#8776;650&#160;Wh&#160;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and large cumulative energy densities considering cycling life. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the high theoretical capacity of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, a high cell-level energy density and a long cycling life are barely achieved, mainly due to the large electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio, polysulfide (PS) shuttle causing the loss of active sulfur, and the formation of passivation layers on the Li anode. To raise the energy density, holding PS in the cathode has been the most popular approach. Still, it has failed, particularly, when the sulfur loading is high enough to have energy densities similar to those of commercial Li-ion batteries. Here, a practical approach of achieving high &#8220;cell-level&#8221; energy densities is attempted using lithium PS (LPS)-containing electrolytes instead of a pure electrolyte, reducing the electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio and PS diffusion out of the cathode due to concentration differences. Meanwhile, the persistent problems including PS passivation and Li dendrites are suppressed using Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S-phobic artificial solid-electrolyte interphase (A-SEI) layers on Li metal. The synergistic effects from the LPS additives and A-SEI result in a superior cell-level volumetric energy density of 650&#160;Wh&#160;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; as well as large cumulative energy densities considering cycling life. This approach provides an important stepping stone to realize commercial Li&#8211;S batteries rivaling the current Li-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phototriggered Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Direct Generation of 4D Soft Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to realize remote spatio&#8208;temporal control of luminescence behavior of materials through a phototriggered aggregation&#8208;induced emission (PTAIE) process is reported. With the strategy, laser&#8208;mediated mask&#8208;free writing and transformable 4D soft patterns of AIE&#8208;active gels are realized.








Abstract
Microscopic control of macroscopic phenomena is one of the core subjects in materials science. Particularly, the spatio&#8208;temporal control of material behaviors through a non&#8208;contact way is of fundamental importance but is difficult to accomplish. Herein, a strategy to realize remote spatio&#8208;temporal control of luminescence behaviors is reported. A multi&#8208;arm salicylaldehyde benzoylhydrazone&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)/metal&#8208;ion system, of which the fluorescence can be gated by the UV irradiation with time dependency, is developed. By changing the metal&#8208;ion species, the fluorescence emission and the intensity can also be tuned. The mechanism of the UV&#8208;mediated fluorescence change is investigated, and it is revealed that a phototriggered aggregation&#8208;induced emission (PTAIE) process contributes to the behaviors. The AIEgen is further covalently integrated into a polymeric network and the formed gel/metal&#8208;ion system can achieve laser&#8208;mediated mask&#8208;free writing enabled by the PTAIE process. Moreover, by further taking advantage of the time&#8208;dependent self&#8208;healing property of hydrazone&#8208;based dynamic covalent bond, transformable 4D soft patterns are generated. The findings and the strategy increase the ways to manipulate molecules on the supramolecule or aggregate level. They also show opportunities for the development of controllable smart materials and expand the scope of the materials in advanced optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthesis Functionalization Enables Fine&#8208;Tuning the Molecular&#8208;Sieving Properties of Zeolites for Light Olefin/Paraffin Separations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effective size of zeolite pores is systematically tuned using a versatile method wherein organic molecules are covalently attached to zeolite frameworks via bridging oxygens using an electrophile, thereby obtaining size&#8208;selective adsorbents for light olefin/paraffin separations. 4&#8208;Methoxybenzene&#8208;functionalized MOR separates ethylene from ethane, whereas toluene&#8208;grafted MOR separates propylene/propane mixtures. Therefore, tailoring the molecular&#8208;sieving properties of zeolites by organic&#8208;functionalization broadens their applications to challenging separations.








Abstract
Zeolite molecular sieves are widely used in gas separation and shape&#8208;selective catalysis, but these applications often require discriminating differences as little as 0.1 &#197;. Molecular sieving with such size selectivity demands zeolites with highly tunable pore diameters and adsorption properties, which are technically challenging to prepare. Nevertheless, it is shown that a wide range of organic functional groups can be covalently functionalized onto the interior pore walls of the zeolites, MOR, LTL, FAU, and MFI, to systematically &#8220;tune&#8221; their effective pore diameters with respect to the size of organic groups. For organic functionalization, small and aggressive organic electrophiles are used (e.g., organo&#8208;halide and &#8208;diazonium) as grafting agents, which are accessible to the intracrystalline void space, forming a C&#8211;Ozeolite bond in a reaction with a bridging oxygen as proved by multiple analysis data. It is demonstrated that the post&#8208;functionalization can be used to tailor the molecular sieving action of a parent zeolite to give size&#8208;selective adsorbents for light olefin/paraffin separations. 4&#8208;Methoxybenzene&#8208;functionalized MOR separates ethylene from ethane with an ideal&#8208;adsorbed&#8208;solution&#8208;theory selectivity of &#8776;5873, whereas toluene&#8208;grafted MOR completely separates propylene/propane mixtures. Therefore, tailoring the molecular&#8208;sieving properties of zeolites by organic functionalization broadens their applications to challenging separations.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Black Phosphorus Heterostructures with Improved Ambient Stability and Enhanced Charge Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular engineering strategy is demonstrated to prepare ambient stable black phosphorus (BP)/hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) hybrid heterostructures. This strategy not only modifies the band structure of BP sheets but also improves their charge mobility, paving the way toward ambient processing and fabrication of high&#8208;performance BP&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Overcoming the intrinsic instability and preserving unique electronic properties are key challenges for the practical applications of black phosphorus (BP) under ambient conditions. Here, it is demonstrated that molecular heterostructures of BP and hexaazatriphenylene derivatives (BP/HATs) enable improved environmental stability and charge transport properties. The strong interfacial coupling and charge transfer between the HATs and the BP lattice decrease the surface electron density and protect BP sheets from oxidation, resulting in an excellent ambient lifetime of up to 21 d. Importantly, HATs increase the charge scattering time of BP, contributing to an improved carrier mobility of 97 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1, almost three times of the pristine BP films, based on noninvasive THz spectroscopic studies. The film mobility is an order of magnitude larger than previously reported values in exfoliated 2D materials. The strategy opens up new avenues for versatile applications of BP sheets and provides an effective method for tuning the physicochemical properties of other air&#8208;sensitive 2D semiconductors.

         <title>Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic&#8211;Organic Isoporous Membranes with Tunable Pore Sizes and Functionalities for Molecular Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic&#8211;organic isoporous membranes are fabricated via sequential infiltration synthesis and atomic layer deposition within block copolymer membranes followed by addition of functional organic molecules. The membrane pore sizes are controlled by metal oxide growth in a predictive manner. The hybrid membranes exhibit superior selectivity and permeability in separating 1&#8211;2 nm organic molecules and similar&#8208;sized proteins.








Abstract
Accomplishing on&#8208;demand molecular separation with a high selectivity and good permeability is very desirable for pollutant removal and chemical and pharmaceutical processing. The major challenge for sub&#8208;10&#160;nm filtration of particles and molecules is the fabrication of high&#8208;performance membranes with tunable pore size and designed functionality. Here, a versatile top&#8208;down approach is demonstrated to produce such a membrane using isoporous block copolymer membranes with well&#8208;defined pore sizes combined with growth of metal oxide using sequential infiltration synthesis and atomic layer deposition (SIS and ALD). The pore size of the membranes is tuned by controlled metal oxide growth within and onto the polymer channels, enabling up to twofold pore diameter reduction. Following the growth, the distinct functionalities are readily incorporated along the membrane nanochannels with either hydrophobic, cationic, or anionic groups via straightforward and scalable gas/liquid&#8211;solid interface reactions. The hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the membrane nanochannel is significantly changed by the introduction of hydrophilic metal oxide and hydrophobic fluorinated groups. The functionalized membranes exhibit a superior selectivity and permeability in separating 1&#8211;2&#160;nm organic molecules and fractionating similar&#8208;sized proteins based on size, charge, and hydrophobicity. This demonstrates the great potential of organic&#8211;inorganic&#8211;organic isoporous membranes for high&#8208;performance molecular separation in numerous applications.

The functionalized membranes exhibit a superior selectivity and permeability in separating 1&#8211;2&#160;nm organic molecules and fractionating similar-sized proteins based on size, charge, and hydrophobicity. This demonstrates the great potential of organic&#8211;inorganic&#8211;organic isoporous membranes for high-performance molecular separation in numerous applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Textile Waste Fiber Regeneration via a Green Chemistry Approach: A Molecular Strategy for Sustainable Fashion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green chemical method for complete separation and regeneration of natural/synthetic blended fabrics is introduced, which aims to provide a universal recycling strategy for fast fashion waste and provide a new source of fibers. Besides single&#8208;component fibers, a new composite fiber consisting of cellulose and wool keratin is also regenerated, which presents unique morphology differing from previous studies.








Abstract
Fast fashion, as a continuously growing part of the textile industry, is widely criticized for its excessive resource use and high generation of textiles. To reduce its environmental impacts, numerous efforts are focused on finding sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly approaches to textile recycling. However, waste textiles and fibers are still mainly disposed of in landfills or by incineration after their service life and thereby pollute the natural environment, as there is still no effective strategy to separate natural fibers from chemical fibers. Herein, a green chemistry strategy is developed for the separation and regeneration of waste textiles at the molecular level. Cellulose/wool keratin composite fibers and multicomponent fibers are regenerated from waste textiles via a green chemical process. The strategy attempts to reduce the large amount of waste textiles generated by the fast&#8208;developing fashion industry and provide a new source of fibers, which can also address the fossil fuel reserve shortages caused by chemical fiber industries and global food shortages caused by natural fiber production.

         <title>Elastic Lattice and Excess Charge Carrier Manipulation in 1D&#8211;3D Perovskite Solar Cells for Exceptionally Long&#8208;Term Operational Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electro&#8208;strictive strain in 3D polycrystalline perovskite is observed, which can lead to an accelerated ion migration under operational conditions. The 1D&#8211;3D perovskite, that is, 1D BnPbI3 perovskite, spatially distributed in the 3D perovskite film and compensating the dangling bonds in the grain boundaries, can effectively inhibit electro&#8208;strictive  responses and unbalanced charge carrier extraction, realizing ultralong operational stability.








Abstract
3D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid halide perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) inherently face severe instability issue due to ion migration under operational conditions. This ion migration inevitably results from the decomposition of ionic bonds under lattice strain and is accelerated by the existence of excess charge carriers. In this study, a 1D&#8211;3D mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite material is explored by adding an organic salt with a bulk benzimidazole cation (Bn+). The Bn+ can induce 3D perovskite crystalline growth with the preferred orientation and form a 1D BnPbI3 perovskite spatially distributed in the 3D perovskite film. For the first time, the electro&#8208;strictive response, which has a significant influence on the lattice strain under an electric field, is observed in polycrystalline perovskite. The 1D&#8211;3D perovskite can effectively suppress electro&#8208;strictive responses and unbalanced charge carrier extraction, providing an intrinsically stable lattice with enhanced ionic bonds and fewer excess charge carriers. As a result, the ion migration behavior of the p&#8208;i&#8208;n 1D&#8211;3D based pero&#8208;SC is dramatically suppressed under operational conditions, showing ultra&#8208;long&#8208;term stability that retains 95.3% of its initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) under operation for 3072 h, and simultaneously achieving an excellent PCE with a hysteresis&#8208;free photovoltaic behavior.

Cancer Immunotherapy
In article number 2106768, Chao Wang and co&#8208;workers develop a 3D&#8208;printed scaffold loaded with immunoregulators for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. The 3D&#8208;scaffold with porous structure endows the system with similar functions to real lymphoid organs by the recruitment of a large number of immune cells, leading to the formation of &#8220;artificial tertiary lymphoid structures&#8221; (aTLS), which are promising sites to enhance both humoral and cellular immune responses. Efficient anticancer immunity is induced when combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis.

Capacitive Pressure Sensors
Low sensitivity at large pressure has been a long&#8208;lasting obstacle of capacitive pressure sensors. In article number 2103320, Nanshu Lu and co&#8208;workers introduce a hybrid&#8208;response pressure sensor (HRPS), which offers a promising solution to this challenge. By laminating an electrically conductive porous nanocomposite (PNC) with an ultrathin insulating layer, the combined piezoresistivity and piezocapacitivity of the PNC enable up to 423% improvement over existing sensors.

Topological Nodal Line States
A mirror helps light rays to make an image of an object; the mirror planes in a material's crystal structure similarly guide electrons and enhance the properties. In article number 2104126, Chandra Shekhar and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that the abundance of such mirror planes is primarily responsible for topological nodal line states at the Fermi energy in some ferromagnetic metals, leading to a large anomalous Hall conductivity.

Molecular Sieves
Zeolite molecular sieves are widely used in gas separation, but this application often requires discriminating differences as little as 0.1 &#197;. Molecular sieving with such size selectivity demands zeolites with highly tunable pore diameters. In article number 2105398, Michal Mazur, Hae Sung Cho, Changbum Jo, and co&#8208;workers report the development of a versatile method for tuning zeolite micropores by attaching organic molecules to internal bridging oxygens, thereby obtaining size&#8208;selective adsorbents for light olefin/paraffin separation.

         <title>Conquering the Hypoxia Limitation for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficacy of photodynamic therapy is often restricted by the hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME). The strategies deve loped to alleviate tumor hypoxia in the past decades are reviewed, including delivering exogenous O2, in situ O2 generation, reducing cellular O2 consumption by inhibiting respiration, regulating the TME, and inhibiting the hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor 1 (HIF&#8208;1) signaling pathway.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has aroused great research interest in recent years owing to its high spatiotemporal selectivity, minimal invasiveness, and low systemic toxicity. However, due to the hypoxic nature characteristic of many solid tumors, PDT is frequently limited in therapeutic effect. Moreover, the consumption of O2 during PDT may further aggravate the tumor hypoxic condition, which promotes tumor proliferation, metastasis, and invasion resulting in poor prognosis of treatment. Therefore, numerous efforts have been made to increase the O2 content in tumor with the goal of enhancing PDT efficacy. Herein, these strategies developed in past decade are comprehensively reviewed to alleviate tumor hypoxia, including 1) delivering exogenous O2 to tumor directly, 2) generating O2 in situ, 3) reducing tumor cellular O2 consumption by inhibiting respiration, 4) regulating the TME, (e.g., normalizing tumor vasculature or disrupting tumor extracellular matrix), and 5) inhibiting the hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor 1 (HIF&#8208;1) signaling pathway to relieve tumor hypoxia. Additionally, the O2&#8208;independent Type&#8208;I PDT is also discussed as an alternative strategy. By reviewing recent progress, it is hoped that this review will provide innovative perspectives in new nanomaterials designed to combat hypoxia and avoid the associated limitation of PDT.

         <dc:description>
Recent advances on nanocellulose&#8208;based composites consisting of nanocellulose and other electrochemical materials for emerging flexible energy&#8208;storage devices are comprehensively discussed, with a focus on structure&#8211;property&#8211;application relationships to optimize their performance. The current challenges and future developments regarding design and fabrication of nanocellulose&#8208;based composites for the next generation of  energy&#8208;storage systems are discussed and proposed.








Abstract
With the increasing demand for wearable electronics (such as smartwatch equipment, wearable health monitoring systems, and human&#8211;robot interface units), flexible energy storage systems with eco&#8208;friendly, low&#8208;cost, multifunctional characteristics, and high electrochemical performances are imperative to be constructed. Nanocellulose with sustainable natural abundance, superb properties, and unique structures has emerged as a promising nanomaterial, which shows significant potential for fabricating functional energy storage systems. This review is intended to provide novel perspectives on the combination of nanocellulose with other electrochemical materials to design and fabricate nanocellulose&#8208;based flexible composites for advanced energy storage devices. First, the unique structural characteristics and properties of nanocellulose are briefly introduced. Second, the structure&#8211;property&#8211;application relationships of these composites are addressed to optimize their performances from the perspective of processing technologies and micro/nano&#8208;interface structure. Next, the recent specific applications of nanocellulose&#8208;based composites, ranging from flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries and electrochemical supercapacitors to emerging electrochemical energy storage devices, such as lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, sodium&#8208;ion batteries, and zinc&#8208;ion batteries, are comprehensively discussed. Finally, the current challenges and future developments in nanocellulose&#8208;based composites for the next generation of flexible energy storage systems are proposed.

         <title>Engineered Bifunctional Proteins for Targeted Cancer Therapy: Prospects and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of various forms of bifunctional proteins (BFPs) for cancer treatment is becoming increasingly popular and important. BFPs can simultaneously act on different components in the tumor microenvironment, which are expected to play a diverse role in combating tumor heterogeneity and improving treatment outcomes. A variety of preclinical and early&#8208;stage clinical studies have reported their great potential in cancer treatment.








Abstract
Bifunctional proteins (BFPs) are a class of therapeutic agents produced through genetic engineering and protein engineering, and are increasingly used to treat various human diseases, including cancer. These proteins usually have two or more biological functions&#8212;specifically recognizing different molecular targets to regulate the related signaling pathways, or mediating effector molecules/cells to kill tumor cells. Unlike conventional small&#8208;molecule or single&#8208;target drugs, BFPs possess stronger biological activity but lower systemic toxicity. Hence, BFPs are considered to offer many benefits for the treatment of heterogeneous tumors. In this review, the authors briefly describe the unique structural feature of BFP molecules and innovatively divide them into bispecific antibodies, cytokine&#8208;based BFPs (immunocytokines), and protein toxin&#8208;based BFPs (immunotoxins) according to their mode of action. In addition, the latest advances in the development of BFPs are discussed and the potential limitations or problems in clinical applications are outlined. Taken together, future studies need to be centered on understanding the characteristics of BFPs for optimizing and designing more effective such drugs.

         <title>Advances in Microwave Synthesis of Nanoporous Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microwave ovens can be used as powerful devices in the synthesis of various  porous materials including silicas, carbons, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, and metal oxides. Microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis offers a simple, fast, efficient, and economic way to obtain nanoporous materials. The recent achievements in the microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis of these  diverse nanoporous materials and their potential applications are summarized.








Abstract
Usually, porous materials are synthesized by using conventional electric heating, which can be energy&#8208; and time&#8208;consuming. Microwave heating is commonly used in many households to quickly heat food. Microwave ovens can also be used as powerful devices in the synthesis of various porous materials. The microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis offers a simple, fast, efficient, and economic way to obtain many of the advanced nanomaterials. This review summarizes the recent achievements in the microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis of diverse groups of nanoporous materials including silicas, carbons, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, and metal oxides. Microwave&#8208;assisted methods afford highly porous materials with high specific surface areas (SSAs), e.g., activated carbons with SSA &#8776;3100 m2 g&#8722;1, metal&#8211;organic frameworks with SSA &#8776;4200&#160;m2 g&#8722;1, covalent organic frameworks with SSA &#8776;2900 m2 g&#8722;1, and metal oxides with relatively small SSA &#8776;300 m2 g&#8722;1. These methods are also successfully implemented for the preparation of ordered mesoporous silicas and carbons as well as spherically shaped nanomaterials. Most of the nanoporous materials obtained under microwave irradiation show potential applications in gas adsorption, water treatment, catalysis, energy storage, and drug delivery, among others.

         <title>Manipulating Intratumoral Fenton Chemistry for Enhanced Chemodynamic and Chemodynamic&#8208;Synergized Multimodal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advances in reinforcement strategies to increase the efficiency of intratumoral Fenton reaction are discussed. Then, multimodal anticancer therapies involving enhanced chemodynamic therapy and mechanisms of synergy are highlighted. Finally, the major challenges and further improvements of this evolving field are elaborated.








Abstract
Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) uses the tumor microenvironment&#8208;assisted intratumoral Fenton reaction for generating highly toxic hydroxyl free radicals (&#8226;OH) to achieve selective tumor treatment. However, the limited intratumoral Fenton reaction efficiency restricts the therapeutic efficacy of CDT. Recent years have witnessed the impressive development of various strategies to increase the efficiency of intratumoral Fenton reaction. The introduction of these reinforcement strategies can dramatically improve the treatment efficiency of CDT and further promote the development of enhanced CDT (ECDT)&#8208;based multimodal anticancer treatments. In this review, the authors systematically introduce these reinforcement strategies, from their basic working principles, reinforcement mechanisms to their representative clinical applications. Then, ECDT&#8208;based multimodal anticancer therapy is discussed, including how to integrate these emerging Fenton reinforcement strategies for accelerating the development of multimodal anticancer therapy, as well as the synergistic mechanisms of ECDT and other treatment methods. Eventually, future direction and challenges of ECDT and ECDT&#8208;based multimodal synergistic therapies are elaborated, highlighting the key scientific problems and unsolved technical bottlenecks to facilitate clinical translation.
