      <title>Stable, High&#8208;Efficiency Voltage&#8208;Dependent Color&#8208;Tunable Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with a Single Tetradentate Platinum(II) Emitter Having Long Operational Lifetime</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance voltage&#8208;dependent color&#8208;tunable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with a single Pt[O^N^C^N] emitter are fabricated. The emission color can be tuned from warm white to nature white or from orange to yellowish green, depending upon the emitter used. High external quantum efficiency (23.23%), low efficiency roll&#8208;off, long&#8208;term stability (LT90&#160;= 19&#160;105 h) and continuously variable color enable these color&#8208;tunable OLEDs to find applications in smart wearable devices.








Abstract
Voltage&#8208;dependent, color&#8208;tunable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are appealing tools that can be used for the visualization of electronic output signal of sensors. Nonetheless, the literature&#8208;reported color&#8208;tunable OLEDs that have a simple single&#8208;cell device structure suffer from relatively low efficiency, pronounced efficiency roll&#8208;off, color&#8208;aging, and short operation lifetime, all of which limit their practical applications. Here, a novel co&#8208;host&#8208;in&#8208;double&#8208;emissive&#8208;layer (CHIDEL) device, designed to enhance the performance of color&#8208;tunable OLEDs with the use of a single tetradentate Pt[O^N^C^N] emitter, is described. When Pt&#8208;X&#8208;2 is used as a single emitter in an optimized CHIDEL device, a white OLED with tunable Commission International de I'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates from (0.47, 0.44) at 3&#160;V to (0.36, 0.48) at 11&#160;V, a high color rendering index of 82, and high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 20.75% can be achieved. By using Pt&#8208;X&#8208;4 as a single emitter, the voltage&#8208;dependent color&#8208;tunable CHIDEL device, with CIE coordinates shifted from (0.56, 0.43) at 3&#160;V to (0.42, 0.55) at 11&#160;V, demonstrates a high luminance of beyond 90 000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a high EQE of 23.23% at a luminance of 1300&#160;cd m&#8722;2. A long&#8208;lifetime time to 90% of the initial luminance (LT90) of almost 20&#160;000 h is demonstrated for the color&#8208;tunable OLED with Pt&#8208;X&#8208;4 emitting dopant.

      <title>Nanoscale&#8208;Confined Terahertz Polaritons in a van der Waals Crystal</title>
      <dc:description>
Extreme confinement of long&#8208;wavelength terahertz radiation to nanoscale dimensions is achieved in the natural hyperbolic van der Waals crystal &#945;&#8208;MoO3. A range of highly anisotropic, in&#8208;plane THz polaritonic excitations are directly visualized in the 8&#8211;12 THz spectral range, exhibiting ultralow&#8208;loss propagation, tunable THz response, and orthogonal propagation directions.








Abstract
Electromagnetic field confinement is crucial for nanophotonic technologies, since it allows for enhancing light&#8211;matter interactions, thus enabling light manipulation in deep sub&#8208;wavelength scales. In the terahertz (THz) spectral range, radiation confinement is conventionally achieved with specially designed metallic structures&#8212;such as antennas or nanoslits&#8212;with large footprints due to the rather long wavelengths of THz radiation. In this context, phonon polaritons&#8212;light coupled to lattice vibrations&#8212;in van der Waals (vdW) crystals have emerged as a promising solution for controlling light beyond the diffraction limit, as they feature extreme field confinements and low optical losses. However, experimental demonstration of nanoscale&#8208;confined phonon polaritons at THz frequencies has so far remained elusive.

     alt="Nanoscale&#8208;Confined Terahertz Polaritons in a van der Waals Crystal"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extreme confinement of long&#8208;wavelength terahertz radiation to nanoscale dimensions is achieved in the natural hyperbolic van der Waals crystal &#945;&#8208;MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. A range of highly anisotropic, in&#8208;plane THz polaritonic excitations are directly visualized in the 8&#8211;12 THz spectral range, exhibiting ultralow&#8208;loss propagation, tunable THz response, and orthogonal propagation directions.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electromagnetic field confinement is crucial for nanophotonic technologies, since it allows for enhancing light&#8211;matter interactions, thus enabling light manipulation in deep sub&#8208;wavelength scales. In the terahertz (THz) spectral range, radiation confinement is conventionally achieved with specially designed metallic structures&#8212;such as antennas or nanoslits&#8212;with large footprints due to the rather long wavelengths of THz radiation. In this context, phonon polaritons&#8212;light coupled to lattice vibrations&#8212;in van der Waals (vdW) crystals have emerged as a promising solution for controlling light beyond the diffraction limit, as they feature extreme field confinements and low optical losses. However, experimental demonstration of nanoscale&#8208;confined phonon polaritons at THz frequencies has so far remained elusive. Here, it is provided by employing scattering&#8208;type scanning near&#8208;field optical microscopy combined with a free&#8208;electron laser to reveal a range of low&#8208;loss polaritonic excitations at frequencies from 8 to 12 THz in the vdW semiconductor &#945;&#8208;MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In this study, THz polaritons are visualized with: i) in&#8208;plane hyperbolic dispersion, ii) extreme nanoscale field confinement (below &#955;&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;&#8260;75), and iii) long polariton lifetimes, with a lower limit of &amp;gt;2&#160;ps.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Turning On Solid&#8208;State Luminescence by Phototriggered Subtle Molecular Conformation Variations</title>
      <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state intelligent materials, in particular those showing photoresponsive luminescence (PRL), is desirable for their cutting&#8208;edge applications but challenging. A PRL material that features sensitive and reversible fluorescence switching through phototriggering and thermal annealing is reported. The behavior is attributed to subtle molecular conformation variations. Excellent quality of thin&#8208;films and high PRL performance allows interesting applications in invisible anti&#8208;counterfeiting and dynamic optical data storage with micro&#8208;resolution.








Abstract
The development of solid&#8208;state intelligent materials, in particular those showing photoresponsive luminescence (PRL), is highly desirable for their cutting&#8208;edge applications in sensors, displays, data&#8208;storage, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting, but is challenging. Few PRL materials are constructed by tethering the classic photochromic systems with newly&#8208;emerged solid&#8208;state emitters. Selective solid&#8208;state photoreactions are demanded to precisely manipulate the luminescent behavior of these emitters, which require dramatic structural change and enough free space, thus limiting the scope of the PRL family. Here, a new PRL material, TPE&#8208;4N, that features sensitive and reversible fluorescence switching is reported. The interesting on&#8211;off luminescent property of TPE&#8208;4N can be facilely tuned through fast phototriggering and thermal annealing. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that subtle molecular conformation variation induces the corresponding PRL behavior. The crystalline and amorphous state endows an efficient and weak ISC process, respectively, to turn on and off the emission. The readily fabricated thin&#8208;film of TPE&#8208;4N exhibits non&#8208;destructive PRL behavior with high contrast (&gt;102), good light transmittance (&gt;72.3%), and great durability and reversibility under room light for months. Remarkably, a uniform thin&#8208;film with such fascinating PRL properties allows high&#8208;tech applications in invisible anti&#8208;counterfeiting and dynamic optical data storage with micro&#8208;resolution.

      <title>Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Modulated Supramolecular Assembly Increases Antitumor Potency against Malignant Breast Tumors via Tunable Cooperativity</title>
      <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled multi&#8208;iodinated boron dipyrromethene micelles (IBMs), via the interplay of both &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrophobic interactions, are reported. These IBMs cause efficient cascade delivery into cytoplasm and tunable photoconversion for yielding potent antitumor synergy against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer together with distinctly reduced recurrence and metastasis through the reversal of tumor immunosuppression.








Abstract
Triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains with highest incidence and mortality rates among females, and a critical bottleneck lies in rationally establishing potent therapeutics against TNBC. Here, the self&#8208;assembled micellar nanoarchitecture of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;modulated supramolecules with efficient cytoplasmic translocation and tunable photoconversion is shown, for potent suppression against primary, metastatic, and recurrent TNBC. Multi&#8208;iodinated boron dipyrromethene micelles yield tunable photoconversion into singlet oxygen and a thermal effect, together with deep penetration and subsequent cytoplasmic translocation at the tumor. Tetra&#8208;iodinated boron dipyrromethene micelles (4&#8208;IBMs) particularly show a distinctly enhanced cooperativity of antitumor efficiency through considerable expressions of apoptotic proteins, potently suppressing subcutaneous, and orthotopic TNBC models, together with reduced oxygen dependence. Furthermore, 4&#8208;IBMs yield preferable anti&#8208;metastatic and anti&#8208;recurrent efficacies through the inhibition of metastasis&#8208;relevant proteins, distinct immunogenic cell death, and re&#8208;education of M2 macrophages into tumoricidal M1 phenotype as compared to chemotherapy and surgical resection. These results offer insights into the cooperativity of supramolecular nanoarchitectures for potent phototherapy against TNBC.

      <title>Stabilizing Anionic Redox Chemistry in a Mn&#8208;Based Layered Oxide Cathode Constructed by Li&#8208;Deficient Pristine State</title>
      <dc:description>
O3&#8208;type Li0.6[Li0.2Mn0.8]O2 is successfully developed, with the pristine state displaying both a Li excess in the transition metal layer and a deficiency in the alkali metal layer. Benefiting from stable structure evolution and Li migration processes, irreversible lattice oxygen loss and structure distortion are effectively restrained.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich cathode materials are of significant interest for coupling anionic redox with cationic redox chemistry to achieve high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, lattice oxygen loss and derived structure distortion would induce serious capacity loss and voltage decay, further hindering its practical application. Herein, a novel Li&#8208;rich cathode material, O3&#8208;type Li0.6[Li0.2Mn0.8]O2, is developed with the pristine state displaying both a Li excess in the transition metal layer and a deficiency in the alkali metal layer. Benefiting from stable structure evolution and Li migration processes, not only can high reversible capacity (&#8776;329 mAh g&#8722;1) be harvested but also irreversible/reversible anionic/cationic redox reactions are comprehensively assigned via the combination of in/ex situ spectroscopies. Furthermore, irreversible lattice oxygen loss and structure distortion are effectively restrained, resulting in long&#8208;term cycle stability (capacity drop of 0.045% per cycle, 500 cycles). Altogether, tuning the Li state in the alkali metal layer presents a promising way for modification of high&#8208;capacity Li&#8208;rich cathode candidates.

      <title>Performance Limits of an Alternating Current Electroluminescent Device</title>
      <dc:description>
Electroluminescence can be achieved from nearly any emissive material with a single, generic device structure that uses alternating current voltage and a carbon nanotube contact. Performance limits of the device are studied through device modeling and experiments, demonstrating how low voltage and efficient electroluminescence can be achieved with emissive materials possessing a wide range of electrical and physical properties.








Abstract
The use of an alternating current (AC) voltage is a simple, versatile method of producing electroluminescence from generic emissive materials without the need for contact engineering. Recently, it was shown that AC&#8208;driven, capacitive electroluminescent devices with carbon nanotube network contacts can be used to generate and study electroluminescence from a variety of molecular materials emitting in the infrared&#8208;to&#8208;ultraviolet range. Here, performance trade&#8208;offs in these devices are studied through comprehensive device simulations and illustrative experiments, enhancing understanding of the mechanism and capability of electroluminescent devices based on alternating as opposed to direct current (DC) schemes. AC&#8208;driven electroluminescent devices can overcome several limitations of conventional DC&#8208;driven electroluminescent devices, including the requirement for proper alignment of material energy levels and the need to process emitting materials into uniform thin films. By simultaneously optimizing device geometry, driving parameters, and material characteristics, the performance of these devices can be tuned. Importantly, the turn&#8208;on voltage of AC&#8208;driven electroluminescent devices approaches the bandgap of the emitting material as the gate oxide thickness is scaled, and internally efficient electroluminescence can be achieved using low&#8208;mobility single&#8208;layer emitter films with varying thicknesses and energy barrier heights relative to the contact.

      <title>Operando Tailoring of Defects and Strains in Corrugated &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 Nanosheets for Stable and High&#8208;Rate Energy Storage</title>
      <dc:description>
Corrugated &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2, with outstanding activity and stability for hybrid supercapacitors, is developed through an electrochemical abuse strategy. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure technique and finite element analysis demonstrate that the in situ tailored lattice defects and the strain&#8208;induced highly curved micromorphology play critical roles in enhancing chemical activity and structural robustness.








Abstract
Nickel hydroxide represents a technologically important material for energy storage, such as hybrid supercapacitors.

&lt;p&gt;Corrugated &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with outstanding activity and stability for hybrid supercapacitors, is developed through an electrochemical abuse strategy. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure technique and finite element analysis demonstrate that the in situ tailored lattice defects and the strain&#8208;induced highly curved micromorphology play critical roles in enhancing chemical activity and structural robustness.

      <title>Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophage and Tumor&#8208;Cell Dually Transfecting Polyplexes for Efficient Interleukin&#8208;12 Cancer Gene Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Intravenously administered polymeric interleukin&#8208;12 (IL12) gene&#8208;delivery vector transfects both tumor cells and macrophages to efficiently produce IL12 inside the tumor, which activates anticancer immune responses and the tumor microenvironment, leading to retarded tumor growth and prolonged animals&#8217; survival with negligible systemic toxicities. This work demonstrates the first nonviral IL12 gene delivery making use of both macrophages and tumor cells.








Abstract
Interleukin 12 (IL12) is a potent pro&#8208;inflammatory chemokine with multifunction, including promoting cytotoxic T&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated killing of cancer cells. IL12&#8208;based cancer gene therapy can overcome IL12's life&#8208;threatening adverse effects, but its clinical translation has been limited by the lack of systemic gene&#8208;delivery vectors capable of efficiently transfecting tumors to produce sufficient local IL12. Macrophages inherently excrete IL12, and tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) are the major tumor component taking up a large fraction of the vectors arriving in the tumor. It is thus hypothesized that a gene vector efficiently transfecting both cancer cells and TAMs would make the tumor to produce sufficient IL12; however, gene transfection of TAMs is challenging due to their inherent strong degradation ability. Herein, an IL12 gene&#8208;delivery vector is designed that efficiently transfects both cancer cells and TAMs to make them as a factory for IL12 production, which efficiently activates anticancer immune responses and remodels the tumor microenvironment, for instance, increasing the M1/M2 ratio by more than fourfold. Therefore, the intravenously administered vector retards tumor growth and doubles survival in three animal models&#8217; with negligible systemic toxicities. This work reports the first nonviral IL12 gene delivery system that effectively makes use of both macrophages and tumor cells.

      <title>Consequences of Chirality in Directing the Pathway of Cholesteric Helix Inversion of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers by Light</title>
      <dc:description>
Alternating copolymers of fluorene and azobenzene exhibit exceptional chiroptical properties in annealed thin films. The chiroptical properties, polymer chain alignment, and their supramolecular helicity can be fully controlled by irradiating with polarized light. Intriguingly, the diastereomeric relationship between the supramolecular helicity of polymer and the circular polarization of light leads to an asymmetric helix inversion pathway, reminiscent of molecular motors.








Abstract
Control over main&#8208;chain motion of chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers can lead to unexpected new functionalities.&#160;Here, it is shown that by combining photoswitchable azobenzene units in conjugation with chiral fluorene comonomers and appropriate plasticizers, the polymer organization and chiroptical properties of these alternating copolymers steered by light and its state of polarization can be dynamically controlled. The configuration of the stereogenic centers in the side chains of the fluorene units determines the handedness of the cholesteric organization in thermally annealed films, indicating cooperative behavior. The polymer alignment and helicity of the supramolecular arrangement can be switched by irradiating with linearly and circularly polarized light, respectively.&#160;Intriguingly, when switching the handedness of thermally induced cholesteric organizations by illuminating with circularly polarized light that is opposite to the handedness of the cholesteric phases, a nematic&#8208;like intermediate state is observed during helix interconversion. By the sequence of irradiation with left and right circularly polarized light followed by thermal annealing, an asymmetric motion, reminiscent of that seen in molecular motors is observed. These findings suggest that functional conjugated polymers can exhibit emergent properties at mesoscopic scale.

      <title>Designing Mechanical Metamaterials with Kirigami&#8208;Inspired, Hierarchical Constructions for Giant Positive and Negative Thermal Expansion</title>
      <dc:description>
A type of 2D hierarchical metamaterial that incorporates kirigami&#8208;inspired bilayer actuating elements into periodic lattice patterns to allow for giant positive/negative CTEs is developed. Quantitative comparison to existing mechanical metamaterials suggests that the presented hierarchical metamaterials can substantially enlarge the accessible range of CTE in the Ashby plot, by nearly an order of magnitude for the biaxial CTE.








Abstract
Advanced mechanical metamaterials with unusual thermal expansion properties represent an area of growing interest, due to their promising potential for use in a broad range of areas. In spite of previous work on metamaterials with large or ultralow coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), achieving a broad range of CTE values with access to large thermally induced dimensional changes in structures with high filling ratios remains a key challenge. Here, design concepts and fabrication strategies for a kirigami&#8208;inspired class of 2D hierarchical metamaterials that can effectively convert the thermal mismatch between two closely packed constituent materials into giant levels of biaxial/uniaxial thermal expansion/shrinkage are presented. At large filling ratios (&gt;50%), these systems offer not only unprecedented negative and positive biaxial CTE (i.e., &#8722;5950 and 10 710&#160;ppm K&#8722;1), but also large biaxial thermal expansion properties (e.g., &gt;&#160;21% for 20 K temperature increase). Theoretical modeling of thermal deformations provides a clear understanding of the microstructure&#8211;property relationships and serves as a basis for design choices for desired CTE values. An Ashby plot of the CTE versus density serves as a quantitative comparison of the hierarchical metamaterials presented here to previously reported systems, indicating the capability for substantially enlarging the accessible range of CTE.

      <title>Recent Advances in Hyperthermia Therapy&#8208;Based Synergistic Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanomaterial&#8208;based hyperthermia therapy (HTT) including photothermal therapy and magnetic hyperthermia can not only ablate different types of primary tumors, but also sensitize tumors to create a highly immunogenic tumor microenvironment for immunotherapy to further fight against cancer metastasis and recurrence. Hence, such HTT&#8208;synergized immunotherapy approach offers a powerful method for curing cancer completely.








Abstract
The past decades have witnessed hyperthermia therapy (HTT) as an emerging strategy against malignant tumors. Nanomaterial&#8208;based photothermal therapy (PTT) and magnetic hyperthermia (MHT), as highly effective and noninvasive treatment models, offer advantages over other strategies in the treatment of different types of tumors. However, both PTT and MHT cannot completely cure cancer due to recurrence and distal metastasis. In recent years, cancer immunotherapy has attracted widespread attention owing to its capability to activate the body's own natural defense to identify, attack, and eradicate cancer cells. Significant efforts have been devoted to studying the activated immune responses caused by hyperthermia&#8208;ablated tumors. In this article, the synergistic mechanism of HTT in immunotherapy, including immunogenic cell death and reversal of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment is discussed. The reports of the combination of HTT or HTT&#8208;based multimodal therapy with immunotherapy, including immunoadjuvant exploitation, immune checkpoint blockade therapy, and adoptive cellular immunotherapy are summarized. As highlighted, these strategies could achieve synergistically enhanced therapeutic outcomes against both primary tumors and metastatic lesions, prevent cancer recurrence, and prolong the survival period. Finally, current challenges and prospective developments in HTT&#8208;synergized immunotherapy are also reviewed.

      <title>Nanocellulose: Recent Fundamental Advances and Emerging Biological and Biomimicking Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanocelluloses have recently become the focal point of sustainable nanoconstruction. Beyond the classic approaches dealing with, for example, reinforced nanocomposites, barriers, films, and structural color, the fundamental interactions within nanocelluloses, multifunctional hybrid gels, multicomponent fibers, and nanocelluloses in artificial photosynthesis are reviewed.








Abstract
In the effort toward sustainable advanced functional materials, nanocelluloses have attracted extensive recent attention. Nanocelluloses range from rod&#8208;like highly crystalline cellulose nanocrystals to longer and more entangled cellulose nanofibers, earlier denoted also as microfibrillated celluloses and bacterial cellulose. In recent years, they have spurred research toward a wide range of applications, ranging from nanocomposites, viscosity modifiers, films, barrier layers, fibers, structural color, gels, aerogels and foams, and energy applications, until filtering membranes, to name a few. Still, nanocelluloses continue to show surprisingly high challenges to master their interactions and tailorability to allow well&#8208;controlled assemblies for functional materials. Rather than trying to review the already extensive nanocellulose literature at large, here selected aspects of the recent progress are the focus. Water interactions, which are central for processing for the functional properties, are discussed first. Then advanced hybrid gels toward (multi)stimuli responses, shape&#8208;memory materials, self&#8208;healing, adhesion and gluing, biological scaffolding, and forensic applications are discussed. Finally, composite fibers are discussed, as well as nanocellulose as a strategy for improvement of photosynthesis&#8208;based chemicals production. In summary, selected perspectives toward new directions for sustainable high&#8208;tech functional materials science based on nanocelluloses are described.

     alt="Nanocellulose: Recent Fundamental Advances and Emerging Biological and Biomimicking Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanocelluloses have recently become the focal point of sustainable nanoconstruction. Beyond the classic approaches dealing with, for example, reinforced nanocomposites, barriers, films, and structural color, the fundamental interactions within nanocelluloses, multifunctional hybrid gels, multicomponent fibers, and nanocelluloses in artificial photosynthesis are reviewed.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the effort toward sustainable advanced functional materials, nanocelluloses have attracted extensive recent attention. Nanocelluloses range from rod&#8208;like highly crystalline cellulose nanocrystals to longer and more entangled cellulose nanofibers, earlier denoted also as microfibrillated celluloses and bacterial cellulose. In recent years, they have spurred research toward a wide range of applications, ranging from nanocomposites, viscosity modifiers, films, barrier layers, fibers, structural color, gels, aerogels and foams, and energy applications, until filtering membranes, to name a few. Still, nanocelluloses continue to show surprisingly high challenges to master their interactions and tailorability to allow well&#8208;controlled assemblies for functional materials. Rather than trying to review the already extensive nanocellulose literature at large, here selected aspects of the recent progress are the focus. Water interactions, which are central for processing for the functional properties, are discussed first. Then advanced hybrid gels toward (multi)stimuli responses, shape&#8208;memory materials, self&#8208;healing, adhesion and gluing, biological scaffolding, and forensic applications are discussed. Finally, composite fibers are discussed, as well as nanocellulose as a strategy for improvement of photosynthesis&#8208;based chemicals production. In summary, selected perspectives toward new directions for sustainable high&#8208;tech functional materials science based on nanocelluloses are described.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identifying Ionic and Electronic Charge Transfer at Oxide Heterointerfaces</title>
      <dc:description>
The combined role of ionic and electronic charge transfer in oxide heterointerfaces (LaAlO3/SrTiO3) is investigated. New near&#8208;ambient&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy data proves a reversible Sr cation reconstruction under thermodynamic treatment to be responsible for lowered interface conductivity and enhanced magnetism under low temperatures. Ionic movement is found to be considerably higher and more influential than in the bulk.








Abstract
The ability to tailor oxide heterointerfaces has led to novel properties in low&#8208;dimensional oxide systems. A fundamental understanding of these properties is based on the concept of electronic charge transfer. However, the electronic properties of oxide heterointerfaces crucially depend on their ionic constitution and defect structure: ionic charges contribute to charge transfer and screening at oxide interfaces, triggering a thermodynamic balance of ionic and electronic structures. Quantitative understanding of the electronic and ionic roles regarding charge&#8208;transfer phenomena poses a central challenge. Here, the electronic and ionic structure is simultaneously investigated at the prototypical charge&#8208;transfer heterointerface, LaAlO3/SrTiO3. Applying in situ photoemission spectroscopy under oxygen ambient, ionic and electronic charge transfer is deconvoluted in response to the oxygen atmosphere at elevated temperatures. In this way, both the rich and variable chemistry of complex oxides and the associated electronic properties are equally embraced. The interfacial electron gas is depleted through an ionic rearrangement in the strontium cation sublattice when oxygen is applied, resulting in an inverse and reversible balance between cation vacancies and electrons, while the mobility of ionic species is found to be considerably enhanced as compared to the bulk. Triggered by these ionic phenomena, the electronic transport and magnetic signature of the heterointerface are significantly altered.

      <dc:description>
Here, a straightforward polyTPD passivation is introduced to reduce the defect&#8208;mediated recombination by elucidating the imperfections on the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite materials. Suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination and improved interfacial hole extraction result in perovskite solar cells with stabilized efficiency exceeding 21%. Moreover, ultra&#8208;hydrophobic and thermally robust polyTPD passivated devices retain 94% of the initial efficiency after 800 h under operational conditions.








Abstract
The failure of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to maintain their maximum efficiency over a prolonged time is due to the deterioration of the light harvesting material under environmental factors such as humidity, heat, and light. Systematically elucidating and eliminating such degradation pathways are critical to imminent commercial use of this technology. Here, a straightforward approach is introduced to reduce the level of defect&#8208;states present at the perovskite and hole transporting layer interface by treating the various perovskite surfaces with poly(N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;4&#8208;butylphenyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisphenyl)benzidine (polyTPD) molecules. This strategy significantly suppresses the defect&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative recombination in the ensuing devices and prevents the penetration of degrading agents into the inner layers by passivating the perovskite surface and grain boundaries. Suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination and improved interfacial hole extraction result in PSCs with stabilized efficiency exceeding 21% with negligible hysteresis (&#8776;19.1% for control device). Moreover, ultra&#8208;hydrophobic polyTPD passivant considerably alleviates moisture penetration, showing &#8776;91% retention of initial efficiencies after 300 h storage at high relative humidity of 80%. Similarly, passivated device retains 94% of its initial efficiency after 800 h under operational conditions (maximum power point tracking under continuous illumination at 60&#160;&#176;C). In addition to interfacial passivation function, hole&#8208;selective role of dopant&#8208;free polyTPD is also evaluated and discussed in this study.

      <title>Strain&#8208;Mediated High Conductivity in Ultrathin Antiferromagnetic Metallic Nitrides</title>
      <dc:description>
Electronic state transitions in highly crystalline antiferromagnetic CrN films are mediated with strain and reduced dimensionality. Surprisingly, the CrN layer is still highly conductive when its thickness shrinks to 1&#8208;unit&#8208;cell, which is far below the critical thickness of most metallic films. The ability to achieve highly conductive nitride ultrathin films can be used for utilizing their exceptional characteristics.








Abstract
Strain engineering provides the ability to control the ground states and associated phase transition in epitaxial films. However, the systematic study of the intrinsic character and strain dependency in transition&#8208;metal nitrides remains challenging due to the difficulty in fabricating stoichiometric and high&#8208;quality films. Here the observation of an electronic state transition in highly crystalline antiferromagnetic CrN films with strain and reduced dimensionality is reported. By shrinking the film thickness to a critical value of &#8776;30 unit cells, a profound conductivity reduction accompanied by unexpected volume expansion is observed in CrN films. The electrical conductivity is observed surprisingly when the CrN layer is as thin as a single unit cell thick, which is far below the critical thickness of most metallic films. It is found that the metallicity of an ultrathin CrN film recovers from insulating behavior upon the removal of the as&#8208;grown strain by the fabrication of freestanding nitride films. Both first&#8208;principles calculations and linear dichroism measurements reveal that the strain&#8208;mediated orbital splitting effectively customizes the relatively small bandgap at the Fermi level, leading to an exotic phase transition in CrN. The ability to achieve highly conductive nitride ultrathin films by harnessing strain&#8208;control over competing phases can be used for utilizing their exceptional characteristics.

In recent years, microfluidic technologies have increasingly been applied toward the accelerated synthesis science studies of solution&#8208;processed nanomaterials, allowing greater control over synthesis conditions, lower reagent consumption, and unique data access through online monitoring techniques.

      <title>An Ultrahigh&#8208;Field&#8208;Tailored T1&#8211;T2 Dual&#8208;Mode MRI Contrast Agent for High&#8208;Performance Vascular Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
An ultrahigh magnetic field (UHF)&#8208;tailored T1&#8211;T2 dual&#8208;mode iron oxide nanoparticle&#8208;based contrast agent (UDIOC) with a near&#8208;paramagnetic core and ultracompact hydrophilic surface modification is developed, which exhibits a dually enhanced T1&#8211;T2 contrast effect under UHF. By virtue of high&#8208;resolution UHF magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a simple double&#8208;checking process, UDIOC&#8208;based dual&#8208;mode imaging enables the assessment of the vascular anatomy and functions with high sensitivity and accuracy.








Abstract
The assessment of vascular anatomy and functions using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for medical diagnosis, whereas the commonly used low&#8208;field MRI system (&#8804;3 T) suffers from low spatial resolution. Ultrahigh field (UHF) MRI (&#8805;7 T), with significantly improved resolution and signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, shows great potential to provide high&#8208;resolution vasculature images. However, practical applications of UHF MRI technology for vascular imaging are currently limited by the low sensitivity and accuracy of single&#8208;mode (T1 or T2) contrast agents. Herein, a UHF&#8208;tailored T1&#8211;T2 dual&#8208;mode iron oxide nanoparticle&#8208;based contrast agent (UDIOC) with extremely small core size and ultracompact hydrophilic surface modification, exhibiting dually enhanced T1&#8211;T2 contrast effect under the 7 T magnetic field, is reported. The UDIOC enables clear visualization of microvasculature as small as &#8776;140&#160;&#181;m in diameter under UHF MRI, extending the detection limit of the 7 T MR angiography. Moreover, by virtue of high&#8208;resolution UHF MRI and a simple double&#8208;checking process, UDIOC&#8208;based dual&#8208;mode dynamic contrast&#8208;enhanced MRI is successfully applied to detect tumor vascular permeability with extremely high sensitivity and accuracy, providing a novel paradigm for the precise medical diagnosis of vascular&#8208;related diseases.

&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dual&#8208;mode iron oxide nanoparticle&#8208;based contrast agent (UDIOC) with a near&#8208;paramagnetic core and ultracompact hydrophilic surface modification is developed, which exhibits a dually enhanced &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contrast effect under UHF. By virtue of high&#8208;resolution UHF magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a simple double&#8208;checking process, UDIOC&#8208;based dual&#8208;mode imaging enables the assessment of the vascular anatomy and functions with high sensitivity and accuracy.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assessment of vascular anatomy and functions using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for medical diagnosis, whereas the commonly used low&#8208;field MRI system (&#8804;3 T) suffers from low spatial resolution. Ultrahigh field (UHF) MRI (&#8805;7 T), with significantly improved resolution and signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, shows great potential to provide high&#8208;resolution vasculature images. However, practical applications of UHF MRI technology for vascular imaging are currently limited by the low sensitivity and accuracy of single&#8208;mode (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) contrast agents. Herein, a UHF&#8208;tailored &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dual&#8208;mode iron oxide nanoparticle&#8208;based contrast agent (UDIOC) with extremely small core size and ultracompact hydrophilic surface modification, exhibiting dually enhanced &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contrast effect under the 7 T magnetic field, is reported. The UDIOC enables clear visualization of microvasculature as small as &#8776;140&#160;&#181;m in diameter under UHF MRI, extending the detection limit of the 7 T MR angiography. Moreover, by virtue of high&#8208;resolution UHF MRI and a simple double&#8208;checking process, UDIOC&#8208;based dual&#8208;mode dynamic contrast&#8208;enhanced MRI is successfully applied to detect tumor vascular permeability with extremely high sensitivity and accuracy, providing a novel paradigm for the precise medical diagnosis of vascular&#8208;related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Magnetic Recording: Magnetic&#8208;Pole Flip by Millimeter Wave (Adv. Mater. 48/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2004897, Shin&#8208;ichi Ohkoshi and co&#8208;workers propose a new magnetic recording methodology, &#8220;focused&#8208;millimeter&#8208;wave&#8208;assisted magnetic recording (F&#8208;MIMR)&#8221;, to drastically increase the recording density of magnetic tapes. Demonstrations are performed using magnetic films based on a series of epsilon iron oxide, &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3. Irradiation of the focused millimeter wave generated from terahertz (THz) light flips the magnetic pole direction, leading to a breakthrough technology for high&#8208;density magnetic recordings.

In article number 2004519, Jessica C.

      <title>Magnetic Patterning: Magneto&#8208;Driven Gradients of Diamagnetic Objects for Engineering Complex Tissues (Adv. Mater. 48/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2005030, Robert L. Mauck and co&#8208;workers magnetically pattern diamagnetic objects in 3D hydrogels to engineer complex tissues. Because the diamagnetic objects are suspended in a transiently paramagnetic solution, the objects are repelled from a permanent magnet. Most notably, unlabeled living cells are magneto&#8208;patterned to generate cartilaginous tissues with a native&#8208;like cell gradient.

      <title>A Low&#8208;Swelling Polymeric Mixed Conductor Operating in Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
      <dc:description>
Although beneficial to ion transport, swelling can affect the performance and durability of organic mixed conductor devices. This communication presents a hydrophilic conjugated polymer, poly[3&#8208;(6&#8208;hydroxy)hexylthiophene], comparing its swelling properties to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art glycolated organic semiconductors for bioelectronics. Hydroxyl functionalization of poly(thiophene) backbone minimizes swelling while still allowing good ion uptake, resulting in robust organic electrochemical transistor operation in aqueous electrolytes.








Abstract
Organic mixed conductors find use in batteries, bioelectronics technologies, neuromorphic computing, and sensing. While great progress has been achieved, polymer&#8208;based mixed conductors frequently experience significant volumetric changes during ion uptake/rejection, i.e., during doping/de&#8208;doping and charging/discharging. Although ion dynamics may be enhanced in expanded networks, these volumetric changes can have undesirable consequences, e.g., negatively affecting hole/electron conduction and severely shortening device lifetime. Here, the authors present a new material poly[3&#8208;(6&#8208;hydroxy)hexylthiophene] (P3HHT) that is able to transport ions and electrons/holes, as tested in electrochemical absorption spectroscopy and organic electrochemical transistors, and that exhibits low swelling, attributed to the hydroxylated alkyl side&#8208;chain functionalization. P3HHT displays a thickness change upon passive swelling of only +2.5%, compared to +90% observed for the ubiquitous poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate, and +10 to +15% for polymers such as poly(2&#8208;(3,3&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;(2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)&#8208;[2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophen]&#8208;5&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) (p[g2T&#8208;TT]). Applying a bias pulse during swelling, this discrepancy becomes even more pronounced, with the thickness of P3HHT films changing by &lt;10%&#160;while that of p(g2T&#8208;TT) structures increases by +75 to +80%. Importantly, the initial P3HHT film thickness is essentially restored after de&#8208;doping while p(g2T&#8208;TT) remains substantially swollen. The authors, thus, expand the materials&#8208;design toolbox for the creation of low&#8208;swelling soft mixed conductors with tailored properties and applications in bioelectronics and beyond.

      <title>Transparent Hybrid Opals with Unexpected Strong Resonance&#8208;Enhanced Photothermal Energy Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>
Optical absorption, being absent in the pure polymer matrix and that with ordered particles, is remarkably amplified in a self&#8208;assembled polymer&#8208;tethered (brush) particles comprised of low contrast constituents. The amplification is shown to be caused by &#8220;photon slowdown&#8221; and to induce rapid &#8220;melting&#8221; of materials even in the absence of &#8220;visible&#8221; absorption.








Abstract
Photothermal energy conversion is of fundamental importance to applications ranging from drug delivery to microfluidics and from ablation to fabrication. It typically originates from absorptive processes in materials that&#8212;when coupled with non&#8208;radiative dissipative processes&#8212;allow the conversion of radiative energy into heat. Microstructure design provides versatile strategies for controlling light&#8211;matter interactions. In particular, the deliberate engineering of the band structure in photonic materials is known to be an effective approach to amplify absorption in materials. However, photonic amplification is generally tied to high optical contrast materials which limit the applicability of the concept to metamaterials such as microfabricated metal&#8211;air hybrids. This contribution describes the first observation of pronounced amplification of absorption in low contrast opals formed by the self&#8208;assembly of polymer&#8208;tethered particles. The dependence of the amplification factor on the length scale and degree of order of materials as well as the angle of incidence reveal that it is related to the slow photon effect. A remarkable amplification factor of 16 is shown to facilitate the rapid &#8220;melting&#8221; of opal films even in the absence of &#8220;visible&#8221; absorption. The results point to novel opportunities for tailoring light&#8211;matter interactions in hybrid materials that can benefit the manipulation and fabrication of functional materials.

      <title>Ternary Ta2PdS6 Atomic Layers for an Ultrahigh Broadband Photoresponsive Phototransistor</title>
      <dc:description>
A new 2D material, atomic layer Ta2PdS6, is introduced to the 2D family, and exhibits excellent optoelectronic and electronic performances including an ultrahigh photoresponsivity of 1.42&#160;&#215; 106 A W&#8722;1, photoconductive gain of 2.7&#160;&#215; 106, electron mobility of 25 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1, Ion/Ioff ratio of 106 and one&#8208;year air stability, making it a promising 2D material for nano&#8208;electronic and nano&#8208;optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
2D noble&#8208;transition&#8208;metal chalcogenides (NTMCs) are emerging as a promising class of optoelectronic materials due to ultrahigh air stability, large bandgap tunability, and high photoresponse. Here, a new set of 2D NTMC: Ta2PdS6 atomic layers is developed, displaying the excellent comprehensive optoelectronic performance with an ultrahigh photoresponsivity of 1.42&#160;&#215; 106 A W&#8722;1, detectivity of 7.1&#160;&#215; 1010 Jones and a high photoconductive gain of 2.7&#160;&#215; 106 under laser illumination at a wavelength of 633&#160;nm with a power of 0.025 W m&#8722;2, which is ascribed to a photogating effect via study of the device band profiles. Especially, few&#8208;layer Ta2PdS6 exhibits a good broadband photoresponse, ranging from 450&#160;nm in the ultraviolet region to 1450&#160;nm in the shortwave infrared (SIR) region. Moreover, this material also delivers an impressive electronic performance with electron mobility of &#8776;25 cm2V&#8211;1s&#8211;1, Ion/Ioff ratio of 106, and a one&#8208;year air stability, which is better than those of most reported 2D materials. Our&#160;studies underscore Ta2PdS6 as a promising 2D material for nano&#8208;electronic and nano&#8208;optoelectronic applications.

Especially, few&#8208;layer Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PdS&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits a good broadband photoresponse, ranging from 450&#160;nm in the ultraviolet region to 1450&#160;nm in the shortwave infrared (SIR) region. Moreover, this material also delivers an impressive electronic performance with electron mobility of &#8776;25 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;on&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt; ratio of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, and a one&#8208;year air stability, which is better than those of most reported 2D materials. Our&#160;studies underscore Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PdS&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; as a promising 2D material for nano&#8208;electronic and nano&#8208;optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Persistent Conjugated Backbone and Disordered Lamellar Packing Impart Polymers with Efficient n&#8208;Doping and High Conductivities</title>
      <dc:description>
Two conjugated polymers with rigid planar backbones, but with disordered crystalline structures, exhibit surprising structural tolerance to commonly used n&#8208;dopants. These properties allow both high concentrations and high mobility of the charge carriers to be realized simultaneously in n&#8208;doped polymers, resulting in excellent electrical conductivity of over 90 S cm&#8722;1 and thermoelectric performance up to 106 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable highly conductive polymers are of great interest in emerging electronic applications. For p&#8208;doped polymers, conductivities as high a nearly 105 S cm&#8722;1 have been reported. In the case of n&#8208;doped polymers, they often fall well short of the high values noted above, which might be achievable, if much higher charge&#8208;carrier mobilities determined could be realized in combination with high charge&#8208;carrier densities. This is in part due to inefficient doping and dopant ions disturbing the ordering of polymers, limiting efficient charge transport and ultimately the achievable conductivities. Here, n&#8208;doped polymers that achieve a high conductivity of more than 90 S cm&#8722;1 by a simple solution&#8208;based co&#8208;deposition method are reported. Two conjugated polymers with rigid planar backbones, but with disordered crystalline structures, exhibit surprising structural tolerance to, and excellent miscibility with, commonly used n&#8208;dopants. These properties allow both high concentrations and high mobility of the charge carriers to be realized simultaneously in n&#8208;doped polymers, resulting in excellent electrical conductivity and thermoelectric performance.

      <title>Elucidation of the Synergistic Effect of Dopants and Vacancies on Promoted Selectivity for CO2 Electroreduction to Formate</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel SnO2 nanosheet catalyst presents a possible synergistic effect of N dopants and oxygen vacancies on the activity and selectivity for CO2 electroreduction to formate. Low coordination Sn&#8211;N moieties with optimal N dopants and O vacancies are identified as active sites with intrinsically enhanced activity.








Abstract
Sn&#8208;based materials are identified as promising catalysts for the CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) to formate (HCOO&#8722;). However, their insufficient selectivity and activity remain grand challenges. A new type of SnO2 nanosheet with simultaneous N dopants and oxygen vacancies (VO&#8208;rich N&#8208;SnO2 NS) for promoting CO2 conversion to HCOO&#8722; is reported. Due to the likely synergistic effect of N dopant and VO, the VO&#8208;rich N&#8208;SnO2 NS exhibits high catalytic selectivity featured by an HCOO&#8722; Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 83% at &#8722;0.9 V and an FE of &gt; 90% for all C1 products (HCOO&#8722; and CO) at a wide potential range from &#8722;0.9 to &#8722;1.2 V. Low coordination Sn&#8211;N moieties are the active sites with optimal electronic and geometric structures regulated by VO and N dopants. Theoretical calculations elucidate that the reaction free energy of HCOO* protonation is decreased on the VO&#8208;rich N&#8208;SnO2 NS, thus enhancing HCOO&#8722; selectivity. The weakened H* adsorption energy also inhibits the hydrogen evolution reaction, a dominant side reaction during the CO2RR. Furthermore, using the catalyst as the cathode, a spontaneous Galvanic Zn&#8208;CO2 cell and a solar&#8208;powered electrolysis process successfully demonstrated the efficient HCOO&#8722; generation through CO2 conversion and storage.

      <title>Full Concentration Gradient&#8208;Tailored Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxides for High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A precise elemental gradient design for practical lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) agglomerated spheres is developed, providing a unique tool for the optimization of voltage retention and electrochemical/thermal stability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The effects of elemental gradient on the LLOs, especially from a mechanical/electrochemical stress point of view, have been quantitively elucidated for stability evaluation.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs) are prospective cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but severe voltage decay and energy attenuation with cycling still hinder their practical applications. Herein, a series of full concentration gradient&#8208;tailored agglomerated&#8208;sphere LLOs are designed with linearly decreasing Mn and linearly increasing Ni and Co from the particle center to the surface. The gradient&#8208;tailored LLOs exhibit noticeably reduced voltage decay, enhanced rate performance, improved cycle stability, and thermal stability. Without any material modifications or electrolyte optimizations, the gradient&#8208;tailored LLO with medium&#8208;slope shows the best electrochemical performance, with a very low average voltage decay of 0.8&#160;mV per cycle as well as a capacity retention of 88.4% within 200 cycles at 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1. These excellent findings are due to spinel structure suppression, electrochemical stress optimization, and Jahn&#8208;Teller effect inhibition. Further investigation shows that the gradient&#8208;tailored LLO reduces the thermal release percentage by as much as about 41% when the battery is charged to 4.4&#160;V. This study provides an effective method to suppress the voltage decay of LLOs for further practical utilization in LIBs and also puts forward a bulk&#8208;structure design strategy to prepare better electrode materials for different rechargeable batteries.

      <title>Tailored Mesoporous Inorganic Biomaterials: Assembly, Functionalization, and Drug Delivery Engineering</title>
      <dc:description>
Tailored mesoporous inorganic nanocarriers with abundant compositions and structures exhibit unprecedented drug&#8208;loading capacity and sustained responsive release behavior under various stimuli (e.g., pH, redox, temperature, magnetic field, and light), and exceptionally mesoporous structure plays an important role in the diffusion and transport of drug molecules, which will open a new door for drug therapy and new biological nanocarriers.








Abstract
Infectious or immune diseases have caused serious threat to human health due to their complexity and specificity, and emerging drug delivery systems (DDSs) have evolved into the most promising therapeutic strategy for drug&#8208;targeted therapy.

&lt;p&gt;Tailored mesoporous inorganic nanocarriers with abundant compositions and structures exhibit unprecedented drug&#8208;loading capacity and sustained responsive release behavior under various stimuli (e.g., pH, redox, temperature, magnetic field, and light), and exceptionally mesoporous structure plays an important role in the diffusion and transport of drug molecules, which will open a new door for drug therapy and new biological nanocarriers.

&lt;p&gt;Infectious or immune diseases have caused serious threat to human health due to their complexity and specificity, and emerging drug delivery systems (DDSs) have evolved into the most promising therapeutic strategy for drug&#8208;targeted therapy. Various mesoporous biomaterials are exploited and applied as efficient nanocarriers to loading drugs by virtue of their large surface area, high porosity, and prominent biocompatibility.

      <title>Recent Advances and Perspectives on Calcium&#8208;Ion Storage: Key Materials and Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
Ca&#8208;ion based technologies are attractive for low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance energy storage, while their development is currently far from practical applications. An overview of the key electrode materials for Ca2+ storage and a comprehensive insight of promising optimization strategies such as multi&#8208;ion strategy are critical to promote further development of Ca2+ technologies.








Abstract
The urgent demand for cost&#8208;effective energy storage devices for large&#8208;scale applications has led to the development of several beyond&#8208;lithium energy storage systems (EESs). Among them, calcium&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) are attractive due to abundant calcium resources, excellent volumetric and gravimetric capacities of Ca metal anode, and potential high energy density coming from the multivalent feature of Ca&#8208;ion. Therefore, the exploration of CIBs electrode materials and the construction of CIBs devices are gaining increasing research interest. Relevant publications cover a wide range of materials by both theoretical and experimental investigations, whereas the performances of rocking&#8208;chair CIBs have been unsatisfactory. Meanwhile, multi&#8208;ion strategies using more than one ion as the charge carrier have been demonstrated to be feasible and promising options in realizing room temperature CIBs. The summary and reflection of previous studies would provide useful information for future exploration and optimization. In this circumstance, this paper overviews the reported CIBs electrode materials, including both anode and cathode, and presents the latest progress of multi&#8208;ion strategies in CIBs. Fundamental challenges, potential solutions, and opportunities are accordingly proposed, mimicking other more mature EESs. This review may promote the development of electrode materials and accelerate the construction of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance CIBs.

      <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Ti3C2Tx MXene Antennas for Radio&#8208;Frequency Communication</title>
      <dc:description>
MXene microstrip patch antennas with ultrahigh&#8208;power radiation in a wide frequency range are fabricated by spray&#8208;coating. The radiation efficiency of a 5.5&#160;&#181;m thick MXene patch antenna reaches 99% at 16.4&#160;GHz, which is about the same as that of a 35&#160;&#181;m thick copper patch antenna. MXene outperforms all other materials evaluated for patch antennas to date.








Abstract
Highly integrated, flexible, and ultrathin wireless communication components are in significant demand due to the explosive growth of portable and wearable electronic devices in the fifth&#8208;generation (5G) network era, but only conventional metals meet the requirements for emerging radio&#8208;frequency (RF) devices so far. Here, it is reported on Ti3C2Tx MXene microstrip transmission lines with low&#8208;energy attenuation and patch antennas with high&#8208;power radiation at frequencies from 5.6 to 16.4&#160;GHz. The radiation efficiency of a 5.5&#160;&#181;m thick MXene patch antenna manufactured by spray&#8208;coating from aqueous solution reaches 99% at 16.4&#160;GHz, which is about the same as that of a standard 35&#160;&#181;m thick copper patch antenna at about 15% of its thickness and 7% of the copper weight. MXene outperforms all other materials evaluated for patch antennas to date. Moreover, it is demonstrated that an MXene patch antenna array with integrated feeding circuits on a conformal surface has comparable performance with that of a copper antenna array at 28&#160;GHz, which is a target frequency in practical 5G applications. The versatility of MXene antennas in wide frequency ranges coupled with the flexibility, scalability, and ease of solution processing makes MXene promising for integrated RF components in various flexible electronic devices.

      <title>Imaging Cellular Aerobic Glycolysis using Carbon Dots for Early Warning of Tumorigenesis</title>
      <dc:description>
The occurrence of aerobic glycolysis based on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)&#8208;induced enhancement of fluorescence emitted by nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon dots is revealed by a new strategy. This can be used to monitor the occurrence of tumorigenesis and provide an early warning of tumor formation with high accuracy and specificity.








Abstract
Early warning of tumor formation is crucial for the classification, treatment, and prognosis of tumor patients. Here, a new strategy is reported, aimed at realizing this goal based on imaging aerobic glycolysis processes using nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon dots (N&#8208;CDs) as fluorescent probes. The intensity of the photoluminescence emitted by the N&#8208;CDs is specifically enhanced by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+, oxidized) in the physiological environment. The N&#8208;CDs allow a few (five to ten) abnormal cells in spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma models to be identified before the in situ development of tumor tissue. The N&#8208;CD probes can also distinguish tumor cells from normal cells and be used to evaluate their proliferation activity (with a specificity of up to 96.15% in 13 types of tumor cells and 90.90% in orthotopic xenograft models). The N&#8208;CDs are successfully used to monitor the invasion of tumor cells into neighboring tissues and body fluids in 49 clinical samples (with a sensitivity up to 79.31%). These included three vitreous body samples (from patients with retinoblastoma), 42 urine samples (22 patients clinically diagnosed with urothelium carcinoma and 20 healthy persons), and four hydrothorax samples (from patients with metastatic lesions).

      <title>Observation of Standing Spin Waves in a van der Waals Magnetic Material</title>
      <dc:description>
Standing spin&#8208;wave modes are reported in a van der Waals magnetic material. These modes travel along the CrCl3 sample thickness of 20 mm and are reflected at the boundaries. These spin waves can be useful for creating tunable van der Waals magnonic devices operating at GHz frequencies.








Abstract
Spin waves are studied for data storage, communication, and logic circuits in the field of spintronics based on their potential to substitute electrons. The recent discovery of magnetism in 2D systems such as monolayer CrI3 and Cr2Ge2Te6 has led to a renewed interest in such applications of magnetism in the 2D limit. Here, direct evidence of standing spin waves is presented along with the uniform precessional resonance modes in the van der Waals magnetic material, CrCl3. This is the first direct observation of standing spin&#8208;wave modes, set up along a thickness of 20&#160;mm, in a van der Waals material. Standing spin waves are detected in the vicinity of both branches, optical and acoustic, of the antiferromagnetic resonance. Magnon&#8211;magnon coupling and softening of resonance modes with temperature enable extraction of interlayer exchange field as a function of temperature.

      <title>Electrochemical Delamination of Ultralarge Few&#8208;Layer Black Phosphorus with a Hydrogen&#8208;Free Intercalation Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>
Ultralarge few&#8208;layer black&#8208;phosphorus single crystals are obtained with a hydrogen&#8208;free electrochemical exfoliation mechanism using CH3COOTBA intercalation. The largest size is up to 119 &#181;m with an average around at 77.6 &#177; 15.0 &#181;m. A high hole mobility of 76 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1, and a broadband photoresponse from 532 to 1850 nm with ultrahigh responsivity are achieved at 298 K.








Abstract
Due to strong interlayer interaction and ease of oxidation issues of black phosphorus (BP), the domain size of artificial synthesized few&#8208;layer black phosphorus (FL&#8208;BP) crystals is often below 10&#160;&#181;m, which extremely limits its further applications in large&#8208;area thin&#8208;film devices and integrated circuits. Herein, a hydrogen&#8208;free electrochemical delamination strategy through weak Lewis acid intercalation enabled exfoliation is developed to produce ultralarge FL&#8208;BP single&#8208;crystalline domains with high quality. The interaction between the weak Lewis acid tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium acetate (CH3COOTBA) and P atoms promotes the average domain size of FL&#8208;BP crystal up to 77.6&#160;&#177; 15.0&#160;&#181;m and the largest domain size is found to be as large as 119&#160;&#181;m. The presence of H+ and H2O is found to sharply decrease the size of as&#8208;exfoliated FL&#8208;BP flakes. The electronic transport measurements show that the delaminated FL&#8208;BP crystals exhibit a high hole mobility of 76 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 and an on/off ratio of 103 at 298 K. A broadband photoresponse from 532 to 1850&#160;nm with ultrahigh responsivity is achieved. This work provides a scalable, simple, and low&#8208;cost approach for large&#8208;area BP films that meet industrial requirements for nanodevices applications.

     alt="Electrochemical Delamination of Ultralarge Few&#8208;Layer Black Phosphorus with a Hydrogen&#8208;Free Intercalation Mechanism"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultralarge few&#8208;layer black&#8208;phosphorus single crystals are obtained with a hydrogen&#8208;free electrochemical exfoliation mechanism using CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOTBA intercalation. The largest size is up to 119 &#181;m with an average around at 77.6 &#177; 15.0 &#181;m. A high hole mobility of 76 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and a broadband photoresponse from 532 to 1850 nm with ultrahigh responsivity are achieved at 298 K.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to strong interlayer interaction and ease of oxidation issues of black phosphorus (BP), the domain size of artificial synthesized few&#8208;layer black phosphorus (FL&#8208;BP) crystals is often below 10&#160;&#181;m, which extremely limits its further applications in large&#8208;area thin&#8208;film devices and integrated circuits. Herein, a hydrogen&#8208;free electrochemical delamination strategy through weak Lewis acid intercalation enabled exfoliation is developed to produce ultralarge FL&#8208;BP single&#8208;crystalline domains with high quality. The interaction between the weak Lewis acid tetra&#8208;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;butylammonium acetate (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOTBA) and P atoms promotes the average domain size of FL&#8208;BP crystal up to 77.6&#160;&#177; 15.0&#160;&#181;m and the largest domain size is found to be as large as 119&#160;&#181;m. The presence of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is found to sharply decrease the size of as&#8208;exfoliated FL&#8208;BP flakes. The electronic transport measurements show that the delaminated FL&#8208;BP crystals exhibit a high hole mobility of 76 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an on/off ratio of 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 298 K. A broadband photoresponse from 532 to 1850&#160;nm with ultrahigh responsivity is achieved. This work provides a scalable, simple, and low&#8208;cost approach for large&#8208;area BP films that meet industrial requirements for nanodevices applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide Driven by the Intrinsic Defects in the Carbon Plane of a Single Fe&#8211;N4 Site</title>
      <dc:description>
The outstanding electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction activity of the intrinsic defect in a carbon&#8208;based catalyst containing a single Fe&#8211;N4 site is highlighted. Benefiting from its immunity for the adsorbed intermediates, such as *CO, as well as the enhanced intrinsic activity after incorporating with the Fe&#8211;N4 site, the intrinsic defect acts as the real active center for carbon dioxide reduction and outperforms single Fe&#8211;N4 centers.








Abstract
Manipulating the in&#8208;plane defects of metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon catalysts to regulate the electroreduction reaction of CO2 (CO2RR) remains a challenging task. Here, it is demonstrated that the activity of the intrinsic carbon defects can be dramatically improved through coupling with single&#8208;atom Fe&#8211;N4 sites. The resulting catalyst delivers a maximum CO Faradaic efficiency of 90% and a CO partial current density of 33&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in 0.1 m KHCO3. The remarkable enhancements are maintained in concentrated electrolyte, endowing a rechargeable Zn&#8211;CO2 battery with a high CO selectivity of 86.5% at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Further analysis suggests that the intrinsic defect is the active sites for CO2RR, instead of the Fe&#8211;N4 center. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Fe&#8211;N4 coupled intrinsic defect exhibits a reduced energy barrier for CO2RR and suppresses the hydrogen evolution activity. The high intrinsic activity, coupled with fast electron&#8208;transfer capability and abundant exposed active sites, induces excellent electrocatalytic performance.

      <title>Plant Nanobionic Sensors for Arsenic Detection</title>
      <dc:description>
Exploiting the natural ability of plants to pre&#8208;concentrate and extract arsenite from the belowground environment, a living plant nanobionic sensor is engineered for non&#8208;destructive arsenite monitoring. By embedding near&#8208;infrared fluorescent nanosensors within the mesophyll, living plants are converted into environmental sensors for real&#8208;time arsenite detection. This demonstration opens new frontiers for plant&#8208;based sensors in environmental monitoring and food safety research.








Abstract
Arsenic is a highly toxic heavy&#8208;metal pollutant which poses a significant health risk to humans and other ecosystems. In this work, the natural ability of wild&#8208;type plants to pre&#8208;concentrate and extract arsenic from the belowground environment is exploited to engineer plant nanobionic sensors for real&#8208;time arsenic detection. Near&#8208;infrared fluorescent nanosensors are specifically designed for sensitive and selective detection of arsenite. These optical nanosensors are embedded in plant tissues to non&#8208;destructively access and monitor the internal dynamics of arsenic taken up by the plants via the roots. The integration of optical nanosensors with living plants enables the conversion of plants into self&#8208;powered autosamplers of arsenic from their environment. Arsenite detection is demonstrated with three different plant species as nanobionic sensors. Based on an experimentally validated kinetic model, the nanobionic sensor could detect 0.6 and 0.2 ppb levels of arsenic after 7 and 14 days respectively by exploiting the natural ability of Pteris cretica ferns to hyperaccumulate and tolerate exceptionally high level of arsenic. The sensor readout could also be interfaced with portable electronics at a standoff distance, potentially enabling applications in environmental monitoring and agronomic research.

      <title>Quasi&#8208;Epitaxial Growth of Magnetic Nanostructures on 4H&#8208;Au Nanoribbons</title>
      <dc:description>
Crystal&#8208;phase engineering of Co and Ni nanostructures is reported, which is realized by quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth on 4H&#8208;Au nanoribbons. Notably, a new phase of Co, namely 14H, is formed due to the generation of ordered misfit dislocations in the grown Co nanostructures. The as&#8208;prepared 14H&#8208;Co nanostructures are ferromagnetic at room temperature.








Abstract
Phase engineering of nanomaterials is an effective strategy to tune the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials for various promising applications. Herein, by using the 4H&#8208;Au nanoribbons as templates, four novel magnetic nanostructures, namely 4H&#8208;Au&#8202;@&#8202;14H&#8208;Co nanobranches, 4H&#8208;Au&#8202;@&#8202;14H&#8208;Co nanoribbons, 4H&#8208;Au&#8202;@&#8202;2H&#8208;Co nanoribbons, and 4H&#8208;Au&#8202;@&#8202;2H&#8208;Ni nanoribbons, are synthesized based on the quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth. Different from the conventional epitaxial growth of metal nanomaterials, the obtained Co and Ni nanostructures possess different crystal phases from the Au template. Due to the large lattice mismatch between Au and the grown metals (i.e., Co and Ni), ordered misfit dislocations are generated at the Co/Au and Ni/Au interfaces. Notably, a new super&#8208;structure of Co is formed, denoted as 14H. Both 4H&#8208;Au&#8202;@&#8202;14H&#8208;Co nanobranches and nanoribbons are ferromagnetic at room temperature, showing similar Curie temperature. However, their magnetic behaviors exhibit distinct temperature dependence, resulting from the competition between spin and volume fluctuations as well as the unique geometry. This work paves the way to the templated synthesis of nanomaterials with unconventional crystal phases for the exploration of phase&#8208;dependent properties.

Owing to the stability between lithium metal and a garnet&#8208;type solid electrolyte, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are proved to possess longer cycling life than that of liquid&#8208;state LMBs under limited lithium anode condition. Moreover, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LMBs with long cycling life using a limited lithium metal anode are achieved at room temperature through a hybrid solid&#8208;state electrolyte design.








Abstract
Metallic lithium (Li), considered as the ultimate anode, is expected to promise high&#8208;energy rechargeable batteries. However, owing to the continuous Li consumption during the repeated Li plating/stripping cycling, excess amount of the Li metal anode is commonly utilized in lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs), leading to reduced energy density and increased cost. Here, an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal battery (ASSLMB) based on a garnet&#8208;oxide solid electrolyte with an ultralow negative/positive electrode capacity ratio (N/P ratio) is reported. Compared with the counterpart using a liquid electrolyte at the same low N/P ratios, ASSLMBs show longer cycling life, which is attributed to the higher Coulombic efficiency maintained during cycling. The effect of the species of the interface layer on the cycling performance of ASSLMBs with low N/P ratio is also studied. Importantly, it is demonstrated that the ASSLMB using a limited Li metal anode paired with a LiFePO4 cathode (5.9 N/P ratio) delivers a stable long&#8208;term cycling performance at room temperature. Furthermore, it is revealed that enhanced specific energies for ASSLMBs with low N/P ratios can be further achieved by the use of a high&#8208;voltage or high mass&#8208;loading cathode. This study sheds light on the practical high&#8208;energy all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries under the constrained condition of a limited Li metal anode.

      <title>Solution&#8208;Processed All&#8208;Ceramic Plasmonic Metamaterials for Efficient Solar&#8211;Thermal Conversion over 100&#8211;727&#160;&#176;C</title>
      <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed large&#8208;area plasmonic metamaterial with all&#8208;ceramic components is demonstrated to achieve high solar absorption but low IR emission over 100&#8211;727&#160;&#176;C, leading to higher solar&#8211;thermal conversion efficiency than vacuum&#8208;deposited absorbers. Accompanied by its great thermal stability (727&#160;&#176;C) and low cost (&lt;1.6&#160;USD&#160;m&#8722;2), the versatile metamaterial will benefit both low&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature solar&#8211;thermal systems.








Abstract
Low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;area solar&#8211;thermal absorbers with superior spectral selectivity and excellent thermal stability are vital for efficient and large&#8208;scale solar&#8211;thermal conversion applications, such as space heating, desalination, ice mitigation, photothermal catalysis, and concentrating solar power. Few state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art selective absorbers are qualified for both low&#8208; (&lt;200&#160;&#176;C) and high&#8208;temperature (&gt;600&#160;&#176;C) applications due to insufficient spectral selectivity or thermal stability over a wide temperature range. Here, a high&#8208;performance plasmonic metamaterial selective absorber is developed by facile solution&#8208;based processes via assembling an ultrathin (&#8776;120&#160;nm) titanium nitride (TiN) nanoparticle film on a TiN mirror. Enabled by the synergetic in&#8208;plane plasmon and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot resonances, the all&#8208;ceramic plasmonic metamaterial simultaneously achieves high, full&#8208;spectrum solar absorption (95%), low mid&#8208;IR emission (3% at 100&#160;&#176;C), and excellent stability over a temperature range of 100&#8211;727&#160;&#176;C, even outperforming most vacuum&#8208;deposited absorbers at their specific operating temperatures. The competitive performance of the solution&#8208;processed absorber is accompanied by a significant cost reduction compared with vacuum&#8208;deposited absorbers. All these merits render it a cost&#8208;effective, universal solution to offering high efficiency (89&#8211;93%) for both low&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature solar&#8211;thermal applications.

      <title>Lifshitz Transition and Non&#8208;Fermi Liquid Behavior in Highly Doped Semimetals</title>
      <dc:description>
A physical model to quantitatively explain the Lifshitz transition and non&#8208;Fermi liquid behavior in highly doped monoclinic Nb2Se3 is reported. Based on Hall and magnetoresistance measurements, the two&#8208;band Drude model, and first&#8208;principles calculations, the non&#8208;quadratic temperature exponent in the resistivity can be quantitatively determined by the chemical potential shift under the framework of Fermi liquid theory.








Abstract
The classical Fermi liquid theory and Drude model have provided fundamental ways to understand the resistivity of most metals. The violation of the classical theory, known as non&#8208;Fermi liquid (NFL) transport, appears in certain metals, including topological semimetals, but quantitative understanding of the NFL behavior has not yet been established. In particular, the determination of the non&#8208;quadratic temperature exponent in the resistivity, a sign of NFL behavior, remains a puzzling issue. Here, a physical model to quantitatively explain the Lifshitz transition and NFL behavior in highly doped (a carrier density of &#8776;1022 cm&#8722;3) monoclinic Nb2Se3 is reported. Hall and magnetoresistance measurements, the two&#8208;band Drude model, and first&#8208;principles calculations demonstrate an apparent chemical potential shift by temperature in monoclinic Nb2Se3, which induces a Lifshitz transition and NFL behavior in the material. Accordingly, the non&#8208;quadratic temperature exponent in the resistivity can be quantitatively determined by the chemical potential shift under the framework of Fermi liquid theory. This model provides a new experimental insight for nontrivial transport with NFL behavior or sign inversion of Seebeck coefficients in emerging materials.

      <title>Mutually Reinforced Polymer&#8211;Graphene Bilayer Membranes for Energy&#8208;Efficient Acoustic Transduction</title>
      <dc:description>
To fabricate ultrahigh&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio, lightweight, and transparent conductive membranes, single&#8208;layer graphene is reinforced by high&#8208;performance polyetherimide to form a laminate bilayer. The bilayer is exceptionally strong, lightweight, transparent, and conductive and has a record&#8208;high aspect ratio of 1 &#215; 105. As an acoustic transducer in a prototype electrostatic speaker, the bilayer consumes 100 times less energy than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrodynamic speakers.








Abstract
Graphene holds promise for thin, ultralightweight, and high&#8208;performance nanoelectromechanical transducers. However, graphene&#8208;only devices are limited in size due to fatigue and fracture of suspended graphene membranes. Here, a lightweight, flexible, transparent, and conductive bilayer composite of polyetherimide and single&#8208;layer graphene is prepared and suspended on the centimeter scale with an unprecedentedly high aspect ratio of 105. The coupling of the two components leads to mutual reinforcement and creates an ultrastrong membrane that supports 30&#160;000 times its own weight. Upon electromechanical actuation, the membrane pushes a massive amount of air and generates high&#8208;quality acoustic sound. The energy efficiency is &#8776;10&#8211;100&#160;times better than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrodynamic speakers. The bilayer membrane's combined properties of electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, optical transparency, thermal stability, and chemical resistance will promote applications in electronics, mechanics, and optics.

      <title>Guest Encapsulation within Surface&#8208;Adsorbed Self&#8208;Assembled Cages</title>
      <dc:description>
The adsorption of two metal&#8211;organic coordination capsules on alumina is quantified and the cages are shown to retain their ability to bind and release a molecular cargo following immobilization. The adsorbed cages are then used to stabilize the reagents of a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction prior to their subsequent release and reaction.








Abstract
Coordination cages encapsulate a wide variety of guests in the solution state. This ability renders them useful for applications such as catalysis and the sequestration of precious materials. A simple and general method for the immobilization of coordination cages on alumina is reported. Cage loadings are quantified via adsorption isotherms and guest displacement assays demonstrate that the adsorbed cages retain the ability to encapsulate and separate guest and non&#8208;guest molecules. Finally, a system of two cages, adsorbed on to different regions of alumina, stabilizes and separates a pair of Diels&#8211;Alder reagents. The addition of a single competitive guest results in the controlled release of the reagents, thus triggering their reaction. This method of coordination cage immobilization on solid phases is envisaged to be applicable to the extensive library of reported cages, enabling new applications based upon selective solid&#8208;phase molecular encapsulation.

      <title>Photosynthetic Nanomaterial Hybrids for Bioelectricity and Renewable Energy Systems</title>
      <dc:description>
Natural photosynthesis absorbs solar energy and generates photosynthetic electrons by water splitting with an internal quantum efficiency close to 100%. Various nanomaterials applied to photosynthetic complexes are discussed in detail, including the working principles and improvements in photosynthetic electron generation, transfer, conversion, and storage efficiency.








Abstract
Harvesting solar energy in the form of electricity from the photosynthesis of plants, algal cells, and bacteria has been researched as the most environment&#8208;friendly renewable energy technology in the last decade. The primary challenge has been the engineering of electrochemical interfacing with photosynthetic apparatuses, organelles, or whole cells. However, with the aid of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials, there have been many advances, including enhanced photon absorption, increased generation of photosynthetic electrons (PEs), and more efficient transfer of PEs to electrodes. These advances have demonstrated the possibility for the technology to advance to a new level. In this article, the fundamentals of photosynthesis are introduced. How PE harvesting systems have improved concerning solar energy absorption, PE production, and PE collection by electrodes is discussed. The review focuses on how different kinds of nanomaterials are applied and function in interfacing with photosynthetic materials for enhanced PE harvesting. Finally, the review analyzes how the performance of PE harvesting and stand&#8208;alone systems have evolved so far and its future prospects.

      <title>Fullerene Desymmetrization as a Means to Achieve Single&#8208;Enantiomer Electron Acceptors with Maximized Chiroptical Responsiveness</title>
      <dc:description>
The isomeric complexity of a common organic fullerene electron acceptor is resolved, giving ten enantiomeric pairs across six bond types with different chiroptical response. Single&#8208;enantiomer fullerene transistor devices discriminate circularly polarized light with a fast light response and very high photocurrent dissymmetry factor (up to gph&#160;= 1.2&#160;&#177; 0.06).








Abstract
Solubilized fullerene derivatives have revolutionized the development of organic photovoltaic devices, acting as excellent electron acceptors. The addition of solubilizing addends to the fullerene cage results in a large number of isomers, which are generally employed as isomeric mixtures. Moreover, a significant number of these isomers are chiral, which further adds to the isomeric complexity. The opportunities presented by single&#8208;isomer, and particularly single&#8208;enantiomer, fullerenes in organic electronic materials and devices are poorly understood however. Here, ten pairs of enantiomers are separated from the 19 structural isomers of bis[60]phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester, using them to elucidate important chiroptical relationships and demonstrating their application to a circularly polarized light (CPL)&#8208;detecting device. Larger chiroptical responses are found, occurring through the inherent chirality of the fullerene. When used in a single&#8208;enantiomer organic field&#8208;effect transistor, the potential to discriminate CPL with a fast light response time and with a very high photocurrent dissymmetry factor (gph&#160;= 1.27 &#177; 0.06)&#160;is demonstrated. This study thus provides key strategies to design fullerenes with large chiroptical responses for use as chiral components of organic electronic devices. It is anticipated that this data will position chiral fullerenes as an exciting material class for the growing field of chiral electronic technologies.

      <title>High Color&#8208;Rendering Index and Stable White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes by Assembling Two Broadband Emissive Self&#8208;Trapped Excitons</title>
      <dc:description>
Stable and highly luminescent CsCu2I3@Cs3Cu2I5 composites are synthesized through a one&#8208;step spin&#8208;coating method. They exhibit white&#8208;light emission through self&#8208;trapped excitons, as well as cold/warm white&#8208;light tuning. By using the composites as a white&#8208;light emitter, electrically driven cold/warm tunable WLEDs with a record color&#8208;rendering index of 91.6 are successfully demonstrated, and a long half&#8208;lifetime of 238.5 min is achieved.








Abstract
White light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs) are promising next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state light sources. However, the commercialization route for WLED production suffers from challenges in terms of insufficient color&#8208;rendering index (CRI), color instability, and incorporation of rare&#8208;earth elements. Herein, a new two&#8208;component strategy is developed by assembling two broadband emissive materials with self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) for high CRI and stable WLEDs. The strategy addresses effectively the challenging issues facing current WLEDs. Based on first&#8208;principles thermodynamic calculations, copper&#8208;based ternary halides composites, CsCu2I3@Cs3Cu2I5, are synthesized by a facile one&#8208;step solution approach. The composites exhibit an ideal white&#8208;light emission with a cold/warm white&#8208;light tuning and a robust stability against heat, ultraviolet light, and environmental oxygen/moisture. A series of cold/warm tunable WLEDs is demonstrated with a maximum luminance of 145&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and an external quantum efficiency of 0.15%, and a record high CRI of 91.6 is achieved, which is the highest value for lead&#8208;free WLEDs. Importantly, the fabricated device demonstrates an excellent operation stability in a continuous current mode, exhibiting a long half&#8208;lifetime of 238.5&#160;min. The results promise the use of the hybrids of STEs&#8208;derived broadband emissive materials for high&#8208;performance WLEDs.

      <title>A Wearable Nutrition Tracker</title>
      <dc:description>
A wearable nutrient tracker that allows monitoring of vitamin C in sweat, along with urine and blood, to assist tracking users&#8217; nutritional status is demonstrated. A longitudinal study is performed on two individuals to explore correlations of vitamin C concentrations in sweat and urine with blood. It has promising potential applications in nutritional assessment and dietary intervention.








Abstract
Nutrients are essential for the healthy development and proper maintenance of body functions in humans. For adequate nourishment, it is important to keep track of nutrients level in the body, apart from consuming sufficient nutrition that is in line with dietary guidelines. Sweat, which contains rich chemical information, is an attractive biofluid for routine non&#8208;invasive assessment of nutrient levels. Herein, a wearable sensor that can selectively measure vitamin C concentration in biofluids, including sweat, urine, and blood is developed. Detection through an electrochemical sensor modified with Au nanostructures, LiClO4&#8208;doped conductive polymer, and an enzymes&#8208;immobilized membrane is utilized to achieve wide detection linearity, high selectivity, and long&#8208;term stability. The sensor allows monitoring of temporal changes in vitamin C levels. The effect of vitamin C intake on the sweat and urine profile is explored by monitoring concentration changes upon consuming different amounts of vitamin C. A longitudinal study of sweat's and urine's vitamin C correlation with blood is performed on two individuals. The results suggest that sweat and urine analysis can be a promising method to routinely monitor nutrition through the sweat sensor and that this sensor can facilitate applications such as nutritional screening and dietary intervention.

      <title>Manipulating the Solvation Structure of Nonflammable Electrolyte and Interface to Enable Unprecedented Stability of Graphite Anodes beyond 2 Years for Safe Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Nonflammable electrolytes show great advantages over conventional electrolytes in terms of both safety and performance, exhibiting high compatibility with graphite electrodes with the longest cycling performance (&gt;2 years). The electrolyte structure and derived F&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase jointly contribute to the superlong cycling stability of graphite electrode, which highlights the importance of the electrolyte compatibility and the interface.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are attractive for low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale energy storage applications, in which graphite is one of the most promising anodes. However, the large size and the high activity of K+ ions and the highly catalytic surface of graphite largely prevent the development of safe and compatible electrolytes. Here, a nonflammable, moderate&#8208;concentration electrolyte is reported that is highly compatible with graphite anodes and that consists of fire&#8208;retardant trimethyl phosphate (TMP) and potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (KFSI) in a salt/solvent molar ratio of 3:8. It shows unprecedented stability, as evidenced by its 74% capacity retention over 24 months of cycling (over 2000 cycles) at the 0.2 C current rate. Electrolyte structure and surface analyses show that this excellent cycling stability is due to the nearly 100% solvation of TMP molecules with K+ cations and the formation of FSI&#8722;&#8208;derived F&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which effectively suppresses the decomposition of the solvent molecules toward the graphite anode. Furthermore, excellent performance on high&#8208;mass loaded graphite electrodes and in a full cell with perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride cathode is demonstrated. This study highlights the importance of the compatibility of both electrolyte and the interface, and offers new opportunities to design the electrolyte&#8211;SEI nexus for safe and practical PIBs.

      <title>Layered PtSe2 for Sensing, Photonic, and (Opto&#8208;)Electronic Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Layered PtSe2 holds great promise for industries benefiting from its exciting physical and chemical properties, high air&#8208;stability, and semiconductor&#8208;technology&#8208;compatible fabrication methods. An overview of the use of PtSe2 for applications in photonics, (opto&#8208;)electronics, and sensors is provided. Challenges associated with the synthesis and integration of PtSe2, and the outlook for industry adoption of this material, are discussed.








Abstract
Since the first experimental discovery of graphene 16 years ago, many other 2D layered nanomaterials have been reported. However, the majority of 2D nanostructures suffer from relatively complicated fabrication processes that have bottlenecked their development and their uptake by industry for practical applications. Here, the recent progress in sensing, photonic, and (opto&#8208;)electronic applications of PtSe2, a 2D layered material that is likely to be used in industries benefiting from its high air&#8208;stability and semiconductor&#8208;technology&#8208;compatible fabrication methods, is reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of a range of synthesis methods for PtSe2 are initially compared, followed by a discussion of its outstanding properties, and industrial and commercial advantages. Research focused on the broadband nonlinear photonic properties of PtSe2, as well as reports of its use as a saturable absorber in ultrafast lasers, are then reviewed. Additionally, the advances that have been achieved in a range of PtSe2&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistors, photodetectors, and sensors are summarized. Finally, a conclusion on these results along with the outlook for the future is presented.

      <title>Indium Nitride at the 2D Limit</title>
      <dc:description>
A bilayer of InN is formed between graphene and SiC by an intercalation process. The coverage of the SiC surface is very high, above 90%. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements prove a bandgap value of 2&#160;&#177; 0.1&#160;eV for the 2D InN.








Abstract
The properties of 2D InN are predicted to substantially differ from the bulk crystal. The predicted appealing properties relate to strong in&#8208; and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane excitons, high electron mobility, efficient strain engineering of their electronic and optical properties, and strong application potential in gas sensing. Until now, the realization of 2D InN remained elusive. In this work, the formation of 2D InN and measurements of its bandgap are reported. Bilayer InN is formed between graphene and SiC by an intercalation process in metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The thickness uniformity of the intercalated structure is investigated by conductive atomic force microscopy (C&#8208;AFM) and the structural properties by atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The coverage of the SiC surface is very high, above 90%, and a major part of the intercalated structure is represented by two sub&#8208;layers of indium (In) bonded to nitrogen (N). Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements give a bandgap value of 2&#160;&#177; 0.1&#160;eV for the 2D InN. The stabilization of 2D InN with a pragmatic wide bandgap and high lateral uniformity of intercalation is demonstrated.

      <title>MXenes for Rechargeable Batteries Beyond the Lithium&#8208;Ion</title>
      <dc:description>
MXene and MXene&#8208;based materials are promising for emerging battery technologies beyond lithium ion batteries (including alkali&#8208;ion storage, multivalent&#8208;ion storage, and metal batteries). High conductivity, compositional diversity, and rich surface terminations allow MXenes to play various roles in emerging batteries, including as electrodes, metal anode protective layers, sulfur hosts, separator interlayers, and conductive additives.








Abstract
Research on next&#8208;generation battery technologies (beyond Li&#8208;ion batteries, or LIBs) has been accelerating over the past few years. A key challenge for these emerging batteries has been the lack of suitable electrode materials, which severely limits their further developments. MXenes, a new class of 2D transition metal carbides, carbonitrides, and nitrides, are proposed as electrode materials for these emerging batteries due to several desirable attributes. These attributes include large and tunable interlayer spaces, excellent hydrophilicity, extraordinary conductivity, compositional diversity, and abundant surface chemistries, making MXenes promising not only as electrode materials but also as other components in the cells of emerging batteries. Herein, an overview and assessment of the utilization of MXenes in rechargeable batteries beyond LIBs, including alkali&#8208;ion (e.g., Na+, K+) storage, multivalent&#8208;ion (e.g., Mg2+, Zn2+, and Al3+) storage, and metal batteries are presented. In particular, the synthetic strategies and properties of MXenes that enable MXenes to play various roles as electrodes, metal anode protective layers, sulfur hosts, separator modification layers, and conductive additives in these emerging batteries are discussed. Moreover, a perspective on promising future research directions on MXenes and MXene&#8208;based materials, ranging from material design and processing, fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanisms, to device performance optimization strategies is provided.

      <title>Recent Advances in the Design and Sensing Applications of Hemin/Coordination Polymer&#8208;Based Nanocomposites</title>
      <dc:description>
By combining the properties of hemin and porous coordination polymers into novel nanocomposites, different types of sensors can be generated for testing the concentrations of different biological molecules. These biosensors are based on electrochemical, chemiluminescent, or colorimetric techniques, and have excellent detection limits and stability.








Abstract
The fabrication of biomimetic catalysts as substituents for enzymes is of critical interest in the field due to the problems associated with the extraction, purification, and storage of enzymes in sensing applications. Of these mimetics, hemin/coordination polymer&#8208;based nanocomposites, mainly hemin/metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF), have been developed for various biosensing applications because of the unique properties of each component, while trying to mimic the normal biological functions of heme within the protein milieu of enzymes. This critical review first discusses the different catalytic functions of heme in the body in the form of enzyme/protein structures. The properties of hemin dimerization are then elucidated with the supposed models of hemin oxidation. After that, the progress in the fabrication of hemin/MOF nanocomposites for the sensing of diverse biological molecules is discussed. Finally, the challenges in developing this type of composites are examined as well as possible proposals for future directions to enhance the sensing performance in this field further.

      <title>Tailored Graphene Micropatterns by Wafer&#8208;Scale Direct Transfer for Flexible Chemical Sensor Platform</title>
      <dc:description>
A strategy to micropattern 2D materials on large&#8208;scale flexible substrates using direct polymer curing transfer method is demonstrated. Graphene microchannels on polymer substrates exhibit ultrahigh effective self&#8208;heating under the applied bias voltage of less than 10&#160;V. Entirely flexible and transparent chemical sensor array based on graphene micropatterns successfully discriminate gas species under the self&#8208;activated state without external heating.








Abstract
2D materials, such as graphene, exhibit great potential as functional materials for numerous novel applications due to their excellent properties. The grafting of conventional micropatterning techniques on new types of electronic devices is required to fully utilize the unique nature of graphene. However, the conventional lithography and polymer&#8208;supported transfer methods often induce the contamination and damage of the graphene surface due to polymer residues and harsh wet&#8208;transfer conditions. Herein, a novel strategy to obtain micropatterned graphene on polymer substrates using a direct curing process is demonstrated. Employing this method, entirely flexible, transparent, well&#8208;defined self&#8208;activated graphene sensor arrays, capable of gas discrimination without external heating, are fabricated on 4 in. wafer&#8208;scale substrates. Finite element method simulations show the potential of this patterning technique to maximize the performance of the sensor devices when the active channels of the 2D material are suspended and nanoscaled. This study contributes considerably to the development of flexible functional electronic devices based on 2D materials.

      <title>Liquid&#8208;Flowing Graphene Chip&#8208;Based High&#8208;Resolution Electron Microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
The liquid&#8208;flowing graphene chip (LFGC) is a novel imaging platform enabling the atomic&#8208;scale observation of liquid&#8208;phase reactions in operando circumstances. Graphene viewing windows and anti&#8208;bulging SiNx supports provide a controllable liquid thickness and structural integrity under harsh experimental conditions. Using LFGC, both atomic&#8208;resolution imaging and molecular&#8208;level information for inorganic and biological samples can be acquired under liquid circulation.








Abstract
The recent advances in liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy represent tremendous potential in many different fields and exciting new opportunities. However, achieving both high&#8208;resolution imaging and operando capabilities remain a significant challenge. This work suggests a novel in situ imaging platform of liquid&#8208;flowing graphene chip TEM (LFGC&#8208;TEM) equipped with graphene viewing windows and a liquid exchange system. The LFGCs are robust under high&#8208;pressure gradients and rapid liquid circulation in ranges covering the experimental conditions accessible with conventional thick SiNx chips. LFGC&#8208;TEM provides atomic resolution for colloidal nanoparticles and molecular&#8208;level information limits for unstained wet biomolecules and cells that are comparable to the resolutions achievable with solid&#8208;phase and cryogenic TEM, respectively. This imaging platform can provide an opportunity for live imaging of biological phenomena that is not yet achieved using any current methods.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent advances in liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy represent tremendous potential in many different fields and exciting new opportunities. However, achieving both high&#8208;resolution imaging and operando capabilities remain a significant challenge. This work suggests a novel in situ imaging platform of liquid&#8208;flowing graphene chip TEM (LFGC&#8208;TEM) equipped with graphene viewing windows and a liquid exchange system. The LFGCs are robust under high&#8208;pressure gradients and rapid liquid circulation in ranges covering the experimental conditions accessible with conventional thick SiN&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; chips. LFGC&#8208;TEM provides atomic resolution for colloidal nanoparticles and molecular&#8208;level information limits for unstained wet biomolecules and cells that are comparable to the resolutions achievable with solid&#8208;phase and cryogenic TEM, respectively. This imaging platform can provide an opportunity for live imaging of biological phenomena that is not yet achieved using any current methods.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hybrid Solid Electrolyte Interphases Enabled Ultralong Life Ca&#8211;Metal Batteries Working at Room Temperature</title>
      <dc:description>
A stable Ca plating/stripping process for more than 1000 h is realized through a Na/Ca hybrid SEI strategy. This enables an ultralong life and high operation voltage, up to 4.5 V, for room&#8208;temperature Ca&#8211;metal batteries.








Abstract
Currently, the application of calcium metal anodes is challenged by rapidly degenerated plating/stripping electrochemistry without suitable solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) capable of fast Ca2+ transport kinetics and superior ability to resist anion oxidation. Here, through in situ evolved Na/Ca hybrid SEIs, symmetrical Ca//Ca batteries readily remain stable for more than 1000 h deposition&#8211;dissolution cycles (versus less than 60 h for those with pure Ca SEIs under the same condition). Coupled with a specially designed freestanding lattice&#8208;expanded graphitic carbon fiber membrane and tailored operation voltages, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept Ca&#8208;metal batteries reversibly run for almost 1900 cycles with &#8776;83% capacity retention and a high average discharge voltage of 3.16&#160;V. The good performance not only benefits from the stable SEIs at the Ca metal surface which affords free Ca2+ transports and prohibits out&#8208;of&#8208;control fluridation of Ca (forming CaF2 ion&#8208;/electron&#8208;insulating layer) but is also attributed to reversible relay insertion/extraction electrochemistry in the cathode. This work sheds new light on durable metal battery technology.

      <title>Compositional Fluctuations Locked by Athermal Transformation Yielding High Thermoelectric Performance in GeTe</title>
      <dc:description>
The interplay between phase decomposition and athermal phase transition is leveraged in a Ge&#8208;Sb&#8208;Te ternary system to enable exquisite microstructure features by strong composition fluctuations and coexistence of rhombohedral&#8208; and cubic GeTe. Specifically, alloying GeTe with Sb2Te3 significantly suppresses thermal conductivity while retaining eligible carrier concentration over a wide composition range, resulting in high zT values &gt; 2.6.








Abstract
Phase transition in thermoelectric (TE) material is a double&#8208;edged sword&#8212;it is undesired for device operation in applications, but the fluctuations near an electronic instability are favorable. Here, Sb doping is used to elicit a spontaneous composition fluctuation showing uphill diffusion in GeTe that is otherwise suspended by diffusionless athermal cubic&#8208;to&#8208;rhombohedral phase transition at around 700 K. The interplay between these two phase transitions yields exquisite composition fluctuations and a coexistence of cubic and rhombohedral phases in favor of exceptional figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit zT. Specifically, alloying GeTe by Sb2Te3 significantly suppresses the thermal conductivity while retaining eligible carrier concentration over a wide composition range, resulting in high zT values of &gt;2.6. These results not only attest to the efficacy of using phase transition in manipulating the microstructures of GeTe&#8208;based materials but also open up a new thermodynamic route to develop higher performance TE materials in general.

      <title>High&#8208;Performance Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Enabled by Efficient Energy Transfer between Coupled Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Layers</title>
      <dc:description>
A bifunctional ligand of 4&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl) benzoic acid cation is incorporated into perovskite to simultaneously diminish the weak van der Waals gap and passivate the defects for efficient energy transfer and radiative recombination. Fabricated blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes show an external quantum efficiency of 10.11% and a long stability of 81.3 min, indicating that this is an effective approach for high device performance.








Abstract
While there has been extensive investigation into modulating quasi&#8208;2D perovskite compositions in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) for promoting their electroluminescence, very few reports have studied approaches involving enhancement of the energy transfer between quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layers of the film, which plays very important role for achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs). In this work, a bifunctional ligand of 4&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)benzoic acid (ABA) cation is strategically introduced into the perovskite to diminish the weak van der Waals gap between individual perovskite layers for promoting coupled quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layers. In particular, the strengthened interaction between coupled quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layers favors an efficient energy transfer in the perovskite films. The introduced ABA can also simultaneously passivate the perovskite defects by reducing metallic Pb for less nonradiative recombination loss. Benefiting from the advanced properties of ABA incorporated perovskites, highly efficient blue PeLEDs with external quantum efficiency of 10.11% and a very long operational stability of 81.3&#160;min, among the best performing blue quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs, are achieved. Consequently, this work contributes an effective approach for high&#8208;performance and stable blue PeLEDs toward practical applications.

      <title>Machine Learning Predictions of Block Copolymer Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>
Machine learning is used to analyze the self&#8208;assembly of block copolymer thin films. The neural networks predict the effect of process parameters on morphology and defectivity during solvent annealing, and a ridge regression model identifies the critical parameters that determine the quality of line/space patterns. These results illustrate the potential of machine learning to inform nanomanufacturing processes.








Abstract
Directed self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers is a key enabler for nanofabrication of devices with sub&#8208;10 nm feature sizes, allowing patterning far below the resolution limit of conventional photolithography. Among all the process steps involved in block copolymer self&#8208;assembly, solvent annealing plays a dominant role in determining the film morphology and pattern quality, yet the interplay of the multiple parameters during solvent annealing, including the initial thickness, swelling, time, and solvent ratio, makes it difficult to predict and control the resultant self&#8208;assembled pattern. Here, machine learning tools are applied to analyze the solvent annealing process and predict the effect of process parameters on morphology and defectivity. Two neural networks are constructed and trained, yielding accurate prediction of the final morphology in agreement with experimental data. A ridge regression model is constructed to identify the critical parameters that determine the quality of line/space patterns. These results illustrate the potential of machine learning to inform nanomanufacturing processes.

      <title>Self&#8208;Strengthening Adhesive Force Promotes Cell Mechanotransduction</title>
      <dc:description>
Benefiting from the spontaneous merocyanine&#8208;to&#8208;spiropyran isomerization, a coating displays dynamic self&#8208;strengthening of the interfacial adhesive force. Cells enable remodeling of the underlaying interfaces to meet their demand for adhesion when the ligand anchoring strength is weak. The subsequent self&#8208;strengthening process offers progressive force stimulation following the adaptation step to mediate cell behaviors and ultimately drive cell fate specification.








Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) undergoes dynamic remodeling and progressive stiffening during tissue regeneration and disease progression. However, most of the artificial ECMs and in vitro disease models are mechanically static. Here, a self&#8208;strengthening polymer coating mimicking the dynamic nature of native ECM is designed to study the cellular response to dynamic biophysical cues and promote cell mechanical sensitive response. Spiropyran (SP) is utilized as dynamic anchor group to regulate the strength of cell adhesive peptide ligands. Benefiting from spontaneous thermal merocyanine&#8208;to&#8208;spiropyran (MC&#8211;SP) isomerization, the resulting self&#8208;responsive coating displays dynamic self&#8208;strengthening of interfacial interactions. Comparing with the static and all of the previous dynamic artificial ECMs, cells on this self&#8208;responsive surface remodel the weakly bonded MC&#8208;based coatings to activate &#945;5&#946;1 integrin and Rac signaling in the early adhesion stage. The subsequent MC&#8208;to&#8208;SP conversion strengthens the ligand&#8211;integrin interaction to further activate &#945;v&#946;3 integrin and RhoA/ROCK signaling in the latter stage. This sequential process enhances cellular mechanotransduction as well as the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). It is worth emphasizing that the self&#8208;strengthening occurs spontaneously in the absence of any stimulus, making it especially useful for implanted scaffolds in regenerative medicine.

      <title>Unraveling the Nature of Excellent Potassium Storage in Small&#8208;Molecule Se@Peapod&#8208;Like N&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanofibers</title>
      <dc:description>
Small&#8208;molecule Se embedded in freestanding N&#8208;doped porous carbon nanofibers thin film is prepared as the cathode for K&#8211;Se batteries. The short&#8208;chain Se confined in the micropores is eventually transformed to K2Se by a two&#8208;step conversion reaction via an &#8220;all&#8208;solid&#8208;state&#8221; electrochemical process which hinders the generation of polyselenides and promotes complete conversion thus enhancing the utilization of Se.








Abstract
The potassium&#8211;selenium (K&#8211;Se) battery is considered as an alternative solution for stationary energy storage because of abundant resource of K. However, the detailed mechanism of the energy storage process is yet to be unraveled. Herein, the findings in probing the working mechanism of the K&#8208;ion storage in Se cathode are reported using both experimental and computational approaches. A flexible K&#8211;Se battery is prepared by employing the small&#8208;molecule Se embedded in freestanding N &#8208;doped porous carbon nanofibers thin film (Se@NPCFs) as cathode. The reaction mechanisms are elucidated by identifying the existence of short&#8208;chain molecular Se encapsulated inside the microporous host, which transforms to K2Se by a two&#8208;step conversion reaction via an &#8220;all&#8208;solid&#8208;state&#8221; electrochemical process in the carbonate electrolyte system. Through the whole reaction, the generation of polyselenides (K2Sen, 3&#160;&#8804;&#160;n&#160;&#8804;&#160;8) is effectively suppressed by electrochemical reaction dominated by Se2 molecules, thus significantly enhancing the utilization of Se and effecting the voltage platform of the K&#8211;Se battery. This work offers a practical pathway to optimize the K&#8211;Se battery performance through structure engineering and manipulation of selenium chemistry for the formation of selective species and reveal its internal reaction mechanism in the carbonate electrolyte.

      <title>High&#8208;Definition Single&#8208;Cell Printing: Cell&#8208;by&#8208;Cell Fabrication of Biological Structures</title>
      <dc:description>
Conventional bioprinting methods cannot reliably print single cells. A novel microfluidic bioprinting technology with a highly miniaturized cell sorter is presented to accurately print single cells. Through selective cell&#8208;by&#8208;cell printing, intricate cell patterns at single&#8208;cell resolution and uniform spheroids with defined composition and morphology are fabricated.








Abstract
Bioprinting is a powerful technology with the potential to transform medical device manufacturing, organ replacement, and the treatment of diseases and physiologic malformations. However, current bioprinters are unable to reliably print the fundamental unit of all living things, single cells. A high&#8208;definition single&#8208;cell printing, a novel microfluidic technology, is presented here that can accurately print single cells from a mixture of multiple candidates. The bioprinter employs a highly miniaturized microfluidic sorter to deterministically select single cells of interest for printing, achieving an accuracy of &#8776;10&#160;&#181;m and speed of &#8776;100&#160;Hz. This approach is demonstrated by fabricating intricate cell patterns with pre&#8208;defined features through selective single&#8208;cell printing. The approach is used to synthesize well&#8208;defined spheroids with controlled composition and morphology. The speed, accuracy, and flexibility of the approach will advance bioprinting to enable new studies in organoid science, tissue engineering, and spatially targeted cell therapies.

      <title>Fully Light&#8208;Controlled Memory and Neuromorphic Computation in Layered Black Phosphorus</title>
      <dc:description>
An all&#8208;optically tunable neuromorphic imaging element based on black phosphorus (BP) is demonstrated. Unusual wavelength&#8208;dependent photocurrent in BP is harnessed to optically program and erase visual memory elements. Concurrently, the same elements are capable of in&#8208;pixel image pre&#8208;processing in an array and optoelectronic machine learning for image recognition through artificial neural networks.








Abstract
Imprinting vision as memory is a core attribute of human cognitive learning. Fundamental to artificial intelligence systems are bioinspired neuromorphic vision components for the visible and invisible segments of the electromagnetic spectrum. Realization of a single imaging unit with a combination of in&#8208;built memory and signal processing capability is imperative to deploy efficient brain&#8208;like vision systems. However, the lack of a platform that can be fully controlled by light without the need to apply alternating polarity electric signals has hampered this technological advance. Here, a neuromorphic imaging element based on a fully light&#8208;modulated 2D semiconductor in a simple reconfigurable phototransistor structure is presented. This standalone device exhibits inherent characteristics that enable neuromorphic image pre&#8208;processing and recognition. Fundamentally, the unique photoresponse induced by oxidation&#8208;related defects in 2D black phosphorus (BP) is exploited to achieve visual memory, wavelength&#8208;selective multibit programming, and erasing functions, which allow in&#8208;pixel image pre&#8208;processing. Furthermore, all&#8208;optically driven neuromorphic computation is demonstrated by machine learning to classify numbers and recognize images with an accuracy of over 90%. The devices provide a promising approach toward neurorobotics, human&#8211;machine interaction technologies, and scalable bionic systems with visual data storage/buffering and processing.
