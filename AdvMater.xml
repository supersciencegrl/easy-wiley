      <title>Tellurium: A High&#8208;Volumetric&#8208;Capacity Potassium&#8208;Ion Battery Electrode Material</title>
      <dc:description>
Tellurium (Te) is demonstrated to be a promising electrode material for storage of K+ ions via a two&#8208;electron conversion&#8208;type reaction mechanism of 2K + Te &#8596; K2Te. A rationally designed tellurium/porous carbon composited electrode that can alleviate the volume change and shuttle effect shows a high volumetric capacity as well as high rate and long&#8208;term cycling performance.








Abstract
Currently, exploring high&#8208;volumetric&#8208;capacity electrode materials that allow for reversible (de&#8208;)insertion of large&#8208;size K+ ions remains challenging. Tellurium (Te) is a promising alternative electrode for storage of K+ ions due to its high volumetric capacity, confirmed in lithium&#8208;/sodium&#8208;ion batteries, and the intrinsic good electronic conductivity. However, the charge storage capability and mechanism of Te in potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) have not been unveiled until now. Here, a novel K&#8211;Te battery is constructed, and the K+&#8208;ion storage mechanism of Te is revealed to be a two&#8208;electron conversion&#8208;type reaction of 2K + Te &#8596; K2Te, resulting in a high theoretical volumetric capacity of 2619 mAh cm&#8722;3. Consequently, the rationally fabricated tellurium/porous carbon electrodes deliver an ultrahigh reversible volumetric capacity of 2493.13 mAh cm&#8722;3 at 0.5 C (based on Te), a high&#8208;rate capacity of 783.13 mAh cm&#8722;3 at 15 C, and superior long&#8208;term cycling stability for 1000 cycles at 5 C. This excellent electrochemical performance proves the feasibility of utilizing Te as a high&#8208;volumetric&#8208;capacity active material for storage of K+ ions and will advance the practical application of KIBs.

      <title>Intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; Conjugation Self&#8208;Assembly to Stabilize Surface Passivation of Highly Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Sufficient and stable surface passivation of perovskite solar cells is realized using a novel tribenzylphosphine oxide molecule, with high cell efficiency of &gt;22% and excellent operation stability being obtained. These achievements benefit from the strong molecule&#8211;perovskite Coulomb interaction and the formation of superstructure self&#8208;assembly on the perovskite surface, enabled by intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugation.








Abstract
Surface passivation is an effective approach to eliminate defects and thus to achieve efficient perovskite solar cells, while the stability of the passivation effect is a new concern for device stability engineering.

&lt;p&gt;Sufficient and stable surface passivation of perovskite solar cells is realized using a novel tribenzylphosphine oxide molecule, with high cell efficiency of &amp;gt;22% and excellent operation stability being obtained. These achievements benefit from the strong molecule&#8211;perovskite Coulomb interaction and the formation of superstructure self&#8208;assembly on the perovskite surface, enabled by intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugation.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surface passivation is an effective approach to eliminate defects and thus to achieve efficient perovskite solar cells, while the stability of the passivation effect is a new concern for device stability engineering. Herein, tribenzylphosphine oxide (TBPO) is introduced to stably passivate the perovskite surface. A high efficiency exceeding 22%, with steady&#8208;state efficiency of 21.6%, is achieved, which is among the highest performances for TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; planar cells, and the hysteresis is significantly suppressed. Further density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that the surface molecule superstructure induced by TBPO intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugation, such as the periodic interconnected structure, results in a high stability of TBPO&#8211;perovskite coordination and passivation. The passivated cell exhibits significantly improved stability, with sustaining 92% of initial efficiency after 250 h maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point tracking. Therefore, the construction of a stabilized surface passivation in this work represents great progress in the stability engineering of perovskite solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A 2D Titanium Carbide MXene Flexible Electrode for High&#8208;Efficiency Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
      <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed transparent conducting electrode with desirable properties including high electrical conductivity (&#8776;11 668 S cm&#8722;1) and work function (&#8776;5.1 eV) is achieved by using a 2D titanium carbide (Ti3C2) MXene thin film. Precise control of the surface chemical composition and a neutralized hole&#8208;injection layer prevent detrimental surface/interface oxidation of the MXene and enable a high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting diode that uses the solution&#8208;processed MXene electrode.








Abstract
Although several transparent conducting materials such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, and conducting polymers have been intensively explored as flexible electrodes in optoelectronic devices, their insufficient electrical conductivity, low work function, and complicated electrode fabrication processes have limited their practical use. Herein, a 2D titanium carbide (Ti3C2) MXene film with transparent conducting electrode (TCE) properties, including high electrical conductivity (&#8776;11 670 S cm&#8722;1) and high work function (&#8776;5.1 eV), which are achieved by combining a simple solution processing with modulation of surface composition, is described. A chemical neutralization strategy of a conducting&#8208;polymer hole&#8208;injection layer is used to prevent detrimental surface oxidation and resulting degradation of the electrode film. Use of the MXene electrode in an organic light&#8208;emitting diode leads to a current efficiency of &#8776;102.0 cd A&#8722;1 and an external quantum efficiency of &#8776;28.5% ph/el, which agree well with the theoretical maximum values from optical simulations. The results demonstrate the strong potential of MXene as a solution&#8208;processable electrode in optoelectronic devices and provide a guideline for use of MXenes as TCEs in low&#8208;cost flexible optoelectronic devices.

      <title>Heavy Water Additive in Formamidinium: A Novel Approach to Enhance Perovskite Solar Cell Efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>
Deuterium oxide as a solvent additive enhances the power conversion efficiency of triple&#8208;cation perovskite solar cells. It passivates the defects, thus enhancing the charge carrier lifetimes and diffusion lengths. Partial formamidinium deuteration also helps to stabilize the PbI6 structure. This facile approach based on selective isotope exchange could possibly be extended to other perovskite devices to improve their optoelectronic properties.








Abstract
Heavy water or deuterium oxide (D2O) comprises deuterium, a hydrogen isotope twice the mass of hydrogen. Contrary to the disadvantages of deuterated perovskites, such as shorter recombination lifetimes and lower/invariant efficiencies, the serendipitous effect of D2O as a beneficial solvent additive for enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of triple&#8208;A cation (cesium (Cs)/methylammonium (MA)/formaminidium (FA)) perovskite solar cells from &#8776;19.2% (reference) to 20.8% (using 1 vol% D2O) with higher stability is reported. Ultrafast optical spectroscopy confirms passivation of trap states, increased carrier recombination lifetimes, and enhanced charge carrier diffusion lengths in the deuterated samples. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy validate the N&#8211;H2 group as the preferential isotope exchange site. Furthermore, the NMR results reveal the induced alteration of the FA to MA ratio due to deuteration causes a widespread alteration to several dynamic processes that influence the photophysical properties. First&#8208;principles density functional theory calculations reveal a decrease in PbI6 phonon frequencies in the deuterated perovskite lattice. This stabilizes the PbI6 structures and weakens the electron&#8211;LO phonon (Fr&#246;hlich) coupling, yielding higher electron mobility. Importantly, these findings demonstrate that selective isotope exchange potentially opens new opportunities for tuning perovskite optoelectronic properties.

      <title>Facile Synthesis of Efficient Luminogens with AIE Features for Three&#8208;Photon Fluorescence Imaging of the Brain through the Intact Skull</title>
      <dc:description>
An ultrabright solid&#8208;state FR/NIR luminogen with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature is reported. Its resulting AIE dots show good biocompatibility, satisfactory photostability, and a large three&#8208;photon absorption cross section. The AIE dots are reported for visualization of the cerebral thrombosis process of a mouse with intact skull, with high penetration depth and good image contrast.








Abstract
Visualization of the brain in its native environment is important for understanding common brain diseases. Herein, bright luminogens with remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics and high quantum yields of up to 42.6% in the solid state are synthesized through facile reaction routes. The synthesized molecule, namely BTF, shows ultrabright far&#8208;red/near&#8208;infrared emission and can be fabricated into AIE dots by a simple nanoprecipitation procedure. Due to their high brightness, large Stokes shift, good biocompatibility, satisfactory photostability, and large three&#8208;photon absorption cross section, the AIE dots can be utilized as efficient fluorescent nanoprobes for in vivo brain vascular imaging through the intact skull by a three&#8208;photon fluorescence microscopy imaging technique. This is the first example of using AIE dots for the visualization of the cerebral stroke process through the intact skull of a mouse with high penetration depth and good image contrast. Such good results are anticipated to open up a new venue in the development of efficient emitters with strong nonlinear optical effects for noninvasive bioimaging of living brain.

      <title>An Ultrastrong and Highly Stretchable Polyurethane Elastomer Enabled by a Zipper&#8208;Like Ring&#8208;Sliding Effect</title>
      <dc:description>
A molecular zipper elastomer&#8212;the combination of ring&#8208;sliding effects and dense hydrogen&#8208;bonding crystal domains in a dry polymer network&#8212;results in unexpectedly substantial improvements to the elastomer mechanical performance, including stretchability and strength. The mechanism is found to be the ring&#8208;sliding motion against hydrogen&#8208;bonding domains upon stretching, which effectively dissipates the input mechanical energy.








Abstract
Elastomers with excellent mechanical properties are in substantial demand for various applications, but there is always a tradeoff between their mechanical strength and stretchability. For example, partially replacing strong covalent crosslinking by weak sacrificial bonds can enhance the stretchability but also usually decreases the mechanical strength. To surmount this inherent tradeoff, a supramolecular strategy of introducing a zipper&#8208;like sliding&#8208;ring mechanism in a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;crosslinked polyurethane network is proposed. A very small amount (0.5 mol%) of an external additive (pseudo[2]rotaxane crosslinker) can dramatically increase both the mechanical strength and elongation of this polyurethane network by nearly one order of magnitude. Based on the investigation of the relationship between molecular structure and mechanical properties, this enhancement is attributable to a unique molecular&#8208;level zipper&#8208;like ring&#8208;sliding motion, which efficiently dissipates mechanical work in the solvent&#8208;free network. This research not only provides a distinct and general strategy for the construction of high&#8208;performance elastomers but also paves the way for the practical application of artificial molecular machines toward solvent&#8208;free polyurethane networks.

      <title>Phosphonium Modification Leads to Ultrapermeable Antibacterial Polyamide Composite Membranes with Unreduced Thickness</title>
      <dc:description>
Facile modification of polyamide composite membranes by an inexpensive phosphonium monomer featuring tetrahedral geometry is found to create additional water transport channels, improving the water purification performance without reducing film thickness. Compared with cutting&#8208;edge ultrathin membranes, the modified membrane highlights good rejection, antibacterial properties, superior water permeability, and facile preparation.








Abstract
Water transport rate in network membranes is inversely correlated to thickness, thus superior permeance is achievable with ultrathin membranes prepared by complicated methods circumventing nanofilm weakness and defects. Conferring ultrahigh permeance to easily prepared thicker membranes remains challenging. Here, a tetrakis(hydroxymethyl) phosphonium chloride (THPC) monomer is discovered that enables straightforward modification of polyamide composite membranes. Water permeance of the modified membrane is &#8776;6 times improved, give rising to permeability (permeance &#215; thickness) one magnitude higher than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymer nanofiltration membranes. Meanwhile, the membrane exhibits good rejection (RNa2SO4 = 98%) and antibacterial properties under crossflow conditions. THPC modification not only improves membrane hydrophilicity, but also creates additional angstrom&#8208;scale channels in polyamide membranes for unimpeded transport of water.

     alt="Phosphonium Modification Leads to Ultrapermeable Antibacterial Polyamide Composite Membranes with Unreduced Thickness"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facile modification of polyamide composite membranes by an inexpensive phosphonium monomer featuring tetrahedral geometry is found to create additional water transport channels, improving the water purification performance without reducing film thickness. Compared with cutting&#8208;edge ultrathin membranes, the modified membrane highlights good rejection, antibacterial properties, superior water permeability, and facile preparation.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water transport rate in network membranes is inversely correlated to thickness, thus superior permeance is achievable with ultrathin membranes prepared by complicated methods circumventing nanofilm weakness and defects. Conferring ultrahigh permeance to easily prepared thicker membranes remains challenging. Here, a tetrakis(hydroxymethyl) phosphonium chloride (THPC) monomer is discovered that enables straightforward modification of polyamide composite membranes. Water permeance of the modified membrane is &#8776;6 times improved, give rising to permeability (permeance &#215; thickness) one magnitude higher than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymer nanofiltration membranes. Meanwhile, the membrane exhibits good rejection (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;Na2SO4&lt;/sub&gt; = 98%) and antibacterial properties under crossflow conditions. THPC modification not only improves membrane hydrophilicity, but also creates additional angstrom&#8208;scale channels in polyamide membranes for unimpeded transport of water. This unique mechanism provides a paradigm shift in facile preparation of ultrapermeable membranes with unreduced thickness for clean water and desalination.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A New Microengineered Platform for 4D Tracking of Single Cells in a Stem&#8208;Cell&#8208;Based In Vitro Morphogenesis Model</title>
      <dc:description>
Several stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based morphogenesis models mimicking embryonic development have been recently developed; however, customized cell culture platforms are needed to unleash their full potential. A new, microengineered platform for 3D suspension culture of mouse stem cell aggregates is presented; enabling microscale control of the position and orientation of elongating stem cell aggregates and real&#8208;time data acquisition at single&#8208;cell resolution.








Abstract
Recently developed stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based in vitro models of morphogenesis can help shed light on the mechanisms involved in embryonic patterning. These models are showcased using traditional cell culture platforms and materials, which allow limited control over the biological system and usually do not support high&#8208;content imaging. In contrast, using advanced microengineered tools can help in microscale control, long&#8208;term culture, and real&#8208;time data acquisition from such biological models and aid in elucidating the underlying mechanisms. Here, a new culturing, manipulation and analysis platform is described to study in vitro morphogenesis using thin polycarbonate film&#8208;based microdevices. A pipeline consisting of open&#8208;source software to quantify 3D cell movement using 4D image acquisition is developed to analyze cell migration within the multicellular clusters. It is shown that the platform can be used to control and study morphogenesis in non&#8208;adherent cultures of the P19C5 mouse stem cell line and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) that show symmetry breaking and axial elongation events similar to early embryonic development. Using the new platform, it is found that localized cell proliferation and coordinated cell migration result in elongation morphogenesis of the P19C5 aggregates. Further, it is found that polarization and elongation of mESC aggregates are dependent on directed cell migration.

      <title>A Highly Efficient Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalyst of F&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon toward N2 Electroreduction</title>
      <dc:description>
A F&#8208;doped 3D porous carbon framework (F&#8208;doped carbon) is developed as a highly efficient metal&#8208;free catalyst toward N2 electroreduction. At &#8722;0.3 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, the F&#8208;doped carbon achieves a yield rate of 197.7 &#181;gNH3 mg&#8722;1cat. h&#8722;1 for NH3, which is more than one order of magnitude higher than those of the reported metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts up to date.








Abstract
N2 electroreduction into NH3 represents an attractive prospect for N2 utilization. Nevertheless, this process suffers from low Faraday efficiency (FE) and yield rate for NH3. In this work, a highly efficient metal&#8208;free catalyst is developed by introducing F atoms into a 3D porous carbon framework (F&#8208;doped carbon) toward N2 electroreduction. At &#8722;0.2 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), the F&#8208;doped carbon achieves the highest FE of 54.8% for NH3, which is 3.0 times as high as that (18.3%) of pristine carbon frameworks. Notably, at &#8722;0.3 V versus RHE, the yield rate of F&#8208;doped carbon for NH3 reaches 197.7 &#181;gNH3 mg&#8722;1cat. h&#8722;1. Such a value is more than one order of magnitude higher than those of other metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts under the near&#8208;ambient conditions for NH3 product to date. Mechanistic studies reveal that the improved performance in N2 electroreduction for F&#8208;doped carbon originates from the enhanced binding strength of N2 and the facilitated dissociation of N2 into *N2H. F bonding to C atom creates a Lewis acid site due to the different electronegativity between the F and C atoms. As such, the repulsive interaction between the Lewis acid site and proton H suppresses the activity of H2 evolution reaction, thus enhancing the selectivity of N2 electroreduction into NH3.

      <title>Amyloid&#8208;Like Protein Aggregates: A New Class of Bioinspired Materials Merging an Interfacial Anchor with Antifouling</title>
      <dc:description>
Few strategies can achieve a robust antifouling coating on a surface in an easy and reliable way. The preparation of an antifouling coating by one&#8208;step aqueous amyloid&#8208;like aggregation of bovine serum albumin (PTB) is reported, showing strong stability and adhesion with the underlying substrate, as well as excellent resistance to the nonspecific adsorption of a broad&#8208;spectrum of biological contaminants.








Abstract
Surfaces that resist nonspecific protein adsorption in a complex biological milieu are required for a variety of applications. However, few strategies can achieve a robust antifouling coating on a surface in an easy and reliable way, regardless of material type, morphology, and shape. Herein, the preparation of an antifouling coating by one&#8208;step aqueous supramolecular assembly of bovine serum albumin (BSA) is reported. Based on fast amyloid&#8208;like protein aggregation through the rapid reduction of the intramolecular disulfide bonds of BSA by tris(2&#8208;carboxyethyl)phosphine, a dense proteinaceous nanofilm with controllable thickness (&#8776;130 nm) can be covered on virtually arbitrary material surfaces in tens of minutes by a simple dipping or spraying. The nanofilm shows strong stability and adhesion with the underlying substrate, exhibiting excellent resistance to the nonspecific adsorption of a broad&#8208;spectrum of contaminants including proteins, serum, cell lysate, cells, and microbes, etc. In vitro and in vivo experiments show that the nanofilm can prevent the adhesion of microorganisms and the formation of biofilm. Compared with native BSA, the proteinaceous nanofilm coating exposes a variety of functional groups on the surface, which have more&#8208;stable adhesion with the surface and can maintain the antifouling in harsh conditions including under ultrasound, surfactants, organic solvents, and enzymatic digestion.

      <title>Defect&#8208;Enhanced Polarization Switching in the Improper Ferroelectric LuFeO3</title>
      <dc:description>
Polarization switching in epitaxial thin films of the improper ferroelectric LuFeO3 shows that the inclusion of point defects can reduce the coercive electric field. Frequency dispersion of the switching field is larger when the thickness is reduced, suggesting that the mechanical constraint induced by the substrates may play a key role in the switching of the polarization state.








Abstract
Results of switching behavior of the improper ferroelectric LuFeO3 are presented. Using a model set of films prepared under controlled chemical and growth&#8208;rate conditions, it is shown that defects can reduce the quasi&#8208;static switching voltage by up to 40% in qualitative agreement with first&#8208;principles calculations. Switching studies show that the coercive field has a stronger frequency dispersion for the improper ferroelectrics compared to a proper ferroelectric such as PbTiO3. It is concluded that the primary structural order parameter controls the switching dynamics of such improper ferroelectrics.

      <title>A Noble&#8208;Transition Alloy Excels at Hot&#8208;Carrier Generation in the Near Infrared</title>
      <dc:description>
A noble&#8208;transition alloy, AuxPd1&#8722;x, is demonstrated to excel at generating above&#8208;equilibrium &#8220;hot&#8220; carriers under near&#8208;infrared excitation. Au50Pd50 provides a 20&#8208;fold increase in the number of &#8776;0.8 eV hot holes, compared to Au, and a threefold increase in the carrier lifetime, compared to Pd.








Abstract
Above&#8208;equilibrium &#8220;hot&#8221;&#8208;carrier generation in metals is a promising route to convert photons into electrical charge for efficient near&#8208;infrared optoelectronics. However, metals that offer both hot&#8208;carrier generation in the near&#8208;infrared and sufficient carrier lifetimes remain elusive. Alloys can offer emergent properties and new design strategies compared to pure metals. Here, it is shown that a noble&#8208;transition alloy, AuxPd1&#8722;x, outperforms its constituent metals concerning generation and lifetime of hot carriers when excited in the near&#8208;infrared. At optical fiber wavelengths (e.g., 1550 nm), Au50Pd50 provides a 20&#8208;fold increase in the number of &#8776;0.8 eV hot holes, compared to Au, and a threefold increase in the carrier lifetime, compared to Pd. The discovery that noble&#8208;transition alloys can excel at hot&#8208;carrier generation reveals a new material platform for near&#8208;infrared optoelectronic devices.

     alt="A Noble&#8208;Transition Alloy Excels at Hot&#8208;Carrier Generation in the Near Infrared"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A noble&#8208;transition alloy, Au&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;, is demonstrated to excel at generating above&#8208;equilibrium &#8220;hot&#8220; carriers under near&#8208;infrared excitation. Au&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; provides a 20&#8208;fold increase in the number of &#8776;0.8 eV hot holes, compared to Au, and a threefold increase in the carrier lifetime, compared to Pd.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above&#8208;equilibrium &#8220;hot&#8221;&#8208;carrier generation in metals is a promising route to convert photons into electrical charge for efficient near&#8208;infrared optoelectronics. However, metals that offer both hot&#8208;carrier generation in the near&#8208;infrared and sufficient carrier lifetimes remain elusive. Alloys can offer emergent properties and new design strategies compared to pure metals. Here, it is shown that a noble&#8208;transition alloy, Au&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;, outperforms its constituent metals concerning generation and lifetime of hot carriers when excited in the near&#8208;infrared. At optical fiber wavelengths (e.g., 1550 nm), Au&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; provides a 20&#8208;fold increase in the number of &#8776;0.8 eV hot holes, compared to Au, and a threefold increase in the carrier lifetime, compared to Pd. The discovery that noble&#8208;transition alloys can excel at hot&#8208;carrier generation reveals a new material platform for near&#8208;infrared optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Living Bioelectrochemical Composites</title>
      <dc:description>
Combining Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 with the self&#8208;doped conjugated polyelectrolyte CPE&#8208;K leads to conductive networks that allow transfer of extracellular electron equivalents to an external gold electrode. It is shown that three&#8208;dimensional living biocomposites incorporating electrogenic bacteria and conductive gels efficiently harvest biocurrent, providing a strategy to reduce barriers to charge extraction and injection in bioelectrochemical devices.








Abstract
Composites, in which two or more material elements are combined to provide properties unattainable by single components, have a historical record dating to ancient times. Few include a living microbial community as a key design element. A logical basis for enabling bioelectronic composites stems from the phenomenon that certain microorganisms transfer electrons to external surfaces, such as an electrode. A bioelectronic composite that allows cells to be addressed beyond the confines of an electrode surface can impact bioelectrochemical technologies, including microbial fuel cells for power production and bioelectrosynthesis platforms where microbes produce desired chemicals. It is shown that the conjugated polyelectrolyte CPE&#8208;K functions as a conductive matrix to electronically connect a three&#8208;dimensional network of Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 to a gold electrode, thereby increasing biocurrent &#8776;150&#8208;fold over control biofilms. These biocomposites spontaneously assemble from solution into an intricate arrangement of cells within a conductive polymer matrix. While increased biocurrent is due to more cells in communication with the electrode, the current extracted per cell is also enhanced, indicating efficient long&#8208;range electron transport. Further, the biocomposites show almost an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude lower charge transfer resistance than CPE&#8208;K alone, supporting the idea that the electroactive bacteria and the conjugated polyelectrolyte work synergistically toward an effective bioelectronic composite.

      <title>Metabolic Fingerprinting on Synthetic Alloys for Medulloblastoma Diagnosis and Radiotherapy Evaluation</title>
      <dc:description>
Synthetic Pd&#8211;Au alloys are developed for mass&#8208;spectrometry&#8208;based metabolic fingerprinting and analysis, toward medulloblastoma diagnosis and radiotherapy evaluation. Optimized alloys enhance laser desorption/ionization efficacy and achieve direct detection of 100 nL of biofluids in seconds. Medulloblastoma patients are diagnosed by machine learning. Furthermore, radiotherapy is monitored and a preliminary panel of serum metabolite biomarkers is identified with gradual changes.








Abstract
Diagnostics is the key in screening and treatment of cancer. As an emerging tool in precision medicine, metabolic analysis detects end products of pathways, and thus is more distal than proteomic/genetic analysis. However, metabolic analysis is far from ideal in clinical diagnosis due to the sample complexity and metabolite abundance in patient specimens. A further challenge is real&#8208;time and accurate tracking of treatment effect, e.g., radiotherapy. Here, Pd&#8211;Au synthetic alloys are reported for mass&#8208;spectrometry&#8208;based metabolic fingerprinting and analysis, toward medulloblastoma diagnosis and radiotherapy evaluation. A core&#8211;shell structure is designed using magnetic core particles to support Pd&#8211;Au alloys on the surface. Optimized synthetic alloys enhance the laser desorption/ionization efficacy and achieve direct detection of 100 nL of biofluids in seconds. Medulloblastoma patients are differentiated from healthy controls with average diagnostic sensitivity of 94.0%, specificity of 85.7%, and accuracy of 89.9%, by machine learning of metabolic fingerprinting. Furthermore, the radiotherapy process of patients is monitored and a preliminary panel of serum metabolite biomarkers is identified with gradual changes. This work will lead to the application&#8208;driven development of novel materials with tailored structural design and establishment of new protocols for precision medicine in near future.

      <title>Carrier Multiplication in PbS Quantum Dots Anchored on a Au Tip using Conductive Atomic Force Microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
A coated metal tip, on which lead sulfide quantum dots are anchored, is installed on a conductive atomic force microscope with a light source. This measurement system supplies the photocurrent from the few quantum dots. The photocurrent exhibits a step&#8208;like behavior near two and three times the bandgap of the quantum dots.








Abstract
Carrier multiplication (CM) is the amplification of the excited carrier density by two times or more when the incident photon energy is larger than twice the bandgap of semiconductors. A practical approach to demonstrate the CM involves the direct measurement of photocurrent in the device. Specifically, photocurrent measurement in quantum dots (QDs) is typically limited by high contact resistance and long carrier&#8208;transfer length, which yields a low CM conversion efficiency and high CM threshold energy. Here, the local photocurrent is measured to evaluate the CM quantum efficiency from a QD&#8208;attached Au tip of a conductive atomic force microscope (CAFM) system. The photocurrent is efficiently measured between the PbS QDs anchored on a Au tip and a graphene layer on a SiO2/Si substrate as a counter electrode, yielding an extremely short channel length that reduces the contact resistance. The quantum efficiency extracted from the local photocurrent data with an incident photon energy exhibits a step&#8208;like behavior. More importantly, the CM threshold energy is as low as twice the bandgap, which is the lowest threshold energy of optically observed QDs to date. This enables the CAFM&#8208;based photocurrent technique to directly evaluate the CM conversion efficiency in low&#8208;dimensional materials.

      <title>Phase Transition across Anisotropic NbS3 and Direct Gap Semiconductor TiS3 at Nominal Titanium Alloying Limit</title>
      <dc:description>
Studies show the first two&#8208;dimensional Nb(1&#8722;x)TixS3 anisotropic vdW alloys in the entire composition range without phase separation. A triclinic to monoclinic phase transition occurs at a very small titanium doping limit. These results expand ternary alloy layered crystals and allow for band engineering in the infrared.








Abstract
Alloying selected layered transitional metal trichalcogenides (TMTCs) with unique chain&#8208;like structures offers the opportunities for structural, optical, and electrical engineering thus expands the regime of this class of pseudo&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional materials. Here, the novel phase transition in anisotropic Nb(1&#8722;x)TixS3 alloys is demonstrated for the first time. Results show that Nb(1&#8722;x)TixS3 can be fully alloyed across the entire composition range from triclinic&#8208;phase NbS3 to monoclinic&#8208;phase TiS3. Surprisingly, incorporation of a small concentration of Ti (x &#8776; 0.05&#8211;0.18) into NbS3 host matrix is sufficient to induce triclinic to monoclinic transition. Theoretical studies suggest that Ti atoms effectively introduce hole doping, thus rapidly decreases the total energy of monoclinic phase and induces the phase transition. When alloyed, crystalline and optical anisotropy are largely preserved as evidenced by high resolution transmission electron microscopy and angle&#8208;resolved Raman spectroscopy. Further Raman measurements identify Raman modes to determine crystalline anisotropy direction and offer insights into the degree of anisotropy. Overall results introduce Nb(1&#8722;x)TixS3 as a new and easy phase change material and mark the first phase engineering in anisotropic van der Waals (vdW) trichalcogenide systems for their potential applications in two&#8208;dimensional superconductivity, electronics, photonics, and information technologies.

High spin&#8211;orbit torque and large spin Hall conductivity are found in these PtTe2 thin films, which manifest the potential of PtTe2 thin film for energy&#8208;efficient magnetization switching. The experiments establish a primary basis for further research on similar systems for high&#8208;performance spintronic devices.








Abstract
Manipulation of magnetization by electric&#8208;current&#8208;induced spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT) is of great importance for spintronic applications because of its merits in energy&#8208;efficient and high&#8208;speed operation. An ideal material for SOT applications should possess high charge&#8208;spin conversion efficiency and high electrical conductivity. Recently, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) emerge as intriguing platforms for SOT study because of their controllability in spin&#8211;orbit coupling, conductivity, and energy band topology. Although TMDs show great potentials in SOT applications, the present study is restricted to the mechanically exfoliated samples with small sizes and relatively low conductivities. Here, a manufacturable recipe is developed to fabricate large&#8208;area thin films of PtTe2, a type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal, to study their capability of generating SOT. Large SOT efficiency together with high conductivity results in a giant spin Hall conductivity of PtTe2 thin films, which is the largest value among the presently reported TMDs. It is further demonstrated that the SOT from PtTe2 layer can switch a perpendicularly magnetized CoTb layer efficiently. This work paves the way for employing PtTe2&#8208;like TMDs for wafer&#8208;scale spintronic device applications.

      <title>Aptamer/Peptide&#8208;Functionalized Genome&#8208;Editing System for Effective Immune Restoration through Reversal of PD&#8208;L1&#8208;Mediated Cancer Immunosuppression</title>
      <dc:description>
An aptamer/peptide&#8208;functionalized delivery vector is constructed to effectively deliver CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 plasmid to tumor cells for &#946;&#8208;catenin knockout to eliminate tumor immunosuppression. The significantly decreased programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) in edited tumor cells not only releases the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 brake to improve the cancer&#8208;killing capability of T cells, but also enhances the antitumor immune responses of the immune cells co&#8208;cultured with edited tumor cells.








Abstract
Effective reversal of tumor immunosuppression is of critical importance in cancer therapy. A multifunctional delivery vector that can effectively deliver CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 plasmid for &#946;&#8208;catenin knockout to reverse tumor immunosuppression is constructed. The multi&#8208;functionalized delivery vector is decorated with aptamer&#8208;conjugated hyaluronic acid and peptide&#8208;conjugated hyaluronic acid to combine the tumor cell/nuclear targeting function of AS1411 with the cell penetrating/nuclear translocation function of TAT&#8208;NLS. Due to the significantly enhanced plasmid enrichment in malignant cell nuclei, the genome editing system can induce effective &#946;&#8208;catenin knockout and suppress Wnt/&#946;&#8208;catenin pathway, resulting in notably downregulated proteins involved in tumor progression and immunosuppression. Programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) downregulation in edited tumor cells not only releases the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 brake to improve the cancer killing capability of CD8+ T cells, but also enhances antitumor immune responses of immune cells. This provides a facile strategy to reverse tumor immunosuppression and to restore immunosurveillance and activate anti&#8208;tumor immunity.

      <title>Ferromagnetic Liquid Metal Putty&#8208;Like Material with Transformed Shape and Reconfigurable Polarity</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel ferromagnetic liquid metal plasticine with unique reconfigurable magnetic polarity, stiffening effect, transformed shape, and high electrical conductivity is reported. This material can be used as a printable conductive ink for various applications in paper electronics, including magnetic switching, flexible erasable magnetic recording paper, and paper&#8208;based soft robotics using magnetic actuation.








It is remarkably desirable and challenging to design reconfigurable ferromagnetic materials with high electrical conductivity. This has attracted great attention due to promising applications in many fields such as emerging flexible electronics and soft robotics. However, the shape and magnetic polarity of existing ferromagnetic materials with low conductivity are both hard to be reconfigured, and the magnetization of insulative ferrofluids is easily lost once the external magnetic field is removed. A novel reconfigurable ferromagnetic liquid metal (LM) putty&#8208;like material (FM&#8208;LMP) with high electrical conductivity and transformed shape, which is prepared through homogenously mixing neodymium&#8211;iron&#8211;boron microparticles into the gallium&#8208;based LM matrix, and turning this liquid&#8208;like suspension into the solid&#8208;like putty&#8208;like material by magnetization, is reported to achieve this. The induction magnetic field of FM&#8208;LMP is mainly attributed to the magnetic alignment of the dispersed ferromagnetic microparticles, which can be conveniently demagnetized by mechanical disordering and reversibly reconfigured through microparticle realignment by applying a weak magnetic field. FM&#8208;LMP with a low fraction of microparticles can be used as printable conductive ink for paper electronics, which are further exploited for applications including magnetic switching, flexible erasable magnetic recording paper, and self&#8208;sensing paper&#8208;based soft robotics using magnetic actuation.

      <title>A Polymerization&#8208;Assisted Grain Growth Strategy for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
A polymerization&#8208;assisted grain growth strategy in the sequential deposition method of perovskite thin films is demonstrated by triggering a polymerization process during PbI2 film annealing. This strategy effectively passivates undercoordinated lead ions, reduces defect density, and boosts power conversion efficiency up to 23.0%, together with a prolonged lifetime.








Abstract
Intrinsically, detrimental defects accumulating at the surface and grain boundaries limit both the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. Small molecules and bulkier polymers with functional groups are utilized to passivate these ionic defects but usually suffer from volatility and precipitation issues, respectively. Here, starting from the addition of small monomers in the PbI2 precursor, a polymerization&#8208;assisted grain growth strategy is introduced in the sequential deposition method. With a polymerization process triggered during the PbI2 film annealing, the bulkier polymers formed will be adhered to the grain boundaries, retaining the previously established interactions with PbI2. After perovskite formation, the polymers anchored on the boundaries can effectively passivate undercoordinated lead ions and reduce the defect density. As a result, a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.0% is obtained, together with a prolonged lifetime where 85.7% and 91.8% of the initial PCE remain after 504 h continuous illumination and 2208 h shelf storage, respectively.

      <title>How To Quantify the Efficiency Potential of Neat Perovskite Films: Perovskite Semiconductors with an Implied Efficiency Exceeding 28%</title>
      <dc:description>
A method is introduced to experimentally measure the efficiency potential of any neat perovskite film on glass with/without attached transport layers using intensity&#8208;dependent photoluminescence measurements. This approach allows decoupling efficiency losses due to insufficient charge transport, bulk, interface, and surface recombination. These findings also shine light on the ideality factor in perovskite solar cells and thereby fill factor limitations.








Abstract
Perovskite photovoltaic (PV) cells have demonstrated power conversion efficiencies (PCE) that are close to those of monocrystalline silicon cells; however, in contrast to silicon PV, perovskites are not limited by Auger recombination under 1&#8208;sun illumination. Nevertheless, compared to GaAs and monocrystalline silicon PV, perovskite cells have significantly lower fill factors due to a combination of resistive and non&#8208;radiative recombination losses. This necessitates a deeper understanding of the underlying loss mechanisms and in particular the ideality factor of the cell. By measuring the intensity dependence of the external open&#8208;circuit voltage and the internal quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting (QFLS), the transport resistance&#8208;free efficiency of the complete cell as well as the efficiency potential of any neat perovskite film with or without attached transport layers are quantified. Moreover, intensity&#8208;dependent QFLS measurements on different perovskite compositions allows for disentangling of the impact of the interfaces and the perovskite surface on the non&#8208;radiative fill factor and open&#8208;circuit voltage loss. It is found that potassium&#8208;passivated triple cation perovskite films stand out by their exceptionally high implied PCEs &gt; 28%, which could be achieved with ideal transport layers. Finally, strategies are presented to reduce both the ideality factor and transport losses to push the efficiency to the thermodynamic limit.

By measuring the intensity dependence of the external open&#8208;circuit voltage and the internal quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting (QFLS), the transport resistance&#8208;free efficiency of the complete cell as well as the efficiency potential of any neat perovskite film with or without attached transport layers are quantified. Moreover, intensity&#8208;dependent QFLS measurements on different perovskite compositions allows for disentangling of the impact of the interfaces and the perovskite surface on the non&#8208;radiative fill factor and open&#8208;circuit voltage loss. It is found that potassium&#8208;passivated triple cation perovskite films stand out by their exceptionally high implied PCEs &amp;gt; 28%, which could be achieved with ideal transport layers. Finally, strategies are presented to reduce both the ideality factor and transport losses to push the efficiency to the thermodynamic limit.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Flexible Ceramic/Polymer Hybrid Solid Electrolyte for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A flexible ceramic/polymer hybrid solid electrolyte is designed and fabricated with (3&#8208;chloropropyl)trimethoxysilane as a bridge builder. Benefiting from the enhanced interfacial compatibility, the HSE shows high conductivity, good stability on air exposure, as well as high Li+ transference number. Meanwhile, it demonstrates stable plating/stripping cycles in a symmetric Li cell for more than 7000 h.








Abstract
Ceramic/polymer hybrid solid electrolytes (HSEs) have attracted worldwide attentions because they can overcome defects by combining the advantages of ceramic electrolytes (CEs) and solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). However, the interface compatibility of CEs and SPEs in HSE limits their full function to a great extent. Herein, a flexible ceramic/polymer HSE is prepared via in situ coupling reaction. Ceramic and polymer are closely combined by strong chemical bonds, thus the problem of interface compatibility is resolved and the ions can transport rapidly by an expressway. The as&#8208;prepared membrane demonstrates an ionic conductivity of 9.83 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at room temperature and a high Li+ transference numbers of 0.68. This in situ coupling reaction method provides an effective way to resolve the problem of interface compatibility.

      <title>Interfacial and Electronic Modulation via Localized Sulfurization for Boosting Lithium Storage Kinetics</title>
      <dc:description>
A 3D sulfurized Ti3C2Tx framework decorated with Fe3O4/FeS heterostructures is constructed through interfacial and electronic modulation to improve electrochemical reaction kinetics and boost Li storage performance, which can provide new insight into the structural design of anode materials with high performance and in&#8208;depth understanding of complex lithium intercalation and conversion reactions.








Abstract
Structural modulation endows electrochemical hybrids with promising energy storage properties owing to their adjustable interfacial and/or electronic characteristics. For MXene&#8208;based materials, however, the facile but effective strategies for tuning their structural properties at nanoscale are still lacking. Herein, 3D crumpled S&#8208;functionalized Ti3C2Tx substrate is rationally integrated with Fe3O4/FeS heterostructures via coprecipitation and subsequent partial sulfurization to induce a highly active and stable electrode architecture. The unique heterostructures with tuned electronic properties can induce improved kinetics and structural stability. The surface engineering by S terminations on the MXene further unlocks extra (pseudo)capacitive lithium storage. Serving as anode for lithium storage, the optimized electrode delivers an excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability (913.9 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1) and superior rate capability (490.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1). Moreover, the (de)lithiation pathways associated with energy storage mechanisms are further revealed by operando X&#8208;ray diffraction, in situ electroanalytical techniques, and first&#8208;principles calculations. The hybrid electrode is proved to undergo stepwise phase transformations during discharging but a relatively uniform reconversion during charging, suggesting an asymmetric conversion mechanism. This work provides a novel strategy for designing high&#8208;performance hybrids and paves the way for in&#8208;depth understanding of complex lithium intercalation and conversion reactions.

      <title>Engineered Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Protein Assemblies for Robust Bioimaging and Therapeutic Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
A new class of near&#8208;infrared fluorescent protein nanoassemblies is developed by genetic engineering. Stable and specific vivo tumor imaging is realized via simple exogenous injection of the robust protein nanomaterials. Hydrophobic anti&#8208;tumor antibiotic of thiostrepton can be efficiently loaded in the protein nanoaggregates and effective tumor therapy is achieved.








Abstract
Fluorescent proteins are investigated extensively as markers for the imaging of cells and tissues that are treated by gene transfection. However, limited transfection efficiency and lack of targeting restrict the clinical application of this method rooted in the challenging development of robust fluorescent proteins for in vivo bioimaging. To address this, a new type of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent protein assemblies manufactured by genetic engineering is presented. Due to the formation of well&#8208;defined nanoparticles and spectral operation within the phototherapeutic window, the NIR protein aggregates allow stable and specific tumor imaging via simple exogenous injection. Importantly, in vivo tumor metastases are tracked and this overcomes the limitations of in vivo imaging that can only be implemented relying on the gene transfection of fluorescent proteins. Concomitantly, the efficient loading of hydrophobic drugs into the protein nanoparticles is demonstrated facilitating the therapy of tumors in a mouse model. It is believed that these theranostic NIR fluorescent protein assemblies, hence, show great potential for the in vivo detection and therapy of cancer.

      <title>Blueprinting Photothermal Shape&#8208;Morphing of Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
      <dc:description>
Light&#8208;driven shape&#8208;morphing via spatially patterned photothermal deformation of liquid crystal elastomers is demonstrated. Distinct from shape prescription via modulation of the director orientation, a general method for patterning deformation profiles in monodomain elastomers with a unidirectional director field is presented. A model for prescribing Gaussian curvature via continuous deformation profiles is presented and validated with experiments and finite element analysis.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are an attractive platform for dynamic shape&#8208;morphing due to their ability to rapidly undergo large deformations. While recent work has focused on patterning the director orientation field to achieve desired target shapes, this strategy cannot be generalized to material systems where high&#8208;resolution surface alignment is impractical. Instead of programming the local orientation of anisotropic deformation, an alternative strategy for prescribed shape&#8208;morphing by programming the magnitude of stretch ratio in a thin LCE sheet with constant director orientation is developed here. By spatially patterning the concentration of gold nanoparticles, uniform illumination leads to gradients in photothermal heat generation and therefore spatially nonuniform deformation profiles that drive out&#8208;of&#8208;plane buckling of planar films into predictable 3D shapes. Experimentally realized shapes are shown to agree closely with both finite element simulations and geometric predictions for systems with unidirectional variation in deformation magnitude. Finally, the possibility to achieve complex oscillatory motion driven by uniform illumination of a free&#8208;standing patterned sheet is demonstrated.

      <title>Fluoro&#8208;Photoacoustic Polymeric Renal Reporter for Real&#8208;Time Dual Imaging of Acute Kidney Injury</title>
      <dc:description>
A fluoro&#8208;photoacoustic polymeric renal reporter is developed for real&#8208;time dual imaging of acute kidney injury (AKI). With its high renal clearance and biomarker&#8208;activatable near&#8208;infrared fluorescence and photoacoustic signals, detection of the onset of AKI 48 h earlier than clinical diagnostic methods is possible.








Abstract
Photoacoustic (PA) imaging agents detect disease tissues and biomarkers with increased penetration depth and enhanced spatial resolution relative to traditional optical imaging, and thus hold great promise for clinical applications. However, existing PA imaging agents often encounter the issues of slow body excretion and low&#8208;signal specificity, which compromise their capability for in vivo detection. Herein, a fluoro&#8208;photoacoustic polymeric renal reporter (FPRR) is synthesized for real&#8208;time imaging of drug&#8208;induced acute kidney injury (AKI). FPRR simultaneously turns on both near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and PA signals in response to an AKI biomarker (&#947;&#8208;glutamyl transferase) with high sensitivity and specificity. In association with its high renal clearance efficiency (78% at 24 h post&#8208;injection), FPRR can detect cisplatin&#8208;induced AKI at 24 h post&#8208;drug treatment through both real&#8208;time imaging and optical urinalysis, which is 48 h earlier than serum biomarker elevation and histological changes. More importantly, the deep&#8208;tissue penetration capability of PA imaging results in a signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio that is 2.3&#8208;fold higher than NIRF imaging. Thus, the study not only demonstrates the first activatable PA probe for real&#8208;time sensitive imaging of kidney function at molecular level, but also highlights the polymeric probe structure with high renal clearance.

Herein, a fluoro&#8208;photoacoustic polymeric renal reporter (FPRR) is synthesized for real&#8208;time imaging of drug&#8208;induced acute kidney injury (AKI). FPRR simultaneously turns on both near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and PA signals in response to an AKI biomarker (&#947;&#8208;glutamyl transferase) with high sensitivity and specificity. In association with its high renal clearance efficiency (78% at 24 h post&#8208;injection), FPRR can detect cisplatin&#8208;induced AKI at 24 h post&#8208;drug treatment through both real&#8208;time imaging and optical urinalysis, which is 48 h earlier than serum biomarker elevation and histological changes. More importantly, the deep&#8208;tissue penetration capability of PA imaging results in a signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio that is 2.3&#8208;fold higher than NIRF imaging. Thus, the study not only demonstrates the first activatable PA probe for real&#8208;time sensitive imaging of kidney function at molecular level, but also highlights the polymeric probe structure with high renal clearance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stabilizing Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes by Incorporation of Binary Alkali Cations</title>
      <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with comparable operation stability to NIR organic LEDs are demonstrated by incorporation of binary alkali cations. Surface&#8208;distributed Rb+ and bulk&#8208;distributed Cs+ effectively reduce nonradiative recombination and block I&#8722; migration pathways, leading to a record external quantum efficiency of 15.84% in alkali&#8208;cation&#8208;incorporated FAPbI3&#8208;based PeLEDs and a half&#8208;lifetime over 3600 min.








Abstract
The poor stability of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is a key bottleneck that hinders commercialization of this technology. Here, the degradation process of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3)&#8208;based PeLEDs is carefully investigated and the device stability is improved through binary&#8208;alkalication incorporation. Using time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry, it is found that the degradation of FAPbI3&#8208;based PeLEDs during operation is directly associated with ion migration, and incorporation of binary alkali cations, i.e., Cs+ and Rb+, in FAPbI3 can suppress ion migration and significantly enhance the lifetime of PeLEDs. Combining experimental and theoretical approaches, it is further revealed that Cs+ and Rb+ ions stabilize the perovskite films by locating at different lattice positions, with Cs+ ions present relatively uniformly throughout the bulk perovskite, while Rb+ ions are found preferentially on the surface and grain boundaries. Further chemical bonding analysis shows that both Cs+ and Rb+ ions raise the net atomic charge of the surrounding I anions, leading to stronger Coulomb interactions between the cations and the inorganic framework. As a result, the Cs+&#8211;Rb+&#8208;incorporated PeLEDs exhibit an external quantum efficiency of 15.84%, the highest among alkali cation&#8208;incorporated FAPbI3 devices. More importantly, the PeLEDs show significantly enhanced operation stability, achieving a half&#8208;lifetime over 3600 min.

      <title>A Scalable Nickel&#8211;Cellulose Hybrid Metamaterial with Broadband Light Absorption for Efficient Solar Distillation</title>
      <dc:description>
A nonresonant and broadband hybrid metamaterial is obtained by confining and separating Ni nanoparticles in natural cellulose fibers. The hybrid metamaterial delivers high solar&#8208;to&#8208;water efficiencies from 47.9% to 65.8% for the solar purification of seawater and sewage. The low cost and high scalability of the metamaterial makes it promising for large&#8208;scale solar energy harvesting.








Abstract
Sophisticated metastructures are usually required to broaden the inherently narrowband plasmonic absorption of light for applications such as solar desalination, photodetection, and thermoelectrics. Here, nonresonant nickel nanoparticles (diameters &lt; 20 nm) are embedded into cellulose microfibers via a nanoconfinement effect, producing an intrinsically broadband metamaterial with 97.1% solar&#8208;weighted absorption. Interband transitions rather than plasmonic resonance dominate the optical absorption throughout the solar spectrum due to a high density of electronic states near the Fermi level of nickel. Field solar purification of sewage and seawater based on the metamaterial demonstrates high solar&#8208;to&#8208;water efficiencies of 47.9&#8211;65.8%. More importantly, the solution&#8208;processed metamaterial is mass&#8208;producible (1.8 &#215; 0.3 m2), low&#8208;cost, flexible, and durable (even effective after 7 h boiling in water), which are critical to the commercialization of portable solar&#8208;desalination and domestic&#8208;water&#8208;purification devices. This work also broadens material choices beyond plasmonic metals for the light absorption in photothermal and photocatalytic applications.

      <title>A Multifunctional Electronic Skin Empowered with Damage Mapping and Autonomic Acceleration of Self&#8208;Healing in Designated Locations</title>
      <dc:description>
New material and electronic design strategies are used for obtaining a multilayered electronic skin with advanced multifunctional features. The electronic skin exhibits damage mapping and autonomic acceleration of self&#8208;healing in designated locations as well as highly&#8208;sensitive physical and chemical sensing capabilities.








Abstract
Integrating self&#8208;healing capabilities into soft electronic devices and sensors is important for increasing their reliability, longevity, and sustainability. Although some advances in self&#8208;healing soft electronics have been made, many challenges have been hindering their integration in digital electronics and their use in real&#8208;world conditions. Herein, an electronic skin (e&#8208;skin) with high sensing performance toward temperature, pressure, and pH levels&#8212;both at ambient and/or in underwater conditions is reported. The e&#8208;skin is empowered with a novel self&#8208;repair capability that consists of an intrinsic mechanism for efficient self&#8208;healing of small&#8208;scale damages as well as an extrinsic mechanism for damage mapping and on&#8208;demand self&#8208;healing of big&#8208;scale damages in designated locations. The overall design is based on a multilayered structure that integrates a neuron&#8208;like nanostructured network for self&#8208;monitoring and damage detection and an array of electrical heaters for selective self&#8208;repair. This system has significantly enhanced self&#8208;healing capabilities; for example, it can decrease the healing time of microscratches from 24 h to 30 s. The electronic platform lays down the foundation for the development of a new subcategory of self&#8208;healing devices in which electronic circuit design is used for self&#8208;monitoring, healing, and restoring proper device function.

      <title>Pitch&#8208;Derived Soft Carbon as Stable Anode Material for Potassium Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
The cycling stability of anode materials in potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) is challenged by the large size of K+ itself. The findings not only demonstrate the promising potential of soft carbon as a category suitable for high&#8208;performance KIB electrodes, but also provide insights into the complicated K+ storage mechanisms in carbon anodes of KIBs.








Abstract
Potassium ion batteries (KIBs) have emerged as a promising energy storage system, but the stability and high rate capability of their electrode materials, particularly carbon as the most investigated anode ones, become a primary challenge. Here, it is identified that pitch&#8208;derived soft carbon, a nongraphitic carbonaceous species which is paid less attention in the battery field, holds special advantage in KIB anodes. The structural flexibility of soft carbon makes it convenient to tune its crystallization degree, thereby modulating the storage behavior of large&#8208;sized K+ in the turbostratic carbon lattices to satisfy the need in structural resilience, low&#8208;voltage feature, and high transportation kinetics. It is confirmed that a simple thermal control can produce structurally optimized soft carbon that has much better battery performance than its widely reported carbon counterparts such as graphite and hard carbon. The findings highlight the potential of soft carbon as an interesting category suitable for high&#8208;performance KIB electrode and provide insights for understanding the complicated K+ storage mechanisms in KIBs.

      <title>Illuminating Diverse Concomitant DNA Logic Gates and Concatenated Circuits with Hairpin DNA&#8208;Templated Silver Nanoclusters as Universal Dual&#8208;Output Generators</title>

A novel type of hairpin DNA&#8208;templated silver nanoclusters with two fluorescence peaks is administrated as universal dual&#8208;output generators to fabricate diverse concomitant contrary logic gates and extended concatenated logic circuits (e.g., 3&#8208;bit even^odd parity checkers). Distinguished from previous ones, this noncovalent design exhibits obvious simplicity and unique concomitant feature, and provides a toolbox of cost&#8208;effective logic gates.








Abstract
Exquisite administration of a new type of hairpin DNA&#8208;templated silver nanoclusters (H&#8208;AgNCs) as universal dual&#8208;output generators in DNA&#8208;based logic systems is reported. Diverse concomitant contrary logic gates (CCLGs) with opposite functions (YES^NOT, OR^NOR, INHIBIT^IMPLICATION, XOR^XNOR, and MAJORITY^MINORITY) and extended concatenated logic circuits are presented and some of them perform specific functions, such as parity generators and checkers. The introduction of H&#8208;AgNCs as noncovalent signal reporters avoids tedious and high&#8208;cost labeling procedures. Of note, the concomitant feature of CCLGs attributed to the dual&#8208;emitter AgNCs conduces to reducing the time and cost to devise multiple logic gates. As compared to previous ones, this design eliminates numerous substances (e.g., organic dyes) and unstable components (hydrogen peroxide), which not only decreases the complexity of logic performs and improves repeatability of operation, but also makes it convenient to connect distinct DNA&#8208;based logic gates. It is worthy to anticipate that the cost&#8208;effective strategy will inspire researchers to develop much more complex logic systems and contribute to the field of molecular computing.

      <title>Controllable Growth of High&#8208;Quality Inorganic Perovskite Microplate Arrays for Functional Optoelectronics</title>
      <dc:description>
A facile strategy for a vapor&#8208;phase patterning inorganic perovskite single crystal array is demonstrated to fabricate high&#8208;performance micro&#8208;optoelectronic devices. This strategy allows growth of high&#8208;quality inorganic perovskite single crystals with controllable size and location. It provides new opportunities to explore the inorganic perovskite single&#8208;crystal array for various integrated optoelectronics applications.








Abstract
Inorganic perovskite single crystals have emerged as promising vapor&#8208;phase processable structures for optoelectronic devices. However, because of material lattice mismatch and uncontrolled nucleation, vapor&#8208;phase methods have been restricted to random distribution of single crystals that are difficult to perform for integrated device arrays. Herein, an effective strategy to control the vapor&#8208;phase growth of high&#8208;quality cesium lead bromide perovskite (CsPbBr3) microplate arrays with uniform morphology as well as controlled location and size is reported. By introducing perovskite seeds on substrates, intractable lattice mismatches and random nucleation barriers are surpassed, and the epitaxial growth of perovskite crystals is accurately controlled. It is further demonstrated that CsPbBr3 microplate arrays can be monolithically integrated on substrates for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance lasers and photodetectors. This strategy provides a facile approach to fabricate high&#8208;quality CsPbBr3 microplates with controllable size and location, which offers new opportunities for the scalable production of integrated optoelectronic devices.

      <title>Optimization of the Pore Structures of MOFs for Record High Hydrogen Volumetric Working Capacity</title>
      <dc:description>
Two empirical equations to predict hydrogen storage capacity are rationalized for cage&#8208;type and channel&#8208;type metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with superior prediction accuracy than the established equation. Guided by these new equations, a cage&#8208;type Zr&#8208;MOF NPF&#8208;200 (NPF: Nebraska Porous Framework) is evaluated and found to possess record high volumetric working capacity (37.2 g L&#8722;1) between 100 and 5 bar at 77 K.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for onboard hydrogen storage thanks to the tunable pore size, pore volume, and pore geometry. In consideration of pore structures, the correlation between the pore volume and hydrogen storage capacity is examined and two empirical equations are rationalized to predict the hydrogen storage capacity of MOFs with different pore geometries. The total hydrogen adsorption under 100 bar and 77 K is predicted as ntot= 0.085&#215; Vp &#8722; 0.013&#215; Vp2 for cage&#8208;type MOFs and ntot= 0.076&#215; Vp &#8722; 0.011&#215; Vp2 for channel&#8208;type MOFs, where Vp is the pore volume of corresponding MOFs. The predictions by these empirical equations are validated by several MOFs with an average deviation of 5.4%. Compared with a previous equation for activated carbon materials, the empirical equations demonstrate superior accuracy especially for MOFs with high surface area (i.e., SBET over &#8776;3000 m2 g&#8722;1). Guided by these empirical equations, a highly porous Zr&#8208;MOF NPF&#8208;200 (NPF: Nebraska Porous Framework) is examined to possess outstanding hydrogen total adsorption capacity (65.7 mmol g&#8722;1) at 77 K and record high volumetric working capacity of 37.2 g L&#8722;1 between 100 and 5 bar at 77 K.

      <title>2D MXene&#8211;TiO2 Core&#8211;Shell Nanosheets as a Data&#8208;Storage Medium in Memory Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
The deterministically controlled oxidation of multilayer Ti3C2Tx MXene and the application of MXene&#8211;TiO2 core&#8211;shell nanosheets as a data&#8208;storage medium in memory devices are demostrated. The optimized MXene nano&#8208;floating&#8208;gate transistor memory exhibits excellent nonvolatile memory characteristics and synaptic functions.








Abstract
MXenes, an emerging class of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides with the general formula Mn+1XnTx (n = 1&#8211;4), have potential for application as floating gates in memory devices because of their intrinsic properties of a 2D structure, high density&#8208;of&#8208;states, and high work function. In this study, a series of MXene&#8211;TiO2 core&#8211;shell nanosheets are synthesized by deterministic control of the surface oxidation of MXene. The floating gate (multilayer MXene) and tunneling layer (TiO2) in a nano&#8208;floating&#8208;gate transistor memory (NFGTM) device are prepared simultaneously by a facile, low&#8208;cost, and water&#8208;based process. The memory performance is optimized via adjustment of the thickness of the oxidation layer formed on the MXene surface. The fabricated MXene NFGTMs exhibit excellent nonvolatile memory characteristics, including a large memory window (&gt;35.2 V), high programming/erasing current ratio (&#8776;106), low off&#8208;current (&lt;1 pA), long retention (&gt;104 s), and cyclic endurance (300 cycles). Furthermore, synaptic functions, including the excitatory postsynaptic current/inhibitory postsynaptic current, paired&#8208;pulse facilitation, and synaptic plasticity (long&#8208;term potentiation/depression), are successfully emulated using the MXene NFGTMs. The successful control of MXene oxidation and its application to NFGTMs are expected to inspire the application of MXene as a data&#8208;storage medium in future memory devices.

      <title>Wavelength&#8208;Tunable Mid&#8208;Infrared Lasing from Black Phosphorus Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>
A vertical surface&#8208;emitting wavelength&#8208;tunable mid&#8208;infrared lasing is achieved from black phosphorus nanosheets embedded in distributed Bragg reflector microcavities.








Abstract
Van der Waals layered semiconductor materials own unique physical properties and have attracted intense interest in developing high&#8208;performance electronic and photonic devices. Among them, black phosphorus (BP) is distinct for its layer number&#8208;tuned direct band gap which spans from near&#8208; to mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) waveband. In addition, the puckered honey comb crystal lattice endows the material with highly linear&#8208;polarized emission and marked anisotropy in carrier transportation. These unique material properties render BP as an intriguing and promising building block for constructing mid&#8208;infrared&#8208;ranged coherent light sources. Here, a room temperature surface&#8208;emitting MIR laser based on single crystalline BP nanosheets coupled with a distributed Bragg reflector cavity is reported. MIR stimulated emission at 3611 nm is achieved with a near&#8208;unity linear polarization, which exhibits robust thermal stability up to 360 K. Most importantly, the lasing wavelength can be tuned from 3425 to 4068 nm by varying the cavity length via thickness control of BP layer. The demonstrated highly polarized lasing output and wavelength&#8208;tunable capacity of the proposed device scheme in MIR spectral range opens up promising opportunities for a broad array of applications in polarization&#8208;resolved IR imaging, range&#8208;finding, and free space quantum communications.

     alt="Wavelength&#8208;Tunable Mid&#8208;Infrared Lasing from Black Phosphorus Nanosheets"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vertical surface&#8208;emitting wavelength&#8208;tunable mid&#8208;infrared lasing is achieved from black phosphorus nanosheets embedded in distributed Bragg reflector microcavities.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van der Waals layered semiconductor materials own unique physical properties and have attracted intense interest in developing high&#8208;performance electronic and photonic devices. Among them, black phosphorus (BP) is distinct for its layer number&#8208;tuned direct band gap which spans from near&#8208; to mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) waveband. In addition, the puckered honey comb crystal lattice endows the material with highly linear&#8208;polarized emission and marked anisotropy in carrier transportation. These unique material properties render BP as an intriguing and promising building block for constructing mid&#8208;infrared&#8208;ranged coherent light sources. Here, a room temperature surface&#8208;emitting MIR laser based on single crystalline BP nanosheets coupled with a distributed Bragg reflector cavity is reported. MIR stimulated emission at 3611 nm is achieved with a near&#8208;unity linear polarization, which exhibits robust thermal stability up to 360 K. Most importantly, the lasing wavelength can be tuned from 3425 to 4068 nm by varying the cavity length via thickness control of BP layer. The demonstrated highly polarized lasing output and wavelength&#8208;tunable capacity of the proposed device scheme in MIR spectral range opens up promising opportunities for a broad array of applications in polarization&#8208;resolved IR imaging, range&#8208;finding, and free space quantum communications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Chemically Orthogonal Hole Transport Layer for Efficient Colloidal Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
A chemically orthogonal hole transport layer for lead sulfide colloidal quantum dot (CQD) solar cells is introduced. By substituting the 1,2&#8208;ethanedithiol&#8208;treated CQDs with malonic&#8208;acid&#8208;treated CQDs, the surface chemistry of the active layer is preserved. This increases the charge diffusion length by 1.4&#215;, enabling near&#8208;unity charge extraction efficiency at the back electrode, achieving 13.0% efficiency.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are of interest in light of their solution&#8208;processing and bandgap tuning. Advances in the performance of CQD optoelectronic devices require fine control over the properties of each layer in the device materials stack. This is particularly challenging in the present best CQD solar cells, since these employ a p&#8208;type hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL) implemented using 1,2&#8208;ethanedithiol (EDT) ligand exchange on top of the CQD active layer. It is established that the high reactivity of EDT causes a severe chemical modification to the active layer that deteriorates charge extraction. By combining elemental mapping with the spatial charge collection efficiency in CQD solar cells, the key materials interface dominating the subpar performance of prior CQD PV devices is demonstrated. This motivates to develop a chemically orthogonal HTL that consists of malonic&#8208;acid&#8208;crosslinked CQDs. The new crosslinking strategy preserves the surface chemistry of the active layer beneath, and at the same time provides the needed efficient charge extraction. The new HTL enables a 1.4&#215; increase in charge carrier diffusion length in the active layer; and as a result leads to an improvement in power conversion efficiency to 13.0% compared to EDT standard cells (12.2%).

      <title>Deep Red Emissive Carbonized Polymer Dots with Unprecedented Narrow Full Width at Half Maximum</title>
      <dc:description>
Deep red emissive carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) with unprecedented full width at half maximum around 20 nm possess recorded quantum yield of 59% and 31% under 413 and 660 nm. These CPDs have unique polymer characteristics, consist of carbon cores and the shells of polymer chains, and are successfully used as a fluorescent probe for one&#8208;photon and two&#8208;photon bioimaging.








Abstract
Development of high&#8208;performance carbon dots (CDs) with emission wavelength longer than 660&#8239;nm (deep red emission) is critical in deep&#8208;tissue bioimaging, yet it is still a major challenge to obtain CDs with both narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) and high deep red/near&#8208;infrared emission yield. Here, deep red emissive carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) with unprecedented FWHM of 20 nm are synthesized. The purified CPDs in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution possess quantum yield (QY) as high as 59% under 413 nm excitation, as well as recorded QY of 31% under 660 nm excitation in the deep red fluorescent window. Detailed characterizations identify that CPDs have unique polymer characteristics, consisting of carbon cores and the shells of polymer chains, and &#960; conjugated system formed with N heterocycles and aromatic rings governs the single photoluminescence (PL) center, which is responsible for high QY in deep red emissive CPDs with narrow FWHM. The CPDs exhibit strong absorption and emission in the deep red light region, low toxicity, and good biocompatibility, making them an efficient probe for both one&#8208;photon and two&#8208;photon bioimaging. CPDs are rapidly excreted via the kidney system and hepatobiliary system.

      <title>A Blue Photosensitizer Realizing Efficient and Stable Green Solar Cells via Color Tuning by the Electrolyte</title>
      <dc:description>
A new green semitransparent dye&#8208;sensitized solar cell (DSC) is realized by combining a blue photosensitizer with an orange electrolyte layer, which differs from the traditional method of employing a green dye. The new green DSC has superior power conversion efficiency and durability compared to conventional green zinc porphyrin sensitizers.








Abstract
Semitransparent dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are appealing as aesthetically pleasing and colorful see&#8208;through photovoltaics. Green semitransparent DSCs have been presented, but the best ones rely on green zinc porphyrin photosensitizers and high volatile electrolytes. For potential outdoor applications, the zinc porphyrin DSCs employing ionic liquid electrolytes merely reached a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.3% even with opaque mesoporous TiO2 films. Herein, the new green DSC is realized by using a blue organic photosensitizer in conjunction with an orange ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;based electrolyte, presenting a simple and an effective path for color tuning of photovoltaics. The new approach allows for broadly modulating the color from spring green to cyan by tuning the contributions of the light absorption by the dye&#8208;sensitized TiO2 film and the electrolyte layer. The new semitransparent DSCs with spring green to cyan colors have PCEs ranging from 6.7% to 8.1% and show stability for 1000 h under accelerated ageing test at 80 &#176;C, superior to the zinc porphyrin DSCs. The findings pave a new way to achieve efficient and stable colorful solar cells.

      <title>Interfacial Engineering of MoO2&#8208;FeP Heterojunction for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Coupled with Biomass Electrooxidation</title>
      <dc:description>
A porous MoO2&#8208;FeP@C nanospindle is proposed as a robust bifunctional electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and biomass electrooxidation reaction. The MoO2&#8208;FeP@C not only exhibits excellent HER activity, but also catalyzes the electrooxidation of biomass into value&#8208;added products. The electrolyzer assembled by MoO2&#8208;FeP@C for cathodic H2 and anodic 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid production requires a low voltage of 1.486 V at 10 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Simultaneous highly efficient production of hydrogen and conversion of biomass into value&#8208;added products is meaningful but challenging. Herein, a porous nanospindle composed of carbon&#8208;encapsulated MoO2&#8208;FeP heterojunction (MoO2&#8208;FeP@C) is proposed as a robust bifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and biomass electrooxidation reaction (BEOR). X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis and theoretical calculations confirm the electron transfer from MoO2 to FeP at the interfaces, where electron accumulation on FeP favors the optimization of H2O and H* absorption energies for HER, whereas hole accumulation on MoO2 is responsible for improving the BEOR activity. Thanks to its interfacial electronic structure, MoO2&#8208;FeP@C exhibits excellent HER activity with an overpotential of 103 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 48 mV dec&#8722;1. Meanwhile, when 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural is chosen as the biomass for BEOR, the conversion is almost 100%, and 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is obtained with the selectivity of 98.6%. The electrolyzer employing MoO2&#8208;FeP@C for cathodic H2 and anodic FDCA production requires only a low voltage of 1.486 V at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and can be powered by a solar cell (output voltage: 1.45 V). Additionally, other BEORs coupled with HER catalyzed by MoO2&#8208;FeP@C also have excellent catalytic performance, implying their good versatility.

The electrolyzer employing MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;FeP@C for cathodic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and anodic FDCA production requires only a low voltage of 1.486 V at 10 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and can be powered by a solar cell (output voltage: 1.45 V). Additionally, other BEORs coupled with HER catalyzed by MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;FeP@C also have excellent catalytic performance, implying their good versatility.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effective Separation of CO2 Using Metal&#8208;Incorporated rGO Membranes</title>
      <dc:description>
Membranes of reduced graphene oxide with interlaced transition metal ions offer effective separation of CO2 from N2 due to higher adsorption of N2 gas molecules within the Fe&#8208;interacted nanochannels. Depending on the value of applied gas pressure, both Maxwell&#8211;Stefan and Knudsen diffusion contribute to the gas permeation process for these membranes.








Abstract
Graphene&#8208;based materials, primarily graphene oxide (GO), have shown excellent separation and purification characteristics. Precise molecular sieving is potentially possible using graphene oxide&#8208;based membranes, if the porosity can be matched with the kinetic diameters of the gas molecules, which is possible via the tuning of graphene oxide interlayer spacing to take advantage of gas species interactions with graphene oxide channels. Here, highly effective separation of gases from their mixtures by using uniquely tailored porosity in mildly reduced graphene oxide (rGO) based membranes is reported. The gas permeation experiments, adsorption measurement, and density functional theory calculations show that this membrane preparation method allows tuning the selectivity for targeted molecules via the intercalation of specific transition metal ions. In particular, rGO membranes intercalated with Fe ions that offer ordered porosity, show excellent reproducible N2/CO2 selectivity of &#8776;97 at 110 mbar, which is an unprecedented value for graphene&#8208;based membranes. By exploring the impact of Fe intercalated rGO membranes, it is revealed that the increasing transmembrane pressure leads to a transition of N2 diffusion mode from Maxwell&#8211;Stefan type to Knudsen type. This study will lead to new avenues for the applications of graphene for efficiently separating CO2 from N2 and other gases.

      <title>Copper&#8208;Enriched Prussian Blue Nanomedicine for In Situ Disulfiram Toxification and Photothermal Antitumor Amplification</title>
      <dc:description>
This work provides an intriguing paradigm of in situ conversion of disulfiram into an effective anticarcinogen combined with therapeutic efficacy amplification for tumor eradication and excellent biosafety, which is also expected to contribute to the future design of novel in situ&#8208;activated and external&#8208;stimulus&#8208;augmented therapeutic nanoplatforms.








Abstract
In situ toxification of less toxic substance for the generation of effective anticarcinogens at the specific tumor tissue has been a novel paradigm for combating cancer. Significant efforts have been recently dedicated to turning clinical&#8208;approved drugs into anticancer agents in specific tumor microenvironment by chemical reactions. Herein, a hollow mesoporous Prussian blue (HMPB)&#8208;based therapeutic nanoplatform, denoted as DSF@PVP/Cu&#8208;HMPB, is constructed by encapsulating alcohol&#8208;abuse drug disulfiram (DSF) into the copper&#8208;enriched and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)&#8208;decorated HMPB nanoparticles to achieve in situ chemical reaction&#8208;activated and hyperthermia&#8208;amplified chemotherapy of DSF. Upon tumor accumulation of DSF@PVP/Cu&#8208;HMPB, the endogenous mild acidity in tumor condition triggers the biodegradation of the HMPB nanoparticle and the concurrent co&#8208;releases of DSF and Cu2+, thus forming cytotoxic bis(N,N&#8208;diethyl dithiocarbamato)copper(II) complexes (CuL2) via DSF&#8208;Cu2+ chelating reaction. Moreover, by the intrinsic photothermal&#8208;conversion effect of PVP/Cu&#8208;HMPBs, the anticancer effect of DSF is augmented by the hyperthermia generated upon near&#8208;infrared irradiation, thus inducing remarkable cell apoptosis in vitro and tumor elimination in vivo on both subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor&#8208;bearing models. This strategy of in situ drug transition by chemical chelation reaction and photothermal&#8208;augmentation provides a promising paradigm for designing novel cancer&#8208;therapeutic nanoplatforms.

      <title>A Multi&#8208;Bioinspired Dual&#8208;Gradient Electrode for Microbubble Manipulation toward Controllable Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;bioinspired electrode derived from the water spider, cacti spines, and the lotus leaf is designed for spontaneous and dual&#8208;directional bubble transport during water splitting. This Janus asymmetric electrode provides a possible solution to the key problem of separation of the gas products via self&#8208;propelling fluid transport.








Abstract
Clean energy generated from total water splitting is expected to be an affordable, sustainable, and reliable resource but it remains a challenge to gain pure fuel with a controllable pathway. Here, a simple and economical strategy that enables in situ separation of H2/O2 product by manipulating the generated gas phases with the aid of multi&#8208;bioinspired electrodes is proposed. This versatile electrode is based on a Janus asymmetric foam with dual gradients, i.e., the wettability gradient promotes the one&#8208;way gas penetration and the geometry gradient boosts the spontaneous on&#8208;surface transport in the horizontal direction, which cooperatively facilitates self&#8208;driven 3D bubble transport in an aqueous environment. Benefitting from the 3D bionic electrode, the limited distance between the cathode and the anode can be reduced to 1 mm, and the corresponding current density is enhanced 1.5 times as compared with the common condition. This Janus triangular electrode with dual directionality elucidates 3D smart bubble manipulation during overall water splitting and should offer a great opportunity to develop advanced electrochemical processes toward complicated environments such as confined space and zero gravity.

      <title>Flexible Interface Design for Stress Regulation of a Silicon Anode toward Highly Stable Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A flexible interface design to regulate stress is demonstrated via constructing a silicon anode on an elastic fabric with a conductive buffer layer. A novel silicon&#8211;graphite dual&#8208;ion battery concept is established via combining the flexible silicon anode with an expanded graphite cathode, which exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with a capacity retention of 97% over 2000 cycles at 10 C.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) have attracted increasing attention due to their high working voltage, low cost, and environmental friendliness, yet their development is hindered by their limited energy density. Pairing silicon&#8212;a most promising anode due to its highest theoretical capacity (4200 mAh g&#8722;1)&#8212;with a graphite cathode is a feasible strategy to address the challenge. Nevertheless, the cycling stability of silicon is unsatisfactory due to the loss of electrical contact resulting from the high interface stress when using rigid current collectors. In this work, a flexible interface design to regulate the stress distribution is proposed, via the construction of a silicon anode on a soft nylon fabric modified with a conductive Cu&#8211;Ni transition layer, which endows the silicon electrode with remarkable flexibility and stability over 50 000 bends. Assembly of the flexible silicon anode with an expanded graphite cathode yields a silicon&#8211;graphite DIB (SGDIB), which possesses record&#8208;breaking rate performance (up to 150 C) and cycling stability over 2000 cycles at 10 C with a capacity retention of 97%. Moreover, the SGDIB shows a high capacity retention of &#8776;84% after 1500 bends and a low self&#8208;discharging voltage loss of 0.0015% per bend after 10 000 bends, suggesting high potential for high&#8208;performance flexible energy&#8208;storage applications.

      <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Graphene for Electrothermally Controlled, Mechanically Guided, 3D Assembly and Human&#8211;Soft Actuators Interaction</title>
      <dc:description>
The design, fabrication, and modeling of laser&#8208;induced graphene&#8208;based soft electrothermal actuators are reported and their applications in mechanically guided 3D assembly are explored. With the guidance of finite element analysis, over 20 3D architectures are fabricated, including structures that can reshape among three distinct geometries. Furthermore, their applications in human&#8211;soft actuators interaction, artificial muscles, and biomimetic frog tongues are demonstrated.








Abstract
Mechanically guided, 3D assembly has attracted broad interests, owing to its compatibility with planar fabrication techniques and applicability to a diversity of geometries and length scales.

&lt;p&gt;The design, fabrication, and modeling of laser&#8208;induced graphene&#8208;based soft electrothermal actuators are reported and their applications in mechanically guided 3D assembly are explored. With the guidance of finite element analysis, over 20 3D architectures are fabricated, including structures that can reshape among three distinct geometries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanically guided, 3D assembly has attracted broad interests, owing to its compatibility with planar fabrication techniques and applicability to a diversity of geometries and length scales. Its further development requires the capability of on&#8208;demand reversible shape reconfigurations, desirable for many emerging applications (e.g., responsive metamaterials, soft robotics). Here, the design, fabrication, and modeling of soft electrothermal actuators based on laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG) are reported and their applications in mechanically guided 3D assembly and human&#8211;soft actuators interaction are explored. Over 20 complex 3D architectures are fabricated, including reconfigurable structures that can reshape among three distinct geometries.

      <title>Soft, Implantable Bioelectronic Interfaces for Translational Research</title>
      <dc:description>
Four synergistic steps of design, fabrication, and biomimetic in vitro validation and in vivo evaluation in translational animal models are proposed to advance soft implantable bioelectronics toward use in translational research. A biomimetic multimodal platform combines anatomy, mechanical loading, and electrochemical function to accelerate in vitro optimization of soft microtechnology.








Abstract
The convergence of materials science, electronics, and biology, namely bioelectronic interfaces, leads novel and precise communication with biological tissue, particularly with the nervous system. However, the translation of lab&#8208;based innovation toward clinical use calls for further advances in materials, manufacturing and characterization paradigms, and design rules. Herein, a translational framework engineered to accelerate the deployment of microfabricated interfaces for translational research is proposed and applied to the soft neurotechnology called electronic dura mater, e&#8208;dura. Anatomy, implant function, and surgical procedure guide the system design. A high&#8208;yield, silicone&#8208;on&#8208;silicon wafer process is developed to ensure reproducible characteristics of the electrodes. A biomimetic multimodal platform that replicates surgical insertion in an anatomy&#8208;based model applies physiological movement, emulates therapeutic use of the electrodes, and enables advanced validation and rapid optimization in vitro of the implants. Functionality of scaled e&#8208;dura is confirmed in nonhuman primates, where epidural neuromodulation of the spinal cord activates selective groups of muscles in the upper limbs with unmet precision. Performance stability is controlled over 6 weeks in vivo. The synergistic steps of design, fabrication, and biomimetic in vitro validation and in vivo evaluation in translational animal models are of general applicability and answer needs in multiple bioelectronic designs and medical technologies.

      <title>Sulfur Loading and Speciation Control the Hydrophobicity, Electron Transfer, Reactivity, and Selectivity of Sulfidized Nanoscale Zerovalent Iron</title>
      <dc:description>
The amount and speciation of sulfur incorporated into the crystalline structure of nano&#8208;Fe&#176; controls the materials' hydrophobicity, electron transfer resistance, and adsorbed H, and the rate of reaction with trichloroethylene and water. This work can guide the rational design of robust sulfidized nano&#8208;Fe0 with optimal properties for groundwater treatment.








Abstract
Sulfidized nanoscale zerovalent iron (SNZVI) is a promising material for groundwater remediation. However, the relationships between sulfur content and speciation and the properties of SNZVI materials are unknown, preventing rational design. Here, the effects of sulfur on the crystalline structure, hydrophobicity, sulfur speciation, corrosion potential, and electron transfer resistance are determined. Sulfur incorporation extended the nano&#8208;Fe0 BCC lattice parameter, reduced the Fe local vacancies, and lowered the resistance to electron transfer. Impacts of the main sulfur species (FeS and FeS2) on hydrophobicity (water contact angles) are consistent with density functional theory calculations for these FeSx phases. These properties well explain the reactivity and selectivity of SNZVI during the reductive dechlorination of trichloroethylene (TCE), a hydrophobic groundwater contaminant. Controlling the amount and speciation of sulfur in the SNZVI made it highly reactive (up to 0.41 L m&#8722;2 d&#8722;1) and selective for TCE degradation over water (up to 240 moles TCE per mole H2O), with an electron efficiency of up to 70%, and these values are 54&#8208;fold, 98&#8208;fold, and 160&#8208;fold higher than for NZVI, respectively. These findings can guide the rational design of robust SNZVI with properties tailored for specific application scenarios.

      <title>Promoting Energy Efficiency via a Self&#8208;Adaptive Evaporative Cooling Hydrogel</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel and cost&#8208;effective strategy is presented to boost the energy efficiency of semiconductor devices by using a self&#8208;adaptive evaporative cooling hydrogel. Water inside the hydrogel can quickly evaporate to dissipate the waste heat generated in semiconductor devices. In dormancy, the hydrogel can harvest ambient water molecules to regenerate itself.








Abstract
High temperature brings adverse impacts on the energy efficiency, and even destroys a semiconductor device. Here, a novel and cost&#8208;effective strategy is proposed to boost the energy efficiency of semiconductor devices by using the self&#8208;adaptive evaporative cooling of a lithium&#8208; and bromine&#8208;enriched polyacrylamide hydrogel. Water inside the hydrogel can quickly evaporate to dissipate the waste heat generated by the nugatory carrier transport in the P&#8208;N junction. In dormancy, the hydrogel harvests water molecules from the surrounding air to regenerate itself. The hydrogel is demonstrated to low down the operating temperature of a commercial polycrystalline silicon solar cell by 17 &#176;C under one sun condition and enhances its efficiency from 14.5% to 15.5%. It is also capable of increasing the maximum power of a simulated chip by 45% at a fixed operating temperature. The hydrogel is expected to be widely adopted in current semiconductor industry to improve its energy efficiency.

&lt;p&gt;Bioinspired interfacial materials offer great opportunity to manipulate the fluid behavior in versatile systems. In article number &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.2019080991908099&lt;/a&gt;, Jun Ma, Moyuan Cao, and co&#8208;workers present a multi&#8208;bioinspired electrode for regulating the gas generation in water splitting. The highly controllable gas transport facilitates efficient in situ H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation with applying the membrane apparatus, showing a new paradigm of a water&#8208;splitting interface.

      <title>PbS Quantum Dots: Carrier Multiplication in PbS Quantum Dots Anchored on a Au Tip using Conductive Atomic Force Microscopy (Adv. Mater. 17/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 1908461, Ji&#8208;Hee Kim, Young Hee Lee, and Sung&#8208;Tae Kim demonstrate highly efficient carrier multiplication via photocurrent measurements using a PbS&#8208;quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;decorated tip of a conductive atomic force microscope (CAFM), leading to the lowest threshold energy of twice the bandgap in PbS quantum dots. The CAFM&#8208;based photocurrent technique is a direct approach for evaluating the CM efficiency in low&#8208;dimensional materials.

      <title>Nanomaterial Patterning in 3D Printing</title>
      <dc:description>
The seamless integration of nanomaterials with 3D printing technologies can create highly heterogeneous architectures imparted with unique properties and multi&#8208;material devices endowed with advanced functionalities. The latest advances in achieving such synergistic integration by leveraging mechanical, electrical, magnetic, optical, or thermal forces to pattern nanomaterials in a 3D printing process with a myriad of remarkably innovative approaches are described.








Abstract
The synergistic integration of nanomaterials with 3D printing technologies can enable the creation of architecture and devices with an unprecedented level of functional integration. In particular, a multiscale 3D printing approach can seamlessly interweave nanomaterials with diverse classes of materials to impart, program, or modulate a wide range of functional properties in an otherwise passive 3D printed object. However, achieving such multiscale integration is challenging as it requires the ability to pattern, organize, or assemble nanomaterials in a 3D printing process. This review highlights the latest advances in the integration of nanomaterials with 3D printing, achieved by leveraging mechanical, electrical, magnetic, optical, or thermal phenomena. Ultimately, it is envisioned that such approaches can enable the creation of multifunctional constructs and devices that cannot be fabricated with conventional manufacturing approaches.

      <title>Potential Link between Cu Surface and Selective CO2 Electroreduction: Perspective on Future Electrocatalyst Designs</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent theoretical studies report that the changes in the Cu surface states during the modification of Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts, from metallic Cu to copper oxides or vice versa, can determine the identity of carbon products. Thus, the link between changes on Cu surface and the catalytic performance for the C&#63743;C coupling reaction is investigated.








Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) product distribution has been identified to be dependent on various surface factors, including the Cu facet, morphology, chemical states, doping, etc., which can alter the binding strength of key intermediates such as *CO and *OCCO during reduction. Therefore, in&#8208;depth knowledge of the Cu catalyst surface and identification of the active species under reaction conditions aid in designing efficient Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This progress report categorizes various Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts into four main groups, namely metallic Cu, Cu alloys, Cu compounds (Cu + non&#8208;metal), and supported Cu&#8208;based catalysts (Cu supported by carbon, metal oxides, or polymers). The detailed mechanisms for the selective CO2RR are presented, followed by recent relevant developments on the synthetic procedures for preparing Cu and Cu&#8208;based nanoparticles. Herein, the potential link between the Cu surface and CO2RR performance is highlighted, especially in terms of the chemical states, but other significant factors such as defective sites and roughened morphology of catalysts are equally considered during the discussion of current studies of CO2RR with Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts to fully understand the origin of the significant enhancement toward C2 formation. This report concludes by providing suggestions for future designs of highly selective and stable Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts for CO2RR.

     alt="Potential Link between Cu Surface and Selective CO2 Electroreduction: Perspective on Future Electrocatalyst Designs"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent theoretical studies report that the changes in the Cu surface states during the modification of Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts, from metallic Cu to copper oxides or vice versa, can determine the identity of carbon products. Thus, the link between changes on Cu surface and the catalytic performance for the C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C coupling reaction is investigated.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) product distribution has been identified to be dependent on various surface factors, including the Cu facet, morphology, chemical states, doping, etc., which can alter the binding strength of key intermediates such as *CO and *OCCO during reduction. Therefore, in&#8208;depth knowledge of the Cu catalyst surface and identification of the active species under reaction conditions aid in designing efficient Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This progress report categorizes various Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts into four main groups, namely metallic Cu, Cu alloys, Cu compounds (Cu + non&#8208;metal), and supported Cu&#8208;based catalysts (Cu supported by carbon, metal oxides, or polymers). The detailed mechanisms for the selective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR are presented, followed by recent relevant developments on the synthetic procedures for preparing Cu and Cu&#8208;based nanoparticles.

This report concludes by providing suggestions for future designs of highly selective and stable Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Freeze Casting: From Low&#8208;Dimensional Building Blocks to Aligned Porous Structures&#8212;A Review of Novel Materials, Methods, and Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Freeze casting is frequently used for the fabrication of porous biomimetic materials through ice&#8208;templated assembly of micro&#8208; or nanoscale particles. In recent years, through the use of novel freeze&#8208;casting processes and building blocks, including graphene and nanotubes, materials with extraordinarily high performance have been achieved. Current developments in freeze&#8208;cast materials and their emerging applications are reviewed.








Abstract
Freeze casting, also known as ice templating, is a particularly versatile technique that has been applied extensively for the fabrication of well&#8208;controlled biomimetic porous materials based on ceramics, metals, polymers, biomacromolecules, and carbon nanomaterials, endowing them with novel properties and broadening their applicability. The principles of different directional freeze&#8208;casting processes are described and the relationships between processing and structure are examined. Recent progress in freeze&#8208;casting assisted assembly of low dimensional building blocks, including graphene and carbon nanotubes, into tailored micro&#8208; and macrostructures is then summarized. Emerging trends relating to novel materials as building blocks and novel freeze&#8208;cast geometries&#8212;beads, fibers, films, complex macrostructures, and nacre&#8208;mimetic composites&#8212;are presented. Thereafter, the means by which aligned porous structures and nacre mimetic materials obtainable through recently developed freeze&#8208;casting techniques and low&#8208;dimensional building blocks can facilitate material functionality across multiple fields of application, including energy storage and conversion, environmental remediation, thermal management, and smart materials, are discussed.

      <title>Supramolecular Energy Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly is a bioinspired strategy to create soft materials for renewable and clean energy technologies. The field of supramolecular energy materials is described, covering work on self&#8208;assembling molecules to craft light harvesting systems for photocatalysis and photovoltaics.

Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly is a bioinspired strategy to craft materials for renewable and clean energy technologies. In plants, the alignment and assembly of the light&#8208;harvesting protein machinery in the green leaf optimize the ability to efficiently convert light from the sun to form chemical bonds. In artificial systems, strategies based on self&#8208;assembly using noncovalent interactions offer the possibility to mimic this functional correlation among molecules to optimize photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and energy storage. One of the long&#8208;term objectives of the field described here as supramolecular energy materials is to learn how to design soft materials containing light&#8208;harvesting assemblies and catalysts to generate fuels and useful chemicals. Supramolecular energy materials also hold great potential in the design of systems for photovoltaics in which intermolecular interactions in self&#8208;assembled structures, for example, in electron donor and acceptor phases, maximize charge transport and avoid exciton recombination. Possible pathways to integrate organic and inorganic structures by templating strategies and electrodeposition to create materials relevant to energy challenges including photoconductors and supercapacitors are also described. The final topic discussed is the synthesis of hybrid perovskites in which organic molecules are used to modify both structure and functions, which may include chemical stability, photovoltaics, and light emission.

      <title>A Superlattice&#8208;Stabilized Layered Oxide Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
An effective strategy in layered oxides with binary transition metals (TMs), i.e., the ordered arrangement of TMs, is constructed for achieving a relatively stable electrode material, which can relieve the multiple plateaus and cation migration. The designed Na3Ni2RuO6 cathode with ordered superlattice structure delivers an ultralong potential platform, high capacity of 130 mAh g&#8722;1, and excellent cycling performance.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries are in high demand for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications. Although it is the most prevalent cathode, layered oxide is associated with significant undesirable characteristics, such as multiple plateaus in the charge&#8722;discharge profiles, and cation migration during repeated cycling of Na&#8208;ions insertion and extraction, which results in sluggish kinetics, capacity loss, and structural deterioration. Here, a new strategy, i.e., the manipulation of transition&#8208;metal ordering in layered oxides, is proposed to show a prolonged charge&#8722;discharge plateau and cation&#8208;migration&#8208;free structural evolution. The results demonstrate that the transition&#8208;metal ordering with a honeycomb&#8208;type superlattice can adjust the crystal lattice and suppress cation migration by modifying the crystal strain to realize a large reversible capacity and excellent cycling performance, which are not characteristics of the widely used common layered oxides. These findings can provide new insight that can be used to improve the design of high&#8208;performance electrode materials for secondary&#8208;ion batteries.

      <title>Graphdiyne&#8208;Based Flexible Photodetectors with High Responsivity and Detectivity</title>
      <dc:description>
Flexible photodetectors based on ultrathin graphdiyne nanosheets are constructed and applied for photoelectrochemical&#8208;type photodetection. The prepared flexible PDs show excellent photo&#8208;response behaviors after bending or twisting for 1000 cycles. In addition, following bending, the PDs exhibit pronounced long&#8208;term stability after being kept in alkaline electrolyte for more than 1 month.








Abstract
Graphdiyne (GDY), a newly emerging 2D carbon allotrope, has been widely explored in various fields owing to its outstanding electronic properties such as the intrinsic bandgap and high carrier mobility. Herein, GDY&#8208;based photoelectrochemical&#8208;type photodetection is realized by spin&#8208;coating ultrathin GDY nanosheets onto flexible poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrates. The GDY&#8208;based photodetectors (PDs) demonstrate excellent photo&#8208;responsive behaviors with high photocurrent (Pph, 5.98 &#181;A cm&#8208;2), photoresponsivity (Rph, 1086.96 &#181;A W&#8208;1), detectivity (7.31 &#215; 1010 Jones), and excellent long&#8208;term stability (more than 1 month). More importantly, the PDs maintain an excellent Pph after 1000 cycles of bending (4.45 &#181;A cm&#8208;2) and twisting (3.85 &#181;A cm&#8208;2), thanks to the great flexibility of the GDY structure that is compatible with the flexible PET substrate. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are adopted to explore the electronic characteristics of GDY, which provides evidence for the performance enhancement of GDY in alkaline electrolyte. In this way, the GDY&#8208;based flexible PDs can enrich the fundamental study of GDY and pave the way for the exploration of GDY heterojunction&#8208;based photodetection.

      <title>Structure Engineering of a Lanthanide&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for the Regulation of Dynamic Ranges and Sensitivities for Pheochromocytoma Diagnosis</title>
      <dc:description>
A tunable lanthanide&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework biosensor for precisely quantifying small concentration changes of urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA, pheochromocytoma's early pathological signature) is designed by editing its dynamic ranges and sensitivities. By tailoring the biosensor's structure, its dynamic range is narrowed to &#8220;useful VMA window&#8221; with remarkably enhanced response slope, enabling it as a powerful signal&#8208;amplifier for discriminating positives from negatives.








Abstract
Exploring innovative technologies to precisely quantify biomolecules is crucial but remains a great challenge for disease diagnosis. Unfortunately, the humoral concentrations of most biotargets generally vary within rather limited scopes between normal and pathological states, while most literature&#8208;reported biosensors can detect large spans of targets concentrations, but are less sensitive to small concentration changes, which consequently make them mostly unsatisfactory or even unreliable in distinguishing positives from negatives. Herein, a novel strategy of precisely quantifying the small concentration changes of a certain biotarget by editing the dynamic ranges and sensitivities of a lanthanide&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Eu&#8208;ZnMOF) biosensor is reported. By elaborately tailoring the biosensor's structure and surface areas, the tunable Eu&#8208;ZnMOF is developed with remarkably enhanced response slope within the &#8220;optimized useful detection window,&#8221; enabling it to serve as a powerful signal amplifier (87.2&#8208;fold increase) for discriminating the small concentration variation of urinary vanillylmandelic acid (an early pathological signature of pheochromocytoma) within only three times between healthy and diseased subjects. This study provides a facile approach to edit the biosensors' performances through structure engineering, and exhibits promising perspectives for future clinical application in the non&#8208;invasive and accurate diagnosis of severe diseases.

      <title>Shadow Epitaxy for In Situ Growth of Generic Semiconductor/Superconductor Hybrids</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel growth platform, &#8220;shadow epitaxy,&#8221; is presented, enabling growth of patterned superconductor/metal layers on semiconductor nanostructures, with generic choice of materials and a wide range of electronic device geometries. Using the platform, new hybrid materials for topological superconductivity research are evaluated, with resultant devices exhibiting high yield and electrostatic stability due to obviation of post&#8208;process damage.








Abstract
Uniform, defect&#8208;free crystal interfaces and surfaces are crucial ingredients for realizing high&#8208;performance nanoscale devices. A pertinent example is that advances in gate&#8208;tunable and topological superconductivity using semiconductor/superconductor electronic devices are currently built on the hard proximity&#8208;induced superconducting gap obtained from epitaxial indium arsenide/aluminum heterostructures. Fabrication of devices requires selective etch processes; these exist only for InAs/Al hybrids, precluding the use of other, potentially superior material combinations. This work introduces a crystal growth platform&#8212;based on 3D structuring of growth substrates&#8212;which enables synthesis of semiconductor nanowire hybrids with in situ patterned superconductor shells. The platform eliminates the need for etching, thereby enabling full freedom in the choice of hybrid constituents. All of the most frequently used superconducting hybrid device architectures are realized and characterized. These devices exhibit increased yield and electrostatic stability compared to etched devices, and evidence of ballistic superconductivity is observed. In addition to aluminum, hybrid structures based on tantalum, niobium, and vanadium are presented.

      <title>Atomic&#8208;Precision Repair of a Few&#8208;Layer 2H&#8208;MoTe2 Thin Film by Phase Transition and Recrystallization Induced by a Heterophase Interface</title>
      <dc:description>
A method to precisely repair macroscopic damage to few&#8208;layer 2H&#8208;MoTe2 films at the atomic scale is demonstrated, and its mechanism is elucidated. The repaired 2H&#8208;MoTe2 inherits the lattice orientation of the adjacent original 2H&#8208;MoTe2 and seamlessly contacts to it, thereby forming an atomically perfect lattice. In addition the repaired MoTe2 shows the same electrical quality as the original one.








Abstract
2D semiconductors have emerged as promising candidates for post&#8208;silicon nanoelectronics, owing to their unique properties and atomic thickness. However, in the handling of 2D material, various forms of macroscopic damage, such as cracks, wrinkles, and scratches, etc., are usually introduced, which cause adverse effects on the material properties and device performance. Repairing such macroscopic damage is crucial for improving device performance and reliability, especially for large&#8208;scale 2D device arrays. Here, a method is demonstrated repair damage to few&#8208;layer 2H&#8208;MoTe2 films with atomic precision, and its mechanism is elucidated. The repaired 2H&#8208;MoTe2 inherits the lattice orientation of the adjacent original 2H&#8208;MoTe2, thereby forming an atomically perfect lattice at the repaired interface. The time&#8208;evolution experiments show that the interface between the 2H&#8208; and early formed 1T'&#8208;MoTe2 plays an important role in the subsequent phase transition and recrystallization. Electrical measurements on the original MoTe2, repaired MoTe2, and cross&#8208;interface regions show unobservable differences, indicating that the repaired MoTe2 has the same electrical quality as the original one and the interface does not introduce extra scattering centers for carrier transport. The findings provide an effective strategy for macroscopic damage repair of few&#8208;layer 2H&#8208;MoTe2, which paves the way for its practical application in advanced electronics and optoelectronics.

      <title>Reducing the Singlet&#8722;Triplet Energy Gap by End&#8208;Group &#960;&#8722;&#960; Stacking Toward High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Photovoltaics</title>
      <dc:description>
End&#8208;group &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking is proved to be able to effectively reduce the singlet&#8722;triplet energy difference in narrow&#8208;bandgap A&#8722;D&#8722;A acceptors, which is beneficial to simultaneously decrease the voltage loss in exciton dissociation and suppress triplet recombination. Furthermore, the absorption spectra can be broadened or redshifted, thus improving the light&#8208;harvesting efficiencies. These results pave the way toward high&#8208;efficiency organic photovoltaics.








Abstract
To improve the power conversion efficiencies for organic solar cells, it is necessary to enhance light absorption and reduce energy loss simultaneously. Both the lowest singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) excited states need to energertically approach the charge&#8208;transfer state to reduce the energy loss in exciton dissociation and by triplet recombination. Meanwhile, the S1 energy needs to be decreased to broaden light absorption. Therefore, it is imperative to reduce the singlet&#8722;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST), particularly for the narrow&#8208;bandgap materials that determine the device T1 energy. Although maximizing intramolecular push&#8722;pull effect can drastically decrease &#916;EST, it inevitably results in weak oscillator strength and light absorption. Herein, large oscillator strength (&#8776;3) and a moderate &#916;EST (0.4&#8722;0.5 eV) are found for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art A&#8722;D&#8722;A small&#8208;molecule acceptors (ITIC, IT&#8208;4F, and Y6) owing to modest push&#8722;pull effect. Importantly, end&#8208;group &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking commonly in the films can substantially decrease the S1 energy by nearly 0.1 eV, but the T1 energy is hardly changed. The obtained reduction of &#916;EST is crucial to effectively suppress triplet recombination and acquire small exciton dissociation driving force. Thus, end&#8208;group &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking is an effective way to achieve both small energy loss and efficient light absorption for high&#8208;efficiency organic photovoltaics.

      <title>Higher Than 90% Initial Coulombic Efficiency with Staghorn&#8208;Coral&#8208;Like 3D Porous LiFeO2&#8722;x as Anode Materials for Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
3D porous LiFeO2&#8722;x rich with Fe(II) is prepared by reacting Fe2O3 with LiH at 550 &#176;C. With a unique staghorn&#8208;coral&#8208;like skeleton measuring &#8776;100 nm in diameter, the Fe(II)&#8208;rich LiFeO2&#8722;x delivers the presently known highest initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) value of 90.2% with 1170 mAh g&#8722;1 of discharge capacity favored by a fast conversion reaction of LiFeO2&#8722;x upon lithiation/delithiation.








Abstract
Transition metal oxides represent a promising class of anode materials for high&#8208;capacity lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE, &lt;80%) still remains a crucial challenge for practical applications. Herein, a unique 3D Fe(II)&#8208;rich porous LiFeO2&#8722;x comprising of staghorn&#8208;coral&#8208;like skeleton measuring &#8776;100 nm in diameter is demonstrated, which is readily prepared by reacting Fe2O3 with LiH at 550 &#176;C. When used as an anode material, the Fe(II)&#8208;rich LiFeO2&#8722;x delivers the presently known highest ICE value of 90.2% with 1170 mAh g&#8722;1 discharge capacity. The high ICE value can be ascribed to a fast conversion reaction of LiFeO2&#8722;x upon lithiation/delithiation facilitated by the presence of Fe(II), which generates oxygen vacancies and makes electron transportation much easier, based on the experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

      <title>Stacking&#8208;Order&#8208;Driven Optical Properties and Carrier Dynamics in ReS2</title>
      <dc:description>
Two stacking orders of ReS2 are identified. Stacking AA has negligible displacement across layers and stacking AB has a one&#8208;unit cell displacement along the a&#8208;axis. AB stacking has stronger interlayer coupling than AA. The cross&#8208;layer displacement in AB stacking disrupts excited&#8208;state excitons. Vibrational, optical properties and carrier dynamics in two stacking orders are drastically different.








Abstract
Two distinct stacking orders in ReS2 are identified without ambiguity and their influence on vibrational, optical properties and carrier dynamics are investigated. With atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), two stacking orders are determined as AA stacking with negligible displacement across layers, and AB stacking with about a one&#8208;unit cell displacement along the a axis. First&#8208;principles calculations confirm that these two stacking orders correspond to two local energy minima. Raman spectra inform a consistent difference of modes I &amp; III, about 13 cm&#8722;1 for AA stacking, and 20 cm&#8722;1 for AB stacking, making a simple tool for determining the stacking orders in ReS2. Polarized photoluminescence (PL) reveals that AB stacking possesses blueshifted PL peak positions, and broader peak widths, compared with AA stacking, indicating stronger interlayer interaction. Transient transmission measured with femtosecond pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy suggests exciton dynamics being more anisotropic in AB stacking, where excited state absorption related to Exc. III mode disappears when probe polarization aligns perpendicular to b axis. The findings underscore the stacking&#8208;order driven optical properties and carrier dynamics of ReS2, mediate many seemingly contradictory results in the literature, and open up an opportunity to engineer electronic devices with new functionalities by manipulating the stacking order.

      <title>Dehydration&#8208;Triggered Ionic Channel Engineering in Potassium Niobate for Li/K&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
      <dc:description>
Boosting charge transfer in materials is critical for applications involving charge carriers. Engineering ionic channels in electrode materials can create a skeleton to manipulate their ion/electron behaviors with favorable parameters to promote their performance. Tailoring of the atomic structure in layered potassium niobate and facilitating its application in Li/K storage by dehydration&#8208;triggered lattice rearrangement is reported.








Abstract
Boosting charge transfer in materials is critical for applications involving charge carriers. Engineering ionic channels in electrode materials can create a skeleton to manipulate their ion and electron behaviors with favorable parameters to promote their capacity and stability. Here, tailoring of the atomic structure in layered potassium niobate (K4Nb6O17) nanosheets and facilitating their application in lithium and potassium storage by dehydration&#8208;triggered lattice rearrangement is reported. The spectroscopy results reveal that the interatomic distances of the Nb&#63743;O coordination in the engineered K4Nb6O17 are slightly elongated with increased degrees of disorder. Specifically, the engineered K4Nb6O17 shows enhanced electrical and ionic conductivity, which can be attributed to the enlarged interlamellar spacing and subtle distortions in the fine atomic arrangements. Moreover, subsequent experimental results and calculations demonstrate that the energy barrier for Li+/K+ diffusion is significantly lower than that in pristine K4Nb6O17. Interestingly, the diffusion coefficient of K+ is one order of magnitude higher than that of Li+ , and the engineered K4Nb6O17 presents superior electrochemical performance for K+ to Li+ . This work offers an ionic engineering strategy to enable fast and durable charge transfer in materials, holding great promise for providing guidance for the material design of related energy storage systems.

Coating Au@Rh nanostructures with tumor cell membrane (CM) enables tumor targeting via homologous binding. As a result of the large pores of Rh shells and the trapping ability of CM, the photosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG) is successfully loaded and retained in the cavity of Au@Rh&#8208;CM. Au@Rh&#8208;ICG&#8208;CM shows good biocompatibility, high tumor accumulation, and superior fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging properties. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that Au@Rh&#8208;ICG&#8208;CM is able to effectively convert endogenous hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and then elevate the production of tumor&#8208;toxic singlet oxygen to significantly enhance PDT. As noted, the mild photothermal effect of Au@Rh&#8208;ICG&#8208;CM also improves PDT efficacy. By integrating the superiorities of hypoxia regulation function, tumor accumulation capacity, bimodal imaging, and moderate photothermal effect into a single nanosystem, Au@Rh&#8208;ICG&#8208;CM can readily serve as a promising nanoplatform for enhanced cancer PDT.

      <title>Toward 2D Magnets in the (MnBi2Te4)(Bi2Te3)n Bulk Crystal</title>
      <dc:description>
A new magnetic state is proposed in (MnBi2Te4)(Bi2Te3)n, in which ferro&#8208;magnetic layers are separated by a large number of non&#8208;magnetic layers. The decoupling of the magnetic layers starts to emerge from n = 2, 3, forming a column of weakly&#8208;interacting 2D magnets. The integration of the prototypical magnetic state and topological surface states may lead to exotic physical properties.








Abstract
2D magnets and their engineered magnetic heterostructures are intriguing materials for both fundamental physics and application prospects. On the basis of the recently discovered intrinsic magnetic topological insulators (MnBi2Te4)(Bi2Te3)n, here, a new type of magnet, in which the magnetic layers are separated by a large number of non&#8208;magnetic layers and become magnetically independent, is proposed. This magnet is named as a single&#8208;layer magnet, regarding the vanishing interlayer exchange coupling.

Magnetization data analysis shows that the proposed new magnetic states have a strong uniaxial anisotropy along the c&#8208;axis, forming an Ising&#8208;type magnetic structure, where Tc is the ordering temperature for each magnetic layer. The characteristic slow relaxation, which exists only along the c&#8208;axis but is absent along the ab plane, can be ascribed to interlayer coherent spin rotation and/or intralayer domain wall movement. The present results will stimulate further theoretical and experimental investigations for the prototypical magnetic structures, and their combination with the topological surface states may lead to exotic physical properties.

&lt;p&gt;2D magnets and their engineered magnetic heterostructures are intriguing materials for both fundamental physics and application prospects.

      <title>High&#8208;Rate Printing of Micro/Nanoscale Patterns Using Interfacial Convective Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>
A directed&#8208;assembly&#8208;based printing technique, interfacial convective assembly, is developed to print micro/nanoscale patterns at desired areas of substrates. Various nanoparticles are printed in patterns of different shapes with a high resolution down to 25 nm. Assembly only takes a few minutes, which is two orders of magnitude faster than the conventional convective assembly.








Abstract
Printing of electronics has been receiving increasing attention from academia and industry over the recent years. However, commonly used printing techniques have limited resolution of micro&#8208; or sub&#8208;microscale. Here, a directed&#8208;assembly&#8208;based printing technique, interfacial convective assembly, is reported, which utilizes a substrate&#8208;heating&#8208;induced solutal Marangoni convective flow to drive particles toward patterned substrates and then uses van der Waals interactions as well as geometrical confinement to trap the particles in the pattern areas. The influence of various assembly parameters including type of mixing solvent, substrate temperature, particle concentration, and assembly time is investigated. The results show successful assembly of various nanoparticles in patterns of different shapes with a high resolution down to 25 nm. In addition, the assembly only takes a few minutes, which is two orders of magnitude faster than conventional convective assembly. Small&#8208;sized (diameter below 5 nm) nanoparticles tend to coalesce during the assembly process and form sintered structures. The fabricated silver nanorods show single&#8208;crystal structure with a low resistivity of 8.58 &#215; 10&#8722;5 &#937; cm. With high versatility, high resolution, and high throughput, the interfacial convective assembly opens remarkable opportunities for printing next generation nanoelectronics and sensors.

      <title>Two Are Better Than One: A Design Principle for Ultralong&#8208;Persistent Luminescence of Pure Organics</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel approach to achieve a pure organic long&#8208;persistent luminescent material using a phosphonium salt doped with dimethylaniline is reported. The doped crystals can exhibit a green afterglow emission lasting up to 7 h after the cessation of UV excitation. The positive phosphonium salt holds and protects the separated charge to produce unprecedented afterglow duration.








Abstract
Because of their innate ability to store and then release energy, long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) materials have garnered strong research interest in a wide range of multidisciplinary fields, such as biomedical sciences, theranostics, and photonic devices. Although many inorganic LPL systems with afterglow durations of up to hours and days have been reported, organic systems have had difficulties reaching similar timescales. In this work, a design principle based on the successes of inorganic systems to produce an organic LPL (OLPL) system through the use of a strong organic electron trap is proposed. The resulting system generates detectable afterglow for up to 7 h, significantly longer than any other reported OLPL system. The design strategy demonstrates an easy methodology to develop organic long&#8208;persistent phosphors, opening the door to new OLPL materials.

      <title>Heterostructures of 2D Molybdenum Dichalcogenide on 2D Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon: Superior Potassium&#8208;Ion Storage and Insight into Potassium Storage Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>
Heterostructures of 2D molybdenum dichalcogenide on 2D nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (MoS2&#8208;on&#8208;NC and MoSe2&#8208;on&#8208;NC) are designed for potassium&#8208;ion batteries with superior electrochemical performance and outstanding cycle life. The insertion&#8211;conversion mechanism of MoSe2 is revealed during the process of potassiation and depotassiation by in situ Raman spectra and ex situ high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).








Abstract
Constructing 2D heterostructure materials by stacking different 2D materials can combine the merits of the individual building blocks while eliminating their shortcomings. Dichalcogenides are attractive anodes for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity. However, the practical application of dichalcogenide is greatly hampered by the poor electrochemical performance due to sluggish kinetics of K+ insertion and the electrode structure collapse resulting from the large K+ insertion. Herein, heterostructures of 2D molybdenum dichalcogenide on 2D nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (MoS2, MoSe2&#8208;on&#8208;NC) are prepared to boost their potassium storage performance. The unique 2D heterostructures possess built&#8208;in heterointerfaces, facilitating K+ diffusion. The robust chemical bonds (C&#63743;S, C&#63743;Se, C&#63743;Mo bonds) enhance the mechanical strength of electrodes, thus suppressing the volume expansion. The 2D N&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets interconnected as a 3D structure offer a fast diffusion path for electrons. Benefitting from these merits, both the MoS2&#8208;on&#8208;NC and the MoSe2&#8208;on&#8208;NC exhibit unprecedented cycle life. Moreover, the electrochemical reaction mechanism of MoSe2 is revealed during the process of potassiation and depotassiation.

      <title>Porous Organic Frameworks Featured by Distinct Confining Fields for the Selective Hydrogenation of Biomass&#8208;Derived Ketones</title>
      <dc:description>
Converting biomass&#8208;derived substances into value&#8208;added chemicals such as single&#8208;antipode compounds is an effective strategy to reduce the rapid consumption of fossil resources. Porous organic frameworks with conjugated inner surfaces provide strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction for steric hindrance of substrate molecules around the metal active site to achieve stronger asymmetric induction.








Abstract
The asymmetric hydrogenation of biomass&#8208;derived molecules for the preparation of single enantiomer compounds is an effective method to reduce the rapid consumption of fossil resources. Porous organic frameworks (POFs) with pure organic surfaces may provide unusual confinement effects for organic substrates in chiral catalysis. Here, a series of POF catalysts are designed with chiral active centers decorated into sharply defined one&#8208;dimensional channels with diameters in the range of 1.2&#8211;2.9 nm. Due to the synergistic effect originating from the conjugated inner wall, the POF material (aperture size 2.4 nm) concentrates over 90% of aromatic species into the porous architecture, and its affinity is one or two orders of magnitude higher than those of classical porous solids. As determined by PBE+D3 calculation, the phenyl fragment reveals strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction for steric hindrance around the metal active site to achieve stronger asymmetric induction. Therefore, this POF catalyst achieves high conversion (&gt;99% yield) and enantioselectivity (&gt;99% ee) for various substrates. The advantages of using the POF platform as a chiral catalyst can provide new perspectives on POF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state host&#8211;guest chemistry and asymmetric heterogeneous catalysis.

Activated Bi2Te3 nanoplates are demonstrated as highly universal and robust electrocatalysts for reduction of small molecules, where they exhibit nearly 100% H2O2 selectivity for the oxygen reduction reaction, 89.6% Faradaic efficiency (FE) of HCOOH for the CO2 reduction reaction, and 7.9% FE of NH3 for the nitrogen reduction reaction, showing a new class of electrocatalysts for conversion of small molecules with potential practical applications.








Abstract
The electroreduction of small molecules to high value&#8208;added chemicals is considered as a promising way toward the capture and utilization of atmospheric small molecules. Discovering cheap and efficient electrocatalysts with simultaneously high activity, selectivity, durability, and even universality is desirable yet challenging. Herein, it is demonstrated that Bi2Te3 nanoplates (NPs), cheap and noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts, can be adopted as highly universal and robust electrocatalysts, which can efficiently reduce small molecules (O2, CO2, and N2) into targeted products simultaneously. They can achieve excellent activity, selectivity and durability for the oxygen reduction reaction with almost 100% H2O2 selectivity, the CO2 reduction reaction with up to 90% Faradaic efficiency (FE) of HCOOH, and the nitrogen reduction reaction with 7.9% FE of NH3. After electrochemical activation, an obvious Te dissolution happens on the Bi2Te3 NPs, creating lots of Te vacancies in the activated Bi2Te3 NPs. Theoretical calculations reveal that the Te vacancies can modulate the electronic structures of Bi and Te. Such a highly electroactive surface with a strong preference in supplying electrons for the universal reduction reactions improves the electrocatalytic performance of Bi2Te3. The work demonstrates a new class of cheap and versatile catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of small molecules with potential practical applications.

      <title>Mechanical Tolerance of Cascade Bioreactions via Adaptive Curvature Engineering for Epidermal Bioelectronics</title>
      <dc:description>
Mechanical tolerance of bioreactions is crucial for obtaining high biosensing fidelity. By combining simulations and experiments, it is found that strain&#8208;induced change in reactant flux accounts for the performance drop in flat bioelectrodes. Wavy bioelectrodes capable of curvature adaptation maintain the reactant flux and preserve biosensing performance under static strain and dynamic stretching, which are demonstrated in gesture&#8208;insensitive epidermal metabolite biosensors.








Abstract
Epidermal bioelectronics that can monitor human health status non&#8208;invasively and in real time are core to wearable healthcare equipment. Achieving mechanically tolerant surface bioreactions that convert biochemical information to detectable signals is crucial for obtaining high sensing fidelity. In this work, by combining simulations and experiments, a typical epidermal biosensor system is investigated based on a redox enzyme cascade reaction (RECR) comprising glucose oxidase/lactate oxidase enzymes and Prussian blue nanoparticles. Simulations reveal that strain&#8208;induced change in surface reactant flux is the key to the performance drop in traditional flat bioelectrodes. In contrast, wavy bioelectrodes capable of curvature adaptation maintain the reactant flux under strain, which preserves sensing fidelity. This rationale is experimentally proven by bioelectrodes with flat/wavy geometry under both static strain and dynamic stretching. When exposed to 50% strain, the signal fluctuations for wavy bioelectrodes are only 7.0% (4.9%) in detecting glucose (lactate), which are significantly lower than the 40.3% (51.8%) in flat bioelectrodes. Based on this wavy bioelectrode, a stable human epidermal metabolite biosensor insensitive to human gestures is further demonstrated. This mechanically tolerant biosensor based on adaptive curvature engineering provides a reliable bio/chemical&#8208;information monitoring platform for soft healthcare bioelectronics.

      <title>Electro&#8208;Photoluminescence Color Change for Deformable Visual Encryption</title>
      <dc:description>
An electro&#8208;photoluminescence (EPL) color&#8208;change system is presented. The chromaticity of EPL can be controlled systematically in a wide range of color variation while maintaining high luminance. The EPL color&#8208;changing device can be used in a deformable visual encryption and as a soft skin for a soft robotic rover.








Abstract
Although structural coloring and photoluminescence (PL) have been investigated for radiation&#8208;responsive color change, electroluminescence (EL) has not been used for the radiation&#8208;responsive system. An electro&#8208;photoluminescence (EPL) color change is presented here. The phosphors in the alternating current electroluminescence (ACEL) act simultaneously as electro&#8208;luminophores and photo&#8208;luminophores. The EPL chromaticity is systematically investigated depending on the ACEL frequency and UV intensity. It is found that the PL variation depending on UV intensity is the mechanism of the EPL color change. It is revealed that EL and PL can be controlled independently in the low electric field so that the EPL chromaticity can be adjusted by a linear combination of the EL color and the PL color. The EPL color&#8208;changing device is used as a deformable visual encryption system and a soft skin for a soft robotic rover, imitating the concealment and signaling functions in nature.

      <dc:description>
Increased interest in human sustainability inspires technological progress in clean energy conversion and chemical/biological detection technologies. Various long&#8208;range ordered 3D nanoarchitectures are discussed with a particular emphasis on the key roles of 3D nanostructure design parameters in the performance and reliability of energy conversion systems and chemical/biomarker detection devices.








Abstract
For the last few decades, nanoscale materials and structures have been extensively studied and developed, making a huge impact on human sustainability.

However, there are still remaining challenges that need to be resolved to further improve their performance, reliability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness.

Among the various fabrication techniques, sequential solvent&#8208;injection&#8208;assisted nanotransfer printing is suggested as a practical fabrication platform for tunable long&#8208;range ordered 3D nanostructures composed of ultrahigh&#8208;resolution building blocks.

      <title>Flexible and Self&#8208;Powered Photodetector Arrays Based on All&#8208;Inorganic CsPbBr3 Quantum Dots</title>
      <dc:description>

The as&#8208;fabricated self&#8208;powered flexible photodetector arrays exhibit superior photoresponse and electrical stability under different bending conditions (60&#176; and 1600 cycles) with marginal degradation.

Abstract
Flexible devices are garnering substantial interest owing to their potential for wearable and portable applications. Here, flexible and self&#8208;powered photodetector arrays based on all&#8208;inorganic perovskite quantum dots (QDs) are reported. CsBr/KBr&#8208;mediated CsPbBr3 QDs possess improved surface morphology and crystallinity with reduced defect densities, in comparison with the pristine ones. Systematic material characterizations reveal enhanced carrier transport, photoluminescence efficiency, and carrier lifetime of the CsBr/KBr&#8208;mediated CsPbBr3 QDs. Flexible photodetector arrays fabricated with an optimum CsBr/KBr treatment demonstrate a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.3 V, responsivity of 10.1 A W&#8722;1, specific detectivity of 9.35 &#215; 1013 Jones, and on/off ratio up to &#8776;104. Particularly, such performance is achieved under the self&#8208;powered operation mode. Furthermore, outstanding flexibility and electrical stability with negligible degradation after 1600 bending cycles (up to 60&#176;) are demonstrated. More importantly, the flexible detector arrays exhibit uniform photoresponse distribution, which is of much significance for practical imaging systems, and thus promotes the practical deployment of perovskite products.

      <title>Finely Tuned Submicroporous Thin&#8208;Film Molecular Sieve Membranes for Highly Efficient Fluid Separations</title>
      <dc:description>
Novel pressure&#8208;driven thin&#8208;film composite membranes containing entrapped structural submicroporosity (pore size &lt; 4 &#197;) exhibit superb performance for removal of small solutes from aqueous or organic solutions. The membranes potentially lower the energy burden and improve the environmental sustainability of chemical separations that are currently based on thermal principles and account for &#8776;10&#8211;15% of the world's total energy consumption.








Abstract
Polymeric membranes with increasingly high permselective performances are gaining a significant role in lowering the energy burden and improving the environmental sustainability of complex chemical separations. However, the commercial deployment of newly designed materials with promising intrinsic properties for fluid separations has been stalled by challenges associated with fabrication and scale up of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance, defect&#8208;free thin&#8208;film composite (TFC) membranes. Here, a facile method to fabricate next&#8208;generation	 TFC membranes using a bridged&#8208;bicyclic triptycene tetra&#8208;acyl chloride (Trip) building block with a large fraction of finely tuned structural submicroporosity (pore size &lt; 4 &#197;) is demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;Novel pressure&#8208;driven thin&#8208;film composite membranes containing entrapped structural submicroporosity (pore size &amp;lt; 4 &#197;) exhibit superb performance for removal of small solutes from aqueous or organic solutions. The membranes potentially lower the energy burden and improve the environmental sustainability of chemical separations that are currently based on thermal principles and account for &#8776;10&#8211;15% of the world's total energy consumption.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymeric membranes with increasingly high permselective performances are gaining a significant role in lowering the energy burden and improving the environmental sustainability of complex chemical separations. However, the commercial deployment of newly designed materials with promising intrinsic properties for fluid separations has been stalled by challenges associated with fabrication and scale up of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance, defect&#8208;free thin&#8208;film composite (TFC) membranes. Here, a facile method to fabricate next&#8208;generation	 TFC membranes using a bridged&#8208;bicyclic triptycene tetra&#8208;acyl chloride (Trip) building block with a large fraction of finely tuned structural submicroporosity (pore size &amp;lt; 4 &#197;) is demonstrated. The TFCs exhibit superb potential for removal of small (&#8776;200 g mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) organic microcontaminants from organic solvent streams by showing both improved rejection and permeance in organic systems compared to current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial membranes. The TFCs also display unprecedented properties for desalination applications with performance located far above the current water permeance/sodium chloride rejection trendline. The strategy of using highly contorted triptycene building blocks with well&#8208;defined interconnected internal free volume elements establishes a scalable, generalized approach to fabricate highly selective, submicroporous TFC membranes for a wide variety of challenging energy&#8208;intensive fluid separations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kirigami&#8208;Design&#8208;Enabled Hydrogel Multimorphs with Application as a Multistate Switch</title>
      <dc:description>
Multistable morphing configurations are obtained in one composite hydrogel with kirigami design by controlling the buckling direction of high&#8208;swelling gel strips constrained by a stiff frame. In the kirigami structure, the introduction of cutouts destroy the geometric continuity, increasing the deformation freedom of the discrete strips. A multistate switch is designed by harnessing the hydrogel multimorphs to control a set of light&#8208;emitting diodes.








Abstract
Morphing materials have promising applications in soft robots, intelligent devices, and so forth. Among the various design strategies, kirigami structures are recognized as a powerful tool to obtain sophisticated 3D configurations and unprecedented properties from planar designs on common materials. Here, some kirigami designs are demonstrated for programmable, multistable 3D configurations from composite hydrogel sheets. Via photolithographic polymerization, perforated composite hydrogel sheets are fabricated, in which soft and active hydrogel strips are patterned in stiff and passive hydrogel frames. When immersed in water, the gel strips buckle out of plane due to swelling mismatch. In the kirigami structures, the geometric continuity is disrupted by the introduction of cutouts, and thus the degrees of deformation freedom increases remarkably. Multiple configurations are obtained in a single composite hydrogel by controlling the buckling direction of each strip. Multitier configurations are also obtained by using a hierarchically designed kirigami structure. A multicontact switch of an electric circuit is designed by harnessing the multitier gel configurations. Furthermore, a rotation mode is realized by introducing chirality in the kirigami design. The versatile design of the kirigami structure for programmable deformations should be applicable for other intelligent materials toward promising applications in biomedical devices and flexible electronics.

      <title>Chiral Surface Lattice Resonances</title>
      <dc:description>
Surface lattice resonances result from coupling of localized surface plasmon resonances to grazing diffraction orders. By arranging chiral nanocrescents into periodic arrays with controlled interparticle distances, chiral lattice resonances become accessible. These resonances show a selective response to the handedness of incident, circularly polarized light. Such arrays are fabricated over large areas (&gt;cm2) by self&#8208;assembly of core&#8211;shell masking particles and modified colloidal lithography.








Abstract
Collective excitation of periodic arrays of metallic nanoparticles by coupling localized surface plasmon resonances to grazing diffraction orders leads to surface lattice resonances with narrow line width. These resonances may find numerous applications in optical sensing and information processing. Here, a new degree of freedom of surface lattice resonances is experimentally investigated by demonstrating handedness&#8208;dependent excitation of surface lattice resonances in arrays of chiral plasmonic crescents. The self&#8208;assembly of particles used as mask and modified colloidal lithography is applied to produce arrays of planar and 3D gold crescents over large areas. The excitation of surface lattice resonances as a function of the interparticle distance and the degree of order within the arrays is investigated. The chirality of the individual 3D crescents leads to the formation of chiral lattice modes, that is, surface lattice resonances that exhibit optical activity.

      <title>Harnessing the Formation of Natural Killer&#8211;Tumor Cell Immunological Synapses for Enhanced Therapeutic Effect in Solid Tumors</title>
      <dc:description>
The reinforced natural killer (ReNK) cell system is designed to release drugs upon the formation of an NK&#8211;tumor cell immunological synapse. Degranulation and acidification at the synapse cleft trigger the disassembly of pH&#8208;sensitive polymeric micelles on the surface of the NK cells. Doxorubicin released from ReNK diffuses into the tumor tissue, overcoming the insufficient therapeutic effect due to restricted infiltration of NK cells.








Abstract
The formation of an immunological synapse (IS) on recognition of a cancer cell is the main mechanism underlying the natural killer (NK)&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated killing of tumor cells. Herein, an integrative strategy for cancer therapy against solid tumors is reported, in which alterations in the cleft of IS, following the secretion of acidic granular content, are utilized as a trigger for the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs. NK cells are decorated with the IS&#8208;environment&#8208;responsive micellar system to ensure the release of the payload when they attack cancer cells. Using this strategy, the immunological cytotoxic killing effect of NK cells against solid tumors is reinforced with the site&#8208;specific diffusion of chemotherapeutic agents. Harnessing the intrinsic mechanism for the recognition of abnormal cells and the tumor&#8208;homing effect of NK cells limit the adverse systemic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs. This approach may provide a pragmatic platform for the universal and effective utilization of IS formation.

      <title>Nested Inverse Opal Perovskite toward Superior Flexible and Self&#8208;Powered Photodetection Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
A flexible and self&#8208;powered photodetector based on a nested inverse opal (NIO) perovskite structure is presented. The NIO device shows excellent photoresponse performance and mechanical durability. The remarkable improvement is attributed to the NIO&#8208;structure&#8208;enabled enhanced light harvesting, fast carrier transport, high perovskite crystallinity, and efficient stress release.








Abstract
Flexible and self&#8208;powered perovskite photodetectors have attracted tremendous research interests due to their applications in wearable and portable devices. However, the conventional planar structured photodetectors are always accompanied with limited device performance and undesired mechanical stability. Herein, a nested inverse opal (NIO) structured perovskite photodetector via a facile template&#8208;assisted spin&#8208;coating method is reported. The coupling effect of enhanced light capture, increased carrier transport, and improved perovskite film quality enables NIO device to exhibit superior photoresponse performance. The NIO photodetector exhibits a high responsivity of 473 mA W&#8722;1 and detectivity up to 1.35 &#215; 1013 Jones at 720 nm without external bias. The NIO structure can efficiently release mechanical stress during the bending process and the photocurrent has no degradation even after 500 cycles of bending. Moreover, the unencapsulated NIO device can operate for over 16 d under ambient conditions, presenting a significantly enhanced environmental stability compared to the planar device. This work demonstrates that deliberate structural design is an effective avenue for constructing self&#8208;powered, flexible, and stable optoelectronic devices.

      <title>A Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Zinc&#8211;Iodine Battery with Smart Overcharge Self&#8208;Protection Function</title>
      <dc:description>
Integrating stimulus responses into rechargeable batteries shows potential to revolutionize energy storage for smart devices. A stimulus&#8208;responsive Zn&#8211;I2 battery can be rapidly switched off with capacity degrading to 6% of the initial capacity under overcharge conditions, thereby preventing irreversible side reactions (including hydrogen generation and electrode degradation), battery failure, and relevant safety issues.








Abstract
Zinc&#8211;iodine aqueous batteries (ZIABs) are highly attractive for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their high theoretical capacities, environmental friendliness, and intrinsic non&#8208;flammability. However, because of the close redox potential of Zn stripping/platting and hydrogen evolution, slight overcharge of ZIABs would induce drastic side reactions, serious safety concerns, and battery failure. A novel type of stimulus&#8208;responsive zinc&#8211;iodine aqueous battery (SR&#8208;ZIAB) with fast overcharge self&#8208;protection ability is demonstrated by employing a smart pH&#8208;responsive electrolyte. Operando spectroelectrochemical characterizations reveal that the battery failure mechanism of ZIABs during overcharge arises from the increase of electrolyte pH induced by hydrogen evolution as well as the consequent irreversible formation of insulating ZnO at anode and soluble Zn(IO3)2 at cathode. Under overcharge conditions, the designed SR&#8208;ZIABs can be rapidly switched off with capacity degrading to 6% of the initial capacity, thereby avoiding continuous battery damage. Importantly, SR&#8208;ZIABs can be switched on with nearly 100% of capacity recovery by re&#8208;adjusting the electrolyte pH. This work will inspire the development of aqueous Zn batteries with smart self&#8208;protection ability in the overcharge state.

Operando spectroelectrochemical characterizations reveal that the battery failure mechanism of ZIABs during overcharge arises from the increase of electrolyte pH induced by hydrogen evolution as well as the consequent irreversible formation of insulating ZnO at anode and soluble Zn(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at cathode. Under overcharge conditions, the designed SR&#8208;ZIABs can be rapidly switched off with capacity degrading to 6% of the initial capacity, thereby avoiding continuous battery damage. Importantly, SR&#8208;ZIABs can be switched on with nearly 100% of capacity recovery by re&#8208;adjusting the electrolyte pH. This work will inspire the development of aqueous Zn batteries with smart self&#8208;protection ability in the overcharge state.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Energetic Control of Redox&#8208;Active Polymers toward Safe Organic Bioelectronic Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Faradaic side&#8208;reactions of redox&#8208;active materials, that can produce harmful side&#8208;products, should be minimized when employed in bioelectronic devices for studying biological systems. This work sheds light on side&#8208;reactions with oxygen in state&#8209;of&#8209;the&#8209;art materials for electrochemical transistors, forming hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and provides design rules toward high&#8208;performance materials that prevent adverse reactions by tailoring the energy levels of the redox&#8208;active material.








Abstract
Avoiding faradaic side reactions during the operation of electrochemical devices is important to enhance the device stability, to achieve low power consumption, and to prevent the formation of reactive side&#8208;products. This is particularly important for bioelectronic devices, which are designed to operate in biological systems. While redox&#8208;active materials based on conducting and semiconducting polymers represent an exciting class of materials for bioelectronic devices, they are susceptible to electrochemical side&#8208;reactions with molecular oxygen during device operation. Here, electrochemical side reactions with molecular oxygen are shown to occur during organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) operation using high&#8208;performance, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OECT materials. Depending on the choice of the active material, such reactions yield hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a reactive side&#8208;product, which may be harmful to the local biological environment and may also accelerate device degradation. A design strategy is reported for the development of redox&#8208;active organic semiconductors based on donor&#8211;acceptor copolymers that prevents the formation of H2O2 during device operation. This study elucidates the previously overlooked side&#8208;reactions between redox&#8208;active conjugated polymers and molecular oxygen in electrochemical devices for bioelectronics, which is critical for the operation of electrolyte&#8208;gated devices in application&#8208;relevant environments.

      <title>Unraveling the Microstructure&#8208;Related Device Stability for Polymer Solar Cells Based on Nonfullerene Small&#8208;Molecular Acceptors</title>
      <dc:description>
Fill factor losses in nonfullerene&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based organic solar cells under illumination are caused by morphological traps due to diffusion limited aggregation of the nonfullerene acceptors in the mixed matrix. To achieve stable and high&#8208;performance organic solar cells under illumination, it is essential to engineer the mixed regions from both thin&#8208;film formation kinetics and materials intrinsic properties, e.g., materials compatibility and diffusion constant.








Abstract
As the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) has surpassed the 17% baseline, the long&#8208;term stability of highly efficient OSCs is essential for the practical application of this photovoltaic technology. Here, the photostability and possible degradation mechanisms of three state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymer donors with a commonly used nonfullerene acceptor (NFA), IT&#8208;4F, are investigated. The active&#8208;layer materials show excellent intrinsic photostability. The initial morphology, in particular the mixed region, causes degradation predominantly in the fill factor (FF) under illumination. Electron traps are formed due to the reorganization of polymers and diffusion&#8208;limited aggregation of NFAs to assemble small isolated acceptor domains under illumination. These electron traps lead to losses mainly in FF, which is in contradistinction to the degradation mechanisms observed for fullerene&#8208;based OSCs. Control of the composition of NFAs close to the thermodynamic equilibrium limit while keeping adequate electron percolation and improving the initial polymer and NFA ordering are of the essence to stabilize the FF in NFA&#8208;based solar cells, which may be the key tactics to develop next&#8208;generation OSCs with high efficiency as well as excellent stability.

Abstract
A highly efficient cathode catalyst for rechargeable Li&#8211;CO2 batteries is successfully synthesized by implanting single iron atoms into 3D porous carbon architectures, consisting of interconnected N,S&#8208;codoped holey graphene (HG) sheets. The unique porous 3D hierarchical architecture of the catalyst with a large surface area and sufficient space within the interconnected HG framework can not only facilitate electron transport and CO2/Li+ diffusion, but also allow for a high uptake of Li2CO3 to ensure a high capacity. Consequently, the resultant rechargeable Li&#8211;CO2 batteries exhibit a low potential gap of &#8776;1.17 V at 100 mA g&#8722;1 and can be repeatedly charged and discharged for over 200 cycles with a cut&#8208;off capacity of 1000 mAh g&#8722;1 at a high current density of 1 A g&#8722;1. Density functional theory calculations are performed and the observed appealing catalytic performance is correlated with the hierarchical structure of the carbon catalyst. This work provides an effective approach to the development of highly efficient cathode catalysts for metal&#8211;CO2 batteries and beyond.

      <title>A ZnS/CaZnOS Heterojunction for Efficient Mechanical&#8208;to&#8208;Optical Energy Conversion by Conduction Band Offset</title>
      <dc:description>
The Mn&#8208;doped ZnS/CaZnOS semiconductor heterojunction system demonstrates more than double the mechanoluminescence performance of commercial ZnS. The superior performance arises from the band offset induced by the interfacial bonding region, which alleviates the barrier of electron excitation and transfer. The combination of Mn and Ln dopants achieves luminescence modulation covering the full spectrum.








Abstract
Actively collecting the mechanical energy by efficient conversion to other forms of energy such as light opens a new possibility of energy&#8208;saving, which is of pivotal significance for supplying potential solutions for the present energy crisis. Such energy conversion has shown promising applications in modern sensors, actuators, and energy harvesting. However, the implementation of such technologies is being hindered because most luminescent materials show weak and non&#8208;recoverable emissions under mechanical excitation. Herein, a new class of heterojunctioned ZnS/CaZnOS piezophotonic systems is presented, which displays highly reproducible mechanoluminescence (ML) with an unprecedented intensity of over two times higher than that of the widely used commercial ZnS (the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ML material). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the high&#8208;performance ML originates from efficient charge transfer and recombination through offset of the valence and conduction bands in the heterojunction interface region. By controlling the ZnS&#8208;to&#8208;CaZnOS ratio in conjunction with manganese (Mn2+) and lanthanide (Ln3+) doping, tunable ML across the full spectrum is activated by a small mechanical stimulus of 1 N (10 kPa). The findings demonstrate a novel strategy for constructing efficient ML materials by leveraging interface effects and ultimately promoting practical applications for ML.

Nonvolatile molybdenum telluride (MoTe2) p&#8211;n junctions with high rectification factor of 5 &#215; 105 are demonstrated by ferroelectric domains. Coupling to opposite polarized ferroelectric copolymers, electrons or holes accumulate in the corresponding region of the ambipolar MoTe2 channel, defining a p&#8208;n homojunction at the ferro&#8208;electric domain wall. The p&#8208;n junctions can be used as photodetectors and photovoltaic devices.








Abstract
Doped p&#8211;n junctions are fundamental electrical components in modern electronics and optoelectronics. Due to the development of device miniaturization, the emergence of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials may initiate the next technological leap toward the post&#8208;Moore era owing to their unique structures and physical properties. The purpose of fabricating 2D p&#8211;n junctions has fueled many carrier&#8208;type modulation methods, such as electrostatic doping, surface modification, and element intercalation. Here, by using the nonvolatile ferroelectric field polarized in the opposite direction, efficient carrier modulation in ambipolar molybdenum telluride (MoTe2) to form a p&#8211;n homojunction at the domain wall is demonstrated. The nonvolatile MoTe2 p&#8211;n junction can be converted to n&#8211;p, n&#8211;n, and p&#8211;p configurations by external gate voltage pulses. Both rectifier diodes exhibited excellent rectifying characteristics with a current on/off ratio of 5 &#215; 105. As a photodetector/photovoltaic, the device presents responsivity of 5 A W&#8722;1, external quantum efficiency of 40%, specific detectivity of 3 &#215; 1012 Jones, fast response time of 30 &#181;s, and power conversion efficiency of 2.5% without any bias or gate voltages. The MoTe2 p&#8211;n junction presents an obvious short&#8208;wavelength infrared photoresponse at room temperature, complementing the current infrared photodetectors with the inadequacies of complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor incompatibility and cryogenic operation temperature.

      <title>Photophoretic Levitation of Macroscopic Nanocardboard Plates</title>
      <dc:description>
Solid particles can levitate using photophoresis&#8212;light&#8208;driven airflow&#8212;but only when micrometer&#8208;scale in size. However, hollow plates with nanoscale thickness and microscopic channels exhibit photophoretic levitation at millimeter and centimeter scales. Light&#8208;driven thermal transpiration of air through the plate's channels creates jets that result in small&#8208;height hovering at atmospheric pressure or mid&#8208;air flight at reduced pressures, even allowing small payloads.








Abstract
Scaling down miniature rotorcraft and flapping&#8208;wing flyers to sub&#8208;centimeter dimensions is challenging due to complex electronics requirements, manufacturing limitations, and the increase in viscous damping at low Reynolds numbers. Photophoresis, or light&#8208;driven fluid flow, was previously used to levitate solid particles without any moving parts, but only with sizes of 1&#8211;20 &#181;m. Here, architected metamaterial plates with 50 nm thickness are leveraged to realize photophoretic levitation at the millimeter to centimeter scales. Instead of creating lift through conventional rotors or wings, the nanocardboard plates levitate due to light&#8208;induced thermal transpiration through microchannels within the plates, enabled by their extremely low mass and thermal conductivity. At atmospheric pressure, the plates hover above a solid substrate at heights of &#8776;0.5 mm by creating an air cushion beneath the plate. Moreover, at reduced pressures (10&#8211;200 Pa), the increased speed of thermal transpiration through the plate's channels creates an air jet that enables mid&#8208;air levitation and allows the plates to carry small payloads heavier than the plates themselves. The macroscopic metamaterial structures demonstrate the potential of this new mechanism of flight to realize nanotechnology&#8208;enabled flying vehicles without any moving parts in the Earth's upper atmosphere and at the surface of other planets.

      <title>Nitric Oxide Release Device for Remote&#8208;Controlled Cancer Therapy by Wireless Charging</title>
      <dc:description>
An implantable and wirelessly charged nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;release device (NO&#8208;wLED) capable of being remote&#8208;controlled is constructed to overcome the issue in that it is difficult to treat deep cancer by phototherapy due to the insufficient penetration capability of light. With irradiation in the body and the good tissue penetration of NO, suppression of orthotopic and postsurgery cancers is achieved.








Abstract
Traditional phototherapies face the issue that the insufficient penetration of light means it is difficult to reach deep lesions, which greatly reduces the feasibility of cancer therapy. Here, an implantable nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;release device is developed to achieve long&#8208;term, long&#8208;distance, remote&#8208;controllable gas therapy for cancer. The device consists of a wirelessly powered light&#8208;emitting diode (wLED) and S&#8208;nitrosoglutathione encapsulated with poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), obtaining the NO&#8208;release wLED (NO&#8208;wLED). It is found that NO release from the NO&#8208;wLED can be triggered by wireless charging and the concentration of produced NO reaches 0.43 &#215; 10&#8722;6 m min&#8722;1, which can achieve a killing effect on cancer cells. In vivo anticancer experiments exhibit obvious inhibitory effect on the growth of orthotopic cancer when the implanted NO&#8208;wLED is irradiated by wireless charging. In addition, recurrence of cancer can be prevented by NO produced from the NO&#8208;wLED after surgery. By illumination in the body, this strategy overcomes the poor penetration and long&#8208;wavelength dependence of traditional phototherapies, which also provides a promising approach for in vivo gas therapy remote&#8208;controlled by wireless charging.

      <title>Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Induced Ionic Sieving at Planar Graphene Oxide Heterojunctions for Miniaturized Water Desalination</title>
      <dc:description>
Non&#8208;size&#8208;based ionic sieving is achieved with planar heterogeneous graphene oxide membranes. Following the mechanism, a prototype water desalination device, termed planar heterogeneous interface desalination, is accomplished with 97.0% rejection rate for NaCl and high water flux of 1529 L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1 via an inverted T&#8208;shaped water&#8208;extraction mode.








Abstract
Layered graphene oxide membranes (GOMs) offer a unique platform for precise sieving of small ions and molecules due to controlled sub&#8208;nanometer&#8208;wide interlayer distance and versatile surface chemistry. Pristine and chemically modified GOMs effectively block organic dyes and nanoparticles, but fail to exclude smaller ions with hydrated diameters less than 9 &#197;. Toward sieving of small inorganic salt ions, a number of strategies are proposed by reducing the interlayer spacing down to merely several angstroms. However, one critical challenge for such compressed GOMs is the extremely low water flux (&lt;0.1 Lm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1) that prevents these innovative nanomaterials from being used in real&#8208;world applications. Here, a planar heterogeneous graphene oxide membrane (PHGOM) with both nearly perfect salt rejection and high water flux is reported. Horizontal ion transport through oppositely charged GO multilayer lateral heterojunction exhibits bi&#8208;unipolar transport behavior, blocking the conduction of both cations and anions. Assisted by a forward electric field, salt concentration is depleted in the near&#8208;neutral transition area of the PHGOM. In this situation, deionized water can be extracted from the depletion zone. Following this mechanism, a high rejection rate of 97.0% for NaCl and water flux of 1529 Lm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1 at the outlet via an inverted T&#8208;shaped water extraction mode are achieved.

      <title>A Hybrid Eukaryotic&#8211;Prokaryotic Nanoplatform with Photothermal Modality for Enhanced Antitumor Vaccination</title>
      <dc:description>
To improve the functionality and expandability of biomimetic nanoplatforms for cancer therapy, a eukaryotic&#8211;prokaryotic vesicle (EPV) is engineered by fusing melanoma cytomembrane vesicles and attenuated Salmonella outer membrane vesicles. Inheriting the virtues of the parent ingredients, the EPV integrates tumor antigens with natural adjuvants, exhibiting great potential for immunotherapy.

Abstract
Cytomembrane&#8208;derived nanoplatforms are an effective biomimetic strategy in cancer therapy. To improve their functionality and expandability for enhanced vaccination, a eukaryotic&#8211;prokaryotic vesicle (EPV) nanoplatform is designed and constructed by fusing melanoma cytomembrane vesicles (CMVs) and attenuated Salmonella outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). Inheriting the virtues of the parent components, the EPV integrates melanoma antigens with natural adjuvants for robust immunotherapy and can be readily functionalized with complementary therapeutics. In vivo prophylactic testing reveals that the EPV nanoformulation can be utilized as a prevention vaccine to stimulate the immune system and trigger the antitumor immune response, combating tumorigenesis. In the melanoma model, the poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid)&#8211;indocyanine green (ICG) moiety (PI)&#8208;implanted EPV (PI@EPV) in conjunction with localized photothermal therapy with durable immune inhibition shows synergetic antitumor effects as a therapeutic vaccine. The eukaryotic&#8211;prokaryotic fusion strategy provides new perspectives for the design of tumor&#8208;immunogenic, self&#8208;adjuvanting, and expandable vaccine platforms.

&lt;p&gt;To improve the functionality and expandability of biomimetic nanoplatforms for cancer therapy, a eukaryotic&#8211;prokaryotic vesicle (EPV) is engineered by fusing melanoma cytomembrane vesicles and attenuated &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; outer membrane vesicles. Inheriting the virtues of the parent ingredients, the EPV integrates tumor antigens with natural adjuvants, exhibiting great potential for immunotherapy. Moreover, it can be readily functionalized with complementary therapeutics for enhanced anticancer vaccination.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cytomembrane&#8208;derived nanoplatforms are an effective biomimetic strategy in cancer therapy. To improve their functionality and expandability for enhanced vaccination, a eukaryotic&#8211;prokaryotic vesicle (EPV) nanoplatform is designed and constructed by fusing melanoma cytomembrane vesicles (CMVs) and attenuated &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). Inheriting the virtues of the parent components, the EPV integrates melanoma antigens with natural adjuvants for robust immunotherapy and can be readily functionalized with complementary therapeutics. In vivo prophylactic testing reveals that the EPV nanoformulation can be utilized as a prevention vaccine to stimulate the immune system and trigger the antitumor immune response, combating tumorigenesis. In the melanoma model, the poly(lactic&#8208;&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;glycolic acid)&#8211;indocyanine green (ICG) moiety (PI)&#8208;implanted EPV (PI@EPV) in conjunction with localized photothermal therapy with durable immune inhibition shows synergetic antitumor effects as a therapeutic vaccine. The eukaryotic&#8211;prokaryotic fusion strategy provides new perspectives for the design of tumor&#8208;immunogenic, self&#8208;adjuvanting, and expandable vaccine platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Magnetic Proximity Effect in Graphene/CrBr3 van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <dc:description>
The magnetic proximity effect (MPE) in 2D graphene/CrBr3 van der Waals heterostructures is probed by the Zeeman spin Hall effect via non&#8208;local transport measurements; estimation of the Zeeman splitting energy demonstrates a significant magnetic proximity exchange field. The newly observed anomalous longitudinal resistances at the Dirac point with magnetic field may be attributed to the new phases of the ground state induced by MPE.








Abstract
2D van der Waals heterostructures serve as a promising platform to exploit various physical phenomena in a diverse range of novel spintronic device applications. Efficient spin injection is the prerequisite for these devices. The recent discovery of magnetic 2D materials leads to the possibility of fully 2D van der Waals spintronics devices by implementing spin injection through the magnetic proximity effect (MPE). Here, the investigation of MPE in 2D graphene/CrBr3 van der Waals heterostructures is reported, which is probed by the Zeeman spin Hall effect through non&#8208;local measurements. Quantitative estimation of the Zeeman splitting field demonstrates a significant MPE field even in a low magnetic field. Furthermore, the observed anomalous longitudinal resistance changes at the Dirac point RXX,D with increasing magnetic field near &#957;&#8197;= 0 may be attributed to the MPE&#8208;induced new ground state phases. This MPE revealed in the graphene/CrBr3 van der Waals heterostructures therefore provides a solid physics basis and key functionality for next&#8208;generation 2D spin logic and memory devices.

      <title>Dopant&#8208;Free Organic Hole&#8208;Transporting Material for Efficient and Stable Inverted All&#8208;Inorganic and Hybrid Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
A new S&#8208;atom&#8208;containing small molecule (TPE&#8208;S) is introduced as a dopant&#8208;free hole&#8208;transporting layer in all&#8208;inorganic and organic/inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) with a p&#8211;i&#8211;n inverted structure, leading to improved power conversion efficiencies of 15.4% and 21%, respectively. In addition, these devices also show enhanced photostability, with performance comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PVSCs based on the conventional n&#8211;i&#8211;p structure.








Abstract
Designing new hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) with desired chemical, electrical, and electronic properties is critical to realize efficient and stable inverted perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) with a p&#8211;i&#8211;n structure. Herein, the synthesis of a novel 3D small molecule named TPE&#8208;S and its application as an HTM in PVSCs are shown. The all&#8208;inorganic inverted PVSCs made using TPE&#8208;S, processed without any dopant or post&#8208;treatment, are highly efficient and stable. Compared to control devices based on the commonly used HTM, PEDOT:PSS, devices based on TPE&#8208;S exhibit improved optoelectronic properties, more favorable interfacial energetics, and reduced recombination due to an improved trap passivation effect. As a result, the all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI2Br PVSCs based on TPE&#8208;S demonstrate a remarkable efficiency of 15.4% along with excellent stability, which is the one of the highest reported values for inverted all&#8208;inorganic PVSCs. Meanwhile, the TPE&#8208;S layer can also be generally used to improve the performance of organic/inorganic hybrid inverted PVSCs, which show an outstanding power conversation efficiency of 21.0%, approaching the highest reported efficiency for inverted PVSCs. This work highlights the great potential of TPE&#8208;S as a simple and general dopant&#8208;free HTM for different types of high&#8208;performance PVSCs.

      <title>Stretchable Cephalopod&#8208;Inspired Multimodal Camouflage Systems</title>
      <dc:description>
Soft, stretchable materials and systems that can manipulate both light and heat are desirable for a variety of applications. Multimodal camouflage platforms are designed by drawing inspiration from cephalopod skin and developed by leveraging a high&#8208;performance stretchable proton conductor. The reported devices feature a straightforward working mechanism, multispectral functionality in the visible and infrared light, rapid response times, and excellent stability.








Abstract
Soft, mechanically deformable materials and systems that can, on demand, manipulate light propagation within both the visible and infrared (IR) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum are desirable for applications that include sensing, optoelectronics, robotics, energy conservation, and thermal management. However, the development of such technologies remains exceptionally difficult, with relatively few examples reported to date. Herein, this challenge is addressed by engineering cephalopod&#8208;inspired adaptive camouflage platforms with multispectral functionality. First, stretchable copolymer membranes that feature outstanding unstrained protonic conductivities of up to &#8776;90 mS cm&#8722;1, demonstrate increases of &#8776;80% in their conductivities at strains of 200%, and exhibit no loss in electrical performance even under extreme elongations of 500% are described. Next, the membranes are used for the fabrication of mechanically and electrically actuated camouflage devices that function over an unprecedented spectral window; can simultaneously modulate their visible and IR specular&#8208;to&#8208;diffuse transmittance ratios by &gt;3000&#8208;fold and &gt;4&#8208;fold, respectively; feature rapid response times of &#8776;0.6 s; and exhibit good performance after repeated actuation. These findings may afford new scientific and technological opportunities not only for adaptive optics and photonics but also for any platform that can benefit from simultaneously controlling visible light and heat.

      <title>The Structural Origins of Wood Cell Wall Toughness</title>
      <dc:description>
In situ scanning electron microscopy fracture tests reveal a previously unknown strategy for wood to improve its splitting fracture toughness: deflecting and trapping cracks along a tough interface. The structural origin of the toughness is the specific arrangement of the cellulose microfibrils at the S1/S2 cell wall interface, which can be mimicked to improve the toughness of engineering fiber&#8208;reinforced composites.








Abstract
The remarkable mechanical stability of wood is primarily attributed to the hierarchical fibrous arrangement of the polymeric components. While the mechanisms by which fibrous cell structure and cellulose microfibril arrangements lend stiffness and strength to wood have been intensively studied, the structural origins of the relatively high splitting fracture toughness remain unclear. This study relates cellulose microfibril arrangements to splitting fracture toughness in pine wood cell walls using in situ electron microscopy and reveals a previously unknown toughening mechanism: the specific arrangement of cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall deflects cracks from the S2 layer to the S1/S2 interface, and, once there, causes the crack to be repetitively arrested and shunted along the interface in a zig&#8208;zag path. It is suggested that this natural adaptation of wood to achieve tough interfaces and then deflect and trap cracks at them can be generalized to provide design guidelines to improve toughness of high&#8208;performance and renewable engineering materials.

      <title>Necroptosis&#8208;Inducible Polymeric Nanobubbles for Enhanced Cancer Sonoimmunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Necroptosis&#8208;inducible nanobubbles (NBs) facilitate cell&#8208;membrane rupture via the acoustic cavitation effect, leading to RIPK3&#8208;independent necroptosis. These may elicit the enhanced immunogenicity of dying cells and damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, compared to apoptosis inducers. Under ultrasound irradiation, NBs significantly improve the therapeutic response of immune checkpoint blockade therapy and demonstrate beneficial antitumor efficacy against metastatic tumors.








Abstract
Necroptosis, caspase&#8208;independent programmed necrosis, has emerged as a therapeutic target to make dying cancer cells stimulants for antitumor immune responses. The clinical translations exploiting necroptosis, however, have been limited since most cancer cells downregulate receptor&#8208;interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) as a key enzyme for necroptosis. Herein, nanobubbles (NBs) that can trigger RIPK3&#8208;independent necroptosis, facilitating cell&#8208;membrane rupture via the acoustic cavitation effect are reported. The NBs, imbibing perfluoropentane as the gas precursor, are prepared using an amphiphilic polymer conjugate, composed of PEGylated carboxymethyl dextran as the hydrophilic backbone and chlorin e6 as the hydrophobic sonosensitizer. When exposed to ultrasound, the NBs efficiently promote the release of biologically active damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns by inducing burst&#8208;mediated cell&#8208;membrane disintegration. Consequently, the necroptosis&#8208;inducible NBs significantly improve antitumor immunity by maturation of dendritic cells and activation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the combination of NBs and immune checkpoint blockade leads to complete regression of the primary tumor and beneficial therapeutic activity against metastatic tumors in an RIPK3&#8208;deficient CT26 tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model. Overall, the innovative NB that causes immunogenic cell death of cancer via RIPK3&#8208;independent necroptosis is a promising enhancer for cancer immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;Necroptosis&#8208;inducible nanobubbles (NBs) facilitate cell&#8208;membrane rupture via the acoustic cavitation effect, leading to RIPK3&#8208;independent necroptosis. These may elicit the enhanced immunogenicity of dying cells and damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, compared to apoptosis inducers. Under ultrasound irradiation, NBs significantly improve the therapeutic response of immune checkpoint blockade therapy and demonstrate beneficial antitumor efficacy against metastatic tumors.

      <title>Edge&#8208;Rich Fe&#8722;N4 Active Sites in Defective Carbon for Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
A series of atomic Fe catalysts with adjustable configurations is synthesized to demonstrate the superiority of edge nitrogen&#8208;modified divacancy (ND) trapped Fe sites to intact center models in acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).








Abstract
Controllably constructing nitrogen&#8208;modified divacancies (ND) in carbon substrates to immobilize atomic Fe species and unveiling the advantageous configuration is still challenging, but indispensable for attaining optimal Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, a fundamental investigation of unfolding intrinsically superior edge&#8208;ND trapped atomic Fe motifs (e&#8208;ND&#8722;Fe) relative to an intact center model (c&#8208;ND&#8722;Fe) in ORR electrocatalysis is reported. Density functional theory calculations reveal that local electronic redistribution and bandgap shrinkage for e&#8208;ND&#8722;Fe endow it with a lower free&#8208;energy barrier toward direct four&#8208;electron ORR. Inspired by this, a series of atomic Fe catalysts with adjustable ND&#8722;Fe coordination are synthesized, which verify that ORR performance highly depends on the concentration of e&#8208;ND&#8722;Fe species. Remarkably, the best e&#8208;ND&#8722;Fe catalyst delivers a favorable kinetic current density and halfwave potential that can be comparable to benchmark Pt&#8722;C under acidic conditions. This work will guide to develop highly active atomic metal catalysts through rational defect engineering.

      <title>A Microchannel&#8208;Confined Crystallization Strategy Enables Blade Coating of Perovskite Single Crystal Arrays for Device Integration</title>
      <dc:description>
A microchannel&#8208;confined crystallization (MCC) strategy is proposed for scalable deposition of high&#8208;quality perovskite single crystal (PSC) arrays through blade coating. The resultant PSC arrays exhibit perfect single&#8208;crystalline nature and possess excellent optoelectronic properties. An image sensor based on the PSC arrays demonstrates a high&#8208;sensitivity and high&#8208;resolution imaging capability with a broad linear dynamic range and a large detectivity.








Abstract
Perovskite single crystals (PSCs) possess superior optoelectronic properties compared to their corresponding polycrystalline films, but their applications of PSCs in high&#8208;performance, integrated devices are hindered by their heavy thickness and difficulty in scalable deposition. Here, a microchannel&#8208;confined crystallization (MCC) strategy to grow uniform and large&#8208;area PSC arrays for integrated device applications is reported. Benefiting from the confinement effect of the microchannels, solution flow dynamics is well controlled, and thus uniform deposition of PSC arrays with suitable thickness is achieved, meaning they are applicable for scale&#8208;up device applications. The resulting PSCs possess excellent optoelectronic properties in terms of a long carrier lifetime (175 ns) and an ultralow defect density (2 &#215; 109 cm&#8722;3), which are comparable to the corresponding bulk crystals. The unique embedded structure of PSCs within the microchannels allows the construction of a high&#8208;integration image sensor. This work paves the way toward high&#8208;throughput growth of PSCs for integrated optoelectronic devices.

      <title>An Integrated Flexible All&#8208;Nanowire Infrared Sensing System with Record Photosensitivity</title>
      <dc:description>
A simple and highly integrated IR detection amplification system is designed for high&#8208;performance IR imaging applications with record photosensitivity, which provides a new perspective for constructing high&#8208;performance IR imaging system.








Abstract
Infrared (IR) photodetectors are a key optoelectronic device and have thus attracted considerable research attention in recent years. Photosensitivity is an increasingly important device performance parameter for nanoscale photodetectors and image sensors, as it determines the ultimate imaging quality and contrast. However, photosensitivities of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art low&#8208;dimensional nanostructure&#8208;based IR detectors are considerably low, limiting their practical applications. Herein, a biomimetic IR detection amplification (IRDA) system that boosts photosensitivity by several orders of magnitude by introducting nanowire field effect transistors (FETs), resulting in a peak photosensitivity of 7.6 &#215; 104 under an illumination of 1342 nm, is presented. Consequently, high&#8208;contrast imaging of IR light is obtained on the flexible IRDA arrays. The image information can be then trained and recognized by an artificial neural network for higher image&#8208;recognition efficiency. This work provides a new perspective for developing high&#8208;performance IR imaging systems, and is expected to undoubtedly enlighten future work on artificial intelligence and biorobotic systems.

      <title>Omnidirectional Photodetectors Based on Spatial Resonance Asymmetric Facade via a 3D Self&#8208;Standing Strategy</title>
      <dc:description>
A structure and function integrated printing method is proposed for preparing 3D facade&#8208;based photodetectors between predesigned gold electrodes. Due to the enlarged cross section in the 3D asymmetric rectangular structure, the facade photodetectors with branched geometry achieve omnidirectional angle detection. This strategy provides a general guidance toward novel 3D nanostructured photoelectric devices.








Abstract
Integration of photovoltaic materials directly into 3D light&#8211;matter resonance architectures can extend their functionality beyond traditional optoelectronics. Semiconductor structures at subwavelength scale naturally possess optical resonances, which provides the possibility to manipulate light&#8211;matter interactions. In this work, a structure and function integrated printing method to remodel 2D film to 3D self&#8208;standing facade between predesigned gold electrodes, realizing the advancement of structure and function from 2D to 3D, is demonstrated. Due to the enlarged cross section in the 3D asymmetric rectangular structure, the facade photodetectors possess sensitive light&#8211;matter interaction. The single 3D facade photodetectors can measure the incident angle of light in 3D space with a 10&#176; angular resolution. The resonance interaction of the incident light at different illumination angles and the 3D subwavelength photosensitive facade is analyzed by the simulated light flow in the facade. The 3D facade structure enhances the manipulation of the light&#8211;matter interaction and extends metasurface nanophotonics to a wider range of materials. The monitoring of dynamic variation is achieved in a single facade photodetector. Together with the flexibility of structure and function integrated printing strategy, three and four branched photodetectors extend the angle detection to omnidirectional ranges, which will be significant for the development of 3D angle&#8208;sensing devices.

      <title>Strongly Surface State Carrier&#8208;Dependent Spin&#8211;Orbit Torque in Magnetic Topological Insulators</title>
      <dc:description>
The spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT) in topological insulators is quantitatively investigated, demonstrating a drastic decrease of the spin Hall angle as the temperature increases. A competition between the top and bottom topological surface states (TSS) in contributing to the SOT is also observed. The strong dependence of SOT on TSS carriers reveals the unique role of TSS in generating SOT.








Abstract
The topological surface states (TSS) in topological insulators (TIs) can exert strong spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT) on adjacent magnetization, offering great potential in implementing energy&#8208;efficient magnetic memory devices. However, there are large discrepancies among the reported spin Hall angle values in TIs, and its temperature dependence still remains elusive. Here, the spin Hall angle in a modulation&#8208;doped Cr&#8208;BixSb2&#8722;xTe3 (Cr&#8208;BST) film is quantitatively determined via both transport and optic approaches, where consistent results are obtained. A large spin Hall angle of &#8776;90 in the modulation&#8208;doped Cr&#8208;BST film is demonstrated at 2.5 K, and the spin Hall angle drastically decreases to 0.3&#8211;0.5 as the temperature increases. Moreover, by tuning the top TSS carrier concentration, a competition between the top and bottom TSS in contributing to SOT is observed. The above phenomena can account for the large discrepancies among the previously reported spin Hall angle values and reveal the unique role of TSS in generating SOT.

      <title>Deterministic Magnetization Switching Using Lateral Spin&#8211;Orbit Torque</title>
      <dc:description>
Deterministic current&#8208;induced full magnetization switching is realized in locally laser annealed Pt/Co/Pt trilayers. In zero magnetic field, the switching direction depends on the location of the laser track, regardless of the net polarization of external out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin currents. This result is ascribed to an effect of lateral spin&#8211;orbit torque induced by the lateral Pt&#8211;Co interface after localized laser annealing.








Abstract
Current&#8208;induced magnetization switching by spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT) holds considerable promise for next generation ultralow&#8208;power memory and logic applications. In most cases, generation of spin&#8211;orbit torques has relied on an external injection of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin currents into the magnetic layer, while an external magnetic field along the electric current direction is generally required for realizing deterministic switching by SOT. Here, deterministic current&#8208;induced SOT full magnetization switching by lateral spin&#8211;orbit torque in zero external magnetic field is reported. The Pt/Co/Pt magnetic structure is locally annealed by a laser track along the in&#8208;plane current direction, resulting in a lateral Pt gradient within the ferromagnetic layer, as confirmed by microstructure and chemical composition analysis. In zero magnetic field, the direction of the deterministic current&#8208;induced magnetization switching depends on the location of the laser track, but shows no dependence on the net polarization of external out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin currents. From the behavior under external magnetic fields, two independent mechanisms giving rise to SOT are identified, i.e., the lateral Pt&#8211;Co asymmetry as well as out&#8208;of&#8208;plane injected spin currents, where the polarization and the magnitude of the SOT in the former case depends on the relative location and the laser power of the annealing track.

      <title>Magnetic Retrieval of Encapsulated Beta Cell Transplants from Diabetic Mice Using Dual&#8208;Function MRI Visible and Retrievable Microcapsules</title>
      <dc:description>
Magnetic hydrogel capsules containing iron oxide nanoparticles are developed for islet encapsulation. These capsules restore normal glycaemia and remain responsive to magnetic fields following transplant into diabetic mice. This enables MRI imaging of transplant grafts in vivo and facile surgical retrieval of transplants in applied magnetic fields. This system overcomes previous limitations in capsule tracking and retrieval post&#8208;transplant.








Abstract
Encapsulated beta cell transplantation offers a potential cure for a subset of diabetic patients. Once transplanted, beta cell grafts can help to restore glycemic control; however, locating and retrieving cells in the event of graft failure may pose a surgical challenge. Here, a dual&#8208;function nanoparticle&#8208;loaded hydrogel microcapsule is developed that enables graft retrieval under an applied magnetic field. Additionally, this system facilitates graft localization via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and graft isolation from the immune system. Iron oxide nanoparticles encapsulated within alginate hydrogel capsules containing viable islets are transplanted and the in vitro and in vivo retrieval of capsules containing nanoparticles functionalized with various ligands are compared. Capsules containing islets co&#8208;encapsulated with COOH&#8208;coated nanoparticles restore normal glycemia in immunocompetent diabetic mice for at least 6 weeks, can be visualized using MRI, and are retrievable in a magnetic field. Application of a magnetic field for 90 s via a magnetically assisted retrieval device facilitates rapid retrieval of up to 94% (&#177;3.1%) of the transplant volume 24 h after surgical implantation. This strategy aids monitoring of cell&#8208;capsule locations in vivo, facilitates graft removal at the end of the transplant lifetime, and may be applicable to many encapsulated cell transplant systems.

      <title>Highly Stable Phosphonate&#8208;Based MOFs with Engineered Bandgaps for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
      <dc:description>
Phosphonate metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunable gaps are presented. Taking advantage of the controllable compositions and functionalities of MOFs, a titanium&#8208;phosphonate&#8208;based MOF for highly stable photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is showcased. The electron&#8208;donating effect of the functional groups in the phosphonic ligands significantly modifies the electronic structure, thus promoting the photocatalytic activity.








Abstract
Photoactive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) represent one of the most promising materials for photocatalytic hydrogen production, but phosphonate&#8208;based MOFs have remained largely underdeveloped compared to other conventional MOFs. Herein, a photocatalyst of 1D titanium phosphonate MOF is designed through an easy and scalable stirring hydrothermal method. Homogeneous incorporation of organophosphonic linkers can narrow the bandgap, which is due to the strong electron&#8208;donating ability of the &#63743;OH functional group that can efficiently shift the top of the valence band, moving the light absorption to the visible portion of the spectrum. In addition, the unique 1D nanowire topology enhances the photoinduced charge carrier transport and separation. Accordingly, the titanium phosphonate nanowires deliver remarkably enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity under irradiation of both visible light and a full&#8208;spectrum simulator. Such concepts of engineering both nanostructures and electronic states herald a new paradigm for designing MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

Abstract
Delicate design of nanostructures for oxygen&#8208;evolution electrocatalysts is an important strategy for accelerating the reaction kinetics of water splitting. In this work, Ni&#8211;Fe layered&#8208;double&#8208;hydroxide (LDH) nanocages with tunable shells are synthesized via a facile one&#8208;pot self&#8208;templating method. The number of shells can be precisely controlled by regulating the template etching at the interface. Benefiting from the double&#8208;shelled structure with large electroactive surface area and optimized chemical composition, the hierarchical Ni&#8211;Fe LDH nanocages exhibit appealing electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolyte. Particularly, double&#8208;shelled Ni&#8211;Fe LDH nanocages can achieve a current density of 20 mA cm&#8722;2 at a low overpotential of 246 mV with excellent stability.

      <title>A Size&#8208;Changeable Collagenase&#8208;Modified Nanoscavenger for Increasing Penetration and Retention of Nanomedicine in Deep Tumor Tissue</title>
      <dc:description>
A size&#8208;changeable collagenase&#8208;modified nanoscavenger is successfully developed, in which the collagenase&#8208;containing components change from hydrophobic to hydrophilic in an acidic tumor microenvironment. Some of the components dissolve into deep tumor tissues to clear the barriers of nanoparticle (NP) delivery, enhancing the penetration of the NPs; the others cause the an increase of the NPs' size, resulting in an enhanced intratumoral retention.








Abstract
The complex tumor microenvironment constitutes a variety of barriers to prevent nanoparticles (NPs) delivery and results in extremely low accumulation of nanomedicines in solid tumors. Here, a newly developed size&#8208;changeable collagenase&#8208;modified polymer micelle is employed to enhance the penetration and retention of nanomedicine in deep tumor tissue. The TCPPB micelle is first formed by self&#8208;assembly of maleimide&#8208;terminated poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester) (MAL&#8208;PEG&#8208;PBAE) and succinic anhydride&#8208;modified cisplatin&#8208;conjugated poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;triphenylphosphonium (CDDP&#8208;PCL&#8208;PEO&#8208;TPP). Next, Col&#8208;TCPPB NPs are prepared through a &#8220;click&#8221; chemical combination of thiolated collagenase and maleimide groups on TCPPB micelle. Finally, biocompatible chondroitin sulfate (CS) is coated to obtain CS/Col&#8208;TCPPB NPs for avoiding collagenase inactivation in blood circulation. In tumor acidic microenvironment, the hydrophobic PBAE segments of the resultant micelles become hydrophilic, leading to a dissociation and subsequent dissolution of partial collagenase&#8208;containing components (Col&#8208;PEG&#8208;PBAE) from NPs. The dissolved Col&#8208;PEG&#8208;PBAE promotes the digestion of collagen fibers in tumor tissue like a scavenger, which enhances the NPs penetration. Simultaneously, the increased hydrophilicity of residual Col&#8208;PEG&#8208;PBAE in the micellar matrix causes an expansion of the NPs, resulting in an enhanced intratumoral retention. In tumor cells, the NPs target to release the cisplatin drugs into mitochondria, achieving an excellent anticancer efficacy.

      <title>A New Conducting Polymer with Exceptional Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalytic Activity Derived from Barbituric Acid Polycondensation</title>
      <dc:description>
Barbituric acid (BA) is condensed at 300 &#176;C (BA300) to the oligomer crystal with an optimum conjugated electronic system and is a semiconductor with a bandgap of 2.20 eV. A trimer precipitates from the reaction mixture as the primary product of the condensation reaction. The BA300 photocatalyst removes rhodamine B with 96% photodegradation efficiency after 70 min exposure to visible light.








Abstract
A novel covalent, metal&#8208;free, photocatalytic material is prepared by thermal polymerization of barbituric acid (BA). The structure of the photocatalyst is analyzed by using scanning electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and infrared, UV&#8211;visible, and 1H solution and 13C solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The photodegradation efficiency of BA thermally polymerized at different temperatures is tested by photocatalytic degradation of aquatic rhodamine B (RhB) dye under visible&#8208;light irradiation. It is shown that heating BA at an optimized temperature of 300 &#176;C, that is, still in the range that polymer&#8208;like polycondensation takes place, results in a photocatalyst that can remove RhB with 96% photodegradation efficiency after 70 min exposure to visible light. The polycondensation reaction of BA is identified to process through precipitation of trimer units as primary building blocks. Reference experiments such as addition of scavengers and saturation with oxygen are studied to understand the photodegradation process. It is shown that the presence of triethanolamine, and excess of oxygen and p&#8208;benzoquinone in the solution of RhB and photocatalyst (BA300) is not beneficial, but decreases the photodegradation efficiency.

      <title>Efficient Energy Funneling in Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskites: From Light Emission to Lasing</title>
      <dc:description>
Quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper halide perovskite thin films with preferential crystal orientation are achieved via solvent engineering. Such highly oriented quasi&#8208;2D films are shown to be suitable for high&#8208;efficiency light&#8208;emitting diodes and low&#8208;threshold amplified spontaneous emission due to the efficient energy transfer from the high&#8208;bandgap domains to low&#8208;bandgap domains. A green&#8208;emission distributed feedback laser is demonstrated.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper halide perovskites with a large exciton binding energy, self&#8208;assembled quantum wells, and high quantum yield draw attention for optoelectronic device applications. Thin films of these quasi&#8208;2D perovskites consist of a mixture of domains having different dimensionality, allowing energy funneling from lower&#8208;dimensional nanosheets (high&#8208;bandgap domains) to 3D nanocrystals (low&#8208;bandgap domains). High&#8208;quality quasi&#8208;2D perovskite (PEA)2(FA)3Pb4Br13 films are fabricated by solution engineering. Grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering measurements are conducted to study the crystal orientation, and transient absorption spectroscopy measurements are conducted to study the charge&#8208;carrier dynamics. These data show that highly oriented 2D crystal films have a faster energy transfer from the high&#8208;bandgap domains to the low&#8208;bandgap domains (&lt;0.5 ps) compared to the randomly oriented films. High&#8208;performance light&#8208;emitting diodes can be realized with these highly oriented 2D films. Finally, amplified spontaneous emission with a low threshold 4.16 &#181;J cm&#8722;2 is achieved and distributed feedback lasers are also demonstrated. These results show that it is important to control the morphology of the quasi&#8208;2D films to achieve efficient energy transfer, which is a critical requirement for light&#8208;emitting devices.

Abstract
Semiconductor nanowires have been playing a crucial role in the development of nanoscale devices for the realization of spin qubits, Majorana fermions, single photon emitters, nanoprocessors, etc. The monolithic growth of site&#8208;controlled nanowires is a prerequisite toward the next generation of devices that will require addressability and scalability.

This is achieved by a novel growth process that uses a SiGe strain&#8208;relaxation template and can be potentially generalized to other material combinations. Transport measurements show an electrically tunable spin&#8211;orbit coupling, with a spin&#8211;orbit length similar to that of III&#8211;V materials.

      <title>A High&#8208;Performance Li&#8211;Mn&#8211;O Li&#8208;rich Cathode Material with Rhombohedral Symmetry via Intralayer Li/Mn Disordering</title>
      <dc:description>
Intralayer Li/Mn disordering within the Mn&#8208;layer in Li&#8211;Mn&#8211;O cathode reduces distortion caused by the ionic radius difference and promotes the formation of a structure with R3&#175;m symmetry. The unique structure contributes to excellent comprehensive properties: more uniform and less active O states; lower bandgap; a changed delithiation order; and fast Li&#8208;ion mobility. These lead to good stability and rate capability.








Abstract
The search for new high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost cathode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries is a challenging issue in materials research. Commonly used cobalt&#8208; or nickel&#8208;based cathodes suffer from limited resources and safety problems that greatly restrict their large&#8208;scale application, especially for electric vehicles and large&#8208;scale energy storage. Here, a novel Li&#8211;Mn&#8211;O Li&#8208;rich cathode material with R3&#175;m symmetry is developed via intralayer Li/Mn disordering in the Mn&#8208;layer. Due to the special atomic arrangement and higher R3&#175;m symmetry with respect to the C2/m symmetry, the oxygen redox activity is modulated and the Li in the Li&#8208;layer is preferentially thermodynamically extracted from the crystal structure instead of Li in the Mn&#8208;layer. The as&#8208;obtained material delivers a reversible capacity of over 300 mAh g&#8722;1 at 25 mA g&#8722;1 and rate capability of up to 260 mAh g&#8722;1 at 250 mA g&#8722;1 within 2.0&#8211;4.8 V. The excellent performance is attributed to its highly structural reversibility, mitigation of Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, lower bandgap, and faster Li&#8208;ion 2D channels during the lithium&#8208;ion de/intercalation process. This material is not only a promising cathode material candidate but also raises new possibilities for the design of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance cathode materials.

     alt="A High&#8208;Performance Li&#8211;Mn&#8211;O Li&#8208;rich Cathode Material with Rhombohedral Symmetry via Intralayer Li/Mn Disordering"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intralayer Li/Mn disordering within the Mn&#8208;layer in Li&#8211;Mn&#8211;O cathode reduces distortion caused by the ionic radius difference and promotes the formation of a structure with R3&#175;m symmetry. The unique structure contributes to excellent comprehensive properties: more uniform and less active O states; lower bandgap; a changed delithiation order; and fast Li&#8208;ion mobility. These lead to good stability and rate capability.

      <title>A Universal Approach to Aqueous Energy Storage via Ultralow&#8208;Cost Electrolyte with Super&#8208;Concentrated Sugar as Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Regulated Solute</title>
      <dc:description>
Super&#8208;concentrated sugars are used to regulate the hydrogen bond of water by breaking its fully hydrogen&#8208;bonded structure in ultralow&#8208;cost ionic electrolytes, with the positive effects of an expanded electrochemical stability window, very low freezing point, and fair ionic conductivity. Universal performance improvements are realized in the aqueous energy&#8208;storage systems using the super&#8208;concentrated sugar&#8208;based electrolytes.








Abstract
Aqueous energy&#8208;storage systems have attracted wide attention due to their advantages such as high security, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the specific chemical properties of water induce the problems of narrow electrochemical stability window, low stability of water&#8211;electrode interface reactions, and dissolution of electrode materials and intermediate products. Therefore, new low&#8208;cost aqueous electrolytes with different water chemistry are required. The nature of water depends largely on its hydroxyl&#8208;based hydrogen bonding structure. Therefore, the super&#8208;concentrated hydroxyl&#8208;rich sugar solutions are designed to change the original hydrogen bonding structure of water. The super&#8208;concentrated sugars can reduce the free water molecules and destroy the tetrahedral structure, thus lowering the binding degree of water molecules by breaking the hydrogen bonds. The ionic electrolytes based on super&#8208;concentrated sugars have the expanded electrochemical stability window (up to 2.812 V), wide temperature adaptability (&#8211;50 to 80 &#176;C), and fair ionic conductivity (8.536 mS cm&#8722;1). Aqueous lithium&#8208;, sodium&#8208;, potassium&#8208;ion batteries and supercapacitors using super&#8208;concentrated sugar&#8208;based electrolytes demonstrate an excellent electrochemical performance. The advantages of ultralow cost and high universality enable a great practical application potential of the super&#8208;concentrated sugar&#8208;based aqueous electrolytes, which can also provide great experimental and theoretical assistance for further research in water chemistry.

      <title>Binding Zinc Ions by Carboxyl Groups from Adjacent Molecules toward Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Organic Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
An aqueous zinc battery is proposed by using sulfur heterocyclic quinone dibenzo[b,i]thianthrene&#8208;5,7,12,14&#8208;tetraone (DTT) as the cathode, showing high capacity and fast kinetics. Benefitting from the improved molecular stability and the inherent low solubility of DTT, the battery exhibits a superlong life of 23&#8239;000 cycles, which is much superior to previous reports.








Abstract
The newly emerged aqueous Zn&#8211;organic batteries are attracting extensive attention as a promising candidate for energy storage. However, most of them suffer from the unstable and/or soluble nature of organic molecules, showing limited cycle life (&#8804;3000 cycles) that is far away from the requirement (10 000 cycles) for grid&#8208;scale energy storage. Here, a new aqueous zinc battery is proposed by using sulfur heterocyclic quinone dibenzo[b,i]thianthrene&#8208;5,7,12,14&#8208;tetraone (DTT) as the cathode. The cell shows a high reversible capacity of 210.9 mAh gDTT&#8722;1 at 50 mA gDTT&#8722;1 with a high mass loading of 5 mgDTT cm&#8722;2, along with a fast kinetics for charge storage. Electrochemical measurements, ex situ analyses, and density functional theory calculation successfully demonstrate that the DTT electrode can simultaneously store both protons (H+) and Zn2+ to form DTT2(H+)4(Zn2+), where Zn2+ is bound to the carboxyl groups from the adjacent DTT molecules with improved stability. Benefitting from the improved molecular stability and the inherent low solubility of DTT and related discharge products, the DTT//Zn full cell exhibits a superlong life of 23 000 cycles with a capacity retention of 83.8%, which is much superior to previous reports.

      <title>Metallic n&#8208;Type Mg3Sb2 Single Crystals Demonstrate the Absence of Ionized Impurity Scattering and Enhanced Thermoelectric Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
n&#8208;Type Mg3Sb2 single crystals are synthesized using a flux method followed by saturation annealing. A multi&#8208;fold improvement of the room&#8208;temperature thermoelectric performance is achieved by the complete elimination of grain boundaries. The metallic behavior of the single crystals is direct evidence that grain boundary resistance, not ionized impurity scattering, is responsible for detrimental electrical resistance near room temperature.








Abstract
Mg3(Sb,Bi)2 alloys have recently been discovered as a competitive alternative to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;type Bi2(Te,Se)3 thermoelectric alloys. Previous theoretical studies predict that single crystals Mg3(Sb,Bi)2 can exhibit higher thermoelectric performance near room temperature by eliminating grain boundary resistance. However, the intrinsic Mg defect chemistry makes it challenging to grow n&#8208;type Mg3(Sb,Bi)2 single crystals. Here, the first thermoelectric properties of n&#8208;type Te&#8208;doped Mg3Sb2 single crystals, synthesized by a combination of Sb&#8208;flux method and Mg&#8208;vapor annealing, is reported. The electrical conductivity and carrier mobility of single crystals exhibit a metallic behavior with a typical T&#8722;1.5 dependence, indicating that phonon scattering dominates the charge carrier transport. The absence of any evidence of ionized impurity scattering in Te&#8208;doped Mg3Sb2 single crystals proves that the thermally activated mobility previously observed in polycrystalline materials is caused by grain boundary resistance. Eliminating this grain boundary resistance in the single crystals results in a large enhancement of the weighted mobility and figure of merit zT by more than 100% near room temperature. This work experimentally demonstrates the accurate understanding of charge&#8208;carrier scattering is crucial for developing high&#8208;performance thermoelectric materials and indicates that single&#8208;crystalline Mg3(Sb,Bi)2 solid solutions can exhibit higher zT compared to polycrystalline samples.

Excess/unreacted lead iodide (PbI2) has been commonly used in perovskite films for the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solar cell applications. However, an understanding of intrinsic degradation mechanisms of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) containing unreacted PbI2 has been still insufficient and, therefore, needs to be clarified for better operational durability. Here, it is shown that degradation of PSCs is hastened by unreacted PbI2 crystals under continuous light illumination. Unreacted PbI2 undergoes photodecomposition under illumination, resulting in the formation of lead and iodine in films. Thus, this photodecomposition of PbI2 is one of the main reasons for accelerated device degradation. Therefore, this work reveals that carefully controlling the formation of unreacted PbI2 crystals in perovskite films is very important to improve device operational stability for diverse opto&#8208;electronic applications in the future.

      <title>A Surface&#8208;Tailoring Method for Rapid Non&#8208;Thermosensitive Cell&#8208;Sheet Engineering via Functional Polymer Coatings</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel, non&#8208;thermoresponsive cell&#8208;sheet engineering approach is developed by a surface energy&#8208;controlled polymer coating combined with regulation of the surface&#8208;energy&#8208;controlled and transiently changing the divalent cation concentration. An efficient, gentle triggering method enables the release of an intact cell sheet within 100 s under physiological conditions (pH 7.4 and 37 &#176;C), enhancing the therapeutic potential of the cell sheets.








Abstract
Cell sheet engineering, a technique utilizing a monolayer cell sheet, has recently emerged as a promising technology for scaffold&#8208;free tissue engineering. In contrast to conventional tissue&#8208;engineering approaches, the cell sheet technology allows cell harvest as a continuous cell sheet with intact extracellular matrix proteins and cell&#8211;cell junction, which facilitates cell transplantation without any other artificial biomaterials. A facile, non&#8208;thermoresponsive method is demonstrated for a rapid but highly reliable platform for cell&#8208;sheet engineering. The developed method exploits the precise modulation of cell&#8211;substrate interactions by controlling the surface energy of the substrate via a series of functional polymer coatings to enable prompt cell sheet harvesting within 100 s. The engineered surface can trigger an intrinsic cellular response upon the depletion of divalent cations, leading to spontaneous cell sheet detachment under physiological conditions (pH 7.4 and 37 &#176;C) in a non&#8208;thermoresponsive manner. Additionally, the therapeutic potential of the cell sheet is successfully demonstrated by the transplantation of multilayered cell sheets into mouse models of diabetic wounds and ischemia. These findings highlight the ability of the developed surface for non&#8208;thermoresponsive cell sheet engineering to serve as a robust platform for regenerative medicine and provide significant breakthroughs in cell sheet technology.

      <title>Metasurface&#8208;Enabled Generation of Circularly Polarized Single Photons</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel approach to room&#8208;temperature generation of circularly polarized single photons is described, which entails nonradiative coupling of a quantum emitter to surface plasmons being transformed by an optical metasurface into a collimated stream of circularly polarized single photons. Fabrication and characterization of a metasurface consisting of dielectric circular width&#8208;gradient nanoridges fabricated on a silver film around the emitter are reported.








Abstract
Single photons carrying spin angular momentum (SAM), i.e., circularly polarized single photons generated typically by subjecting a quantum emitter (QE) to a strong magnetic field at low temperatures, are at the core of chiral quantum optics enabling nonreciprocal single&#8208;photon configurations and deterministic spin&#8208;photon interfaces. Here, a conceptually new approach to the room&#8208;temperature generation of SAM&#8208;coded single photons (SSPs) is described, which entails QE nonradiative coupling to surface plasmons being transformed, by interacting with an optical metasurface, into a collimated stream of SSPs with the designed handedness. Design, fabrication, and characterization of SSP sources, consisting of dielectric circular nanoridges with azimuthally varying widths deterministically fabricated on a dielectric&#8208;protected silver film around a nanodiamond containing a nitrogen&#8208;vacancy center, are reported. With properly engineered phases of QE&#8208;originated fields scattered by nanoridges, the outcoupled photons are characterized by a well&#8208;defined SAM (with the chirality &gt;0.8) and high directionality (collection efficiency up to 92%).

      <title>Interfacial Superconductivity on the Topological Semimetal Tungsten Carbide Induced by Metal Deposition</title>
      <dc:description>
Interfacial superconductivity is realized in topological semimetal tungsten carbide (WC)/normal&#8208;metal heterostructures. The induced superconductivity is found to be insensitive to the magnetism, which is very different from the case of conventional superconductors, most probably indicating an unconventional nature of the pairing mechanism. The results provide a new direction for exploring topological superconductivity and designing novel topological quantum devices.








Abstract
Interfaces between materials with different electronic ground states have become powerful platforms for creating and controlling novel quantum states of matter, in which inversion symmetry breaking and other effects at the interface may introduce additional electronic states. Among the emergent phenomena, superconductivity is of particular interest. Here, by depositing metal films on a newly identified topological semimetal tungsten carbide (WC) single crystal, interfacial superconductivity is obtained, evidenced from soft point&#8208;contact spectroscopy. This very robust phenomenon is demonstrated for a wide range of metal/WC interfaces, involving both nonmagnetic and ferromagnetic films, and the superconducting transition temperatures are surprisingly insensitive to the magnetism of thin films. This method offers an opportunity to explore the long&#8208;sought topological superconductivity and has potential applications in topological&#8208;state&#8208;based spin devices.

      <title>On the Controlled Loading of Single Platinum Atoms as a Co&#8208;Catalyst on TiO2 Anatase for Optimized Photocatalytic H2 Generation</title>
      <dc:description>
A thin&#8208;film anatase TiO2 substrate for single&#8208;atom (SA) transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization is prepared. Control of the surface density of the SA traps results in tunable SA decoration on the anatase surface and superior photocatalytic H2 generation compared to classic noble&#8208;metal&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;decorated TiO2.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom (SA) catalysis is a novel frontline in the catalysis field due to the often drastically enhanced specific activity and selectivity of many catalytic reactions. Here, an atomic&#8208;scale defect engineering approach to form and control traps for platinum SA sites as co&#8208;catalyst for photocatalytic H2 generation is described. Thin sputtered TiO2 layers are used as a model photocatalyst, and compared to the more frequently used (001) anatase sheets. To form stable SA platinum, the TiO2 layers are reduced in Ar/H2 under different conditions (leading to different but defined Ti3+&#8208;Ov surface defects), followed by immersion in a dilute hexachloroplatinic acid solution. HAADF&#8208;STEM results show that only on the thin&#8208;film substrate can the density of SA sites be successfully controlled by the degree of reduction by annealing. An optimized SA&#8208;Pt decoration can enhance the normalized photocatalytic activity of a TiO2 sputtered sample by 150 times in comparison to a conventional platinum&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;decorated TiO2 surface. HAADF&#8208;STEM, XPS, and EPR investigation jointly confirm the atomic nature of the decorated Pt on TiO2. Importantly, the density of the relevant surface exposed defect centers&#8212;thus the density of Pt&#8208;SA sites, which play the key role in photocatalytic activity&#8212;can be precisely optimized.

      <title>Cancer Immunotherapy: Necroptosis&#8208;Inducible Polymeric Nanobubbles for Enhanced Cancer Sonoimmunotherapy (Adv. Mater. 16/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 1907953, Jae Hyung Park and co&#8208;workers present the potential of necroptosis&#8208;inducible nanobubbles for cancer immunotherapy. When exposed to ultrasound, nanobubbles promote release of intact damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns and tumor&#8208;associated antigens by inducing cell membrane rupture, facilitating efficient maturation of the dendritic cell for antitumor immune response.

      <title>Nanowires: Site&#8208;Controlled Uniform Ge/Si Hut Wires with Electrically Tunable Spin&#8211;Orbit Coupling (Adv. Mater. 16/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
The first wafer&#8208;scale growth of site&#8208;controlled Ge/Si nanowires is reported by Georgios Katsaros, Jian&#8208;Jun Zhang, and co&#8208;workers in article number 1906523. They are highly uniform and their position, distance, length, and even square&#8208; or L&#8208;shaped structures can all be precisely controlled. The electrically tunable spin&#8208;orbit coupling demonstrated by transport measurements and the charge sensing between quantum dots in closely spaced wires open a path toward scalable qubit devices using nanowires on silicon.

      <dc:description>
In article number 1908419, Zheng Lou, Guozhen Shen, and co&#8208;workers design a flexible all&#8208;nanowire&#8208;based IR detection amplification (IRDA) array at the system level that boosts the photosensitivity scale by more than several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the flexible IRDA array is integrated to achieve high&#8208;contrast IR imaging, which can be then trained and recognized by an artificial neural network for higher image&#8208;recognition efficiency.

      <title>Photophoretic Levitation: Photophoretic Levitation of Macroscopic Nanocardboard Plates (Adv. Mater. 16/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 1906878, Igor Bargatin and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that centimeter&#8208;scale hollow plates with nanoscale thickness and microscopic channels can levitate when illuminated with light intensity comparable to natural sunlight. Light&#8208;driven thermal transpiration of air through the plate's channels creates air jets, which result in small&#8208;height hovering at atmospheric pressure and mid&#8208;air flight at reduced pressures, even allowing small payloads.

      <title>Single&#8208;Atom Catalytic Materials for Advanced Battery Systems</title>
      <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom catalytic materials with atomic sizes, good conductivity, and individual catalytic sites are designed for advanced battery systems, including lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, zinc&#8211;air batteries, fuel cells, and other energy&#8208;storage systems. A systematic review on challenges and strategies related to synthesis, theoretical models, and in situ characterization of single&#8208;atom materials is presented to shed light on next&#8208;generation battery systems.








Abstract
Advanced battery systems with high energy density have attracted enormous research enthusiasm with potential for portable electronics, electrical vehicles, and grid&#8208;scale systems. To enhance the performance of conversion&#8208;type batteries, various catalytic materials are developed, including metals and transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Metals are highly conductive with catalytic effects, but bulk structures with low surface area result in low atom utilization, and high chemical reactivity induces unfavorable dendrite effects. TMDs present chemical adsorption with active species and catalytic activity promotes conversion processes, suppressing shuttle effect and improving energy density. But they suffer from inferior conductivity compared with metal, and limited sites mainly concentrate on edges and defects. Single&#8208;atom materials with atomic sizes, good conductivity, and individual sites are promising candidates for advanced batteries because of a large atom utilization, unsaturated coordination, and unique electronic structure. Single&#8208;atom sites with high activity chemically trap intermediates to suppress shuttle effects and facilitate electron transfer and redox reactions for achieving high capacity, rate capability, and conversion efficiency. Herein, single&#8208;atom catalytic electrodes design for advanced battery systems is addressed. Major challenges and promising strategies concerning electrochemical reactions, theoretical model, and in situ characterization are discussed to shed light on future research of single&#8208;atom material&#8208;based energy systems.

      <title>Injectable Biomedical Devices for Sensing and Stimulating Internal Body Organs</title>
      <dc:description>
Injectable biomedical electronics in high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio shaft&#8208;like designs is ideal for implantation in deep&#8208;seated body organs. The devices are attractive for avoiding major surgical procedures while targeting site&#8208;specific regions in the internal organs. Recent advances are reviewed with the aim of emphasizing the structural advantages of high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio formats for minimally invasive implants that have multifunctional stimulation and measurement capabilities.








Abstract
The rapid pace of progress in implantable electronics driven by novel technology has created devices with unconventional designs and features to reduce invasiveness and establish new sensing and stimulating techniques. Among the designs, injectable forms of biomedical electronics are explored for accurate and safe targeting of deep&#8208;seated body organs. Here, the classes of biomedical electronics and tools that have high aspect ratio structures designed to be injected or inserted into internal organs for minimally invasive monitoring and therapy are reviewed. Compared with devices in bulky or planar formats, the long shaft&#8208;like forms of implantable devices are easily placed in the organs with minimized outward protrusions via injection or insertion processes. Adding flexibility to the devices also enables effortless insertions through complex biological cavities, such as the cochlea, and enhances chronic reliability by complying with natural body movements, such as the heartbeat. Diverse types of such injectable implants developed for different organs are reviewed and the electronic, optoelectronic, piezoelectric, and microfluidic devices that enable stimulations and measurements of site&#8208;specific regions in the body are discussed. Noninvasive penetration strategies to deliver the miniscule devices are also considered. Finally, the challenges and future directions associated with deep body biomedical electronics are explained.

      <title>Imaging Beam&#8208;Sensitive Materials by Electron Microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Imaging beam&#8208;sensitive materials by electron microscopy is of fundamental significance for materials science but remains a great challenge. A comprehensive review of the essential advances in electron microscopy techniques toward the dose&#8208;efficient imaging of beam&#8208;sensitive materials is provided. These advances have led to significant materials science discoveries through the elucidation of crystal and local structures.








Abstract
Electron microscopy allows the extraction of multidimensional spatiotemporally correlated structural information of diverse materials down to atomic resolution, which is essential for figuring out their structure&#8211;property relationships. Unfortunately, the high&#8208;energy electrons that carry this important information can cause damage by modulating the structures of the materials. This has become a significant problem concerning the recent boost in materials science applications of a wide range of beam&#8208;sensitive materials, including metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent&#8211;organic frameworks, organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials, 2D materials, and zeolites. To this end, developing electron microscopy techniques that minimize the electron beam damage for the extraction of intrinsic structural information turns out to be a compelling but challenging need. This article provides a comprehensive review on the revolutionary strategies toward the electron microscopic imaging of beam&#8208;sensitive materials and associated materials science discoveries, based on the principles of electron&#8211;matter interaction and mechanisms of electron beam damage. Finally, perspectives and future trends in this field are put forward.

      <title>Memristive Behavior Enabled by Amorphous&#8211;Crystalline 2D Oxide Heterostructure</title>
      <dc:description>
The quasi&#8208;2D heterostructure of atomically thin ZnO monocrystalline nanosheet/amorphous Al2O3 enables exotic memristive behavior, which is attributed to the generation of concentrated oxygen vacancies with a high mobility in the low&#8208;resistance state. This discovery reveals a new route for tuning the electronic transport property by 2D heterostructuring.








Abstract
The emergence of memristive behavior in amorphous&#8211;crystalline 2D oxide heterostructures, which are synthesized by atomic layer deposition (ALD) of a few&#8208;nanometer amorphous Al2O3 layers onto atomically thin single&#8208;crystalline ZnO nanosheets, is demonstrated. The conduction mechanism is identified based on classic oxygen vacancy conductive channels. ZnO nanosheets provide a 2D host for oxygen vacancies, while the amorphous Al2O3 facilitates the generation and stabilization of the oxygen vacancies. The conduction mechanism in the high&#8208;resistance state follows Poole&#8211;Frenkel emission, and in the the low&#8208;resistance state is fitted by the Mott&#8211;Gurney law. From the slope of the fitting curve, the mobility in the low&#8208;resistance state is estimated to be &#8776;2400 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which is the highest value reported in semiconductor oxides. When annealed at high temperature to eliminate oxygen vacancies, Al is doped into the ZnO nanosheet, and the memristive behavior disappears, further confirming the oxygen vacancies as being responsible for the memristive behavior. The 2D heterointerface offers opportunities for new design of high&#8208;performance memristor devices.

      <title>Local Photothermal Control of Phase Transitions for On&#8208;Demand Room&#8208;Temperature Rewritable Magnetic Patterning</title>
      <dc:description>
By controlling the stoichiometry in epitaxial FeRh/MgO, the transition temperature from antiferromagnet to ferromagnet is tuned such that both phases are stable at room temperature. Focused pulsed laser heating is used to write and image arbitrarily shaped ferromagnetic patterns at ultrafast speeds, which can be erased by cooling the film below room temperature.








Abstract
The ability to make controlled patterns of magnetic structures within a nonmagnetic background is essential for several types of existing and proposed technologies. Such patterns provide the foundation of magnetic memory and logic devices, allow the creation of artificial spin&#8208;ice lattices, and enable the study of magnon propagation. Here, a novel approach for magnetic patterning that allows repeated creation and erasure of arbitrary shapes of thin&#8208;film ferromagnetic structures is reported. This strategy is enabled by epitaxial Fe0.52Rh0.48 thin films designed so that both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases are bistable at room temperature. Starting with the film in a uniform antiferromagnetic state, the ability to write arbitrary patterns of the ferromagnetic phase is demonstrated by local heating with a focused laser. If desired, the results can then be erased by cooling below room temperature and the material repeatedly re&#8208;patterned.

Abstract
Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), one of the important porous materials, have garnered interest owing to their highly attractive physicochemical features and advantageous morphological attributes. They are of particular importance for use in diverse fields including, but not limited to, adsorption, catalysis, and medicine. Despite their intrinsic stable siliceous frameworks, excellent mechanical strength, and optimal morphological attributes, pristine MSNs suffer from poor drug loading efficiency, as well as compatibility and degradability issues for therapeutic, diagnostic, and tissue engineering purposes. Collectively, the desirable and beneficial properties of MSNs have been harnessed by modifying the surface of the siliceous frameworks through incorporating supramolecular assemblies and various metal species, and through incorporating supramolecular assemblies and various metal species and their conjugates.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), one of the important porous materials, have garnered interest owing to their highly attractive physicochemical features and advantageous morphological attributes. They are of particular importance for use in diverse fields including, but not limited to, adsorption, catalysis, and medicine. Despite their intrinsic stable siliceous frameworks, excellent mechanical strength, and optimal morphological attributes, pristine MSNs suffer from poor drug loading efficiency, as well as compatibility and degradability issues for therapeutic, diagnostic, and tissue engineering purposes. Collectively, the desirable and beneficial properties of MSNs have been harnessed by modifying the surface of the siliceous frameworks through incorporating supramolecular assemblies and various metal species, and through incorporating supramolecular assemblies and various metal species and their conjugates. Substantial advancements of these innovative colloidal inorganic nanocontainers drive researchers in promoting them toward innovative applications like stimuli (light/ultrasound/magnetic)&#8208;responsive delivery&#8208;associated therapies with exceptional performance in vivo. Here, a brief overview of the fabrication of siliceous frameworks, along with discussions on the significant advances in engineering of MSNs, is provided. The scope of the advancement in terms of structural and physicochemical attributes and their effects on biomedical applications with a particular focus on recent studies is emphasized. Finally, interesting perspectives are recapitulated, along with the scope toward clinical translation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Ternary Hybrid&#8208;Cation Room&#8208;Temperature Liquid Metal Battery and Interfacial Selection Mechanism Study</title>
      <dc:description>
A ternary hybrid&#8208;cation room&#8208;temperature liquid metal battery is developed to explore lithium ions as the cathodic charge carrier and potassium ions as the anodic charge carrier. Stable cycling and high voltage are achieved, and the interfacial chemistry that controls cation selective transportation is also modeled and characterized.








Abstract
The dendrite&#8208;free sodium&#8211;potassium (Na&#8211;K) liquid alloy composed of two alkali metals is one of the ideal alternatives for Li metal as an anode material while maintaining large capacity, low potential, and high abundance. However, Na&#8208; or K&#8208;ion batteries have limited cathode materials that can deliver stably large capacity. Combining advantages of both, a hybrid&#8208;cation liquid metal battery is designed for a Li&#8208;ion&#8208;insertion&#8208;based cathode to deliver stable high capacity using a Na&#8211;K liquid anode to avoid dendrites. The mechanical property of the Na&#8211;K alloy is confirmed by simulation and experimental characterization, which leads to stable cycling performance. The charge carrier selection principle in this ternary hybrid&#8208;cation system is investigated, showing consistency with the proposed interfacial layer formation and ion distribution mechanism for the electrochemical process as well as the good stability. With Li ions contributing stable cycling as the cathode charge carrier, the K ion working as charge carrier on the anode, and Na as the medium to liquefy K metal, such a ternary hybrid battery system not only inherits the rich battery chemistry of Li&#8208;insertion cathodes but also broadens the understanding of alkali metal alloys and hybrid&#8208;ion battery chemistry.

      <title>Advanced Matrixes for Binder&#8208;Free Nanostructured Electrodes in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
The latest progress of various supporting matrixes including metals, polymers, carbon, and other materials for binder&#8208;free nanostructured electrodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries&#8212;in particular, flexible ones&#8212;is demonstrated. A complete survey of most relevant literature, covering a wide range of fundamental and applicative features related to this topic: from material properties to fabrication issues is provided.








Abstract
Commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), limited by their insufficient reversible capacity, short cyclability, and high cost, are facing ever&#8208;growing requirements for further increases in power capability, energy density, lifespan, and flexibility. The presence of insulating and electrochemically inactive binders in commercial LIB electrodes causes uneven active material distribution and poor contact of these materials with substrates, reducing battery performance. Thus, nanostructured electrodes with binder&#8208;free designs are developed and have numerous advantages including large surface area, robust adhesion to substrates, high areal/specific capacity, fast electron/ion transfer, and free space for alleviating volume expansion, leading to superior battery performance. Herein, recent progress on different kinds of supporting matrixes including metals, carbonaceous materials, and polymers as well as other substrates for binder&#8208;free nanostructured electrodes in LIBs are summarized systematically. Furthermore, the potential applications of these binder&#8208;free nanostructured electrodes in practical full&#8208;cell&#8208;configuration LIBs, in particular fully flexible/stretchable LIBs, are outlined in detail. Finally, the future opportunities and challenges for such full&#8208;cell LIBs based on binder&#8208;free nanostructured electrodes are discussed.

Abstract
There is currently enormous and growing demand for flexible electronics for personalized mobile equipment, human&#8211;machine interface units, wearable medical&#8208;healthcare systems, and bionic intelligent robots. Cellulose is a well&#8208;known natural biopolymer that has multiple advantages including low cost, renewability, easy processability, and biodegradability, as well as appealing mechanical performance, dielectricity, piezoelectricity, and convertibility. Because of its multiple merits, cellulose is frequently used as a substrate, binder, dielectric layer, gel electrolyte, and derived carbon material for flexible electronic devices. Leveraging the advantages of cellulose to design advanced functional materials will have a significant impact on portable intelligent electronics. Herein, the unique molecular structure and nanostructures (nanocrystals, nanofibers, nanosheets, etc.) of cellulose are briefly introduced, the structure&#8211;property&#8211;application relationships of cellulosic materials summarized, and the processing technologies for fabricating cellulose&#8208;based flexible electronics considered. The focus then turns to the recent advances of cellulose&#8208;based functional materials toward emerging intelligent electronic devices including flexible sensors, optoelectronic devices, field&#8208;effect transistors, nanogenerators, electrochemical energy storage devices, biomimetic electronic skins, and biological detection devices. Finally, an outlook of the potential challenges and future prospects for developing cellulose&#8208;based wearable devices and bioelectronic systems is presented.

      <title>A Behavior&#8208;Learned Cross&#8208;Reactive Sensor Matrix for Intelligent Skin Perception</title>
      <dc:description>
A highly stretchable cross&#8208;reactive sensor matrix for electronic&#8208;skin applications is demonstrated, which can detect, classify, and discriminate various intermixed tactile and thermal stimuli based on machine learning. By adopting a learning algorithm based on the bag&#8208;of&#8208;words model, highly accurate classification of intermixed stimuli is achieved.








Abstract
Mimicking human skin sensation such as spontaneous multimodal perception and identification/discrimination of intermixed stimuli is severely hindered by the difficulty of efficient integration of complex cutaneous receptor&#8208;emulating circuitry and the lack of an appropriate protocol to discern the intermixed signals. Here, a highly stretchable cross&#8208;reactive sensor matrix is demonstrated, which can detect, classify, and discriminate various intermixed tactile and thermal stimuli using a machine&#8208;learning approach. Particularly, the multimodal perception ability is achieved by utilizing a learning algorithm based on the bag&#8208;of&#8208;words (BoW) model, where, by learning and recognizing the stimulus&#8208;dependent 2D output image patterns, the discrimination of each stimulus in various multimodal stimuli environments is possible. In addition, the single sensor device integrated in the cross&#8208;reactive sensor matrix exhibits multimodal detection of strain, flexion, pressure, and temperature. It is hoped that his proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device with machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based approach will provide a versatile route to simplify the electronic skin systems with reduced architecture complexity and adaptability to various environments beyond the limitation of conventional &#8220;lock and key&#8221; approaches.

      <title>Ultrafast and Stable Li&#8208;(De)intercalation in a Large Single Crystal H&#8208;Nb2O5 Anode via Optimizing the Homogeneity of Electron and Ion Transport</title>
      <dc:description>
Micrometer&#8208;sized single crystal H&#8208;Nb2O5 with an amorphous N&#8208;doped carbon shell (N&#8208;C@MSC&#8208;Nb2O5) is designed to optimize the homogeneity of electron and ion transport, which dramatically improves its electrochemical reaction kinetics and synchronism of phase change during (de)intercalation. Therefore, N&#8208;C@MSC&#8208;Nb2O5 shows a better high&#8208;rate performance than most Li4Ti5O12&#8208;based and T&#8208;Nb2O5&#8208;based anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Exploring anode materials with fast, safe, and stable Li&#8208;(de)intercalation is of great significance for developing next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Monoclinic H&#8208;type niobium pentoxide possesses outstanding intrinsic fast Li&#8208;(de)intercalation kinetics, high specific capacity, and safety; however, its practical rate capability and cycling stability are still limited, ascribed to the asynchronism of phase change throughout the crystals. Herein this problem is addressed by homogenizing the electron and Li&#8208;ion conductivity surrounding the crystals. An amorphous N&#8208;doped carbon layer is introduced on the micrometer single&#8208;crystal H&#8208;Nb2O5 particle to optimize the homogeneity of electron and Li&#8208;ion transport. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared H&#8208;Nb2O5 exhibits high reversible capacity (&gt;250 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50 mA g&#8722;1), unprecedented high&#8208;rate performance (&#8776;120 mAh g&#8722;1 at 16.0 A g&#8722;1) and excellent cycling stability (&#8776;170 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2.0 A g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles), which is by far the highest performance among the H&#8208;Nb2O5 materials. The inherent principle is further confirmed via operando transmission electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction. A novel insight into the further development of electrode materials forlithium&#8208;ion batteries is thus provided.

     alt="Ultrafast and Stable Li&#8208;(De)intercalation in a Large Single Crystal H&#8208;Nb2O5 Anode via Optimizing the Homogeneity of Electron and Ion Transport"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Micrometer&#8208;sized single crystal H&#8208;Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; with an amorphous N&#8208;doped carbon shell (N&#8208;C@MSC&#8208;Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) is designed to optimize the homogeneity of electron and ion transport, which dramatically improves its electrochemical reaction kinetics and synchronism of phase change during (de)intercalation. Therefore, N&#8208;C@MSC&#8208;Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; shows a better high&#8208;rate performance than most Li&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;based and T&#8208;Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;based anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring anode materials with fast, safe, and stable Li&#8208;(de)intercalation is of great significance for developing next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Monoclinic H&#8208;type niobium pentoxide possesses outstanding intrinsic fast Li&#8208;(de)intercalation kinetics, high specific capacity, and safety; however, its practical rate capability and cycling stability are still limited, ascribed to the asynchronism of phase change throughout the crystals. Herein this problem is addressed by homogenizing the electron and Li&#8208;ion conductivity surrounding the crystals. An amorphous N&#8208;doped carbon layer is introduced on the micrometer single&#8208;crystal H&#8208;Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; particle to optimize the homogeneity of electron and Li&#8208;ion transport. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared H&#8208;Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits high reversible capacity (&amp;gt;250 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 50 mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), unprecedented high&#8208;rate performance (&#8776;120 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 16.0 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and excellent cycling stability (&#8776;170 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 2.0 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 1000 cycles), which is by far the highest performance among the H&#8208;Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; materials. The inherent principle is further confirmed via operando transmission electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction. A novel insight into the further development of electrode materials forlithium&#8208;ion batteries is thus provided.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scalable Manufacturing of Free&#8208;Standing, Strong Ti3C2Tx MXene Films with Outstanding Conductivity</title>
      <dc:description>
Strong and highly conductive binder&#8208;free Ti3C2Tx MXene films with excellent electromagnetic interference shielding performance are fabricated by a blade&#8208;coating method using high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio MXene flakes. Achieving such a combination of properties using a scalable fabrication process enables manufacturing of MXene&#8208;based high&#8208;performance devices and new applications.








Abstract
Free&#8208;standing films that display high strength and high electrical conductivity are critical for flexible electronics, such as electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding coatings and current collectors for batteries and supercapacitors. 2D Ti3C2Tx flakes are ideal candidates for making conductive films due to their high strength and metallic conductivity. It is, however, challenging to transfer those outstanding properties of single MXene flakes to macroscale films as a result of the small flake size and relatively poor flake alignment that occurs during solution&#8208;based processing. Here, a scalable method is shown for the fabrication of strong and highly conducting pure MXene films containing highly aligned large MXene flakes. These films demonstrate record tensile strength up to &#8776;570 MPa for a 940 nm thick film and electrical conductivity of &#8776;15 100 S cm&#8722;1 for a 214 nm thick film, which are both the highest values compared to previously reported pure Ti3C2Tx films. These films also exhibit outstanding EMI shielding performance (&#8776;50 dB for a 940 nm thick film) that exceeds other synthetic materials with comparable thickness. MXene films with aligned flakes provide an effective route for producing large&#8208;area, high&#8208;strength, and high&#8208;electrical&#8208;conductivity MXene&#8208;based films for future electronic applications.

      <title>Electrochemical Methods for Lithium Recovery: A Comprehensive and Critical Review</title>
      <dc:description>
Due to the ubiquitous presence of Li&#8208;ion batteries, the future availability of Li is under debate. Li utilization will depend on an increase in production.

Abstract
Due to the ubiquitous presence of lithium&#8208;ion batteries in portable applications, and their implementation in the transportation and large&#8208;scale energy sectors, the future cost and availability of lithium is currently under debate. Lithium demand is expected to grow in the near future, up to 900 ktons per year in 2025. Lithium utilization would depend on a strong increase in production. However, the currently most extended lithium extraction method, the lime&#8208;soda evaporation process, requires a period of time in the range of 1&#8211;2 years and depends on weather conditions. The actual global production of lithium by this technology will soon be far exceeded by market demand. Alternative production methods have recently attracted great attention. Among them, electrochemical lithium recovery, based on electrochemical ion&#8208;pumping technology, offers higher capacity production, it does not require the use of chemicals for the regeneration of the materials, reduces the consumption of water and the production of chemical wastes, and allows the production rate to be controlled, attending to the market demand. Here, this technology is analyzed with a special focus on the methodology, materials employed, and reactor designs. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art is reevaluated from a critical perspective and the viability of the different proposed methodologies analyzed.

      <title>A Rechargeable Zn&#8211;Air Battery with High Energy Efficiency and Long Life Enabled by a Highly Water&#8208;Retentive Gel Electrolyte with Reaction Modifier</title>
      <dc:description>
Electrolytes play a significant role in the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;life rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries. A developed KI&#8211;PVAA&#8211;GO hydrogel electrolyte enables zinc&#8211;air batteries that exhibit low charge potential of 1.69 V, long working life of 200 h, high energy efficiency of 73%, and excellent practicability for flexible power sources.








Abstract
Tremendous effort have recently been made in optimizing the air catalysts of flexible zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Unfortunately, the bottleneck factors in electrolytes that largely limit the working life and energy efficiency of ZABs have long been relatively neglected. Herein, an alkaline gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) is fabricated through multiple crosslinking reactions among poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), poly(acrylic acid), and graphene oxide followed by intense uptake of an alkali and the KI reaction modifier. The prepared GPE exhibits essentially improved properties compared to traditional PVA gel electrolyte in terms of mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, and water retention capability. In addition, the introduced reaction modifier I&#8722; in the GPE changes the path of the conventional oxygen evolution reaction, leading to a more thermodynamically favorable path. The optimized GPE enables flexible ZABs exhibiting an exceptionally low charge potential of 1.69 V, a long cycling time of 200 h, a high energy efficiency of 73%, and rugged reliability under different extreme working conditions. Moreover, the successful integration of ZABs in a variety of real wearable electronic devices demonstrates their excellent practicability as flexible power sources.

      <title>Site&#8208;Specific Synthesis of Silica Nanostructures on DNA Origami Templates</title>
      <dc:description>
Arbitrary silica nanopatterns are fabricated on DNA origami templates by rationally designing the protruding double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) arrays as nucleation sites. Molecular dynamic simulation confirms that the positively charged silica precursors have a stronger electrostatic affinity to protruding dsDNA than DNA origami surfaces. The site&#8208;specific silicification of DNA nanoarchitectures expands the scope of customized synthesis of inorganic nonmetallic nanomaterials.








Abstract
DNA origami has been widely investigated as a template for the organization of various functional elements, leading to potential applications in many fields such as biosensing, nanoelectronics, and nanophotonics. However, the synthesis of inorganic nonmetallic nanomaterials with predesigned patterns using DNA origami templates has seldom been explored. Here, a novel method is reported to site&#8208;specifically synthesize silica nanostructures with designed patterns on DNA origami templates.

&lt;p&gt;Arbitrary silica nanopatterns are fabricated on DNA origami templates by rationally designing the protruding double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) arrays as nucleation sites. Molecular dynamic simulation confirms that the positively charged silica precursors have a stronger electrostatic affinity to protruding dsDNA than DNA origami surfaces. The site&#8208;specific silicification of DNA nanoarchitectures expands the scope of customized synthesis of inorganic nonmetallic nanomaterials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA origami has been widely investigated as a template for the organization of various functional elements, leading to potential applications in many fields such as biosensing, nanoelectronics, and nanophotonics. However, the synthesis of inorganic nonmetallic nanomaterials with predesigned patterns using DNA origami templates has seldom been explored. Here, a novel method is reported to site&#8208;specifically synthesize silica nanostructures with designed patterns on DNA origami templates. The molecular dynamic simulation confirms that the positively charged silica precursors have a stronger electrostatic affinity to protruding double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) than DNA origami surfaces. The work describes a novel strategy to fabricate silica nanostructures with nanoscale precision. Moreover, the site&#8208;specific silicification of DNA nanoarchitectures expands the scope of customized synthesis of inorganic nonmetallic nanomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Heat Capacity and Thermal Damping Properties of Spin&#8208;Crossover Molecules: A New Look at an Old Topic</title>
      <dc:description>
Thermal management of metallic Joule&#8208;heated microwires is experimentally demonstrated using a molecular spin&#8208;crossover film as a thermal damper system. A transient attenuation of the wire temperature, up to 10%, is evidenced due to the excess heat capacity associated with the spin&#8208;state switching, providing a first milestone toward the assessment of the potential of spin&#8208;transition materials for thermal management applications.








Abstract
The thermally induced spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) phenomenon in transition metal complexes is an entropy&#8208;driven process, which has been extensively studied through calorimetric methods. Yet, the excess heat capacity associated with the molecular spin&#8208;state switching has never been explored for practical applications. Herein, the thermal damping effect of an SCO film is experimentally assessed by monitoring the transient heating response of SCO&#8208;coated metallic microwires, Joule&#8208;heated by current pulses. A damping of the wire temperature, up to 10%, is evidenced on a time scale of tens of microseconds due to the spin&#8208;state switching of the molecular film. Fast heat&#8208;charging dynamics and negligible fatigability are demonstrated, which, together with the solid&#8208;solid nature of the spin transition, appear as promising features for achieving thermal energy management applications in functional devices.

      <title>Bioinspired Materials with Self&#8208;Adaptable Mechanical Properties</title>
      <dc:description>
A synthetic material system is demonstrated to be capable of autonomously changing its mechanical properties in response to external mechanical loading. The self&#8208;adaptation is achieved with scaffolds that generate signals to induce the addition of minerals proportional to the applied load. This approach opens new avenues for development of materials for load&#8208;bearing applications from self&#8208;adaptive capabilities.








Abstract
Natural structural materials, such as bone, can autonomously modulate their mechanical properties in response to external loading to prevent failure. These material systems smartly control the addition/removal of material in locations of high/low mechanical stress by utilizing local resources guided by biological signals. On the contrary, synthetic structural materials have unchanging mechanical properties limiting their mechanical performance and service life. Inspired by the mineralization process of bone, a material system that adapts its mechanical properties in response to external mechanical loading is reported. It is found that charges from piezoelectric scaffolds can induce mineralization from surrounding media. It is shown that the material system can adapt to external mechanical loading by inducing mineral deposition in proportion to the magnitude of the stress and the resulting piezoelectric charges. Moreover, the mineralization mechanism allows a simple one&#8208;step route for fabricating functionally graded materials by controlling the stress distribution along the scaffold. The findings can pave the way for a new class of self&#8208;regenerating materials that reinforce regions of high stress or induce deposition of minerals on the damaged areas from the increase in mechanical stress to prevent/mitigate failure. It is envisioned that the findings can contribute to addressing the current challenges of synthetic materials for load&#8208;bearing applications from self&#8208;adaptive capabilities.

      <title>Nanoscale&#8208;Dewetting&#8208;Based Direct Interconnection of Microelectronics for a Deterministic Assembly of Transfer Printing</title>
      <dc:description>
The stability and wettability of coated polymer adhesive with indium (In) particles or gold&#8208;deposited substrates can be controlled by modulating the thickness of the adhesive. The In particles dispersed in the polymer adhesive, or the protruding structures of the substrate, easily trigger dewetting of the polymer adhesive, and form a vertical interconnection of the electronics and the substrate via deterministic assembly.








Abstract
As electronics dramatically advance, their components should be fabricated for miniaturized scale, and integrated on limited&#8208;size substrates with extremely high density. Current technologies for the integration and interconnection of electronics show some critical limitations in the application of microscale electronics. To address these problems, herein, a new direct and vertical interconnection driven by selective dewetting of a polymer adhesive is introduced. The interconnection system consists of the polymer adhesive and nanosized metal particles, or structured electrodes. Nanoscale&#8208;dewetting windows formed by controlling the stability and wetting property of the adhesive polymer are controlled by the interfacial property of the coated polymer adhesive. The adhesive is coated on substrate by a simple spin&#8208;coating process, and its ultraviolet curable property allows only the device&#8208;mounted parts to be selectively conductive and sticky, while the other parts form insulation and protection layers. The interconnection of the electronics and substrate by adhesive makes it possible to apply the technique to various microsize electronics with electrode size and pitch of 20 &#181;m or less, and endure dramatic temperature change and a long&#8208;term high humidity environment. Moreover, over display comprising over 10 000 microscale light&#8208;emitting diodes (micro&#8208;LEDs), and commercialized microchips are demonstrated with monolithic integration on flexible and transparent substrate.

      <dc:description>
Biocompatible&#8208;material&#8208;based flexible electronics have great potential for use in neuromedical system due to the possibility of neural&#8208;interface communication between the brain and machines. Recent developments regarding in vivo neuromodulation are introduced, including flexible reading/writing/drug&#8208;delivery devices, self&#8208;powered deep&#8208;brain stimulators, and closed&#8208;loop control systems.








Abstract
Neural interfaces facilitating communication between the brain and machines must be compatible with the soft, curvilinear, and elastic tissues of the brain and yet yield enough power to read and write information across a wide range of brain areas through high&#8208;throughput recordings or optogenetics. Biocompatible&#8208;material engineering has facilitated the development of brain&#8208;compatible neural interfaces to support built&#8208;in modulation of neural circuits and neurological disorders. Recent developments in brain&#8208;compatible neural interfaces that use soft nanomaterials more suitable for complex neural circuit analysis and modulation are reviewed. Preclinical tests of the compatibility and specificity of these interfaces in animal models are also discussed.

      <title>Emerging Self&#8208;Emissive Technologies for Flexible Displays</title>
      <dc:description>
The progress of self&#8208;emissive techniques for flexible displays is reviewed, beginning with emitting active materials and device fabrication technologies, followed by flexible substrates, transparent electrodes, and encapsulation, and then the rapid development of the performance of devices.








Abstract
Featuring a combination of ultrathin and lightweight properties, excellent mechanical flexibility, low power&#8208;consumption, and widely tunable saturated emission, flexible displays have opened up a new possibility for optoelectronics. The demands for flexible displays are growing on a continual basis due not only to their successful commercialization but, more importantly, their endless possibilities for wearable integrated systems. Up to now, self&#8208;emissive technologies for displays, flexible active&#8208;matrix organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (flex&#8208;AMOLED), flexible quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (flex&#8208;QLEDs), and flexible perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (flex&#8208;PeLEDs) have been widely reported, but despite the significant progress made in these technologies, enormous obstacles and challenges remain for the vision of truly wearable applications, in particular with flex&#8208;QLEDs and flex&#8208;PeLEDs. Here, a review of the recent progress of all three self&#8208;emissive technologies for flexible displays is conducted, including the emissive active materials, device structures and approaches to manufacturing, the flexible substrates, and conductive electrodes, as well as the encapsulation techniques. The fast&#8208;paced improvement made to the efficiency of flexible devices in recent years is also summarized. The review concludes by making suggestions on the future development in this area, and is expected to help researchers in gaining a comprehensive understanding about the newly emerging technologies for flexible displays.

      <title>When Bio Meets Technology: Biohybrid Neural Interfaces</title>
      <dc:description>
Electronics capable of interfacing with the nervous system are rapidly evolving. Biohybrid implants represent a new type of neural interface, combining implantable electrodes technology and cell transplantation. An overview of biohybrid interfaces, with a classification based on the host anatomical location is provided. A summary of the key challenges and the potential future research directions are also presented.








Abstract
The development of electronics capable of interfacing with the nervous system is a rapidly advancing field with applications in basic science and clinical translation. Devices containing arrays of electrodes can be used in the study of cells grown in culture or can be implanted into damaged or dysfunctional tissue to restore normal function. While devices are typically designed and used exclusively for one of these two purposes, there have been increasing efforts in developing implantable electrode arrays capable of housing cultured cells, referred to as biohybrid implants. Once implanted, the cells within these implants integrate into the tissue, serving as a mediator of the electrode&#8211;tissue interface. This biological component offers unique advantages to these implant designs, providing better tissue integration and potentially long&#8208;term stability. Herein, an overview of current research into biohybrid devices, as well as the historical background that led to their development are provided, based on the host anatomical location for which they are designed (CNS, PNS, or special senses). Finally, a summary of the key challenges of this technology and potential future research directions are presented.

      <title>A New Frontier of Printed Electronics: Flexible Hybrid Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
Flexible hybrid electronics (FHE) with applications in wearable health, structural health, and industrial, environmental, and agricultural sensing are reviewed. The recent progress, fabrication, application, and challenges, and an outlook, relating to FHE are presented with a focus on the fundamental building blocks of FHE systems: printed sensors and circuits, thinned silicon integrated circuits, printed antennas, printed energy harvesting and storage modules, and printed displays.








Abstract
The performance and integration density of silicon integrated circuits (ICs) have progressed at an unprecedented pace in the past 60 years. While silicon ICs thrive at low&#8208;power high&#8208;performance computing, creating flexible and large&#8208;area electronics using silicon remains a challenge. On the other hand, flexible and printed electronics use intrinsically flexible materials and printing techniques to manufacture compliant and large&#8208;area electronics. Nonetheless, flexible electronics are not as efficient as silicon ICs for computation and signal communication. Flexible hybrid electronics (FHE) leverages the strengths of these two dissimilar technologies. It uses flexible and printed electronics where flexibility and scalability are required, i.e., for sensing and actuating, and silicon ICs for computation and communication purposes. Combining flexible electronics and silicon ICs yields a very powerful and versatile technology with a vast range of applications. Here, the fundamental building blocks of an FHE system, printed sensors and circuits, thinned silicon ICs, printed antennas, printed energy harvesting and storage modules, and printed displays, are discussed. Emerging application areas of FHE in wearable health, structural health, industrial, environmental, and agricultural sensing are reviewed. Overall, the recent progress, fabrication, application, and challenges, and an outlook, related to FHE are presented.

      <title>Organic Photodetectors for Next&#8208;Generation Wearable Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
Photodetectors based on organic materials are promising devices for wearable applications due to their mechanical flexibility, ease of processing, tunable optoelectronic properties, good light&#8208;sensing performance, and biocompatibility. Recent advances of organic photodetectors in terms of both optoelectronic and mechanical properties are outlined and discussed.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation wearable electronics will need to be mechanically flexible and stretchable such that they can be conformally attached onto the human body. Photodetectors that are available in today's market are based on rigid inorganic crystalline materials and they have limited mechanical flexibility. In contrast, photodetectors based on organic polymers and molecules have emerged as promising alternatives due to their inherent mechanical softness, ease of processing, tunable optoelectronic properties, good light sensing performance, and biocompatibility. Here, the recent advances of organic photodetectors in terms of both optoelectronic and mechanical properties are outlined and discussed, and their application in wearable electronics including health monitoring sensors, artificial vision, and self&#8208;powering integrated devices are highlighted.

      <title>The Future of Neuroimplantable Devices: A Materials Science and Regulatory Perspective</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress in the development of existing neuroimplantable devices such as electrocorticography (ECoG) systems, multielectrode arrays (MEAs), Stentrode, and deep brain probes is reviewed. Furthermore, the materials science and regulatory perspective on such devices, with regard to their relationship with biological, mechanical, and material risk factors, are highlighted.








Abstract
The past two decades have seen unprecedented progress in the development of novel materials, form factors, and functionalities in neuroimplantable technologies, including electrocorticography (ECoG) systems, multielectrode arrays (MEAs), Stentrode, and deep brain probes. The key considerations for the development of such devices intended for acute implantation and chronic use, from the perspective of biocompatible hybrid materials incorporation, conformable device design, implantation procedures, and mechanical and biological risk factors, are highlighted. These topics are connected with the role that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plays in its regulation of neuroimplantable technologies based on the above parameters. Existing neuroimplantable devices and efforts to improve their materials and implantation protocols are first discussed in detail. The effects of device implantation with regards to biocompatibility and brain heterogeneity are then explored. Topics examined include brain&#8208;specific risk factors, such as bacterial infection, tissue scarring, inflammation, and vasculature damage, as well as efforts to manage these dangers through emerging hybrid, bioelectronic device architectures. The current challenges of gaining clinical approval by the FDA&#8212;in particular, with regards to biological, mechanical, and materials risk factors&#8212;are summarized. The available regulatory pathways to accelerate next&#8208;generation neuroimplantable devices to market are then discussed.

      <title>Flexible Neuromorphic Electronics for Computing, Soft Robotics, and Neuroprosthetics</title>
      <dc:description>
Flexible neuromorphic electronics are studied for their application in next&#8208;generation wearable computing, soft robotics, and neuroprosthetics. These applications require synaptic devices and integrated systems that are flexible, consume little power, are biocompatible, and are amenable to high&#8208;density integration. Recent progress in flexible neuromorphic electronics, from basic background to applications is surveyed, and future research is suggested.








Abstract
Flexible neuromorphic electronics that emulate biological neuronal systems constitute a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation wearable computing, soft robotics, and neuroprosthetics. For realization, with the achievement of simple synaptic behaviors in a single device, the construction of artificial synapses with various functions of sensing and responding and integrated systems to mimic complicated computing, sensing, and responding in biological systems is a prerequisite. Artificial synapses that have learning ability can perceive and react to events in the real world; these abilities expand the neuromorphic applications toward health monitoring and cybernetic devices in the future Internet of Things. To demonstrate the flexible neuromorphic systems successfully, it is essential to develop artificial synapses and nerves replicating the functionalities of the biological counterparts and satisfying the requirements for constructing the elements and the integrated systems such as flexibility, low power consumption, high&#8208;density integration, and biocompatibility. Here, the progress of flexible neuromorphic electronics is addressed, from basic backgrounds including synaptic characteristics, device structures, and mechanisms of artificial synapses and nerves, to applications for computing, soft robotics, and neuroprosthetics. Finally, future research directions toward wearable artificial neuromorphic systems are suggested for this emerging area.

      <title>Wireless Monitoring Using a Stretchable and Transparent Sensor Sheet Containing Metal Nanowires</title>
      <dc:description>
Optically and mechanically imperceptible sensor sheets that allow the wireless monitoring of biological signals to obtain low&#8208;noise measurements are discussed. This includes effective improvement methods for a Ag&#8208;nanowire&#8208;based track in terms of transparency, stretchability, reliability, and miniaturization with treatments, such as nanolevel Au plating. In addition, an organic amplifier is explored toward a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio.








Abstract
Mechanically and visually imperceptible sensor sheets integrated with lightweight wireless loggers are employed in ultimate flexible hybrid electronics (FHE) to reduce vital stress/nervousness and monitor natural biosignal responses. The key technologies and applications for conceptual sensor system fabrication are reported, as exemplified by the use of a stretchable sensor sheet completely conforming to an individual's body surface to realize a low&#8208;noise wireless monitoring system (&lt;1 &#181;V) that can be attached to the human forehead for recording electroencephalograms. The above system can discriminate between Alzheimer's disease and the healthy state, thus offering a rapid in&#8208;home brain diagnosis possibility. Moreover, the introduction of metal nanowires to improve the transparency of the biocompatible sensor sheet allows one to wirelessly acquire electrocorticograms of nonhuman primates and simultaneously offers optogenetic stimulation such as toward&#8208;the&#8208;brain&#8211;machine interface under free movement. Also discussed are effective methods of improving electrical reliability, biocompatibility, miniaturization, etc., for metal nanowire based tracks and exploring the use of an organic amplifier as an important component to realize a flexible active probe with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. Overall, ultimate FHE technologies are demonstrated to achieve efficient closed&#8208;loop systems for healthcare management, medical diagnostics, and preclinical studies in neuroscience and neuroengineering.

      <title>3D Self&#8208;Assembled Microelectronic Devices: Concepts, Materials, Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Conventional microelectronics have difficulties accommodating a number of 3D electronic components. Self&#8208;assembled 3D architectures are gradually brought into the field of microelectronics realizing 3D self&#8208;assembled passive, active, sensory, mechanical and energy&#8208;supply devices. The emerging compatibility among different technologies and novel materials defines the onset for fully parallel wafer&#8208;scale fabrication of 3D self&#8208;assembled microelectronic systems.








Abstract
Modern microelectronic systems and their components are essentially 3D devices that have become smaller and lighter in order to improve performance and reduce costs. To maintain this trend, novel materials and technologies are required that provide more structural freedom in 3D over conventional microelectronics, as well as easier parallel fabrication routes while maintaining compatability with existing manufacturing methods. Self&#8208;assembly of initially planar membranes into complex 3D architectures offers a wealth of opportunities to accommodate thin&#8208;film microelectronic functionalities in devices and systems possessing improved performance and higher integration density. Existing work in this field, with a focus on components constructed from 3D self&#8208;assembly, is reviewed, and an outlook on their application potential in tomorrow's microelectronics world is provided.

     alt="3D Self&#8208;Assembled Microelectronic Devices: Concepts, Materials, Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conventional microelectronics&lt;/b&gt; have difficulties accommodating a number of 3D electronic components. Self&#8208;assembled 3D architectures are gradually brought into the field of microelectronics realizing 3D self&#8208;assembled passive, active, sensory, mechanical and energy&#8208;supply devices. The emerging compatibility among different technologies and novel materials defines the onset for fully parallel wafer&#8208;scale fabrication of 3D self&#8208;assembled microelectronic systems.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern microelectronic systems and their components are essentially 3D devices that have become smaller and lighter in order to improve performance and reduce costs. To maintain this trend, novel materials and technologies are required that provide more structural freedom in 3D over conventional microelectronics, as well as easier parallel fabrication routes while maintaining compatability with existing manufacturing methods. Self&#8208;assembly of initially planar membranes into complex 3D architectures offers a wealth of opportunities to accommodate thin&#8208;film microelectronic functionalities in devices and systems possessing improved performance and higher integration density. Existing work in this field, with a focus on components constructed from 3D self&#8208;assembly, is reviewed, and an outlook on their application potential in tomorrow's microelectronics world is provided.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mechanically&#8208;Guided Structural Designs in Stretchable Inorganic Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
Diverse material structures for stretchable inorganic electronics are summarized, covering both functional devices and soft substrates, with a focus on the fundamental principles, design approaches, and system demonstrations. Strategies that allow spatial integration of 3D stretchable device configurations are also highlighted. Finally, perspectives on remaining challenges and open opportunities are provided.








Abstract
Over the past decade, the area of stretchable inorganic electronics has evolved very rapidly, in part because the results have opened up a series of unprecedented applications with broad interest and potential for impact, especially in bio&#8208;integrated systems. Low modulus mechanics and the ability to accommodate extreme mechanical deformations, especially high levels of stretching, represent key defining characteristics. Most existing studies exploit structural material designs to achieve these properties, through the integration of hard inorganic electronic components configured into strategic 2D/3D geometries onto patterned soft substrates. The diverse structural geometries developed for stretchable inorganic electronics are summarized, covering the designs of functional devices and soft substrates, with a focus on fundamental principles, design approaches, and system demonstrations. Strategies that allow spatial integration of 3D stretchable device layouts are also highlighted. Finally, perspectives on the remaining challenges and open opportunities are provided.

Abstract
Wearable electronics have revolutionized the way physiological parameters are sensed, detected, and monitored. In recent years, advances in flexible and stretchable hybrid electronics have created emergent properties that enhance the compliance of devices to our skin. With their unobtrusive attributes, skin conformable sensors enable applications toward real&#8208;time disease diagnosis and continuous healthcare monitoring. Herein, critical perspectives of flexible hybrid electronics toward the future of digital health monitoring are provided, emphasizing its role in physiological sensing. In particular, the strategies within the sensor composition to render flexibility and stretchability while maintaining excellent sensing performance are considered. Next, novel approaches to the functionalization of the sensor for physical or biochemical stimuli are extensively covered. Subsequently, wearable sensors measuring physical parameters such as strain, pressure, temperature, as well as biological changes in metabolites and electrolytes are reported. Finally, their implications toward early disease detection and monitoring are discussed, concluding with a future perspective into the challenges and opportunities in emerging wearable sensor designs for the next few years.

      <title>Van der Waals Epitaxy of III&#8208;Nitride Semiconductors Based on 2D Materials for Flexible Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Van der Waals epitaxy (vdWE) is presently the most promising strategy to obtain flexible III&#8208;nitride (opto)electronic devices based on sp2&#8208;bonded two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered materials. Recent progress in the fabrication of 2D materials, vdWE, and transfer printing of III&#8208;nitride films based on graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides is reviewed, and key points and future perspectives are discussed.








Abstract
III&#8208;nitride semiconductors have attracted considerable attention in recent years owing to their excellent physical properties and wide applications in solid&#8208;state lighting, flat&#8208;panel displays, and solar energy and power electronics. Generally, GaN&#8208;based devices are heteroepitaxially grown on c&#8208;plane sapphire, Si (111), or 6H&#8208;SiC substrates. However, it is very difficult to release the GaN&#8208;based films from such single&#8208;crystalline substrates and transfer them onto other foreign substrates. Consequently, it is difficult to meet the ever&#8208;increasing demand for wearable and foldable applications. On the other hand, sp2&#8208;bonded two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, which exhibit hexagonal in&#8208;plane lattice arrangements and weakly bonded layers, can be transferred onto flexible substrates with ease. Hence, flexible III&#8208;nitride devices can be implemented through such 2D release layers. In this progress report, the recent advances in the different strategies for the growth of III&#8208;nitrides based on 2D materials are reviewed, with a focus on van der Waals epitaxy and transfer printing. Various attempts are presented and discussed herein, including the different kinds of 2D materials (graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides) used as release layers. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives regarding the development of flexible III&#8208;nitride devices are discussed.

      <title>Conformable Hybrid Systems for Implantable Bioelectronic Interfaces</title>
      <dc:description>
Conformable hybrid systems for implantable bioelectronic interfaces enable safe diagnosis and therapy inside the body. Combining soft materials and high&#8208;performance electronics within thin&#8208;films or engineered form factors enables complex devices that can read/write into organs and tissues with unmet precision. Recent advances in materials science, micro/nanofabrication, packaging, and biomedical engineering are analyzed. Current challenges are highlighted with possible future solutions.








Abstract
Conformable bioelectronic systems are promising tools that may aid the understanding of diseases, alleviate pathological symptoms such as chronic pain, heart arrhythmia, and dysfunctions, and assist in reversing conditions such as deafness, blindness, and paralysis. Combining reduced invasiveness with advanced electronic functions, hybrid bioelectronic systems have evolved tremendously in the last decade, pushed by progress in materials science, micro&#8208; and nanofabrication, system assembly and packaging, and biomedical engineering. Hybrid integration refers here to a technological approach to embed within mechanically compliant carrier substrates electronic components and circuits prepared with traditional electronic materials. This combination leverages mechanical and electronic performance of polymer substrates and device materials, respectively, and offers many opportunities for man&#8208;made systems to communicate with the body with unmet precision. However, trade&#8208;offs between materials selection, manufacturing processes, resolution, electrical function, mechanical integrity, biointegration, and reliability should be considered. Herein, prominent trends in manufacturing conformable hybrid systems are analyzed and key design, function, and validation principles are outlined together with the remaining challenges to produce reliable conformable, hybrid bioelectronic systems.

      <title>Multiscale Soft&#8211;Hard Interface Design for Flexible Hybrid Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
A soft&#8211;hard interface design is crucial for the construction of next&#8208;generation thin, soft, lightweight, multifunctional, and skin&#8208;conformal hybrid electronic devices. A series of materials and structural designs, including macroscopic human&#8211;device interfaces, microscale structural interfaces, nanoscale interfaces, and molecular&#8208;scale interfaces, is reviewed to advance technologies for the seamless integration of soft electronics with the human body.








Abstract
Emerging next&#8208;generation soft electronics will require versatile properties functioning under mechanical compliance, which will involve the use of different types of materials. As a result, control over material interfaces (particularly soft/hard interfaces) has become crucial and is now attracting intensive worldwide research efforts. A series of material and structural interface designs has been devised to improve interfacial adhesion, preventing failure of electromechanical properties under mechanical deformation. Herein, different soft/hard interface design strategies at multiple length scales in the context of flexible hybrid electronics are reviewed. The crucial role of soft ligands and/or polymers in controlling the morphologies of active nanomaterials and stabilizing them is discussed, with a focus on understanding the soft/hard interface at the atomic/molecular scale. Larger nanoscopic and microscopic levels are also discussed, to scrutinize viable intrinsic and extrinsic interfacial designs with the purpose of promoting adhesion, stretchability, and durability. Furthermore, the macroscopic device/human interface as it relates to real&#8208;world applications is analyzed. Finally, a perspective on the current challenges and future opportunities in the development of truly seamlessly integrated soft wearable electronic systems is presented.

      <title>Rubbery Electronics Fully Made of Stretchable Elastomeric Electronic Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Compared to conventional rigid and bulky electronics, stretchable electronics have substantial advantages for various situations where large mechanical deformations are required. Recent progress shows stretchable electronics from all rubber&#8208;like components are excellent candidates to substitute electronics developed using architectural engineering for eliminating strain. The current development in rubbery electronics is reviewed and future directions for the field are suggested.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics outperform existing rigid and bulky electronics and benefit a wide range of species, including humans, machines, and robots, whose activities are associated with large mechanical deformation and strain. Due to the nonstretchable nature of most electronic materials, in particular semiconductors, stretchable electronics are mostly realized through the strategies of architectural engineering to accommodate mechanical stretching rather than imposing strain into the materials directly. On the other hand, recent development of stretchable electronics by creating them entirely from stretchable elastomeric electronic materials, i.e., rubbery electronics, suggests a feasible a venue. Rubbery electronics have gained increasing interest due to the unique advantages that they and their associated manufacturing technologies have offered. This work reviews the recent progress in developing rubbery electronics, including the crucial stretchable elastomeric materials of rubbery conductors, rubbery semiconductors, and rubbery dielectrics. Thereafter, various rubbery electronics such as rubbery transistors, integrated electronics, rubbery optoelectronic devices, and rubbery sensors are discussed.

      <title>Artificial Sensory Memory</title>
      <dc:description>
Transferring the biological concept of sensory memory into electronic implementation is promising to achieve perceptual intelligence. Recent endeavors on design, fabrication, and application of artificial sensory memory are summarized. Such a device would undoubtedly shed light on future advances with respect to various translational implementations such as robotics and prosthetics.








Abstract
Sensory memory, formed at the beginning while perceiving and interacting with the environment, is considered a primary source of intelligence. Transferring such biological concepts into electronic implementation aims at achieving perceptual intelligence, which would profoundly advance a broad spectrum of applications, such as prosthetics, robotics, and cyborg systems. Here, the recent developments in the design and fabrication of artificial sensory memory devices are summarized and their applications in recognition, manipulation, and learning are highlighted. The emergence of such devices benefits from recent progress in both bioinspired sensing and neuromorphic engineering technologies and derives from abundant inspiration and benchmarks from an improved understanding of biological sensory processing.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensory memory, formed at the beginning while perceiving and interacting with the environment, is considered a primary source of intelligence. Transferring such biological concepts into electronic implementation aims at achieving perceptual intelligence, which would profoundly advance a broad spectrum of applications, such as prosthetics, robotics, and cyborg systems. Here, the recent developments in the design and fabrication of artificial sensory memory devices are summarized and their applications in recognition, manipulation, and learning are highlighted. The emergence of such devices benefits from recent progress in both bioinspired sensing and neuromorphic engineering technologies and derives from abundant inspiration and benchmarks from an improved understanding of biological sensory processing. Increasing attention to this area would offer unprecedented opportunities toward new hardware architecture of artificial intelligence, which could extend the capabilities of digital systems with emotional/psychological attributes. Pending challenges are also addressed to aspects such as integration level, energy efficiency, and functionality, which would undoubtedly shed light on the future development of translational implementations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Material&#8208;Based Approaches for the Fabrication of Stretchable Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
The latest research developments and progress regarding material&#8208;based approaches for the fabrication of stretchable electronics are comprehensively reviewed. Detailed descriptions of various stretchable conducting/semiconducting composites are given, along with their electrical/mechanical properties, material processing strategies, and examples of device applications. In addition, the outlook for future research in this field is discussed.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics are mechanically compatible with a variety of objects, especially with the soft curvilinear contours of the human body, enabling human&#8208;friendly electronics applications that could not be achieved with conventional rigid electronics. Therefore, extensive research effort has been devoted to the development of stretchable electronics, from research on materials and unit device, to fully integrated systems. In particular, material&#8208;processing technologies that encompass the synthesis, assembly, and patterning of intrinsically stretchable electronic materials have been actively investigated and have provided many notable breakthroughs for the advancement of stretchable electronics. Here, the latest studies of such material&#8208;based approaches are reviewed, mainly focusing on intrinsically stretchable electronic nanocomposites that generally consist of conducting/semiconducting filler materials inside or on elastomer backbone matrices. Various approaches for fabricating these intrinsically stretchable electronic materials are presented, including the blending of electronic fillers into elastomer matrices, the formation of bi&#8208;layered heterogeneous electronic&#8208;layer and elastomer support&#8208;layer structures, and modifications to polymeric molecular structures in order to impart stretchability. Detailed descriptions of the various conducting/semiconducting composites prepared by each method are provided, along with their electrical/mechanical properties and examples of device applications. To conclude, a brief future outlook is presented.

      <title>Flexible and Stretchable Antennas for Biointegrated Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
Flexible and stretchable antennas are critical components of wireless, biointegrated electronics. An overview of material choices and design strategies is provided. Optimization methods and performance characteristics are considered for a range of applications, with an emphasis on wearable devices. The antennas can support data transmission, external control interfaces, power harvesting, and can also function as sensors of mechanical deformations.








Abstract
Combined advances in material science, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering form the foundations of thin, soft electronic/optoelectronic platforms that have unique capabilities in wireless monitoring and control of various biological processes in cells, tissues, and organs. Miniaturized, stretchable antennas represent an essential link between such devices and external systems for control, power delivery, data processing, and/or communication. Applications typically involve a demanding set of considerations in performance, size, and stretchability. Some of the most effective strategies rely on unusual materials such as liquid metals, nanowires, and woven textiles or on optimally configured 2D/3D structures such as serpentines and helical coils of conventional materials. In the best cases, the performance metrics of small, stretchable, radio frequency (RF) antennas realized using these strategies compare favorably to those of traditional devices. Examples range from dipole, monopole, and patch antennas for far&#8208;field RF operation, to magnetic loop antennas for near&#8208;field communication (NFC), where the key parameters include operating frequency, Q factor, radiation pattern, and reflection coefficient S11 across a range of mechanical deformations and cyclic loads. Despite significant progress over the last several years, many challenges and associated research opportunities remain in the development of high&#8208;efficiency antennas for biointegrated electronic/optoelectronic systems.

      <title>Trace&#8208;Level, Multi&#8208;Gas Detection for Food Quality Assessment Based on Decorated Silicon Transistor Arrays</title>
      <dc:description>
Multiplexed gas sensors for monitoring food freshness can potentially limit food waste and promote safe consumption. Integrated arrays of silicon&#8208;based, chemical&#8208;sensitive field&#8208;effect transistors are presented to monitor gases typically associated with food spoilage, including ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and humidity. These sensors are integrated into a compact and portable platform envisioned for integration into smart fridges to assess food quality dynamically.








Abstract
Multiplexed gas detection at room temperature is critical for practical applications, such as for tracking the complex chemical environments associated with food decomposition and spoilage. An integrated array of multiple silicon&#8208;based, chemical&#8208;sensitive field effect transistors (CSFETs) is presented to realize selective, sensitive, and simultaneous measurement of gases typically associated with food spoilage. CSFETs decorated with sensing materials based on ruthenium, silver, and silicon oxide are used to obtain stable room&#8208;temperature responses to ammonia (NH3), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and humidity, respectively. For example, one multi&#8208;CSFET sensor signal changes from its baseline by 13.34 in response to 1 ppm of NH3, 724.45 under 1 ppm H2S, and 23.46 under 80% relative humidity, with sensitive detection down to 10 ppb of NH3 and H2S. To demonstrate this sensor for practical applications, the CSFET sensor array is combined with a custom&#8208;printed circuit board into a compact, fully integrated, and portable system to conduct real&#8208;time monitoring of gases generated by decomposing food. By using existing silicon&#8208;based manufacturing methodologies, this room&#8208;temperature gas sensing array can be fabricated reproducibly and at low cost, making it an attractive platform for ambient gas measurement needed in food safety applications.

      <title>Ligand&#8208;Modulated Excess PbI2 Nanosheets for Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells generally consist of an excess of lead iodide (PbI2) as passivator. In this work, ligand&#8208;modulation technology is demonstrated to fabricate vertically distributed PbI2 nanosheets between the perovskite grain boundaries, which enhances the passivation effect of PbI2 and improves the power conversion efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Excess lead iodide (PbI2), as a defect passivation material in perovskite films, contributes to the longer carrier lifetime and reduced halide vacancies for high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells. However, the random distribution of excess PbI2 also leads to accelerated degradation of the perovskite layer. Inspired by nanocrystal synthesis, here, a universal ligand&#8208;modulation technology is developed to modulate the shape and distribution of excess PbI2 in perovskite films. By adding certain ligands, perovskite films with vertically distributed PbI2 nanosheets between the grain boundaries are successfully achieved, which reduces the nonradiative recombination and trap density of the perovskite layer. Thus, the power conversion efficiency of the modulated device increases from 20% to 22% compared to the control device. In addition, benefiting from the vertical distribution of excess PbI2 and the hydrophobic nature of the surface ligands, the modulated devices exhibit much longer stability, retaining 72% of their initial efficiency after 360 h constant illumination under maximum power point tracking measurement.

In this work, ligand&#8208;modulation technology is demonstrated to fabricate vertically distributed PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets between the perovskite grain boundaries, which enhances the passivation effect of PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and improves the power conversion efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excess lead iodide (PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), as a defect passivation material in perovskite films, contributes to the longer carrier lifetime and reduced halide vacancies for high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells. However, the random distribution of excess PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; also leads to accelerated degradation of the perovskite layer. Inspired by nanocrystal synthesis, here, a universal ligand&#8208;modulation technology is developed to modulate the shape and distribution of excess PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in perovskite films. By adding certain ligands, perovskite films with vertically distributed PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets between the grain boundaries are successfully achieved, which reduces the nonradiative recombination and trap density of the perovskite layer. Thus, the power conversion efficiency of the modulated device increases from 20% to 22% compared to the control device. In addition, benefiting from the vertical distribution of excess PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the hydrophobic nature of the surface ligands, the modulated devices exhibit much longer stability, retaining 72% of their initial efficiency after 360 h constant illumination under maximum power point tracking measurement.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Somatosensory, Light&#8208;Driven, Thin&#8208;Film Robots Capable of Integrated Perception and Motility</title>
      <dc:description>
Somatosensory light&#8208;driven robots (SLiRs) are devised using a smart thin&#8208;film composite that tightly integrates actuation and multisensing. An SLiR subsumes pyro/piezoelectric responses and piezoresistive strain sensation under a photoactuator transducer, enabling simultaneous yet non&#8208;interfering perception of its body temperature and actuation deformation states. The compact thin film, when combined with kirigami, facilitates rapid customization of morphable robotic functionalities and somatosensory receptions.








Abstract
Living organisms are capable of sensing and responding to their environment through reflex&#8208;driven pathways. The grand challenge for mimicking such natural intelligence in miniature robots lies in achieving highly integrated body functionality, actuation, and sensing mechanisms. Here, somatosensory light&#8208;driven robots (SLiRs) based on a smart thin&#8208;film composite tightly integrating actuation and multisensing are presented. The SLiR subsumes pyro/piezoelectric responses and piezoresistive strain sensation under a photoactuator transducer, enabling simultaneous yet non&#8208;interfering perception of its body temperature and actuation deformation states. The compact thin film, when combined with kirigami, facilitates rapid customization of low&#8208;profile structures for morphable, mobile, and multiple robotic functionality. For example, an SLiR walker can move forward on different surfaces, while providing feedback on its detailed locomotive gaits and subtle terrain textures, and an SLiR anthropomorphic hand shows bodily senses arising from concerted mechanoreception, thermoreception, proprioception, and photoreception. Untethered operation with an SLiR centipede is also demonstrated, which can execute distinct, localized body functions from directional motility, multisensing, to wireless human and environment interactions. This SLiR, which is capable of integrated perception and motility, offers new opportunities for developing diverse intelligent behaviors in soft robots.

      <title>High&#8208;Performance Fluorinated Fused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptor with 3D Stacking and Exciton/Charge Transport</title>
      <dc:description>
A fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor FINIC with fluorination of both end groups and side chains is designed and synthesized, and compared with its nonfluorinated analogue INIC. FINIC exhibits 3D molecular stacking, exciton transport and charge transport. FINIC&#8208;based organic solar cells yield an efficiency of 14.0%, far exceeding that of the INIC&#8208;based devices (5.1%).








Abstract
A new fluorinated electron acceptor (FINIC) based on 6,6,12,12&#8208;tetrakis(3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;hexylphenyl)&#8208;indacenobis(dithieno[3,2&#8208;b;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene) as the electron&#8208;donating central core and 5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;(1,1&#8208;dicyanomethylene)&#8208;1&#8208;indanone as the electron&#8208;deficient end groups is rationally designed and synthesized. FINIC shows similar absorption profile in dilute solution to the nonfluorinated analogue INIC. However, compared with INIC, FINIC film shows red&#8208;shifted absorption, down&#8208;shifted frontier molecular orbital energy levels, enhanced crystallinity, and more ordered molecular packing. Single&#8208;crystal structure data show that FINIC molecules pack into closer 3D &#8220;network&#8221; motif through H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction, while INIC molecules pack into incompact &#8220;honeycomb&#8221; motif through only &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Theoretical calculations reveal that FINIC has stronger electronic coupling and more molecular interactions than INIC. FINIC has higher electron mobilities in both horizontal and vertical directions than INIC. Moreover, FINIC and INIC support efficient 3D exciton transport. PBD&#8208;SF/FINIC blend has a larger driving force for exciton splitting, more efficient charge transfer and photoinduced charge generation. Finally, the organic solar cells based on PBD&#8208;SF/FINIC blend yield power conversion efficiency of 14.0%, far exceeding that of the PBD&#8208;SF/INIC&#8208;based devices (5.1%).

      <title>Emergence of Nontrivial Low&#8208;Energy Dirac Fermions in Antiferromagnetic EuCd2As2</title>
      <dc:description>
When magnetism meets topology, colorful novel states can be created in materials. The realization of magnetic topological Dirac materials remains a major issue in topological physics studies. In this work, it is ascertained that the topologically nontrivial ground state of EuCd2As2 is a good candidate for different types of magnetic topological state: magnetic topological Dirac semimetal, axion insulator, antiferromagnetic TCI, and higher order topological insulator.








Abstract
Parity&#8208;time symmetry plays an essential role for the formation of Dirac states in Dirac semimetals. So far, all of the experimentally identified topologically nontrivial Dirac semimetals (DSMs) possess both parity and time reversal symmetry. The realization of magnetic topological DSMs remains a major issue in topological material research. Here, combining angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy with density functional theory calculations, it is ascertained that band inversion induces a topologically nontrivial ground state in EuCd2As2. As a result, ideal magnetic Dirac fermions with simplest double cone structure near the Fermi level emerge in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase. The magnetic order breaks time reversal symmetry, but preserves inversion symmetry. The double degeneracy of the Dirac bands is protected by a combination of inversion, time&#8208;reversal, and an additional translation operation. Moreover, the calculations show that a deviation of the magnetic moments from the c&#8208;axis leads to the breaking of C3 rotation symmetry, and thus, a small bandgap opens at the Dirac point in the bulk. In this case, the system hosts a novel state containing three different types of topological insulator: axion insulator, AFM topological crystalline insulator (TCI), and higher order topological insulator. The results provide an enlarged platform for the quest of topological Dirac fermions in a magnetic system.

      <title>High&#8208;Mobility 2D Hole Gas at a SrTiO3 Interface</title>
      <dc:description>
By depositing a sub&#8208;nanometer&#8208;thick Fe layer on STO substrates at room temperature, a 2DHG with the highest hole mobility ever reported for oxides is realized at the STO interface. The carrier type can be switched from p&#8208;type (2DHG) to n&#8208;type (2DEG) by controlling the Fe thickness.

Abstract
Strontium titanate (SrTiO3 or STO) is important for oxide&#8208;based electronics as it serves as a standard substrate for a wide range of high&#8208;temperature superconducting cuprates, colossal magnetoresistive manganites, and multiferroics. Moreover, in its heterostructures with different materials, STO exhibits a broad spectrum of important physics such as superconductivity, magnetism, the quantum Hall effect, giant thermoelectric effect, and colossal ionic conductivity, most of which emerge in a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) electron gas (2DEG) formed at an STO interface. However, little is known about its counterpart system, a 2D hole gas (2DHG) at the STO interface. Here, a simple way of realizing a 2DHG with an ultrahigh mobility of 24 000 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 is demonstrated using an interface between STO and a thin amorphous FeOy layer, made by depositing a sub&#8208;nanometer&#8208;thick Fe layer on an STO substrate at room temperature. This mobility is the highest among those reported for holes in oxides. The carrier type can be switched from p&#8208;type (2DHG) to n&#8208;type (2DEG) by controlling the Fe thickness. This unprecedented method of forming a 2DHG at an STO interface provides a pathway to unexplored hole&#8208;related physics in this system and enables extremely low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;speed oxide electronics.

      <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Photodriven Self&#8208;Sustained Oscillation of Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Network Film with Predesignated Polydopamine Coating</title>
      <dc:description>
Liquid crystalline network (LCN) film showing steady oscillation behavior driven by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light is prepared by selectively modifying the film with polydopamine coating, which makes the NIR&#8208;light&#8208;driven LCN oscillator designable and reprogrammable. It is found that the NIR light in focused sunlight is enough to actuate the oscillation, providing a new strategy to fabrication of solar power generation devices.








Abstract
Movement is one of the vital features of living systems, and remote control of bioinspired soft robotic systems in a precise, contactless and harmless way is extremely desirable but challenging. A near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photodriven polymeric oscillator is designed and fabricated by selectively coating a mussel&#8208;inspired polydopamine (PDA) polymer layer on the surface of splay&#8208;aligned liquid crystalline network (LCN) film. The oscillating motions of the LCN oscillators can be facilely manipulated by tuning light intensity and film thickness. More importantly, the programmability of the PDA coating enables the oscillating behaviors of LCN film to be predesignated and finely adjusted by coating the film with PDA locally and repeatedly. The self&#8208;oscillating movement mechanism can be attributed to the temperature oscillation at the PDA&#8208;coated LCN film since it is alternatively exposed and sheltered to the NIR&#8208;light irradiations. Owing to over 50% NIR irradiation in solar spectrum, PDA&#8208;coated film is found to oscillate upon exposure of focused sunlight, presenting great potential in fabrication of solar power generation devices. This provides a versatile strategy to fabricate NIR&#8208;light&#8208;actuated polymeric oscillators, providing inspirations in the development of biological soft robots and advanced biomimetic devices.

      <title>Sequential Targeting in Crosslinking Nanotheranostics for Tackling the Multibarriers of Brain Tumors</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel sequential targeting in crosslinking (STICK) nanodelivery strategy is developed to circumvent multiple physiological barriers to improve drug delivery to brain tumors, utilizing an &#8220;interlocking stratagem.&#8221; This STICK nanoplatform significantly inhibits tumor growth and prolongs the survival time with limited toxicity in mice with aggressive, intracranial brain tumors. This strategy can potentially enhance the clinical outcome of brain tumor patients.








Abstract
The efficacy of therapeutics for brain tumors is seriously hampered by multiple barriers to drug delivery, including severe destabilizing effects in the blood circulation, the blood&#8211;brain barrier/blood&#8211;brain tumor barrier (BBB/BBTB), and limited tumor uptake. Here, a sequential targeting in crosslinking (STICK) nanodelivery strategy is presented to circumvent these important physiological barriers to improve drug delivery to brain tumors. STICK nanoparticles (STICK&#8208;NPs) can sequentially target BBB/BBTB and brain tumor cells with surface maltobionic acid (MA) and 4&#8208;carboxyphenylboronic acid (CBA), respectively, and simultaneously enhance nanoparticle stability with pH&#8208;responsive crosslinkages formed by MA and CBA in situ. STICK&#8208;NPs exhibit prolonged circulation time (17&#8208;fold higher area under curve) than the free agent, allowing increased opportunities to transpass the BBB/BBTB via glucose&#8208;transporter&#8208;mediated transcytosis by MA. The tumor acidic environment then triggers the transformation of the STICK&#8208;NPs into smaller nanoparticles and reveals a secondary CBA targeting moiety for deep tumor penetration and enhanced uptake in tumor cells. STICK&#8208;NPs significantly inhibit tumor growth and prolong the survival time with limited toxicity in mice with aggressive and chemoresistant diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. This formulation tackles multiple physiological barriers on&#8208;demand with a simple and smart STICK design. Therefore, these features allow STICK&#8208;NPs to unleash the potential of brain tumor therapeutics to improve their treatment efficacy.

      <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Free and Dendrite&#8208;Free All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Zn anodes persistently suffer from deep&#8208;seated issues of the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth. Meanwhile, hydrogel&#8208;based Zn batteries suffer from poor mechanical properties and dehydration. An ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;based Zn salt electrolyte to solve both the side&#8208;reaction of the HER and Zn&#8208;dendrite growth is developed. Furthermore, a solid polymer electrolyte is constructed to build an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;ion battery.








Abstract
An ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;based Zn salt electrolyte is demonstrated to be an effective route to solve both the side&#8208;reaction of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and Zn&#8208;dendrite growth in Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The developed electrolyte enables hydrogen&#8208;free, dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping over 1500 h cycle (3000 cycles) at 2 mA cm&#8211;2 with nearly 100% coulombic efficiency. Meanwhile, the oxygen&#8208;induced corrosion and passivation are also effectively suppressed. These features bring Zn&#8208;ion batteries an unprecedented long lifespan over 40 000 cycles at 4 A g&#8211;1 and high voltage of 2.05 V with a cobalt hexacyanoferrate cathode. Furthermore, a 28.6 &#181;m thick solid polymer electrolyte of a poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) film filled with poly(ethylene oxide)/ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;based Zn salt is constructed to build an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;ion battery. The all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;ion batteries show excellent cycling performance of 30 000 cycles at 2 A g&#8211;1 at room temperature and withstand high temperature up to 70 &#176;C, low temperature to &#8211;20 &#176;C, as well as abuse test of bending deformation up to 150&#176; for 100 cycles and eight times cutting. This is the first demonstration of an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;ion battery based on a newly developed electrolyte, which meanwhile solves the deep&#8208;seated hydrogen evolution and dendrite growth problem in traditional Zn&#8208;ion batteries.

      <title>Dendronized&#8208;Polymer Disturbing Cells' Stress Protection by Targeting Metabolism Leads to Tumor Vulnerability</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel dendronized&#8208;polymeric nanostructure is introduced, which not only delivers a therapeutic agent for photodynamic therapy, but also intervenes in the metabolic pathways of tumor cells to incapacitate the protection mechanisms for their adaptation and survival. This study represents a new potential platform based on dendronized polymers that target cancer cell metabolism for tumor suppression.








Abstract
Metabolic demand of cancer is quite unique compared to normal tissues and this is an emerging hallmark of cancer, which brings a potential opportunity to discover drugs that target cancer cell metabolism. Herein, the development of a dendronized pyropheophorbide a (Ppa)&#8208;conjugated polymer (DPP) is reported, and a linear Ppa&#8208;conjugated polymer (LPP) is reported as a control. DPP is found to disturb cellular metabolism including increased energy depletion, dysfunctional H+ regulation, and decreased antioxidation, resulting in deficiency in protecting cells from stresses. These vulnerable cells are subjected to photodynamic therapy (PDT) treatment in the presence of DPP, resulting in attenuated cancer cell growth and eventually cell death. The in vivo anticancer efficacy is also ascribed to significantly prolonged blood circulation and enhanced tumor accumulation of DPP due to its unique molecular structure. This study presents a new platform using dendronized polymers for tumor suppression by targeting cancer cell metabolism.

      <title>Inhibiting Random Droplet Motion on Hot Surfaces by Engineering Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Janus&#8208;Mushroom Structure</title>
      <dc:description>
Droplets impacting on hot surfaces can randomly bounce off without becoming fully evaporated for efficient heat transfer. By surrounding a conventional surface with a unique Janus&#8208;mushroom structure endowed with favorable directionality, it is possible to concentrate small impacting droplets preferentially onto a localized hotspot to achieve enhanced cooling efficiency.








Abstract
Concentrating impacting droplets onto a localized hotspot and inducing them to remain in a preferential heat transfer mode is essential for efficient thermal management such as spray cooling. Conventionally, droplets impacting on hot surfaces can randomly bounce off without becoming fully evaporated, resulting in low heat transfer efficiency. Although the directional and guided transport of impacting droplets to a preferential location can be achieved through the introduction of a structural gradient, the manifestation of such a motion requires the meticulous control of the spatial location where the droplet is released. Here, a novel surface consisting of regularly patterned posts with Janus&#8208;mushroom structure (JMS) is designed, in which the sidewalls of the individual posts are decorated with straight and curved morphologies. It is revealed that such structural symmetry&#8208;breaking in the individual posts leads to directional liquid penetration and vapor flow toward the straight sidewall, and also reduces the work of adhesion, altogether triggering collective and preferential droplet transport at a high temperature. By surrounding a conventional surface with JMS endowed with favorable directionality, it is possible to concentrate small impacting droplets preferentially onto a localized hotspot to achieve enhanced cooling efficiency.

&lt;p&gt;Droplets impacting on hot surfaces can randomly bounce off without becoming fully evaporated for efficient heat transfer. By surrounding a conventional surface with a unique Janus&#8208;mushroom structure endowed with favorable directionality, it is possible to concentrate small impacting droplets preferentially onto a localized hotspot to achieve enhanced cooling efficiency.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concentrating impacting droplets onto a localized hotspot and inducing them to remain in a preferential heat transfer mode is essential for efficient thermal management such as spray cooling. Conventionally, droplets impacting on hot surfaces can randomly bounce off without becoming fully evaporated, resulting in low heat transfer efficiency. Although the directional and guided transport of impacting droplets to a preferential location can be achieved through the introduction of a structural gradient, the manifestation of such a motion requires the meticulous control of the spatial location where the droplet is released. Here, a novel surface consisting of regularly patterned posts with Janus&#8208;mushroom structure (JMS) is designed, in which the sidewalls of the individual posts are decorated with straight and curved morphologies. It is revealed that such structural symmetry&#8208;breaking in the individual posts leads to directional liquid penetration and vapor flow toward the straight sidewall, and also reduces the work of adhesion, altogether triggering collective and preferential droplet transport at a high temperature. By surrounding a conventional surface with JMS endowed with favorable directionality, it is possible to concentrate small impacting droplets preferentially onto a localized hotspot to achieve enhanced cooling efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Adhesive Surface Enables High&#8208;Performance Mechanical Energy Harvesting with Unique Frequency&#8208;Insensitive and Pressure&#8208;Enhanced Output Characteristics</title>
      <dc:description>
A conceptually new strategy of using contact electrification of viscoelastic polymer adhesive (VPA) surfaces is proposed and developed for green and sustainable electric energy generation by scavenging low&#8208;frequency and irregular mechanical energy with greatly improved performance. Such VPA&#8208;based generators also possess a unique frequency&#8208;insensitive output characteristic, and their electric performance is further enhanced by suitable introduction of a second adhesive layer.








Abstract
Viscoelastic polymer adhesives (VPAs) are common materials broadly used in adhesive tapes for bonding objects tightly in daily life. This work presents a conceptually new strategy of using contact electrification (rather than strong adhesion) of VPAs to directly convert mechanical energy to electric energy, generally showing 202&#8211;419% of the electric energy generated by conventional mechanical energy harvesters under the same triggering conditions. More notably, the VPA&#8208;based generators (VPAGs) possess unique frequency&#8208;insensitive and pressure&#8208;enhanced output characteristics. The output power of a VPAG not only does not show regular degradation of performance with the decrease of triggering frequency, but also can be further enhanced by simple introduction of a second VPA layer with a smaller area to increase the applied pressure without the requirement of rising applied force. The average output power density of a VPAG with a second layer of 0.5 cm &#215; 0.5 cm can reach 216.7 &#181;W cm&#8722;2, which is &#8776;150% larger than that of a VPAG without a second VPA layer. This research is of significance to harvesting the random, irregular, and low&#8208;frequency (bio&#8208;)mechanical energy that widely exists but is wasted in the environment for both stable electric energy generation and electronic device operation.

      <title>Enabling Rapid Charging Lithium Metal Batteries via Surface Acoustic Wave&#8208;Driven Electrolyte Flow</title>
      <dc:description>
Remarkably, incorporating a small, 100 MHz surface acoustic wave device (SAW) makes rechargeable lithium metal batteries practical, avoiding dendrite growth and rapid failure by encouraging electrolyte flow, which in turn, eliminates the lithium depletion layer next to the anode, leading to dense lithium plating even during very rapid charging.








Abstract
Both powerful and unstable, practical lithium metal batteries have remained a difficult challenge for over 50 years. With severe ion depletion gradients in the electrolyte during charging, they rapidly develop porosity, dendrites, and dead Li that cause poor performance and, all too often, spectacular failure. Remarkably, incorporating a small, 100 MHz surface acoustic wave device (SAW) solves this problem. Providing acoustic streaming electrolyte flow during charging, the device enables dense Li plating and avoids porosity and dendrites. SAW&#8208;integrated Li cells can operate up to 6 mA cm&#8722;2 in a commercial carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte; omitting the SAW leads to short circuiting at 2 mA cm&#8722;2. The Li deposition is morphologically dendrite&#8208;free and close to theoretical density when cycling with the SAW. With a 245 &#181;m thick Li anode in a full Li||LFP (LiFePO4) cell, introducing the SAW increases the uncycled Li from 145 to 225 &#181;m, decreasing Li consumption from 41% to only 8%. A closed&#8208;form model is provided to explain the phenomena and serve as a design tool for integrating this chemistry&#8208;agnostic approach into batteries whatever the chemistry within.

      <title>Exploiting Supramolecular Interactions from Polymeric Colloids for Strong Anisotropic Adhesion between Solid Surfaces</title>
      <dc:description>
Strong and highly anisometric polymeric crystals of cellulose (cellulose nanocrystals) are explored as adhesives resulting in emergent microstructures. Their self&#8208;assembly under confinement enables alignment of the nanocrystals within macroscale lamellae. The colloidal structural adhesive, architectured from the nanometer to the centimeter&#8208;scale, presents more than 70 folds in anisotropy of adhesion, when comparing stresses applied in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane.








Abstract
Adhesion occurs by covalent bonding, as in reactive structural adhesives, or through noncovalent interactions, which are nearly ubiquitous in nature. A classic example of the latter is gecko feet, where hierarchical features enhance friction across the contact area. Biomimicry of such structured adhesion is regularly achieved by top&#8208;down lithography, which allows for direction&#8208;dependent detachment. However, bottom&#8208;up approaches remain elusive given the scarcity of building blocks that yield strong, cohesive, self&#8208;assembly across multiple length scales. Herein, an exception is introduced, namely, aqueous dispersions of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) that form superstructured, adherent layers between solid surfaces upon confined evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (C&#8208;EISA). The inherently strong CNCs (EA &gt; 140 GPa) align into rigid, nematically ordered lamellae across multiple length scales as a result of the stresses associated with confined evaporation. This long&#8208;range order produces remarkable anisotropic adhesive strength when comparing in&#8208;plane (&#8776;7 MPa) and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (&#8804;0.08 MPa) directions. These adhesive attributes, resulting from self&#8208;assembly, substantially outperform previous biomimetic adhesives obtained by top&#8208;down microfabrication (dry adhesives, friction driven), and represent a unique fluid (aqueous)&#8208;based system with significant anisotropy of adhesion. By using C&#8208;EISA, new emergent properties will be closely tied with the nature of colloids and their hierarchical assemblies.

      <title>In Situ Coating Graphdiyne for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density and Stable Organic Cathodes</title>
      <dc:description>
The market boom of Li&#8208;ion batteries has exacerbated the resource shortage and environmentally unfriendly technologies in traditional cathodes. The in situ growth of graphdiyne fills the blank in coating technologies for organic cathodes to solve their issues of low conductivity and molecular dissolution. High&#8208;energy&#8208;density organic batteries can become compelling alternatives for Li&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The preparation of organic small&#8208;molecule cathodes is simple and low&#8208;cost; however, their low conductivity and molecular dissolution are two key issues that mean their energy density and power performance are far lower than those of inorganic batteries, thus hindering their practical application. To develop an effective coating technology is the key to obtain high&#8208;performance organic batteries. A general method of in situ weaving all&#8208;carbon graphdiyne nanocoatings is demonstrated. The graphdiyne can be conformally weaved on organic particles under mild conditions so that the conductivity is increased and the dissolution is suppressed. After weaving graphdiyne nanocoat, the active mass of the small&#8208;molecule organic cathodes rise to 93%, thus delivering a higher energy density of 310 W h kg&#8722;1 than previously reported, and the power performance and long&#8208;term stability are greatly improved. Additionally, this method shows great potential to become the crucial technology for fabricating organic batteries with energy density close to prevailing lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

      <title>FIB&#8208;Patterned Nano&#8208;Supercapacitors: Minimized Size with Ultrahigh Performances</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel strategy is demonstrated to break through the resolution limit of microsized supercapacitors by preparing nano&#8208;supercapacitors (NSCs) with interdigital nanosized electrodes via focused ion beam (FIB) technology. The minimization of the size of the NSCs leads to a large increase in capacitance, with a high volumetric capacitance of 18 700 F cm&#8722;3, which is far superior to other reported examples.








Abstract
Advances in microelectronic system technology have necessitated the development and miniaturization of energy storage devices. Supercapacitors are an important complement to batteries in microelectronic systems; and further reduction of the size of micro&#8208;supercapacitors is challenging. Here, a novel strategy is demonstrated to break through the resolution limit of micro&#8208;supercapacitors by preparing nano&#8208;supercapacitors (NSCs) with interdigital nanosized electrodes using focused ion beam technology.

&lt;p&gt;A novel strategy is demonstrated to break through the resolution limit of microsized supercapacitors by preparing nano&#8208;supercapacitors (NSCs) with interdigital nanosized electrodes via focused ion beam (FIB) technology. The minimization of the size of the NSCs leads to a large increase in capacitance, with a high volumetric capacitance of 18 700 F cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which is far superior to other reported examples.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advances in microelectronic system technology have necessitated the development and miniaturization of energy storage devices. Supercapacitors are an important complement to batteries in microelectronic systems; and further reduction of the size of micro&#8208;supercapacitors is challenging. Here, a novel strategy is demonstrated to break through the resolution limit of micro&#8208;supercapacitors by preparing nano&#8208;supercapacitors (NSCs) with interdigital nanosized electrodes using focused ion beam technology. The minimization of the size of the NSCs leads to a large increase in capacitance, with a high areal capacitance of 9.52 mF cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a volumetric capacitance of 18 700 F cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, far superior to those of other reported works. Size reduction and the narrowing of the physical separation between nanoelectrodes are proved to be the most crucial factors in the enhancement of capacitive performances.

      <title>Flexible All&#8208;Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells with High&#8208;Performance Nonfullerene Active Layers</title>
      <dc:description>
All&#8208;solution&#8208;processed and printable nonfullerene organic solar cells are fabricated. All layers from the substrate to the top electrode are solution&#8208;processed. Hydrogen molybdenum bronze is introduced to solve the charge extraction issue and the wetting issue of the top electrode (PEDOT:PSS) on a hydrophobic active layer. Efficiency over 10% (&gt;1 cm2) is obtained for the all&#8208;solution&#8208;processed nonfullerene solar cells.








Abstract
All&#8208;solution&#8208;processed organic solar cells (from the bottom substrate to the top electrode) are highly desirable for low&#8208;cost and ubiquitous applications. However, it is still challenging to fabricate efficient all&#8208;solution&#8208;processed organic solar cells with a high&#8208;performance nonfullerene (NF) active layer. Issues of charge extraction and wetting are persistent at the interface between the nonfullerene active layer and the printable top electrode (PEDOT:PSS). In this work, efficient all&#8208;solution&#8208;processed NF organic solar cells (from the bottom substrate to the top electrode) are reported via the adoption of a layer of hydrogen molybdenum bronze (HXMoO3) between the active layer and the PEDOT:PSS. The dual functions of HXMoO3 include: 1) its deep Fermi level of &#8722;5.44 eV can effectively extract holes from the active layer; and 2) the wetting issues of the PEDOT:PSS on the hydrophobic surface of the NF active layer can be solved. Importantly, fine control of the HXMoO3 composition during the synthesis is critical in obtaining processing orthogonality between HXMoO3 and the PEDOT:PSS. Flexible all&#8208;solution&#8208;processed NF organic solar cells with power conversion efficiencies of 11.9% and 10.3% are obtained for solar cells with an area of 0.04 and 1 cm2, respectively.

      <title>Realizing Ultrahigh Mechanical Flexibility and &gt;15% Efficiency of Flexible Organic Solar Cells via a &#8220;Welding&#8221; Flexible Transparent Electrode</title>
      <dc:description>
A &#8220;welding&#8221; transparent flexible electrode, with respect to both the upper electrode and the underlying substrate, for fabricating high&#8208;performance flexible OSCs is proposed, resulting in a record power conversion efficiency of single&#8208;junction flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) with excellent mechanical properties.








Abstract
The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) still lag behind those of rigid devices and their mechanical stability is unable to meet the needs of flexible electronics at present due to the lack of a high&#8208;performance flexible transparent electrode (FTE). Here, a so&#8208;called &#8220;welding&#8221; concept is proposed to design an FTE with tight binding of the upper electrode and the underlying substrate. The upper electrode consisting of solution&#8208;processed Al&#8208;doped ZnO (AZO) and silver nanowire (AgNW) network is well welded by utilizing the capillary force effect and secondary growth of AZO, leading to a reduction of the AgNWs junction site resistance. Meanwhile, the poly(ethylene terephthalate) is modified by embedding the AgNWs, which are then used to link with the AgNWs in the upper hybrid electrode, thus enhancing the adhesion of the electrode to the substrate. By this welding strategy, critical bottleneck issues relating to the FTEs in terms of optoelectronic and mechanical properties are comprehensively addressed. The single&#8208;junction flexible OSCs based on this welded FTE show a high performance, achieving a record high PCE of 15.21%. In addition, the PCEs of the flexible OSCs are less influenced by the device area and display robust bending durability even under extreme test conditions.

      <title>Gate&#8208;Coupling&#8208;Enabled Robust Hysteresis for Nonvolatile Memory and Programmable Rectifier in Van der Waals Ferroelectric Heterojunctions</title>
      <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;gated ferroelectric vdWHs devices are fabricated and studied systematically. With the insertion of hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) and a dual&#8208;gated coupling device configuration, the devices show outstanding performances when used as nonvolatile memory and programmable rectifier. This demonstrates the promising potential of ferroelectric vdWHs for new multifunctional ferroelectric devices.








Abstract
Ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistors (FeFETs) are one of the most interesting ferroelectric devices; however, they, usually suffer from low interface quality. The recently discovered 2D layered ferroelectric materials, combining with the advantages of van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs), may be promising to fabricate high&#8208;quality FeFETs with atomically thin thickness. Here, dual&#8208;gated 2D ferroelectric vdWHs are constructed using MoS2, hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), and CuInP2S6 (CIPS), which act as a high&#8208;performance nonvolatile memory and programmable rectifier. It is first noted that the insertion of h&#8208;BN and dual&#8208;gated coupling device configuration can significantly stabilize and effectively polarize ferroelectric CIPS. Through this design, the device shows a record&#8208;high performance with a large memory window, large on/off ratio (107), ultralow programming state current (10&#8722;13 A), and long&#8208;time endurance (104 s) as nonvolatile memory. As for programmable rectifier, a wide range of gate&#8208;tunable rectification behavior is observed. Moreover, the device exhibits a large rectification ratio (3 &#215; 105) with stable retention under the programming state. This demonstrates the promising potential of ferroelectric vdWHs for new multifunctional ferroelectric devices.

      <title>Josephson Effect and Charge Distribution in Thin Bi2Te3 Topological Insulators</title>
      <dc:description>
A combined gate&#8208;dependence study of the Josephson effect, carrier densities, and self&#8208;consistent band structure calculations in thin Bi2Te3 topological devices reveals that the critical current in topological Josephson devices maps the band structure properties of the films when a gate voltage is applied. A coherent picture that incorporates band bending in the discussion of proximity effects for topological devices is provided.








Abstract
Thin layers of topological insulator materials are quasi&#8208;2D systems featuring a complex interplay between quantum confinement and topological band structure. To understand the role of the spatial distribution of carriers in electrical transport, the Josephson effect, magnetotransport, and weak anti&#8208;localization are studied in bottom&#8208;gated thin Bi2Te3 topological insulator films. The experimental carrier densities are compared to a model based on the solutions of the self&#8208;consistent Schr&#246;dinger&#8211;Poisson equations and they are in excellent agreement. The modeling allows for a quantitative interpretation of the weak antilocalization correction to the conduction and of the critical current of Josephson junctions with weak links made from such films without any ad hoc assumptions.

      <title>Inverse Design Strategies for 3D Surfaces Formed by Mechanically Guided Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>
An inverse design method for forming 3D surfaces through buckling&#8208;guided transformation of 2D structures is presented. Validated by numerical and experimental results in a variety of target 3D configurations (e.g., fire balloon, flower, concave lens, saddle surface, waterdrop, and rodent), this method provides a powerful tool for the design of functional devices that demand accurate 3D geometries.








Abstract
Deterministic transformations of 2D patterns of materials into well&#8208;controlled 3D mesostructures serve as the basis for manufacturing methods that can bypass limitations of conventional 3D micro/nanofabrication. Here, guided mechanical buckling processes provide access to a rich range of complex 3D mesostructures in high&#8208;performance materials, from inorganic and organic semiconductors, metals and dielectrics, to ceramics and even 2D materials (e.g., graphene, MoS2). Previous studies demonstrate that iterative computational procedures can define design parameters for certain targeted 3D configurations, but without the ability to address complex shapes. A technical need is in efficient, generalized inverse design algorithms that directly yield sets of optimized parameters. Here, such schemes are introduced, where the distributions of thicknesses across arrays of separated or interconnected ribbons provide scalable routes to 3D surfaces with a broad range of targeted shapes. Specifically, discretizing desired shapes into 2D ribbon components allows for analytic solutions to the inverse design of centrally symmetric and even general surfaces, in an approximate manner. Combined theoretical, numerical, and experimental studies of &#8776;20 different 3D structures with characteristic sizes (e.g., ribbon width) ranging from &#8776;200 &#181;m to &#8776;2 cm and with geometries that resemble hemispheres, fire balloons, flowers, concave lenses, saddle surfaces, waterdrops, and rodents, illustrate the essential ideas.

      <title>An NIR&#8208;Responsive DNA&#8208;Mediated Nanotetrahedron Enhances the Clearance of Senescent Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive upconversion&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;centered Au20&#8211;Au30 nanoparticles tetrahedron (UAuTe) is fabricated using DNA self&#8208;assembly. This tetrahedron selectively targets senescent cells and induces their apoptosis. The UAuTe tetrahedron rescues the loss of kidney function and the senescence phenotype in senescent mice. The developed UAuTe tetrahedron holds great promise for clinical applications in the prevention and remedy of aging.








Abstract
Senescence is a state of stable cell cycle arrest that can escape apoptosis and lead to aging and numerous age&#8208;related diseases. In this study, an upconversion&#8208;nanoparticle (UCNP)&#8208;centered Au20&#8211;Au30 nanoparticles tetrahedron (UAuTe) is prepared by DNA hybridization, which can selectively accelerate the clearance of senescent cells. When the beta&#8208;2&#8208;microglobulin antibody (anti&#8208;B2MG) on the Au NPs recognizes senescent cells, the application of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light induces the disassembly of the UAuTe by breaking the boronic ester linkage. Subsequently, the Granzyme B exposed on the UCNPs induces apoptosis in senescent cells, which can then be tracked by changes in fluorescence. It is found that, as compared to single Granzyme B, the UAuTe can not only control the Granzyme B delivery by NIR&#8208;responsivity, but also synergistically target and activate the Granzyme B in the senescent cell without the need of perforin. Moreover, this tool is applied successfully in vivo; the results demonstrate that the NIR&#8208;responsive tetrahedron can restore renal function, tissue homeostasis, fur density, and athletic ability in a mouse model of senescence after 30 d of treatment. The NIR&#8208;induced tetrahedron provides a practical strategy for clinical diagnosis and therapy, particularly for aging and age&#8208;related diseases.

      <title>Water&#8208;Stable Lithium Metal Anodes with Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate Capability Enabled by a Hydrophobic Graphene Architecture</title>
      <dc:description>
High water/air tolerance is of great importance for the application of lithium metal anodes in practical manufacture and actual use. A hydrophobic graphene architecture, consisting of aligned arrays confining lithium metal and a roof with inclined tiles, not only exerts confinement effect for lithium dendrite growth, but also impedes water/air invasion.








Abstract
Implementing the utilization of lithium metal in actual processing and application conditions is essential for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy batteries at a practical level. However, the air/water instability of the high&#8208;reactive Li metal remains unsolved. Here, a water&#8208;stable Li metal anode with ultrahigh&#8208;rate capability enabled by a rationally designed architecture is reported. A hydrophobic graphene framework, consists of an array of vertically aligned sheets and a roof of sloping&#8208;aligned sheets, is utilized to fully host lithium metal. As a result, it is first demonstrated that the composite Li metal anode can run stably even after it directly contacts with water. In addition, both the arrays and the roof in the framework are directional graphene microsheets that can provide fast charge transport kinetics in the anode without tortuosity. Therefore, the anode can operate at an extremely high current density of 50 mA cm&#8722;2 with long&#8208;term cycling stability. Importantly, the composite Li anodes in Li||LiFePO4 and Li||NCM&#8208;811 cells also show much improved performances than Li metal foil under crucial conditions of lean electrolyte and low negative/positive capacity ratio. This design provides a significant stride in the safety toward the practicability of low air/water tolerance materials.

      <title>Metallopolymer Organohydrogels with Photo&#8208;Controlled Coordination Crosslinks Work Properly Below 0 &#176;C</title>
      <dc:description>
Metallopolymer organohydrogels, which function even at &#8722;20 &#176;C, are prepared using Ru&#8211;thioether coordination bonds as photoresponsive crosslinks. At &#8722;20 &#176;C, the Ru&#8211;thioether bonds are dissociated under light irradiation and re&#8208;form reversibly in the dark. This process enables reversible gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transitions, the healing of damaged gels, control over the mechanical properties of the gels, and rewriting of microstructures on the gels below 0 &#176;C to be induced.








Abstract
Controlling the structures and functions of gels is important for both fundamental research and technological applications. Introducing photoresponsive units into gels enables remote control of their properties with light. However, existing gels show photoresponsiveness only at room temperature or elevated temperatures. The development of photoresponsive gels that work below 0 &#176;C can expand their usage in cold environments. Here, photoresponsive metallopolymer organohydrogels that function even at &#8722;20 &#176;C are reported. The organohydrogels are prepared using photoresponsive Ru&#8211;thioether coordination bonds as reversible crosslinks to form polymer networks. A water/glycerol mixture is used as an anti&#8208;freezing solvent. At &#8722;20 &#176;C, the Ru&#8211;thioether coordination bonds are dissociated under light irradiation and reformed reversibly in the dark, which result in alternating crosslinking densities in the polymer networks. This process enables inducing reversible gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transitions, healing damaged gels, controlling the mechanical properties and volumes of the gels, and rewriting microstructures on the gels below 0 &#176;C.

      <title>Topological Engineering of Pt&#8208;Group&#8208;Metal&#8208;Based Chiral Crystals toward High&#8208;Efficiency Hydrogen Evolution Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
Topological order and structure chirality are integrated into Pt group metals in the space group of P213 (#198). This creates a giant nontrivial topological energy window and long topological surface Fermi arcs at the crystal surfaces, leading to a fast hydrogen evolution kinetics with benchmarking turnover frequency (TOF) values, as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).








Abstract
It has been demonstrated that topological nontrivial surface states can favor heterogeneous catalysis processes such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but a further decrease in mass loading and an increase in activity are still highly challenging. The observation of massless chiral fermions associated with large topological charge and long Fermi arc (FA) surface states inspires the investigation of their relationship with the charge transfer and adsorption process in the HER. In this study, it is found that the HER efficiency of Pt&#8208;group metals can be boosted significantly by introducing topological order. A giant nontrivial topological energy window and a long topological surface FA are expected at the surface when forming chiral crystals in the space group of P213 (#198). This makes the nontrivial topological features resistant to a large change in the applied overpotential. As HER catalysts, PtAl and PtGa chiral crystals show turnover frequencies as high as 5.6 and 17.1 s&#8722;1 and an overpotential as low as 14 and 13.3 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. These crystals outperform those of commercial Pt and nanostructured catalysts. This work opens a new avenue for the development of high&#8208;efficiency catalysts with the strategy of topological engineering of excellent transitional catalytic materials.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been demonstrated that topological nontrivial surface states can favor heterogeneous catalysis processes such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but a further decrease in mass loading and an increase in activity are still highly challenging. The observation of massless chiral fermions associated with large topological charge and long Fermi arc (FA) surface states inspires the investigation of their relationship with the charge transfer and adsorption process in the HER. In this study, it is found that the HER efficiency of Pt&#8208;group metals can be boosted significantly by introducing topological order. A giant nontrivial topological energy window and a long topological surface FA are expected at the surface when forming chiral crystals in the space group of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;3 (#198). This makes the nontrivial topological features resistant to a large change in the applied overpotential. As HER catalysts, PtAl and PtGa chiral crystals show turnover frequencies as high as 5.6 and 17.1 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an overpotential as low as 14 and 13.3 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These crystals outperform those of commercial Pt and nanostructured catalysts. This work opens a new avenue for the development of high&#8208;efficiency catalysts with the strategy of topological engineering of excellent transitional catalytic materials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Localized Electrons Enhanced Ion Transport for Ultrafast Electrochemical Energy Storage</title>
      <dc:description>
Fast ion transport inside an electrode material is crucial to efficient electrochemical energy storage. Based on the localized electrons enhanced ion&#8208;transport mechanism, Li/Na&#8208;ion diffusivity can be enhanced by two orders of magnitude after introducing abundant localized electrons. Meanwhile, the corresponding prepared ion&#8208;batteries can show ten times enhanced capacity than commercial crystals at high mass loading and high rate.








Abstract
The rate&#8208;determining process for electrochemical energy storage is largely determined by ion transport occurring in the electrode materials. Apart from decreasing the distance of ion diffusion, the enhancement of ionic mobility is crucial for ion transport. Here, a localized electron enhanced ion transport mechanism to promote ion mobility for ultrafast energy storage is proposed. Theoretical calculations and analysis reveal that highly localized electrons can be induced by intrinsic defects, and the migration barrier of ions can be obviously reduced. Consistently, experiment results reveal that this mechanism leads to an enhancement of Li/Na ion diffusivity by two orders of magnitude. At high mass loading of 10 mg cm&#8722;2 and high rate of 10C, a reversible energy storage capacity up to 190 mAh g&#8722;1 is achieved, which is ten times greater than achievable by commercial crystals with comparable dimensions.

      <title>Uncovering the Potential of M1&#8208;Site&#8208;Activated NASICON Cathodes for Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
The concept for a novel storage mechanism for Zn2+ in NASICON is uncovered. The dynamic Na+/Zn2+ mixed occupation at the M1 and M2 sites of ZnxNaV2(PO4)3, enabled by their concerted migration, is proposed to improve the structural stability. This work may open a new route toward designing NASICON cathodes for Zn&#8208;ion batteries for energy storage.








Abstract
There is a long&#8208;standing consciousness that the rhombohedral NASICON&#8208;type compounds as promising cathodes for Li+/Na+ batteries should have inactive M1(6b) sites with ion (de)intercalation occurring only in the M2 (18e) sites. Of particular significance is that M1 sites active for charge/discharge are commonly considered undesirable because the ion diffusion tends to be disrupted by the irregular occupation of channels, which accelerates the deterioration of battery. However, it is found that the structural stability can be substantially improved by the mixed occupation of Na+/Zn2+ at both M1 and M2 when using NaV2(PO4)3 (NVP) as a cathode for Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The results of atomic&#8208;scale scanning transmission electron microscopy, analysis of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and an accurate bond&#8208;valence&#8208;based structural model reveal that the improvement is due to the facile migration of Zn2+ in NVP, which is enabled by a concerted Na+/Zn2+ transfer mechanism. In addition, significant improvement of the electronic conductivity and mechanical properties is achieved in Zn2+&#8208;intercalated ZnNaV2(PO4)3 in comparison with those of Na3V2(PO4)3. This work not only provides in&#8208;depth insight into Zn2+ intercalation and dynamics in NVP unlocked by activating the M1 sites, but also opens a new route toward design of improved NASICON cathodes.

      <title>Optimizing Energy Transfer in Nanostructures Enables In Vivo Cancer Lesion Tracking via Near&#8208;Infrared Excited Hypoxia Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
A well&#8208;designed hypoxia nanosensor is developed, in which the donors and acceptors are precisely controlled to optimize energy transfer. This near&#8208;infrared excited core/satellite nanosensor exhibits great sensitivity, reversible response, high selectivity, and robust stability for cycling normoxia&#8211;hypoxia imaging. More importantly, combined with the reliable preclinical model, in vivo lung cancer lesion tracking is achieved.








Abstract
To explore highly sensitive and low&#8208;toxicity techniques for tracking and evaluation of non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer (NSCLC), one of the most mortal tumors in the world, it is utterly imperative for doctors to select the appropriate treatment strategies. Herein, developing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) excited nanosensors, in which the donor and acceptor pairs within a biological metal&#8211;organic framework (bio&#8208;MOF) matrix are precisely controlled to rationalize upconversion F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET), is suggested for detecting the O2 concentration inside tumors with reduced signal disturbance and health detriment. Under NIR excitation, as&#8208;fabricated core/satellite nanosensors exhibit much improved FRET efficiency and reversible hypoxic response with high sensitivity, which are effective both in vitro and in vivo (zebrafish) for cycling normoxia&#8211;hypoxia imaging. Significantly, combined with a reliable preclinical genetically engineered murine model, such nanosensors successfully realize tracking of in vivo NSCLC lesions upon clear and gradient hypoxia signals without apparent long&#8208;term biotoxicity, illustrating their exciting potential for efficient NSCLC evaluation and prognosis.

      <title>Overcoming the Limits of the Interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya Interaction by Antiferromagnetic Order in Multiferroic Heterostructures</title>
      <dc:description>
Magnetic skyrmions are observed in multiferroic heterostructures. Transport measurments and micromagnetic simulations verify that skyrmions at an interface can be largely extended to a thick heterostructure due to the synergistic effect of ferroelectricity and interlayer exchange coupling. This work sheds light on how multiferroic orders can overcome the limits of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction.








Abstract
Topologically protected magnetic states have a variety of potential applications in future spintronics owing to their nanoscale size (&lt;100 nm) and unique dynamics. These fascinating states, however, usually are located at the interfaces or surfaces of ultrathin systems due to the short interaction range of the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI). Here, magnetic topological states in a 40&#8208;unit cells (16 nm) SrRuO3 layer are successfully created via an interlayer exchange coupling mechanism and the interfacial DMI. By controlling the thickness of an antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic layer, interfacial ionic polarization, as well as the transformation between ferromagnetic and magnetic topological states, can be modulated. Using micromagnetic simulations, the formation and stability of robust magnetic skyrmions in SrRuO3/BiFeO3 heterostructures are elucidated. Magnetic skyrmions in thick multiferroic heterostructures are promising for the development of topological electronics as well as rendering a practical approach to extend the interfacial topological phenomena to bulk via antiferromagnetic order.

1.5&#8211;1.6 eV bandgap Pb&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with 30&#8211;31% theoretical efficiency limit by the Shockley&#8211;Queisser model achieve 21&#8211;24% power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). However, the best PCEs of reported ideal&#8208;bandgap (1.3&#8211;1.4 eV) Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs with a higher 33% theoretical efficiency limit are &lt;18%, mainly because of their large open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) deficits (&gt;0.4 V). Herein, it is found that the addition of guanidinium bromide (GABr) can significantly improve the structural and photoelectric characteristics of ideal&#8208;bandgap (&#8776;1.34 eV) Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite films. GABr introduced in the perovskite films can efficiently reduce the high defect density caused by Sn2+ oxidation in the perovskite, which is favorable for facilitating hole transport, decreasing charge&#8208;carrier recombination, and reducing the Voc deficit. Therefore, the best PCE of 20.63% with a certificated efficiency of 19.8% is achieved in 1.35 eV PSCs, along with a record small Voc deficit of 0.33 V, which is the highest PCE among all values reported to date for ideal&#8208;bandgap Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs. Moreover, the GABr&#8208;modified PSCs exhibit significantly improved environmental and thermal stability. This work represents a noteworthy step toward the fabrication of efficient and stable ideal&#8208;bandgap PSCs.

      <title>In Situ Formed Gradient Bandgap&#8208;Tunable Perovskite for Ultrahigh&#8208;Speed Color/Spectrum&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors via Electron&#8208;Donor Control</title>
      <dc:description>
Based on an in situ formed gradient bandgap&#8208;tunable perovskite absorber, a filterless color/spectrum&#8208;sensitive photodetector with ultrahigh&#8208;speed response is achieved. The interfacial capacitance influenced by the electron donor of the absorber is identified to be the key for the response time. The EQE over 90% and the isochronous fast response demonstrate its undoubted potential in the field of spectrum analysis.








Abstract
Integration of various photodetectors with different light&#8208;sensitive materials and detection capacity is an inevitable way to achieve entire color/spectrum detection. However, the uneven capacity of each photodetector would drag the overall performance behind, especially the response speed. A response time down to nanosecond level has not previously been reported for a filter&#8208;free color/spectrum&#8208;sensitive photodetector, as far as is known. Here, a self&#8208;powered filterless color&#8208;sensitive photodetection array based on an in situ formed gradient perovskite absorber film with continuously tunable bandgap is demonstrated. Ultrahigh&#8208;speed response at nanosecond level is achieved in all the ingredient photodetectors. The junction capacitance being influenced by carrier concentration in the absorber is identified to be responsible for the detection speed. Without any optic or mechanical supporting system, the designed color detector exhibits an external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 94% and a high spectral resolution of around 80 nm for the whole visible spectrum. This work offers a guidance to achieve fast response of perovskite&#8208;based photodetectors from the point of view of carrier&#8208;donor control and demonstrates a new avenue to establish color&#8208;sensitive photodetectors/spectrometers.

      <title>Superatomic Gallium Clusters in Dendrimers: Unique Rigidity and Reactivity Depending on their Atomicity</title>
      <dc:description>
Superatoms have been investigated due to their possible substitution for other elements. In this study, superatomic gallium clusters are achieved in solution phase by using a dendrimer template method. This synthesis enabled to change the number of valence electrons in these superatoms by designing the gallium clusters, resulting in unique rigidity and reactivity depending on the atomicity.








Abstract
Superatoms have been investigated due to their possible substitution for other elements. The solution&#8208;phase synthesis of superatoms has attracted attention to realize the availability of superatoms. However, the previous approach is basically limited to the formation of a single cluster. Here, superatoms are investigated and the number of valence electrons in these superatoms is changed by designing the number of gallium atoms present. Based on the dendrimer template method, clusters consisting of 3, 12, 13, and other numbers of atoms have been synthesized. The halogen&#8208;like superatomic nature of Ga13 is structurally and electrochemically observed as completely different to the other clusters. The gallium clusters of 13 and 3 atoms, which can fill the 2P and 1P superatomic orbitals, respectively, exhibit different reactivities. The 3&#8208;atom gallium cluster is suggested as being reduced to Ga3H2&#8722; due to the lower shift of energy levels in the unoccupied orbitals. The results for these gallium clusters provide candidates for superatoms.

      <title>A Colorimetric Artificial Olfactory System for Airborne Improvised Explosive Identification</title>
      <dc:description>
A colorimetric artificial olfactory system with excellent discrimination capabilities, rapid response time, and low detection limit is proposed for detecting airborne improvised explosive microparticulates. The proposed system integrates the merits of previous artificial olfactory systems and overcomes common drawbacks, which can not only resolve the challenges of improvised explosive detection, but also make the detection of nonvolatile target analytes possible.








Abstract
The detection of ultralow or nonvolatile target analytes remains a significant challenge for artificial olfactory systems even after decades of development, which severely limits their widespread application. To overcome this challenge, an artificial olfactory system based on a colorimetric hydrogel array is constructed for the first time as a universal representative. As an effective extension of conventional artificial olfactory systems that integrates the merits of its predecessors, the proposed system accurately mimics olfactory mucosa and specific odorant binding proteins using hydrogels endowed with specific colorimetric reagents for the detection of hypochlorite, chlorate, perchlorate, urea, and nitrate. Therefore, the proposed system is capable of detecting and discriminating between these five airborne improvised explosive microparticulates with a detection limit as low as 39.4 pg. Additionally, the system demonstrates good reusability over ten cycles, rapid response time of &#8776;0.2 s, and excellent discrimination properties, despite significant variation. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study on colorimetric artificial olfactory systems yields a novel strategy for the direct and discriminative detection of nonvolatile airborne microparticulates.

      <title>Beyond Ternary OPV: High&#8208;Throughput Experimentation and Self&#8208;Driving Laboratories Optimize Multicomponent Systems</title>
      <dc:description>
While ternary blends for organic solar cells show significant performance improvements, quaternary mixtures typically cannot be fully optimized due to experimental constraints. A robot&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput technology is demonstrated that allows the stability of multicomponent blends to be investigated. Moreover, the use of machine learning algorithms enables an autonomous operation of the self&#8208;driving laboratory with highly efficient optimization routines.








Abstract
Fundamental advances to increase the efficiency as well as stability of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are achieved by designing ternary blends, which represents a clear trend toward multicomponent active layer blends. The development of high&#8208;throughput and autonomous experimentation methods is reported for the effective optimization of multicomponent polymer blends for OPVs. A method for automated film formation enabling the fabrication of up to 6048 films per day is introduced. Equipping this automated experimentation platform with a Bayesian optimization, a self&#8208;driving laboratory is constructed that autonomously evaluates measurements to design and execute the next experiments. To demonstrate the potential of these methods, a 4D parameter space of quaternary OPV blends is mapped and optimized for photostability. While with conventional approaches, roughly 100 mg of material would be necessary, the robot&#8208;based platform can screen 2000 combinations with less than 10 mg, and machine&#8208;learning&#8208;enabled autonomous experimentation identifies stable compositions with less than 1 mg.

      <title>Initiating Hexagonal MoO3 for Superb&#8208;Stable and Fast NH4+ Storage Based on Hydrogen Bond Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
Hexagonal MoO3 is applied as a stable anode candidate for NH4+&#8208;ion storage and ultrafast rate performance can be realized due to the novel interaction mechanism of hydrogen bond chemistry, which is evidenced by experimental and theoretical results. A full flexible NH4+&#8208;ion battery at device level is realized by coupling with Prussian blue analog cathodes and hydrogel electrolytes.








Abstract
Nonmetallic ammonium (NH4+) ions are applied as charge carriers for aqueous batteries, where hexagonal MoO3 is initially investigated as an anode candidate for NH4+ storage. From experimental and first&#8208;principle calculated results, the battery chemistry proceeds with reversible building&#8211;breaking behaviors of hydrogen bonds between NH4+ and tunneled MoO3 electrode frameworks, where the ammoniation/deammoniation mechanism is dominated by nondiffusion&#8208;controlled pseudocapacitive behavior. Outstanding electrochemical performance of MoO3 for NH4+ storage is delivered with 115 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C and can retain 32 mAh g&#8722;1 at 150 C. Furthermore, it remarkably exhibits ultralong and stable cyclic performance up to 100 000 cycle with 94% capacity retention and high power density of 4170 W kg&#8722;1 at 150 C. When coupled with CuFe prussian blue analogous (PBA) cathode, the full ammonium battery can deliver decent energy density 21.3 Wh kg&#8722;1 and the resultant flexible ammonium batteries at device level are also pioneeringly developed for potential realistic applications.

      <title>Smart Sponge for Fast Liquid Absorption and Thermal Responsive Self&#8208;Squeezing</title>
      <dc:description>
A smart porous sponge with aligned channel structure is fabricated by directional freezing. Compared to sponges with random porous structure, the as&#8208;prepared sponge has larger liquid absorption speed due to its lower tortuosity. The absorbed liquid can be remotely squeezed out due to thermally responsive shape memory effect. Such sponges have great potential in efficient liquid absorption and recycling.








Abstract
Liquid absorption and recycling play a crucial role in many industrial and environmental applications, such as oil spill cleanup and recovery, hemostasis, astronauts' urine recycling, and so on. Although many liquid absorbing materials have been developed, it still remains a grand challenge to achieve both fast absorption and efficient recycling in a cost&#8208;effective and energy&#8208;saving manner, especially for viscous liquids such as crude oil. A smart polyurethane&#8208;based porous sponge with aligned channel structure is prepared by directional freezing. Compared to common sponges with random porous structure, the as&#8208;prepared smart sponge has larger liquid absorption speed due to its lower tortuosity and stronger capillary (&#8220;tortuosity effect&#8221;). More importantly, the absorbed liquid can be remotely squeezed out due to a thermally responsive shape memory effect when the sponge is heated up. Such smart sponges with well&#8208;defined porous structure and thermal responsive self&#8208;squeezing capability have great potential in efficient liquid absorption and recycling.

      <title>Superhigh Electromagnetic Interference Shielding of Ultrathin Aligned Pristine Graphene Nanosheets Film</title>
      <dc:description>
Highly aligned freestanding laminated graphene films and nacre&#8208;like graphene/polymer composite films are synthesized by scanning centrifugal casting. Due to the graphene&#8208;alignment&#8208;induced high electrical conductivity and multiple internal reflections, the films show superhigh electromagnetic&#8208;interference&#8208;shielding performance, comparable to the reported best synthetic material, MXene films, at ultralow thickness, along with much better mechanical strength and thermal conductivity.








Abstract
Ultrathin, lightweight, high&#8208;strength, and thermally conductive electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials with high shielding effectiveness (SE) are highly desired for next&#8208;generation portable and wearable electronics. Pristine graphene (PG) has a great potential to meet all the above requirements, but the poor processability of PG nanosheets hinders its applications. Here, efficient synthesis of highly aligned laminated PG films and nacre&#8208;like PG/polymer composites with a superhigh PG loading up to 90 wt% by a scanning centrifugal casting method is reported. Due to the PG&#8208;nanosheets&#8208;alignment&#8208;induced high electrical conductivity and multiple internal reflections, such films show superhigh EMI SE comparable to the reported best synthetic material, MXene films, at an ultralow thickness. An EMI SE of 93 dB is obtained for the PG film at a thickness of &#8776;100 &#181;m, and 63 dB is achieved for the PG/polyimide composite film at a thickness of &#8776;60 &#181;m. Furthermore, such PG&#8208;nanosheets&#8208;based films show much higher mechanical strength (up to 145 MPa) and thermal conductivity (up to 190 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) than those of their MXene counterparts. These excellent comprehensive properties, along with ease of mass production, pave the way for practical applications of PG nanosheets in EMI shielding.

      <title>A Nontoxic Bifunctional (Anti)Solvent as Digestive&#8208;Ripening Agent for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel bifunctional (anti)solvent system is developed for regulating the perovskite crystallization procedure. It can perform not only as an antisolvent at the spin&#8208;coating step to rapidly generate crystal seeds, but also as a solvent for ripening the precursors to large crystal grains during the thermal&#8208;annealing process. Therefore, it can significantly enhance the efficiency, stability, and reproducibility of perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
The preparation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films is important for achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The effective balance between solvent and antisolvent is an essential factor for regulating high&#8208;quality perovskite film during the spin&#8208;coating and thermal&#8208;annealing steps. In this work, a greener, nonhalogenated, nontoxic bifunctional (anti)solvent, methyl benzoate (MB), is developed not only as an antisolvent to rapidly generate crystal seeds at the perovskite spin&#8208;coating step, but also as a digestive&#8208;ripening solvent for the perovskite precursors, which can prevent the loss of organic components during the thermal&#8208;annealing stage and effectively suppress the formation of miscellaneous lead halide phases. As a result, this novel bifunctional (anti)solvent is employed in planar n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSCs for engineering high&#8208;quality perovskite layers and thus achieving a power conversion efficiency up to 22.37% with negligible hysteresis and &gt;1300 h stability. Moreover, due to the high boiling point and low&#8208;volatility characteristic of MB, high&#8208;performance PSCs are achieved reproducibly at different operating temperatures (22&#8211;34 &#176;C). Therefore, this developed bifunctional solvent system can provide a promising platform toward globally upscaling and commercializing PSCs in all seasons and regions.

      <dc:description>
A novel robot&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput film&#8208;fabrication technique, introduced by Lo&#239;c M. Roch, Thomas Heumueller, and co&#8208;workers in article number 1907801, enables quaternary semiconductor blends to be fully screened for organic photovoltaic applications. This is realized by drop&#8208;casting 96 individual solutions onto a pre&#8208;structured glass plate, resulting in smooth and homogeneous layers. Moreover, the use of machine&#8208;learning algorithms enables an autonomous operation toward highly efficient optimization routines, leading to a 30&#8208;fold faster rate than conventional high&#8208;throughput approaches.

      <title>Inverse Design Methods: Inverse Design Strategies for 3D Surfaces Formed by Mechanically Guided Assembly (Adv. Mater. 14/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 1908424, Yonggang Huang, John A. Rogers, Yihui Zhang, and co&#8208;workers present an inverse design method for forming 3D surfaces through buckling&#8208;guided transformation of 2D structures. Demonstrations in a variety of target 3D configurations (e.g., flower&#8208;, saddle&#8208;surface&#8208;, waterdrop&#8208;, and rodent&#8208;shapes) suggest this method as a powerful tool for creating functional devices that demand accurate 3D geometries.

      <title>Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries: Enabling Rapid Charging Lithium Metal Batteries via Surface Acoustic Wave&#8208;Driven Electrolyte Flow (Adv. Mater. 14/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 1907516, James Friend and co&#8208;workers present the use of acoustic waves to produce electrolyte flow in lithium&#8208;metal batteries, enabling their rapid recharging without fear of damage. The surface acoustic wave device at the bottom produces 100 MHz waves across its surface, which leads to electrolyte transport between the anode and cathode, suppressing lithium&#8208;ion depletion during charging, as well as consequent heating and dendrite growth.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.2019075161907516&lt;/a&gt;, James Friend and co&#8208;workers present the use of acoustic waves to produce electrolyte flow in lithium&#8208;metal batteries, enabling their rapid recharging without fear of damage. The surface acoustic wave device at the bottom produces 100 MHz waves across its surface, which leads to electrolyte transport between the anode and cathode, suppressing lithium&#8208;ion depletion during charging, as well as consequent heating and dendrite growth.

      <title>Biomolecular Piezoelectric Materials: From Amino Acids to Living Tissues</title>
      <dc:description>
The piezoelectricity of the various elements constituting the human body has attracted intensive attention, due to the strong piezoelectricity, biocompatibility, low dielectric, and tissue regeneration effects. Research progress in the various biological piezoelectric materials from the basic building blocks to organized tissues are summarized. The mechanisms and origins of piezoelectricity are discussed, and challenges and perspectives for developing biological piezoelectric materials are presented.








Abstract
Biomolecular piezoelectric materials are considered a strong candidate material for biomedical applications due to their robust piezoelectricity, biocompatibility, and low dielectric property. The electric field has been found to affect tissue development and regeneration, and the piezoelectric properties of biological materials in the human body are known to provide electric fields by pressure. Therefore, great attention has been paid to the understanding of piezoelectricity in biological tissues and its building blocks. The aim herein is to describe the principle of piezoelectricity in biological materials from the very basic building blocks (i.e., amino acids, peptides, proteins, etc.) to highly organized tissues (i.e., bones, skin, etc.). Research progress on the piezoelectricity within various biological materials is summarized, including amino acids, peptides, proteins, and tissues. The mechanisms and origin of piezoelectricity within various biological materials are also covered.

      <title>Phase Engineering of High&#8208;Entropy Alloys</title>
      <dc:description>
Phase engineering of high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) is comprehensively reviewed. HEAs with rich constituent elements exhibit many remarkable properties that are greatly influenced by phase structure. For further exploring the properties of HEAs, controllable synthesis with desired phases is required. The diverse phase structures, phase&#8208;tuning strategies, and property adjusting of phase&#8208;engineered HEAs is presented and discussed in depth.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) are based on five or more principal elements with equal or nearly equal molar fractions and possess many significant advantages over traditional alloys, including high strength and hardness, excellent corrosion resistance, outstanding thermal stability, and irradiation resistance. Phase structure plays a vital role in determining the property of HEAs. For further enhancing the performance of HEAs in various application fields, a controllable synthesis with desired phases is required. In this review, the diverse phase structures of HEAs and the related properties are first introduced. Then, alternative tuning strategies to promote the desired phase structure of HEAs are focused upon. Property adjusting of phase&#8208;engineered HEAs is also discussed in depth. Lastly, some insights into the challenges and future prospects in this rapidly emerging research field are provided.

      <title>Highly Stretchable Polymer Composite with Strain&#8208;Enhanced Electromagnetic Interference Shielding Effectiveness</title>
      <dc:description>
A highly stretchable polymer composite with three&#8208;dimensional liquid metals exhibits strain&#8208;enhanced electromagnetic interference shielding efficiency over a wide range of frequencies. With an unprecedented combination of metal&#8208;like electromagnetic shielding capability, unusual strain&#8208;enhanced electrical conductivity, outstanding stretchability, and skin&#8208;compatible mechanical properties, this material fills an important gap with regard to stretchable materials that are indispensable to soft electronics.








Abstract
Polymer composites with electrically conductive fillers have been developed as mechanically flexible, easily processable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials. Although there are a few elastomeric composites with nanostructured silvers and carbon nanotubes showing moderate stretchability, their EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) deteriorates consistently with stretching. Here, a highly stretchable polymer composite embedded with a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) liquid&#8208;metal (LM) network exhibiting substantial increases of EMI SE when stretched is reported, which matches the EMI SE of metallic plates over an exceptionally broad frequency range of 2.65&#8211;40 GHz. The electrical conductivities achieved in the 3D LM composite are among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in stretchable conductors under large mechanical deformations. With skin&#8208;like elastic compliance and toughness, the material provides a route to meet the demands for emerging soft and human&#8208;friendly electronics.

      <title>Photolithographic Patterning of Organic Color&#8208;Centers</title>
      <dc:description>
Organic color&#8208;centers (OCCs) are patterned on thin films of carbon nanotubes by light. The light drives covalent attachment of substituted aryl groups on the host semiconductor, creating arrays of OCCs that fluoresce in the shortwave infrared. This light&#8208;driven technique opens a path to enable photolithographic patterning of this rich and emerging class of quantum emitters.








Abstract
Organic color&#8208;centers (OCCs) have emerged as promising single&#8208;photon emitters for solid&#8208;state quantum technologies, chemically specific sensing, and near&#8208;infrared bioimaging. However, these quantum light sources are currently synthesized in bulk solution, lacking the spatial control required for on&#8208;chip integration. The ability to pattern OCCs on solid substrates with high spatial precision and molecularly defined structure is essential to interface electronics and advance their quantum applications. Herein, a lithographic generation of OCCs on solid&#8208;state semiconducting single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube films at spatially defined locations is presented. By using light&#8208;driven diazoether chemistry, it is possible to directly pattern p&#8208;nitroaryl OCCs, which demonstrate chemically specific spectral signatures at programmed positions as confirmed by Raman mapping and hyperspectral photoluminescence imaging. This light&#8208;driven technique enables the fabrication of OCC arrays on solid films that fluoresce in the shortwave infrared and presents an important step toward the direct writing of quantum emitters and other functionalities at the molecular level.

      <title>Biomaterials for Personalized Cell Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Biomaterials enable personalized cell therapies with applications in tissue regeneration, therapeutic protein delivery, and immunotherapy. Personalized cell therapies provide localized, dynamic treatment through their innate ability to sense and respond to their microenvironment and orchestrate complex biological processes. Biomaterials to support cell viability and functionality and to instruct cell behavior including differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells are under development.








Abstract
Cell therapy has already had an important impact on healthcare and provided new treatments for previously intractable diseases. Notable examples include mesenchymal stem cells for tissue regeneration, islet transplantation for diabetes treatment, and T cell delivery for cancer immunotherapy. Biomaterials have the potential to extend the therapeutic impact of cell therapies by serving as carriers that provide 3D organization and support cell viability and function. With the growing emphasis on personalized medicine, cell therapies hold great potential for their ability to sense and respond to the biology of an individual patient. These therapies can be further personalized through the use of patient&#8208;specific cells or with precision biomaterials to guide cellular activity in response to the needs of each patient. Here, the role of biomaterials for applications in tissue regeneration, therapeutic protein delivery, and cancer immunotherapy is reviewed, with a focus on progress in engineering material properties and functionalities for personalized cell therapies.

     alt="Biomaterials for Personalized Cell Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biomaterials enable personalized cell therapies with applications in tissue regeneration, therapeutic protein delivery, and immunotherapy. Personalized cell therapies provide localized, dynamic treatment through their innate ability to sense and respond to their microenvironment and orchestrate complex biological processes. Biomaterials to support cell viability and functionality and to instruct cell behavior including differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells are under development.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cell therapy has already had an important impact on healthcare and provided new treatments for previously intractable diseases. Notable examples include mesenchymal stem cells for tissue regeneration, islet transplantation for diabetes treatment, and T cell delivery for cancer immunotherapy. Biomaterials have the potential to extend the therapeutic impact of cell therapies by serving as carriers that provide 3D organization and support cell viability and function. With the growing emphasis on personalized medicine, cell therapies hold great potential for their ability to sense and respond to the biology of an individual patient. These therapies can be further personalized through the use of patient&#8208;specific cells or with precision biomaterials to guide cellular activity in response to the needs of each patient. Here, the role of biomaterials for applications in tissue regeneration, therapeutic protein delivery, and cancer immunotherapy is reviewed, with a focus on progress in engineering material properties and functionalities for personalized cell therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Immunology&#8208;Guided Biomaterial Design for Mucosal Cancer Vaccines</title>
      <dc:description>
Cancer of mucosal tissues is a major cause of worldwide mortality. Engineered cancer vaccines offer a promising approach for inducing antitumor immunity. Challenges associated with vaccination through mucosal and parenteral routes are discussed. Specifically, key considerations are described in the design of biomaterial&#8208;based vaccines that will afford antitumor immune protection at mucosal surfaces.








Abstract
Cancer of mucosal tissues is a major cause of worldwide mortality for which only palliative treatments are available for patients with late&#8208;stage disease. Engineered cancer vaccines offer a promising approach for inducing antitumor immunity. The route of vaccination plays a major role in dictating the migratory pattern of lymphocytes, and thus vaccine efficacy in mucosal tissues. Parenteral immunization, specifically subcutaneous and intramuscular, is the most common vaccination route. However, this induces marginal mucosal protection in the absence of tissue&#8208;specific imprinting signals. To circumvent this, the mucosal route can be utilized, however degradative mucosal barriers must be overcome. Hence, vaccine administration route and selection of materials able to surmount transport barriers are important considerations in mucosal cancer vaccine design. Here, an overview of mucosal immunity in the context of cancer and mucosal cancer clinical trials is provided. Key considerations are described regarding the design of biomaterial&#8208;based vaccines that will afford antitumor immune protection at mucosal surfaces, despite limited knowledge surrounding mucosal vaccination, particularly aided by biomaterials and mechanistic immune&#8211;material interactions. Finally, an outlook is given of how future biomaterial&#8208;based mucosal cancer vaccines will be shaped by new discoveries in mucosal vaccinology, tumor immunology, immuno&#8208;therapeutic screens, and material&#8211;immune system interplay.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and nanotechnology are instrumental in realizing the goal of precision medicine&#8212;tailoring the best treatment for each cancer patient.

Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) and nanotechnology are two fields that are instrumental in realizing the goal of precision medicine&#8212;tailoring the best treatment for each cancer patient. Recent conversion between these two fields is enabling better patient data acquisition and improved design of nanomaterials for precision cancer medicine. Diagnostic nanomaterials are used to assemble a patient&#8208;specific disease profile, which is then leveraged, through a set of therapeutic nanotechnologies, to improve the treatment outcome. However, high intratumor and interpatient heterogeneities make the rational design of diagnostic and therapeutic platforms, and analysis of their output, extremely difficult. Integration of AI approaches can bridge this gap, using pattern analysis and classification algorithms for improved diagnostic and therapeutic accuracy. Nanomedicine design also benefits from the application of AI, by optimizing material properties according to predicted interactions with the target drug, biological fluids, immune system, vasculature, and cell membranes, all affecting therapeutic efficacy. Here, fundamental concepts in AI are described and the contributions and promise of nanotechnology coupled with AI to the future of precision cancer medicine are reviewed.

      <title>Nucleic&#8208;Acid Structures as Intracellular Probes for Live Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Nucleic acid&#8208;based sensors such as hybridization&#8208;based probes, aptamers, and DNAzymes have emerged as key tools for studying analytes in live cells. The current state of intracellular nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based probes is described and common strategies for probe design, what targets can be detected, and how current limitations may be overcome in the future are discussed.








Abstract
The chemical composition of cells at the molecular level determines their growth, differentiation, structure, and function. Probing this composition is powerful because it provides invaluable insight into chemical processes inside cells and in certain cases allows disease diagnosis based on molecular profiles. However, many techniques analyze fixed cells or lysates of bulk populations, in which information about dynamics and cellular heterogeneity is lost. Recently, nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based probes have emerged as a promising platform for the detection of a wide variety of intracellular analytes in live cells with single&#8208;cell resolution. Recent advances in this field are described and common strategies for probe design, types of targets that can be identified, current limitations, and future directions are discussed.

      <title>Biomaterials as Tools to Decode Immunity</title>
      <dc:description>
The selectivity and memory of the immune system have positioned vaccines and immunotherapies as important clinical advances. New tools to study the interactions of immune signals with immune cells and tissues will help drive the next generation of these technologies. Emerging methods in which tunable properties of biomaterials are creating new tools to decode and control immunity are highlighted.








Abstract
The immune system has remarkable capabilities to combat disease with exquisite selectivity. This feature has enabled vaccines that provide protection for decades and, more recently, advances in immunotherapies that can cure some cancers. Greater control over how immune signals are presented, delivered, and processed will help drive even more powerful options that are also safe. Such advances will be underpinned by new tools that probe how immune signals are integrated by immune cells and tissues. Biomaterials are valuable resources to support this goal, offering robust, tunable properties. The growing role of biomaterials as tools to dissect immune function in fundamental and translational contexts is highlighted. These technologies can serve as tools to understand the immune system across molecular, cellular, and tissue length scales. A common theme is exploiting biomaterial features to rationally direct how specific immune cells or organs encounter a signal. This precision strategy, enabled by distinct material properties, allows isolation of immunological parameters or processes in a way that is challenging with conventional approaches. The utility of these capabilities is demonstrated through examples in vaccines for infectious disease and cancer immunotherapy, as well as settings of immune regulation that include autoimmunity and transplantation.

      <title>Recent Advances in Enabling Technologies in 3D Printing for Precision Medicine</title>
      <dc:description>
Enabling technologies are being developed to advance 3D printing in precision medicine. 3D printing is advancing as a technology in patient therapies through the fabrication of patient&#8208;specific implants or models for the screening of patient&#8208;specific therapies. Technologies are improving the available materials for printing, the speed at which printing occurs, and the resolution of printed constructs.








Abstract
Advances in areas such as data analytics, genomics, and imaging have revealed individual patient complexities and exposed the inherent limitations of generic therapies for patient treatment. These observations have also fueled the development of precision medicine approaches, where therapies are tailored for the individual rather than the broad patient population. 3D printing is a field that intersects with precision medicine through the design of precision implants with patient&#8208;directed shapes, structures, and materials or for the development of patient&#8208;specific in vitro models that can be used for screening precision therapeutics. Toward their success, advances in 3D printing and biofabrication technologies are needed with enhanced resolution, complexity, reproducibility, and speed and that encompass a broad range of cells and materials. The overall goal of this progress report is to highlight recent advances in 3D printing technologies that are helping to enable advances important in precision medicine.

This Review aims to provide fundamentals for designing desirable and applicable glucose&#8208;responsive insulin delivery systems in the future.








Abstract
Type 1 and advanced type 2 diabetes treatment involves daily injections or continuous infusion of exogenous insulin aimed at regulating blood glucose levels in the normoglycemic range. However, current options for insulin therapy are limited by the risk of hypoglycemia and are associated with suboptimal glycemic control outcomes. Therefore, a range of glucose&#8208;responsive components that can undergo changes in conformation or show alterations in intermolecular binding capability in response to glucose stimulation has been studied for ultimate integration into closed&#8208;loop insulin delivery or &#8220;smart insulin&#8221; systems. Here, an overview of the evolution and recent progress in the development of molecular approaches for glucose&#8208;responsive insulin delivery systems, a rapidly growing subfield of precision medicine, is presented. Three central glucose&#8208;responsive moieties, including glucose oxidase, phenylboronic acid, and glucose&#8208;binding molecules are examined in detail. Future opportunities and challenges regarding translation are also discussed.

      <title>Progress on Modulating Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages with Biomaterials</title>
      <dc:description>
Tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) are significant drivers of tumor progression. Key strategies that are reported to modulate TAM behavior in cancer using biomaterials are discussed, highlighting challenges and new opportunities. The role of macrophages in wound healing is also discussed and lessons that can be applied to cancer therapies are derived.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) are a complex and heterogeneous population of cells within the tumor microenvironment. In many tumor types, TAMs contribute toward tumor malignancy and are therefore a therapeutic target of interest. Here, three major strategies for regulating TAMs are highlighted, emphasizing the role of biomaterials in these approaches. First, systemic methods for targeting tumor&#8208;associated macrophage are summarized and limitations to both passive and active targeting approaches considered. Second, lessons learned from the significant literature on wound healing and macrophage response to implanted biomaterials are discussed with the vision of applying these principles to localized, biomaterial&#8208;based modulation of tumor&#8208;associated macrophage. Finally, the developing field of engineered macrophages, including genetic engineering and integration with biomaterials or drug delivery systems, is examined. Analysis of major challenges in the field along with exciting opportunities for the future of macrophage&#8208;based therapies in oncology are included.

      <title>Additive Manufacturing of Precision Biomaterials</title>
      <dc:description>
The patient&#8208;specific design of precision biomaterials enables tailored medical devices for specific needs. The integration of enabling technologies like additive manufacturing is accelerating the translation and implementation of precision biomaterials in clinical practice. With these developments, the paradigm of precision medicine extends beyond tailored pharmaceutical treatments based on &#8220;&#8208;omics&#8221; data to include all forms of customization in modern medicine.








Abstract
Biomaterials play a critical role in modern medicine as surgical guides, implants for tissue repair, and as drug delivery systems. The emerging paradigm of precision medicine exploits individual patient information to tailor clinical therapy. While the main focus of precision medicine to date is the design of improved pharmaceutical treatments based on &#8220;&#8208;omics&#8221; data, the concept extends to all forms of customized medical care. This includes the design of precision biomaterials that are tailored to meet specific patient needs. Additive manufacturing (AM) enables free&#8208;form manufacturing and mass customization, and is a critical enabling technology for the clinical implementation of precision biomaterials. Materials scientists and engineers can contribute to the realization of precision biomaterials by developing new AM technologies, synthesizing advanced (bio)materials for AM, and improving medical&#8208;image&#8208;based digital design. As the field matures, AM is poised to provide patient&#8208;specific tissue and organ substitutes, reproducible microtissues for drug screening and disease modeling, personalized drug delivery systems, as well as customized medical devices.

      <title>Biomimetic Nanotechnology toward Personalized Vaccines</title>
      <dc:description>
Personalized medicine is transforming how diseases are managed in the clinic. At the same time, biomimetic nanotechnology offers many advantages that can be leveraged toward the design of more effective medical interventions. Recent developments in biomimetic nanovaccines against cancer and bacterial infections are discussed, with a specific emphasis on potential avenues for personalization.








Abstract
While traditional approaches for disease management in the era of modern medicine have saved countless lives and enhanced patient well&#8208;being, it is clear that there is significant room to improve upon the current status quo. For infectious diseases, the steady rise of antibiotic resistance has resulted in super pathogens that do not respond to most approved drugs. In the field of cancer treatment, the idea of a cure&#8208;all silver bullet has long been abandoned. As a result of the challenges facing current treatment and prevention paradigms in the clinic, there is an increasing push for personalized therapeutics, where plans for medical care are established on a patient&#8208;by&#8208;patient basis. Along these lines, vaccines, both against bacteria and tumors, are a clinical modality that could benefit significantly from personalization. Effective vaccination strategies could help to address many challenging disease conditions, but current vaccines are limited by factors such as a lack of potency and antigenic breadth. Recently, researchers have turned toward the use of biomimetic nanotechnology as a means of addressing these hurdles. Recent progress in the development of biomimetic nanovaccines for antibacterial and anticancer applications is discussed, with an emphasis on their potential for personalized medicine.

      <title>Materials for Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Immunotherapy has established a new paradigm for the management and treatment of diseases, leading to numerous clinical breakthroughs. The means by which materials have helped overcome critical barriers associated with emerging immunotherapies are reviewed, and new opportunities for their continued advancement are discussed.








Abstract
Breakthroughs in materials engineering have accelerated the progress of immunotherapy in preclinical studies. The interplay of chemistry and materials has resulted in improved loading, targeting, and release of immunomodulatory agents. An overview of the materials that are used to enable or improve the success of immunotherapies in preclinical studies is presented, from immunosuppressive to proinflammatory strategies, with particular emphasis on technologies poised for clinical translation. The materials are organized based on their characteristic length scale, whereby the enabling feature of each technology is organized by the structure of that material. For example, the mechanisms by which i) nanoscale materials can improve targeting and infiltration of immunomodulatory payloads into tissues and cells, ii) microscale materials can facilitate cell&#8208;mediated transport and serve as artificial antigen&#8208;presenting cells, and iii) macroscale materials can form the basis of artificial microenvironments to promote cell infiltration and reprogramming are discussed. As a step toward establishing a set of design rules for future immunotherapies, materials that intrinsically activate or suppress the immune system are reviewed. Finally, a brief outlook on the trajectory of these systems and how they may be improved to address unsolved challenges in cancer, infectious diseases, and autoimmunity is presented.

      <title>2D Nanomaterials for Cancer Theranostic Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
2D nanomaterials with their unique nanosheet structure, large surface area, and extraordinary physicochemical properties have attracted tremendous interest for application in many different fields including nanomedicine in recent years. The recent progress in the development of different classes of 2D nanomaterials in biomedicine, especially for cancer theranostic applications, is summarized.








Abstract
2D nanomaterials with unique nanosheet structures, large surface areas, and extraordinary physicochemical properties have attracted tremendous interest. In the area of nanomedicine, research on graphene and its derivatives for diverse biomedical applications began as early as 2008. Since then, many other types of 2D nanomaterials, including transition metal dichalcogenides, transition metal carbides, nitrides and carbonitrides, black phosphorus nanosheets, layered double hydroxides, and metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets, have been explored in the area of nanomedicine over the past decade. In particular, a large surface area makes 2D nanomaterials highly efficient drug delivery nanoplatforms. The unique optical and/or X&#8208;ray attenuation properties of 2D nanomaterials can be harnessed for phototherapy or radiotherapy of cancer. Furthermore, by integrating 2D nanomaterials with other functional nanoparticles or utilizing their inherent physical properties, 2D nanomaterials may also be engineered as nanoprobes for multimodal imaging of tumors. 2D nanomaterials have shown substantial potential for cancer theranostics. Herein, the latest progress in the development of 2D nanomaterials for cancer theranostic applications is summarized. Current challenges and future perspectives of 2D nanomaterials applied in nanomedicine are also discussed.

      <title>Cancer&#8208;Targeting Nanoparticles for Combinatorial Nucleic Acid Delivery</title>
      <dc:description>
Synthetic nanoparticles can be used for delivery of combinations of nucleic acid, with different materials conferring different advantages for safe and effective delivery. Targeting strategies can also be employed for cancer&#8208;specific delivery, including passive targeting based on nanoparticle physical properties; active targeting using cancer&#8208;specific ligands; transcriptional targeting using cancer&#8208;specific promoters; and targeting of cancer&#8208;specific proteins or signaling pathways.








Abstract
Nucleic acids are a promising type of therapeutic for the treatment of a wide range of conditions, including cancer, but they also pose many delivery challenges. For efficient and safe delivery to cancer cells, nucleic acids must generally be packaged into a vehicle, such as a nanoparticle, that will allow them to be taken up by the target cells and then released in the appropriate cellular compartment to function. As with other types of therapeutics, delivery vehicles for nucleic acids must also be designed to avoid unwanted side effects; thus, the ability of such carriers to target their cargo to cancer cells is crucial. Classes of nucleic acids, hurdles that must be overcome for effective intracellular delivery, types of nonviral nanomaterials used as delivery vehicles, and the different strategies that can be employed to target nucleic acid delivery specifically to tumor cells are discussed. Additonally, nanoparticle designs that facilitate multiplexed delivery of combinations of nucleic acids are reviewed.

      <title>Biohybrid Design Gets Personal: New Materials for Patient&#8208;Specific Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Implantable devices function in dynamic environments, but have largely been manufactured using only synthetic materials. Recent advances in integrating responsive biological materials and bioinspired properties into such devices promise to transfer the adaptive functional behavior of organic materials to engineered systems. Significant advances in biohybrid design are highlighted, specifically the development of new responsive materials for precision medicine.








Abstract
Precision medicine requires materials and devices that can sense and adapt to dynamic physiological and pathological conditions. This motivates the design and manufacture of biohybrid materials that mimic the responsive behaviors demonstrated by natural biological systems. Two parallel approaches to biohybrid design are presented&#8212;biomimetics and biointegration. Biohybrid hydrogels that mimic the form and function of natural materials, or that integrate living cells or bioactive moieties, can respond to a range of environmental stimuli in parallel, including heat, light, pH, hydration, enzymes, and electric, mechanical, and magnetic forces. A range of examples that illustrate the tremendous potential of this nascent discipline are presented, and ongoing technical challenges related to manufacturing, storage, transport, and external noninvasive control of these materials that will need to be overcome in the coming years are outlined. The ethical, educational, and regulatory challenges that will govern translation of biohybrid design into medical applications are also discussed. Personalized medical therapies that target the precise needs of patients are a critically needed and expanding market. Biohybrid design offers the unique ability to manufacture materials and devices that match the dynamic and patient&#8208;specific in vivo environment, promising to generate more effective and safe therapies that enable personalized care.

      <title>Oral Delivery of Biologics for Precision Medicine</title>
      <dc:description>
Oral drug delivery technologies contribute to precision medicine by enabling the targeted delivery of biologics. The harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract and the complex structure of macromolecules make their formulation a critical challenge. An overview of the current situation, future prospects, barriers to clinical translation, and identified opportunities for advancement in the field is provided.








The emerging field of precision medicine is rapidly growing, fostered by the advances in genome mapping and molecular diagnosis. In general, the translation of these advances into precision treatments relies on the use of biological macromolecules, whose structure offers a high specificity and potency. Unfortunately, due to their complex structure and limited ability to overcome biological barriers, these macromolecules need to be administered via injection. The scientific community has devoted significant effort to making the oral administration of macromolecules plausible thanks to the implementation of drug delivery technologies. Here, an overview of the current situation and future prospects in the field of oral delivery of biologics is provided. Technologies in clinical trials, as well as recent and disruptive delivery systems proposed in the literature for local and systemic delivery of biologics including peptides, antibodies, and nucleic acids, are described. Strategies for the specific targeting of gastrointestinal regions&#8212;stomach, small bowel, and colon&#8212;cell populations, and internalization pathways, are analyzed. Finally, challenges associated with the clinical translation, future prospects, and identified opportunities for advancement in this field are also discussed.

      <title>Ligand&#8208;Installed Nanocarriers toward Precision Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
The development of ligand&#8208;installed nanocarriers toward active targeted therapy of tumors, cardiovascular disease, and brain diseases, as well as the progress in the clinical stage and future perspectives for precision therapies are summarized.








Abstract
Development of drug&#8208;delivery systems that selectively target neoplastic cells has been a major goal of nanomedicine. One major strategy for achieving this milestone is to install ligands on the surface of nanocarriers to enhance delivery to target tissues, as well as to enhance internalization of nanocarriers by target cells, which improves accuracy, efficacy, and ultimately enhances patient outcomes. Herein, recent advances regarding the development of ligand&#8208;installed nanocarriers are introduced and the effect of their design on biological performance is discussed. Besides academic achievements, progress on ligand&#8208;installed nanocarriers in clinical trials is presented, along with the challenges faced by these formulations. Lastly, the future perspectives of ligand&#8208;installed nanocarriers are discussed, with particular emphasis on their potential for emerging precision therapies.
