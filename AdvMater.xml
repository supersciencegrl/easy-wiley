         <title>Exploiting the Mechanical Bond Effect for Enhanced Molecular Recognition and Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building upon the established chelate and macrocyclic effects, supramolecular chemists have exploited the mechanical bond to create selective supramolecular hosts with enhanced binding affinities and selectivity over non&#8208;interlocked acyclic and macrocyclic host analogs. This review delineates advantages of mechanically interlocked hosts for charged species, and discusses current and potential applications of the mechanical bond effect for recognition and sensing applications.








Abstract
The ubiquity of charged species in biological and industrial processes has resulted in ever&#8208;increasing interest in their selective recognition, detection, and environmental remediation. Building on the established coordination chemistry principles of the chelate and macrocyclic effects, and host preorganization, supramolecular chemists seek to construct specific 3D binding cavities reminiscent of biotic systems to enhance host&#8208;guest binding affinity and selectivity. Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) present a wholly unique platform for synthetic host design, wherein topologies afforded by the mechanical bond enable the decoration of 3D cavities for non&#8208;covalent interactions with a range of target guest geometries. Notably, MIM host systems exhibit mechanical bond effect augmented affinities and selectivities for a variety of charged guest species, compared to non&#8208;interlocked acyclic and macrocycle host analogs. Furthermore, the modular nature of MIM synthesis facilitates incorporation of optical and electrochemical reporter groups, enabling fabrication of highly sensitive and specific molecular sensors. This review discusses the development of recognition and sensing MIMs, from the first reports in the late 20th century through to the present day, delineating how their topologically preorganized and dynamic host cavities enhance charged guest recognition and sensing, demonstrating the mechanical bond effect as a potent tool in future chemosensing materials.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Layer Controlled Transition from Inverse Rashba&#8211;Edelstein Effect to Inverse Spin Hall Effect in 2D PtSe2 Probed by THz Spintronic Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion (SCC) is studied in 2D PtSe2 using THz emission. PtSe2 layers are grown epitaxially on graphene, followed by in situ ferromagnet deposition resulting in well&#8208;defined atomic interfaces.The unique thickness&#8208;dependent electronic structure of PtSe2 allows the control of SCC: from the inverse RashbaEdelstein effect in the semiconducting layers to the inverse spin Hall effect in the semi&#8208;metallic state.








Abstract
2D materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, are ideal platforms for spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion (SCC) as they possess strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC), reduced dimensionality and crystal symmetries as well as tuneable band structure, compared to metallic structures. Moreover, SCC can be tuned with the number of layers, electric field, or strain. Here, SCC in epitaxially grown 2D PtSe2 by THz spintronic emission is studied since its 1T crystal symmetry and strong SOC favor SCC. High quality of as&#8208;grown PtSe2 layers is demonstrated, followed by in situ ferromagnet deposition by sputtering that leaves the PtSe2 unaffected, resulting in well&#8208;defined clean interfaces as evidenced with extensive characterization. Through this atomic growth control and using THz spintronic emission, the unique thickness&#8208;dependent electronic structure of PtSe2 allows the control of SCC. Indeed, the transition from the inverse Rashba&#8211;Edelstein effect (IREE) in 1&#8211;3 monolayers (ML) to the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) in multilayers (&gt;3 ML) of PtSe2 enabling the extraction of the perpendicular spin diffusion length and relative strength of IREE and ISHE is demonstrated. This band structure flexibility makes PtSe2 an ideal candidate to explore the underlying mechanisms and engineering of the SCC as well as for the development of tuneable THz spintronic&#160;emitters.

         <title>Flexible, Biodegradable, and Wireless Magnetoelectric Paper for Simple In Situ Personalization of Bioelectric Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible, biodegradable bioelectronic paper featuring homogeneously distributed wireless stimulation functionality is presented. This paper synergistically combines lead&#8208;free magnetoelectric nanoparticles for external magnetic field&#8208;induced electrical stimulation and flexible, biodegradable nanofibers for high&#8208;selectivity stimulation, oxygen/nutrient permeation, cell orientation modulation, and biodegradation rate control. Scalability, design flexibility, and rapid customizability are demonstrated through simple paper crafting techniques such as origami and kirigami.








Abstract
Bioelectronic implants delivering electrical stimulation offer an attractive alternative to traditional pharmaceuticals in electrotherapy. However, achieving simple, rapid, and cost&#8208;effective personalization of these implants for customized treatment in unique clinical and physical scenarios presents a substantial challenge. This challenge is further compounded by the need to ensure safety and minimal invasiveness, requiring essential attributes such as flexibility, biocompatibility, lightness, biodegradability, and wireless stimulation capability. Here, a flexible, biodegradable bioelectronic paper with homogeneously distributed wireless stimulation functionality for simple personalization of bioelectronic implants is introduced. The bioelectronic paper synergistically combines i) lead&#8208;free magnetoelectric nanoparticles (MENs) that facilitate electrical stimulation in response to external magnetic field and ii) flexible and biodegradable nanofibers (NFs) that enable localization of MENs for high&#8208;selectivity stimulation, oxygen/nutrient permeation, cell orientation modulation, and biodegradation rate control. The effectiveness of wireless electrical stimulation in vitro through enhanced neuronal differentiation of neuron&#8208;like PC12 cells and the controllability of their microstructural orientation are shown. Also, scalability, design flexibility, and rapid customizability of the bioelectronic paper are shown by creating various 3D macrostructures using simple paper crafting techniques such as cutting and folding. This platform holds promise for simple and rapid personalization of temporary bioelectronic implants for minimally invasive wireless stimulation therapies.

         <title>Self&#8208;Mixed Biphasic Liquid Metal Composite with Ultra&#8208;High Stretchability and Strain&#8208;Insensitivity for Neuromorphic Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Neuromorphic circuits that can function under extreme deformations are important for various data&#8208;driven wearable and robotic applications. Herein, biphasic liquid metal particle (BMP) with unprecedented stretchability and strain&#8208;insensitivity (&#916;R/R0 = 1.4@ 1200% strain) were developed to realize a stretchable neuromorphic circuit that mimics a spike&#8208;based biologic sensory system. The BMP consists of liquid metal particles (LMPs) and rigid liquid metal particles (RLMPs), which are homogeneously mixed via spontaneous solutal&#8208;Marangoni mixing flow during coating. This permits facile single step patterning directly on various substrates at room temperature. BMP is highly conductive (2.3 &#215; 106 S/m) without any post activation steps. BMP interconnects were utilized for a sensory system, which is capable of distinguishing variations of biaxial strains with a spiking neural network, thus demonstrating their potential for various sensing and signal processing applications.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact Solar Cell Performance Analysis Using Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides two features that may enhance experimental studies and evaluations on TOPCon solar cells technology: 1) the compilation of a dataset built from current literature, and: 2) a series of rules on cell performance and heuristics for optimization that are obtained based on this dataset, which could serve as a source of inspiration for further experimental studies.








Abstract
Tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) have gained interest as a way to increase the energy conversion efficiency of silicon solar cells, and the International Technology Roadmap of Photovoltaics forecasts TOPCon to become an important technology despite a few remaining challenges. To review the recent development of TOPCon cells, this work has compiled a dataset of all device data found in current literature, which sums up to 405 devices from 131 papers. This may seem like a surprisingly small number of cells given the recent interest in the TOPCon architecture, but it illustrates a problem of data dissemination in the field. Notwithstanding the limited number of cells, there is a great diversity in cell manufacturing procedures, and this work observes a gradual increase in performance indicating that the field has not yet converged on a set of best practices. By analyzing the data using statistical methods and machine learning (ML) algorithms, this work is able to reinforces some commonly held hypotheses related to the performance differences between different device architectures. This work also identifies a few more unintuitive feature combinations that would be of interest for further experimentally studies. This work also aims to inspire improvements in data management and dissemination within the TOPCon community.

&lt;p&gt;This study provides two features that may enhance experimental studies and evaluations on TOPCon solar cells technology: 1) the compilation of a dataset built from current literature, and: 2) a series of rules on cell performance and heuristics for optimization that are obtained based on this dataset, which could serve as a source of inspiration for further experimental studies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) have gained interest as a way to increase the energy conversion efficiency of silicon solar cells, and the International Technology Roadmap of Photovoltaics forecasts TOPCon to become an important technology despite a few remaining challenges. To review the recent development of TOPCon cells, this work has compiled a dataset of all device data found in current literature, which sums up to 405 devices from 131 papers. This may seem like a surprisingly small number of cells given the recent interest in the TOPCon architecture, but it illustrates a problem of data dissemination in the field. Notwithstanding the limited number of cells, there is a great diversity in cell manufacturing procedures, and this work observes a gradual increase in performance indicating that the field has not yet converged on a set of best practices. By analyzing the data using statistical methods and machine learning (ML) algorithms, this work is able to reinforces some commonly held hypotheses related to the performance differences between different device architectures. This work also identifies a few more unintuitive feature combinations that would be of interest for further experimentally studies. This work also aims to inspire improvements in data management and dissemination within the TOPCon community.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Pouch Cell Using Cu3P Nanowires In Situ Grown on Current Collector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu3P nanowires in situ grown on the current collector are capable of realizing uniform deposition of sodium metal during repeated cycling, which is attributed to low Na+ absorption energy and diffusion energy barrier on Na3P. Superior electrochemical performance of Cu3P@Cu anode successfully enables anode&#8208;free sodium metal pouch cell with stable cycling lifespan.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sodium metal battery (AFSMB) promises high energy density but suffers from the difficulty of maintaining high cycling stability. Nonuniform sodium (Na) deposition on the current collector is largely responsible for capacity decay in the cycling process of AFSMB. Here, a unique copper phosphide (Cu3P) nanowire is constructed on copper (Cu3P@Cu) as a sodium deposition substrate by an in situ growth method. Superior electrochemical performance of Cu3P@Cu anode is delivered in asymmetric cells with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% for over 800 cycles at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with 1 mA h cm&#8722;2. The symmetric cell of Cu3P@Cu displayed a cycling lifespan of over 2000&#160;h at 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with 1 mA h cm&#8722;2. Cryo&#8208;transmission electron microscope&#160;characterization and first principles calculation revealed that the low Na+ absorption energy and low Na+ diffusion energy barrier on Na3P promoted uniform Na nucleation and deposition, thus enhancing the Na surface stability. Moreover, anode&#8208;free Na3V2(PO4)3//Cu3P@Cu full pouch cell delivered a considerable cycling capacity of &#8776;15&#160;mA h in 170 cycles, demonstrating its practical feasibility.

         <title>The Case for a Defect Genome Initiative</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Point defects in crystalline solids are likened to new &#8220;elements&#8221; beyond the periodic table. In the spirit of the Material Genome Initiative, a Defect Genome Initiative (DGI) is proposed to fast&#8208;track defect discoveries for energy, quantum, and other applications. This initiative focuses on open defect platforms, data&#8208;driven defect design, and experimental methods, hoping to spur a new community&#8208;wide interest.








Abstract
The Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) has streamlined the materials discovery effort by leveraging generic traits of materials, with focus largely on perfect solids. Defects such as impurities and perturbations, however, drive many attractive functional properties of materials. The rich tapestry of charge, spin, and bonding states hosted by defects are not accessible to elements and perfect crystals, and defects can thus be viewed as another class of &#8220;elements&#8221; that lie beyond the periodic table. Accordingly, a Defect Genome Initiative (DGI) to accelerate functional defect discovery for energy, quantum information, and other applications is proposed. First, major advances made under the MGI are highlighted, followed by a delineation of pathways for accelerating the discovery and design of functional defects under the DGI. Near&#8208;term goals for the DGI are suggested. The construction of open defect platforms and design of data&#8208;driven functional defects, along with approaches for fabrication and characterization of defects, are discussed. The associated challenges and opportunities are considered and recent advances towards controlled introduction of functional defects at the atomic scale are reviewed. It is hoped this perspective will spur a community&#8208;wide interest in undertaking a DGI effort in recognition of the importance of defects in enabling unique functionalities in materials.

         <title>Optimizing Edge Active Sites via Intrinsic In&#8208;Plane Iridium Deficiency in Layered Iridium Oxides for Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Improving catalytic activity of surface iridium sites without compromising their catalytic stability is the core task of designing more efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalysts under acidic conditions. In this work, we present the phase transition of a bulk layered iridate Na2IrO3 in acid solution at room temperature, and the subsequent exfoliation to produce two dimentional iridium oxide nanosheets with an around 4&#160;nm thickness. The nanosheets consist of OH&#8208;terminated, honeycomb&#8208;type layers of edge&#8208;sharing IrO6 octahedral framework with intrinsic in&#8208;plane iridium deficiency. The nanosheet material is among the most active Ir&#8208;based catalysts reported for OER in acid, and gives an iridium mass activity improvement up to a factor of 16.5 over rutile IrO2 nanoparticles. The nanosheet material also exhibits good catalytic and structural stability, and retains the catalytic activity for more than 1,300 hours. The collective results from experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate that edge Ir sites of the layer are the active centres for OER, with structural hydroxyl groups participating in the catalytic cycle of OER via a non&#8208;traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism. The existence of intrinsic in&#8208;plane iridium deficiency is found to the key to building a unique local environment of edge active sites that have optimal surface oxygen adsorption properties and thereby high catalytic activity.

         <title>Vicious Cycle&#8208;Breaking Lipid Nanoparticles Remodeling Multi&#8208;Cellular Crosstalk to Reverse Liver Fibrosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
During liver fibrogenesis, the reciprocal crosstalk among capillarized liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and dysfunctional hepatocytes constructs a self&#8208;amplifying vicious cycle, greatly exacerbating the disease condition and weakening therapeutic effect. Limited by the malignant cellular interactions, the previous single&#8208;cell centric treatment approaches showed unsatisfactory efficacy and failed to meet clinical demand. Herein, a vicious cycle&#8208;breaking strategy was proposed to target and repair pathological cells separately to terminate the malignant progression of liver fibrosis. Chondroitin sulfate modified and vismodegib loaded nanoparticles (CS&#8208;NPs/VDG) were designed to efficiently normalize the fenestrae phenotype of LSECs and restore HSCs to quiescent state by inhibiting Hedgehog signaling pathway. In addition, glycyrrhetinic acid modified and silybin loaded nanoparticles (GA&#8208;NPs/SIB) were prepared to restore hepatocytes function by relieving oxidative stress. The results showed successful interruption of vicious cycle as well as distinct fibrosis resolution in two animal models through multi&#8208;regulation of the pathological cells. This work not only highlights the significance of modulating cellular crosstalk but also provides a promising avenue for developing anti&#8208;fibrotic regimens.

         <title>Nanoengineered Red Blood Cells Loaded with TMPRSS2 and Cathepsin L Inhibitors Block SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Pseudovirus Entry into Lung ACE2+ Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The enzymatic activities of Furin, Transmembrane serine proteinase 2 (TMPRSS2), Cathepsin L (CTSL), and Angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding are necessary for the entry of coronaviruses into host cells. Precise inhibition of these key proteases in ACE2+ lung cells during a viral infection cycle should prevent viral S protein activation and its fusion with a host cell membrane, consequently averting virus entry to the cells. In this study, we construct dual&#8208;drug&#8208;combined (TMPRSS2 inhibitor Camostat and CTSL inhibitor E&#8208;64d) nanocarriers (NCs) conjugated with an anti&#8208;hACE2 antibody and employ RBC&#8208;hitchhiking, termed &#8220;Nanoengineered RBCs,&#8221; for targeting lung cells. We report the significant therapeutic efficacy of the dual&#8208;drug&#8208;loaded nanoengineered RBCs in pseudovirus&#8208;infected K18&#8208;hACE2 transgenic mice. Notably, our modular nanoengineered RBCs (anti&#8208;receptor antibody+NCs+RBCs) precisely target key proteases of host cells in the lungs to block the entry of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, regardless of virus variations. Our findings are anticipated to benefit the development of a series of novel and safe host&#8208;cell&#8208;protecting antiviral therapies.

Notably, our modular nanoengineered RBCs (anti-receptor antibody+NCs+RBCs) precisely target key proteases of host cells in the lungs to block the entry of SARS-CoV-2, regardless of virus variations. Our findings are anticipated to benefit the development of a series of novel and safe host-cell-protecting antiviral therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Formulating Local Environment of Oxygen Mitigates Voltage Hysteresis in Li&#8208;rich Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Li&#8208;rich cathode materials have emerged as one of the most prospective options for Li&#8208;ion batteries owing to their remarkable energy density (&gt; 900&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1). However, voltage hysteresis during charge and discharge process lowers the energy conversion efficiency, which hinders their application in practical devices. Herein, we unveil the fundamental reason for voltage hysteresis through investigating the O redox behavior under different (de)lithiation states and successfully address it by formulating the local environment of O2&#8722;. In Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based materials, we have confirmed that there exists reaction activity of oxygen ions at low discharge voltage (&lt; 3.6&#160;V) in the presence of TM&#8208;TM&#8208;Li ordered arrangement, generating massive amount of voltage hysteresis and resulting in a decreased energy efficiency (80.95%). Moreover, in the case where Li 2b sites are numerously occupied by TM ions, the local environment of O2&#8722; evolves, the reactivity of oxygen ions at low voltage is significantly inhibited, thus giving rise to the large energy conversion efficiency (89.07%). This study unveils the structure&#8208;activity relationship between the local environment around O2&#8722; and voltage hysteresis, which provides guidance in designing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance cathode materials.

         <title>Reduced Lattice Constant in Al&#8208;Doped LiMn2O4 Nanoparticles for Boosted Electrochemical Lithium Extraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extracting lithium selectively and efficiently from brine sources is crucial for addressing energy and environmental challenges. The electrochemical system employing LiMn2O4 (LMO) electrodes has been recognized as an effective method for lithium recovery. However, the lithium selectivity and stability of LMO need further enhancement for its practical applications. Herein, the Al&#8208;doped LMO with reduced lattice constant is successfully fabricated through a facile one&#8208;step solid&#8208;state sintering method, leading to enhanced lithium selectivity. The reduced lattice constant in Al&#8208;doped LMO is proved through spectroscopic analyses and theoretic calculations. Compared to the original LMO, the Al&#8208;doped LMO (LiAl0.05Mn1.95O4, LMO&#8208;Al0.05) exhibit higher specific capacitance, lower resistance, and improved stability. Moreover, the LMO&#8208;Al0.05 with reduced lattice constant can offer higher Li+ diffusion coefficient and lower intercalation energy revealed by cyclic voltammetry and multiscale simulations. When employed in hybrid capacitive deionization (CDI), the LMO&#8208;Al0.05 obtained a Li+ intercalation capacity of 21.7&#160;mg g&#8722;1 and low energy consumption of 2.6&#160;Wh mol&#8722;1 Li+. Importantly, the LMO&#8208;Al0.05 achieves a high Li+ extraction percentage (approximately 86%) with Li+/Na+ and Li+/Mg2+ selectivity of 1653.8 and 434.9, respectively, in synthetic brine. Our results demonstrate that the Al&#8208;doped LMO with reduced lattice constant could be a sustainable solution for electrochemical lithium extraction.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Materials for Advanced Sodium Storage: Development and Anticipation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As a pioneering battery technology, even though sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are safe, non&#8208;flammable, and capable of exhibiting better temperature endurance performance than lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), because of lower energy density and larger ionic size, they are not amicable for large&#8208;scale applications. Generally, the electrochemical storage performance of a secondary battery can be improved by monitoring the composition and morphology of electrode materials. Because more is the intricacy of a nanostructured composite electrode material, more electrochemical storage applications would be expected. Despite the conventional methods suitable for practical production, the synthesis of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) would offer enormous opportunities for next&#8208;generation battery applications by delicately systematizing the structure and composition at the molecular level to store sodium ions with larger sizes compared with lithium ions. Here in this review, we comprehensively discuss the progress of nanostructured MOFs and their derivatives applied as negative and positive electrode materials for effective sodium storage in SIBs. The commercialization goal has prompted the development of MOFs and their derivatives as electrode materials, before which the synthesis and mechanism for MOF&#8208;based SIB electrodes with improved sodium storage performance were systematically discussed. Finally, the existing challenges, possible perspectives, and future opportunities will be anticipated.

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;Structured Materials: Molecular Fundamentals and Electrocatalytic Roles in Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs), a kind of molecular metal oxide cluster with unique physical&#8208;chemical properties, have made essential contributions to creating efficient and robust electrocatalysts in renewable energy systems. Due to the fundamental advantages of POMs, such as the diversity of molecular structures and large numbers of redox active sites, numerous efforts have been devoted to extending their application areas. Up to now, various strategies of assembling POM molecules into superstructures, supporting POMs on heterogeneous substrates, and POMs&#8208;derived metal compounds have been developed for synthesizing electrocatalysts. From a multidisciplinary perspective, we systematically summarize the latest advances in creating POM&#8208;structured materials with a unique focus on their molecular fundamentals, electrocatalytic roles, and the recent breakthroughs of POMs and POM&#8208;derived electrocatalysts. Notably, we focus on exposing the current states, essences, and mechanisms of how POM&#8208;structured materials influence their electrocatalytic activities and disclose the critical requirements for future developments. The future challenges, objectives, comparisons, and perspectives for creating POM&#8208;structured materials have also been systematically discussed. We anticipate that this review will offer a substantial impact on stimulating interdisciplinary efforts for the prosperities and widespread utilizations of POM&#8208;structured materials in electrocatalysis.

         <title>Physiochemical Coupled Dynamic Nanosphere Lithography Enabling Multiple Metastructures from Single Mask</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metastructures are widely used in photonic devices, energy conversion and biomedical applications. However, to fabricate multiple patterns continuously in single etching protocol with highly tunable photonic properties is challenging. Here we proposed a simple and robust dynamic nanosphere lithography by inserting a spacer between the nanosphere assembly and the wafer. The nanosphere diameter decrease and uneven penetration of the spacer during etching leads to a dynamic masking process. Coupled anisotropic physical ion sputtering and ricocheting with isotropic chemical radical etching achieved highly tunable structures with various 3D patterns continuously forming through a single etching process. Specifically, the nanosphere diameters define the periodicity, the etched spacer forms the upper parts, and the wafer forms the lower parts. Each part of the structure is highly tunable through changing nanosphere diameter, spacer thickness and etch conditions. Using this protocol, we realized numerous structures of varying sizes including nano mushrooms, nanocones, nano pencils, and nanoneedles with diverse shapes as proof of concepts. The broadband antireflection ability of the nanostructures and their use in SERS were also demonstrated for practical application. Our method substantially simplified the fabrication procedure of various metastructures, paving the way for its application in multiple disciplines especially in photonic devices.

         <title>Chaotropic Effect&#8208;Boosted Thermogalvanic Ionogel Thermocells for All&#8208;Weather Power Generation</title>

Abstract
Ionic thermocells convert heat into electricity and are promising power sources for electronic devices. However, discontinuous and small electricity output limits practical use under varying environmental conditions. Here, we design a thermogalvanic ionogel with a high Seebeck coefficient (32.4&#160;mV K&#8722;1). We also develop thermocells that combine thermogalvanic ionogel&#8208;based thermocells, which realize all&#8208;weather power generation via passive radiative cooling. These thermocells generate electricity continuously under varying weather conditions and over a wide temperature range (&#8722;40 to 90&#176;C), with a normalized power density of 25.84&#160;mW m&#8722;2 K&#8722;2. Advanced characterization shows the chaotropic effect enhances the Seebeck coefficient, while the self&#8208;supplying temperature difference given the radiative cooling structure enables all&#8208;weather power generation. Our results provide an effective strategy for developing practical thermocells suitable for diverse daily and seasonal variations.

         <title>Modifying Surface Termination by Bidentate Chelating Strategy Enables 13.77% Efficient Kesterite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Surfaces display discontinuities in the kesterite&#8208;based polycrystalline films can produce large defect densities, including strained and dangling bonds. These physical defects tend to introduce electronic defects and surface states, which can greatly promote nonradiative recombination of electron&#8208;hole pairs and damage device performance. Here, an effective chelation strategy is reported to suppress these harmful physical defects related to unterminated Cu, Zn, and Sn sites by modifying the surface of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) films with sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (NaDDTC). The conjoint theoretical calculations and experimental results reveal that the NaDDTC molecules can be coordinate to surface metal sites of CZTSSe films via robust bidentate chelating interactions, effectively reducing surface undercoordinated defects and passivating the electron trap states. Consequently, the solar cell efficiency of the NaDDTC&#8208;treated device is increased to as high as 13.77% under 100 mWcm&#8722;2 illumination, with significant improvement in fill factor (FF) and open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC). This surface chelation strategy provides strong surface termination and defect passivation for further development and application of kesterite&#8208;based photovoltaics.

         <title>Regulation of Coordination Chemistry for Ultra&#8208;Stable Layered Oxide Cathode Materials of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Layered transition&#8208;metal (TM) oxide cathodes have attracted growing attention in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, their practical implementation is plagued by Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion and irreversible cation migration, leading to severe voltage decay and structure instability. Herein, O3&#8208;Na0.898K0.058Ni0.396Fe0.098Mn0.396Ti0.092O2 (KT&#8208;NFM) is reported as an ultra&#8208;stable cathode material via multi&#8208;site substitution with rigid KO6 pillars and flexible TiO6 octahedra. The K pillars induce contracted TMO2 slabs and their strong Coulombic repulsion to inhibit Ni/Fe migration; and Ti incorporation reinforces the hybridization of Ni(3deg*)&#8208;O(2p) to mitigate the undesired O3&#8208;O'3 phase transition. These enable the reversible redox of Ni2+&#8596;Ni3.20+ and Fe3+&#8596;Fe3.69+ for 135.6 mAh g&#8722;1 and ultra&#8208;stable cycles with &gt;90% capacity retention after 2000 cycles in a pouch cell of KT&#8208;NFM||hard carbon. This will provide insights into the design of ultra&#8208;stable layered cathode materials of sodium&#8208;ion batteries and beyond.

         <title>Pyroelectric Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyelectrolyte brushes prepared via surface&#8208;initiated polymerization display pyro&#8208; and piezoelectric behavior. These properties are attributed to the structural complexity of polymer brushes, and depend on, and can be tuned by variation of the counterion. The ability to produce polymer brushes with piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric properties opens new avenues of application of these materials, for example, in energy harvesting or biosensing. 








Abstract
Piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric materials are of interest, for example, for energy harvesting applications, for the development of tactile sensors, as well as neuromorphic computing. This study reports the observation of pyro&#8208; and piezoelectricity in thin surface&#8208;attached polymer brushes containing zwitterionic and electrolytic side groups that are prepared via surface&#8208;initiated polymerization. The pyro&#8208; and piezoelectric properties of the surface&#8208;grafted polyelectrolyte brushes are found to sensitively depend on and can be tuned by variation of the counterion. The observed piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric properties reflect the structural complexity of polymer brushes, and are attributed to a complex interplay of the non&#8208;uniform segment density within these films, together with a non&#8208;uniform distribution of counterions and specific ion effects. The fabrication of thin pyroelectric films by surface&#8208;initiated polymerization is an important addition to the existing strategies toward such materials. Surface&#8208;initiated polymerization, in particular, allows for facile grafting of polar thin polymer films from a wide range of substrates via a straightforward two&#8208;step protocol that obviates the need for multistep laborious synthetic procedures or thin film deposition protocols. The ability to produce polymer brushes with piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric properties opens up new avenues of application of these materials, for example, in energy harvesting or biosensing.

         <title>Reversing Zincophobic/Hydrophilic Nature of Metal&#8208;N&#8208;C via Metal&#8208;Coordination Interaction for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Anode with High Depth&#8208;of&#8208;Discharge</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zincophobic/hydrophilic nature of traditional Metal&#8208;N&#8208;C is ingeniously reversed through manipulating electronic interactions between metal and coordination atoms and the novel zincophilic/hydrophobic Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C host for Zn anode is fabricated. The Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C host benefits the dendrite&#8208;free and durable cyclic stability of Zn anode under high depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge.








Abstract
Dendrite&#8208;free Zn metal anodes with high depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge (DoD) and robust cycle performances are highly desired for the practical application of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, the zincophobic/hydrophilic nature of Metal&#8208;N&#8208;C through manipulating the electronic interactions between metal and coordination atoms is successfully reversed, thereby fabricating a zincophilic/hydrophobic asymmetric Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C (consisting of a Zn center coordinated with 3 pyridinic N atoms and 1 pyrrolic N atom) host, which realizes uniformed Zn deposition and a long lifespan with high DoD. The experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate weakened interaction between pyrrolic N and metal center in the asymmetric Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C triggers downshift of the Zn 3d&#8208;band&#8208;center and a new localization nonbonding state in the N and C 2p&#8208;band, resulting in preferred Zn adsorption to water adsorption. Consequently, the asymmetric Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C host delivers small Zn nucleation overpotential and high Coulombic efficiency of 98.3% over 500 cycles. The symmetric cells with Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C@Zn anode demonstrate 500&#160;h dendrite&#8208;free cycles at DoD up to 50%. The Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C@Zn/S&#8208;PANI full cell also shows a robust long&#8208;term cycle performance of 1000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1. This strategy of constructing zincophilic/hydrophobic Metal&#8208;N&#8208;C may open up their application for the dendrite&#8208;free metal anode.

At low temperatures, excimer phosphorescence can be activated, enabled by the enhanced noncovalent interactions. With environmental variations, the dynamic transition process between the monomer and excimer phosphorescence is captured, establishing a framework to understand the photophysical mechanisms governing organic phosphorescence.








Abstract
Achieving efficient near&#8208;infrared room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence of purely organic phosphors remains scarce and challenging due to strong nonradiative decay. Additionally, the investigation of triplet excimer phosphorescence is rarely reported, despite the fact that excimer, a special emitter commonly formed in crystals with strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, can efficiently change the fluorescent properties of compounds. Herein, a series of dithienopyrrole derivatives with low triplet energy levels and stable triplet states, exhibiting persistent near&#8208;infrared room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, is developed. Via the modification of halogen atoms, the crystals display tunable emissions of monomers from 645 to 702&#160;nm, with a maximum lifetime of 3.68&#160;ms under ambient conditions. Notably, excimer phosphorescence can be switched on at low temperatures, enabled by noncovalent interactions rigidifying the matrix and stabilizing triplet excimer. Unprecedentedly, the dynamic transition process is captured between the monomer and excimer phosphorescence with temperature variations, revealing that the unstable triplet excimers in crystals with a tendency to dissociate can result in the effective quench of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. Excited state transitions across varying environments are elucidated, interpreting the structural dynamics of the triplet excimer and demonstrating strategies for devising novel near&#8208;infrared phosphors.

         <title>Electrically Confined Electroluminescence of Neutral Excitons in WSe2 Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates electrically confined electroluminescence of neutral excitons in WSe2 light&#8208;emitting transistors (LETs). By balancing injected electrons and holes, and electrically confining neutral excitons, WSe2 LETs exhibit strong electroluminescence with a high external quantum efficiency of &#8776;8.2 % at room temperature. This work shows a promising approach to enhancing efficiency and modulating the recombination of exciton complexes for 2D excitonic devices.








Abstract
Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have drawn significant attention for their potential in optoelectronic applications due to their direct band gap and exceptional quantum yield. However, TMD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting devices have shown low external quantum efficiencies as imbalanced free carrier injection often leads to the formation of non&#8208;radiative charged excitons, limiting practical applications. Here, electrically confined electroluminescence (EL) of neutral excitons in tungsten diselenide (WSe2) light&#8208;emitting transistors (LETs) based on the van der Waals heterostructure is demonstrated. The WSe2 channel is locally doped to simultaneously inject electrons and holes to the 1D region by a local graphene gate. At balanced concentrations of injected electrons and holes, the WSe2 LETs exhibit strong EL with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8776;8.2 % at room temperature. These experimental and theoretical results consistently show that the enhanced EQE could be attributed to dominant exciton emission confined at the 1D region while expelling charged excitons from the active area by precise control of external electric fields. This work shows a promising approach to enhancing the EQE of 2D light&#8208;emitting transistors and modulating the recombination of exciton complexes for excitonic devices.

         <title>Biphasic GaIn Alloy Constructed Stable Percolation Network in Polymer Composites over Ultrabroad Temperature Region</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;eutectic biphasic design of GaIn alloy not only maintains the conductive network integrity at a wide temperature range (77&#8211;473 K) by phase transitions of liquid Ga and solid In but also addresses the widespread leakage problem. This work provides a feasible indication of conductive composites for applications in extreme temperature applications.








Abstract
Flexible and adaptable polymer composites with high&#8208;performance reliability over wide temperature range are imperative for various applications. However, the distinct filler&#8208;matrix thermomechanical behaviors often cause severe structure damage and performance degradation upon large thermal shock. To address this issue, a general strategy is proposed to construct leakage&#8208;free, self&#8208;adaptive, stable percolation networks in polymer composites over wide temperature (77&#8211;473 K) with biphasic Ga35In65 alloy. The in situ micro&#8208;CT technology, for the first time, reveals the conformable phase transitions of Ga35In65 alloys in the polymer matrix that help repair the disruptive conductive networks over large temperature variations. The cryo&#8208;expanded Ga compensates the disruptive carbon networks at low temperatures, and flowable Ga and melted In at high temperatures conformably fill and repair the deboned interfaces and yielded crevices. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, this temperature&#8208;resistant composite demonstrates superb electrical conductivity and electromagnetic interference shielding properties and stability even after a large temperature shock (&#916;T = 396 K). Furthermore, the superiority of the construction of temperature self&#8208;adaptive networks within the composite enables them for additive manufacturing of application&#8208;oriented components. This work offers helpful inspiration for developing high&#8208;performance polymer composites for extreme&#8208;temperature applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrically controllable Tamm plasmon coupled with poly (3,4&#8208;ethylene&#8208;dioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate signifies a breakthrough in optical switching, achieving a modulation depth surpassing 88% (&#8776;99% theoretically) in the near&#8208;infrared range at sub&#8208;1&#8208;volt levels. This device holds the potential to accelerate advancements in scalable optical modulators and non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;memory state optical devices. Consequently, it extends applications to rewritable optical memory storage with neuromorphic behavior.








Abstract
Reconfigurable optical devices hold great promise for advancing high&#8208;density optical interconnects, photonic switching, and memory applications. While many optical modulators based on active materials have been demonstrated, it is challenging to achieve a high modulation depth with a low operation voltage in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range, which is a highly sought&#8208;after wavelength window for free&#8208;space communication and imaging applications. Here, electrically switchable Tamm plasmon coupled with poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is introduced. The device allows for a high modulation depth across the entire NIR range by fully absorbing incident light even under epsilon near zero conditions. Optical modulation exceeding 88% is achieved using a CMOS&#8208;compatible voltage of &#177;1&#160;V. This modulation is facilitated by precise electrical control of the charge carrier density through an electrochemical doping/dedoping process. Additionally, the potential applications of the device are extended for a non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;memory state optical device, capable of rewritable optical memory storage and exhibiting long&#8208;term potentiation/depression properties with neuromorphic behavior.

         <title>Topological Engineering Electrodes with Ultrafast Oxygen Transport for Super&#8208;Power Sodium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pore&#8208;clogging and poor O2 diffusion restrict the output power and capacity of sodium&#8208;oxygen batteries. Here, by using 3D&#8208;printing techniques, the impact of porous structures and pore sizes on O2 diffusion in sodium&#8208;oxygen cells is studied. An electrode is 3D printed with progressively branching gas channels to balance O2 diffusion and product storage, which shows a high output power and capacity.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;oxygen battery has attracted tremendous interest due to its extraordinary theoretical specific energy (1605&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1NaO2) and appealing element abundance. However, definite mechanistic factors governing efficient oxygen diffusion and consumption inside electrolyte&#8208;flooded air cathodes remain elusive thus precluding a true gas diffusion electrode capable of high discharge current (i.e., several mA cm&#8722;2) and superior output power. Herein, 3D&#8208;printing technology is adopted to create gas channels with tailored channel size and structure to demystify the diffusion&#8208;limited oxygen delivery process. It is revealed that as the clogging discharging products increase, large channel size, and interconnected channel structure are essential to guaranteeing fast O2 diffusion. Moreover, to further encourage O2 diffusion, a bio&#8208;inspired breathable cathode with progressively branching channels that balances between O2 passage and reaction is 3D printed. This elaborated 3D electrode allows a sodium&#8208;oxygen cell to deliver an impressive discharging current density of up to 4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and an output power of 8.4&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, giving rise to an outstanding capacity of 18.4 mAh cm&#8722;2. The unraveled mystery of oxygen delivery enabled by 3D printing points to a valuable roadmap for the rational design of metal&#8208;air batteries toward practical applications.

The unraveled mystery of oxygen delivery enabled by 3D printing points to a valuable roadmap for the rational design of metal-air batteries toward practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Establishing Multiple&#8208;Order Built&#8208;in Electric Fields Within Heterojunctions to Achieve Photocarrier Spatial Separation</title>

Abstract
Hybridizing two hetero&#8208;components to construct a built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) at the interface represents a significant strategy for facilitating charge separation in carbon dioxide (CO2)&#8208;photoreduction. However, the unidirectional nature of BIEFs formed by various low&#8208;dimensional materials poses challenges in adequately segregating the photogenerated carriers produced in bulk. In this study, leveraging zinc oxide (ZnO) nanodisks, we employed a sulfurization reaction to fabricate Z&#8208;scheme ZnO/zinc sulfide (ZnS) heterojunctions featuring a multiple&#8208;order BIEF. These heterojunctions revealed distinctive interfacial structures characterized by two semi&#8208;coherent phase boundaries. The cathodoluminescence two&#8208;dimensional maps and density functional theory calculation results demonstrated that the direction of the multiple&#8208;order BIEF spanned from ZnS to ZnO. This directional alignment significantly fosters the spatial separation of photogenerated holes within ZnS nanoparticles and enhances CO2&#8208;to&#8208;carbon monoxide photoreduction performance (3811.7&#160;&#949;mol h&#8211;1&#160;g&#8211;1). Our findings present a novel pathway for structurally designing BIEFs within heterojunctions, while providing fresh insights into the migratory behavior of photogenerated carriers across interfaces.

         <title>Reorganizing Helmholtz Adsorption Plane Enables Sodium Layered&#8208;Oxide Cathode Beyond High Oxidation Limits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sodium layered&#8208;oxides (NaxTMO2) sustain severe interfacial stability issues when subjected to battery applications. Particularly at high potential, the oxidation limits including transition metal dissolution and SEI reformation are intertwined upon the cathode, resulting in poor cycle ability. Herein, by rearranging the complex and structure of Helmholtz absorption plane adjacent to NaxTMO2 cathodes, the mechanism of constructing stable cathode/electrolyte interphase to push up oxidation limits is clarified. The strong absorbent fluorinated anions replace the solvents into the inner Helmholtz plane, thereby reorganizing the Helmholtz absorption structure and spontaneously inducing an anion&#8208;dominated interphase to envelop more active sites for layered oxides. More importantly, such multi&#8208;component cathode/electrolyte interphase proves effective for long&#8208;term durability of a series of manganese&#8208;based oxide cathodes, which achieves 1500&#8208;cycles lifetime against high oxidation voltage limit beyond 4.3&#160;V. This work unravels the key role of breaking high&#8208;oxidation limits in attaining higher energy density of layered&#8208;oxide systems.

         <title>Restructuring Electrolyte Solvation by a Versatile Diluent Toward Beyond 99.9% Coulombic Efficiency of Sodium Plating/Stripping at Ultralow Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The reversible and durable operation of sodium metal batteries at low temperatures (LT) is essential for cold&#8208;climate applications but is plagued by dendritic Na plating and unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). Current Coulombic efficiencies of sodium plating/stripping at LT fall far below 99.9%, representing a significant performance gap yet to be filled. Here, we efficiently reconfigure the solvation structure of the conventional 1&#160;M NaPF6 in diglyme electrolyte by facile cyclic ether (1,3&#8208;dioxolane, DOL) dilution. DOL diluents help shield the Na+&#8208;PF6&#8722; Coulombic interaction and intermolecular forces of diglyme, leading to anomalously high Na+&#8208;ion conductivity. Besides, DOL participates in the solvation sheath and weakens the chelation of Na+ by diglyme for facilitated desolvation. More importantly, it promotes concentrated electron cloud distribution around PF6&#8722; in the solvates and promotes their preferential decomposition. A desired inorganic&#8208;rich SEI is generated with compositional uniformity, high ionic conductivity, and high Young's modulus. Consequently, a record&#8208;high Coulombic efficiency over 99.9% is achieved at an ultralow temperature of &#8722;55&#176;C, and a 1&#8208;Ah capacity pouch cell of initial anode&#8208;free sodium metal battery retains 95% of the first discharge capacity over 100 cycles at &#8722;25&#176;C. This study thus provides new insights for formulating electrolytes toward increased Na reversibility at LT.

         <title>Highly Efficient Monolithic Perovskite/Perovskite/Silicon Triple&#8208;Junction Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap metal halide perovskites have demonstrated promise in multi&#8208;junction photovoltaic (PV) cells. However, photoinduced phase segregation and the resultant low open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) have greatly limited the PV performance of perovskite&#8208;based multi&#8208;junction devices. Here, we report a alloying strategy to achieve uniform distribution of triple cations and halides in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites by doping Rb+ and Cl&#8722; with small ionic radii, which effectively suppresses halide phase segregation while promoting the homogenization of surface potential. Based on this strategy, a Voc of 1.33&#160;V was obtained from single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells, and a VOC approaching 3.0&#160;V and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.0% (obtained from reverse scan direction, certified efficiency: 24.19%) on an 1.04&#8208;cm2 photoactive area could be achieved in a perovskite/perovskite/c&#8208;Si triple&#8208;junction tandem cell, where the certification efficiency and stabilized power output (SPO) are by far the greatest PV performance of perovskite&#8208;based triple&#8208;junction tandem solar cells. This work overcomes the performance deadlock of perovskite&#8208;based triple&#8208;junction tandem cells by setting a materials&#8208;by&#8208;design paradigm.

         <title>Mitochondrial Localized In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly Reprogramming Tumor Immune and Metabolic Microenvironment for Enhanced Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The inherent immune and metabolic tumor microenvironment (TME) of most solid tumors adversely affect the antitumor efficacy of various treatments, which is an urgent issue to be solved in clinical cancer therapy. In this study, a mitochondrial localized in situ self&#8208;assembly system is constructed to remodel the TME by improving immunogenicity and disrupting the metabolic plasticity of cancer cells. The peptide&#8208;based drug delivery system can be pre&#8208;assembled into nano&#8208;micelles in vitro and form functional nanofibers on mitochondria through a cascade&#8208;responsive process involving reductive release, targeted enrichment, and in situ self&#8208;assembly. The organelle&#8208;specific in situ self&#8208;assembly amplifies the threshold effect of mitophagy by switching the role of mitophagy from pro&#8208;survival to pro&#8208;death, which finally induces intense endoplasmic reticulum stress and atypical type II immunogenic cell death. Disintegration of the mitochondrial ultrastructure also impedes the metabolic plasticity of tumor cells, which greatly promots the immunosuppresive TME remodeling into an immunostimulatory TME. Ultimately, the mitochondrial localized in situ self&#8208;assembly system effectively suppresses tumor metastases, and converts cold tumors into hot tumors with enhanced sensitivity to radiotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade therapy. This study offers a universal strategy for spatiotemporally controlling the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly on sub&#8208;organelles to determine cancer cell fate and enhance cancer therapy.

         <title>Dynamic Behavior of Spatially Confined Sn Clusters and its Application in Highly Efficient Sodium Storage with High Initial Coulombic Efficiency</title>

Abstract
Advanced battery electrodes require a cautious design of microscale particles with built&#8208;in nanoscale features to exploit the advantages of both micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;particles relative to their performance attributes. Herein, we reveal the dynamic behavior of nanosized Sn clusters and their host pores in carbon nanofibers (CNFs) during sodiation and desodiation using a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 3D electron microscopic reconstruction technique. For the first time, the anomalous expansion of Sn clusters after desodiation is observed owing to the aggregation of clusters/single atoms. Pore connectivity is retained despite the anomalous expansion, suggesting inhibition of solid electrolyte interface formation in the sub&#8208;2&#8208;nm pores. Taking advantage of the built&#8208;in nanoconfinement feature, the CNF film with nanometer&#8208;sized interconnected pores hosting Sn clusters (&#8764;2&#160;nm) enables high utilization (95% at a high rate of 1 A g&#8722;1) of Sn active sites while maintaining an improved initial Coulombic efficiency of 87%. Our findings provide insights into electrochemical reactions in a confined space and a guiding principle in electrode design for battery applications.

&lt;p&gt;Advanced battery electrodes require a cautious design of microscale particles with built-in nanoscale features to exploit the advantages of both micro- and nano-particles relative to their performance attributes. Herein, we reveal the dynamic behavior of nanosized Sn clusters and their host pores in carbon nanofibers (CNFs) during sodiation and desodiation using a state-of-the-art 3D electron microscopic reconstruction technique. For the first time, the anomalous expansion of Sn clusters after desodiation is observed owing to the aggregation of clusters/single atoms. Pore connectivity is retained despite the anomalous expansion, suggesting inhibition of solid electrolyte interface formation in the sub-2-nm pores. Taking advantage of the built-in nanoconfinement feature, the CNF film with nanometer-sized interconnected pores hosting Sn clusters (&#8764;2&#160;nm) enables high utilization (95% at a high rate of 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) of Sn active sites while maintaining an improved initial Coulombic efficiency of 87%.

         <title>Zeolitic Imidazolate&#8208;Framework&#8208;Engineered Heterointerface Catalysis for the Construction of Plant&#8208;Wearable Sensors</title>

Abstract
Plant&#8208;wearable sensors provide real&#8208;time information that enable pesticide inputs to be finely tuned and play critical roles in precision agriculture. However, tracking pesticide information in living plants remains a formidable challenge owing to inadequate shape adaptabilities and low in&#8208;field sensor sensitivities. In this study, we designed plant&#8208;wearable hydrogel discs by embedding a dual&#8208;shelled upconversion&#8208;nanoparticles@zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate&#8208;framework@polydopamine (UCNPs@ZIF@PDA) composite in double&#8208;network hydrogels to deliver on&#8208;site pesticide&#8208;residue information. Benefiting from the enzyme&#8208;mimetic catalytic activity of ZIFs and enzyme triggered&#8208;responsive property of PDA shell, the hydrogel discs are endowed with high sensing sensitivity toward 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenoxyacetic acid pesticide at the nanogram per milliliter level via boosting fluorescence quenching efficiency. Notably, hydrogel discs mounted on tomato plants exhibited sufficient adaptability to profile dynamic pesticide degradation when used in conjunction with an ImageJ processing algorithm, which is practically applicable. Such hydrogel discs form a noninvasive and low&#8208;cost toolkit for the on&#8208;site acquisition of pesticide information, thereby contributing to the precise management of the health status of a plant and the judicious development of precision agriculture.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Electrochemical Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Yolk&#8208;Shell Nanocoils for Exceptional Photocatalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Multi&#8208;yolk&#8208;shell nanostructures have garnered significant interest in various photocatalysis applications such as water splitting and waste treatment. Nonetheless, the complexity and rigorous conditions for the synthesis have hindered their widespread implementation. This study presents a one&#8208;step electrochemical strategy for synthesizing multi&#8208;yolk&#8208;shell nanocoils (mYSNC), wherein multiple cores of noble metal nanoparticles, such as Au, are embedded within the hollow coil&#8208;shaped FePO4 shell structures, mitigating the challenges posed by conventional methods. By capitalizing on the dissimilar dissolution rates of bimetallic alloy nanocoils in an electrochemically programmed solution, we successfully fabricate nanocoils of different shapes and materials, including two variations of mYSNCs. The resulting Au&#8208;FePO4 mYSNCs exhibit exceptional photocatalytic performance for environmental remediation, demonstrating up to 99% degradation of methylene blue molecules within 50&#160;min and 95% degradation of tetracycline within 100&#160;min under ultraviolet&#8208;visible light source. This remarkable performance can be attributed to the abundant electrochemical active sites, internal voids facilitating efficient light harvesting with coil morphology, amplified localized surface plasmon resonance at the plasmonic nanoparticle&#8208;semiconductor interface, and effective band engineering. The innovative approach utilizing bimetallic alloys demonstrates precise geometric control and design of intricate multicomponent hybrid composites, showcasing the potential for developing versatile hollow nanomaterials for catalytic applications.

         <title>A Microphase&#8208;Separated Design Toward An All&#8208;Round Ionic Hydrogel with Discriminable and Anti&#8208;Disturbance Multisensory Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Stretchable ionic hydrogels with superior all&#8208;round properties that can detect multimodal sensations with high discriminability to decouple multiple stimuli and high robustness against external disturbances are highly required for artificial electronic skin applications. However, some of the critical material parameters exhibit intrinsic tradeoffs with each other for most ionic hydrogels. Here, we demonstrate a microphase&#8208;separated hydrogel design by combining three strategies: (1) the use of a low crosslinker/monomer ratio to obtain highly entangled polymer chains as the first network; (2) the introduction of zwitterions into the first network; (3) the synthesis of an ultrasoft polyelectrolyte as the second network. This approach creates an all&#8208;round elastic ionic hydrogel with a skin&#8208;like low Young's modulus (&lt; 60&#160;kPa), large stretchability (&gt; 900%), high resilience (&gt; 95%), low hysteresis (&lt; 5%), unique strain&#8208;stiffening behavior, excellent fatigue tolerance, high ionic conductivity (&gt; 2.0 S/m), and anti&#8208;freezing capability, which were not achieved with previous ionic hydrogels. These comprehensive properties allow the ionic hydrogel to operate as a stretchable multimodal sensor that can detect and decouple multiple stimuli (temperature, pressure, and proximity) with both high discriminability and sensitivity. It also shows strong sensing robustness against strains and temperature perturbations. The ionic hydrogel sensor exhibits great potential for intelligent electronic skin applications such as reliable health monitoring and accurate object identification.

         <title>CO2 Enrichment Boosts Highly Selective Infrared&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Conversion to CH4 By UiO&#8208;66/Co9S8 Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to high&#8208;value chemicals is an attractive approach to mitigate climate change, but it remains a great challenge to produce a specific product selectively by low&#8208;energy IR light. To meet this challenge, UiO&#8208;66/Co9S8 composite is designed to couple the advantages of metallic photocatalysts and porous CO2 adsorbers for IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion. The metallic nature of Co9S8 endows UiO&#8208;66/Co9S8 with exceptional IR light absorption, while UiO&#8208;66 dramatically enhances its CO2 affinity. Notably, finite&#8208;element method simulations reveal the porous structure of UiO&#8208;66 enriches local CO2 concentration around Co9S8. As a result, Co9S8 or UiO&#8208;66 alone doesn't show observable IR&#8208;light photocatalytic activity, whereas UiO&#8208;66/Co9S8 reveals exceptional activity. The CH4 evolution rate over UiO&#8208;66/Co9S8 reaches 25.7&#160;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with ca. 100% selectivity under IR light irradiation, outperforming most reported catalysts under similar reaction conditions. The XAFS spectra verify the presence of two distinct Co sites and confirm the existence of metallic Co&#8208;Co bond in Co9S8. Energy diagrams analysis and fs&#8208;TA spectra manifest that CO2 reduction mainly occurs on Co9S8 for UiO&#8208;66/Co9S8, while DFT calculations demonstrate that high&#8208;electron&#8208;density Co1 sites are the key active sites, possessing lower energy barriers for further protonation of *CO, leading to the ultra&#8208;high selectivity towards CH4.

         <title>Ultraclean Interface of Metal Chalcogenides with Metal Through Confined Interfacial Chalcogenization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Acquisition of defect&#8208;free transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) channels with clean heterojunctions has been a critical issue in production of TMD&#8208;based functional electronic devices. Conventional approaches have synthesized high quality TMDs and transferred them onto a target substrate, and then applied the typical device fabrication processes. Unfortunately, those processes cause physical defects and chemical contamination in the TMD channels. Here, we propose a novel synthetic process of TMD thin films, named confined interfacial chalcogenization (CIC). In the proposed synthesis, a uniform TMD layer is created at the Au/transition metal (TM) interface by diffusion of chalcogen through the grain boundaries of the Au layer and reaction of chalcogen with the underlying TM. CIC allows for ultraclean heterojunctions with the metals, rapid synthesis of homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;structured TMDs, and in&#8208;situ TMD channel formation in the last stage of device fabrication. We reveal the mechanism of TMD growth by the TM&#8208;accelerated chalcogen diffusion, epitaxial growth of TMD on Au(111), and dependence of the growth rate on material species of chalcogen and TM. We demonstrate a 100% production yield of TMD&#8208;based vertical memristors which exhibit excellent statistical concordance in device performance enabled by the ultraclean heterojunctions and superior uniformity in thickness and chemical composition. CIC proposed in this study represents a breakthrough in the synthesis of TMD thin films and also in the TMD&#8208;based electronic device fabrication, marking a substantial step towards practical next&#8208;generation integrated electronics.

         <title>Bioinspired Tumor Calcification&#8208;Guided Early Diagnosis and Eradication of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tumor calcification was found to be associated with the benign prognostic, and which showed considerable promise as a somewhat predictive index of the tumor response clinically. However, calcification is still a missing area in clinical cancer treatment. We propose a specific strategy for inducing tumor calcification through the synergy of CaO2&#8208;based microspheres and transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The persistent calcium stress in situ specifically leads to powerful tumor calcioptosis, resulting in diffuse calcification and a high&#8208;density shadow on computed tomography (CT) that enables clear localization the in vivo tumor site and partial delineation of tumor&#160;margins in an orthotopic HCC rabbit model. This osmotic calcification could facilitate tumor clinical diagnosis, which is of great significance in differentiating tumor response during early follow&#8208;up periods. Proteome and phosphoproteome analysis identified that calreticulin (CALR) is a crucial target protein involved in tumor calcioptosis. Further fluorescence molecular imaging analysis also indicated that CALR can be used as a prodromal marker of calcification to predict tumor response at an earlier stage in different preclinical rodent models. Our findings suggest that upregulated CALR in association with tumor calcification, which might be broadly useful for quick visualization of tumor response.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Triggered Cascade Therapy: A NIR&#8208;II AIE Luminogen Collaborating with Nitric Oxide Facilitates Efficient Collagen Depletion for Boosting Pancreatic Cancer Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional theranostic liposome (Lip&#8208;DTI/NO) by integration of a NIR&#8208;II AIE luminogen DTITBT and GSH or heat&#8208;responsive NO donor S&#8208;nitroso&#8208;N&#8208;acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) is constructed and demonstrated the NIR light&#8208;triggered in situ generation of ONOO&#8722; for tumor stroma depletion and enhanced drug delivery, and consequently boosting pancreatic cancer phototherapy.








Abstract
The dense extracellular matrix (ECM) in the pancreatic cancer severely hampers the penetration of nanodrugs, which causes inferior therapeutic efficacy. To address this issue, a multifunctional liposome, namely, Lip&#8208;DTI/NO, integrating a type&#8208;I photosensitizer DTITBT with glutathione (GSH) or heat&#8208;responsive nitric oxide (NO) donor S&#8208;nitroso&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;penicillamine (SNAP) is constructed to deplete the tumor ECM, leading to enhanced drug delivery and consequently improved phototherapy. The loaded DTITBT possesses multiple functions including NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging, efficient superoxide radical (O2&#8226;&#8722;) generation and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency, making it feasible for precisely pinpointing the tumor in the phototherapy process. Responding to the intracellular overexpressed glutathione or heat produced by photothermal effect of DTITBT, NO can be released from SNAP. Upon 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, Lip&#8208;DTI/NO could selectively induce in situ generation of peroxynitrite anion (ONOO&#8722;) in tumor after cascade processes including O2&#8226;&#8722; production, GSH or heat&#8208;triggered NO release, and rapid reaction between O2&#8226;&#8722; and NO. The generated ONOO&#8722; could activate the expression of endogenous matrix metalloproteinases which could efficiently digest collagen of tumor ECM, thus facilitating enhanced penetration and accumulation of Lip&#8208;DTI/NO in tumor. In vivo evaluation demonstrates the notable therapeutic efficacy via ONOO&#8722;&#8208;potentiated synergistic photodynamic&#8208;photothermal therapies on both subcutaneous and orthotopic pancreatic cancer model.

         <title>Mismatched Refractive Index Strategy for Fabricating Laser&#8208;Driven Wood Diffusers from Bulk Wood for Illumination Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laser&#8208;driven wood diffusers are prepared by impregnating porous delignified wood with poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate with a mismatched refractive index to enhance scattering. The fabrication of laser&#8208;driven wood diffusers is simple, environment&#8208;friendly, and rapid. This low&#8208;cost and highly efficient strategy can provide substantial energy savings and a basis for the application of natural wood in emerging laser diode lighting technology.








Abstract
Laser&#8208;diode&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lighting is primarily used in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art illumination systems. However, these systems rely on light&#8208;converting inorganic phosphors, which have low quantum efficiencies and complex manufacturing conditions. In this study, a mismatched refractive index strategy is proposed to directly convert natural bulk wood into a laser&#8208;driven wood diffuser using a simple delignification and polymer infiltration method. The resulting material has the potential to be used in laser&#8208;driven diffuse illumination applications. The optical performance of the laser&#8208;driven wood diffuser is optimized by changing the density of natural wood. The optimal coefficient of illuminance variation of the wood diffuser is as low as 17.7%, which is significantly lower than that of commercial diffusers. The illuminance uniformity is larger than 0.9, which is significantly higher than the ISO requirements for indoor workplace lighting. The laser damage threshold is 7.9&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;2, which is considerably higher than those of the substrates of commercially available phosphors. Furthermore, the optimized wood diffuser exhibits outstanding mechanical properties, excellent thermal stability, tolerance to harsh environmental conditions, and low speckle contrast. These results show that the laser&#8208;driven wood diffuser is a promising laser&#8208;color converter that is suitable for indoor, long&#8208;distance outdoor, undersea, and other high&#8208;luminance laser lighting applications.

         <title>New Nanophotonics Approaches for Enhancing the Efficiency and Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review begins by introducing the fundamental photophysics of plasmonic metal nanostructures, including radiative and nonradiative decay processes of surface plasmons, and the mechanism of light harvesting and trapping by photonic dielectric microstructures. It then provides a systematic review on the design, implementation, and benefits of these nanophotonic structures for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Over the past decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has experienced a remarkable ascent, soaring from 3.8% in 2009 to a remarkable record of 26.1% in 2023. Many recent approaches for improving PSC performance employ nanophotonic technologies, from light harvesting and thermal management to the manipulation of charge carrier dynamics. Plasmonic nanoparticles and arrayed dielectric nanostructures have been applied to tailor the light absorption, scattering, and conversion, as well as the heat dissipation within PSCs to improve their PCE and operational stability. In this review, it is begin with a concise introduction to define the realm of nanophotonics by focusing on the nanoscale interactions between light and surface plasmons or dielectric photonic structures. Prevailing strategies that utilize resonance&#8208;enhanced light&#8211;matter interactions for boosting the PCE and stability of PSCs from light trapping, carrier transportation, and thermal management perspectives are then elaborated, and the resultant practical applications, such as semitransparent photovoltaics, colored PSCs, and smart perovskite windows are discussed. Finally, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nanophotonic paradigms in PSCs are reviewed, and the benefits of these approaches in improving the aesthetic effects and energy&#8208;saving character of PSC&#8208;integrated buildings are highlighted.

         <title>An NIR&#8208;II Excitable AIE Small Molecule with Multimodal Phototheranostic Features for Orthotopic Breast Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NIR&#8208;II light activatable AIE small molecule with multimodal phototheranostic features is constructed for the first time by taking full use of the advantage of AIEgens in single molecule&#8208;facilitated versatility, as well as synchronously maximizing the molecular donor&#8208;acceptor strength and conformational distortion. This molecule actualizes prominent NIR&#8208;II FLI&#8208;PAI&#8208;PTI trimodal imaging&#8208;guided PDT&#8208;PTT synergistic therapy of orthotopic mouse breast tumors.








Abstract
One&#8208;for&#8208;all phototheranostics, referring to a single component simultaneously exhibiting multiple optical imaging and therapeutic modalities, has attracted significant attention due to its excellent performance in cancer treatment. Benefitting from the superiority in balancing the diverse competing energy dissipation pathways, aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) are proven to be ideal templates for constructing one&#8208;for&#8208;all multimodal phototheranostic agents. However, to this knowledge, the all&#8208;round AIEgens that can be triggered by a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#160;nm) light have not been reported. Given the deep tissue penetration and high maximum permissible exposure of the NIR&#8208;II excitation light, herein, this work reports for the first time an NIR&#8208;II laser excitable AIE small molecule (named BETT&#8208;2) with multimodal phototheranostic features by taking full use of the advantage of AIEgens in single molecule&#8208;facilitated versatility as well as synchronously maximizing the molecular donor&#8208;acceptor strength and conformational distortion. As formulated into nanoparticles (NPs), the high performance of BETT&#8208;2 NPs in NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;driven fluorescence&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic&#8208;photothermal synergistic therapy of orthotopic mouse breast tumors is fully demonstrated by the systematic in vitro and in vivo evaluations. This work offers valuable insights for developing NIR&#8208;II laser activatable one&#8208;for&#8208;all phototheranostic systems.

         <title>Highly Ordered Eutectic Mesostructures via Template&#8208;Directed Solidification Within Thermally Engineered Templates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Template&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly of solidifying eutectics results in emergence of unique microstructures due to diffusion constraints and thermal gradients imposed by the template. Here, we demonstrate the importance of selecting the template material based on its conductivity to control heat transfer between the template and the solidifying eutectic and thus the thermal gradients near the solidification front. Simulations elucidate the relationship between the thermal properties of the eutectic and template and the resultant microstructure. The overarching finding is that templates with low thermal conductivities are generally advantageous for forming highly organized microstructures. When we use electrochemically porosified silicon pillars (thermal conductivity &lt; 0.3 Wm&#8722;1K&#8722;1) as the template into which an AgCl&#8208;KCl eutectic is solidified, 99% of the unit cells in the solidified structure exhibit the same pattern. In contrast, when higher thermal conductivity crystalline silicon pillars (&#8764;100 Wm&#8722;1K&#8722;1) are utilized, the expected pattern is only present in 50% of the unit cells. The thermally engineered template resulted in mesostructures with tunable optical properties and reflectances nearly identical to the simulated reflectances of perfect structures, indicating highly ordered patterns are formed over large areas. Our work highlights the importance of controlling heat flows in template&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly of eutectics.

         <title>Boosting the performance of PEDOT:PSS based electronics via ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The conducting polymer poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) offers superior advantages in electronics due to its remarkable combination of high electrical conductivity, excellent biocompatibility, and mechanical flexibility, making it an ideal material among electronic skin, health monitoring, and energy harvesting and storage. Nevertheless, pristine PEDOT:PSS films exhibit limitations in terms of both low conductivity and stretchability, while conventional processing techniques cannot enhance these properties simultaneously, facing the dilemma that highly conductive interconnected PEDOT:PSS domains are susceptible to tensile strain. Via modifying PEDOT:PSS with ionic liquids (ILs), not only a synergistic enhancement of the electrical and mechanical properties can be achieved, but also the requirements for the printable bioelectronic are satisfied. In this comprehensive review, we have undertaken the task of providing a thorough examination of the mechanisms and applications of ILs as modifiers for PEDOT:PSS. First, the theoretical mechanisms governing the interactions between ILs and PEDOT:PSS is discussed detailly. Then, we have reviewed the enhanced properties and the elucidation of the underlying mechanisms achieved through the incorporation of ILs. Next, specific applications of ILs&#8208;modified PEDOT:PSS relevant to bioelectronic devices are presented. Lastly, we offer a concise summary and engage in a discussion regarding the opportunities and challenges in this exciting field.

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable Li2S Cathodes Enabled by an In Situ&#8208;Formed Li+ Conductor for Graphite&#8208;Li2S Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ formed Li+ conductor (Li4SnS4) layer is directly constructed on commercial Li2S particles to obtain air&#8208;stable, shuttle&#8208;free, and fast&#8208;redox Li2S cathodes for graphite&#8208;Li2S batteries.








Abstract
Using Li2S cathodes instead of S cathodes presents an opportunity to pair them with Li&#8208;free anodes (e.g., graphite), thereby circumventing anode&#8208;related issues, such as poor reversibility and safety, encountered in Li&#8208;S batteries. However, the moisture&#8208;sensitive nature of Li2S causes the release of hazardous H2S and the formation of insulative by&#8208;products, increasing the manufacturing difficulty and adversely affecting cathode performance. Here, Li4SnS4, a Li+ conductor that is air&#8208;stable according to the hard&#8211;soft acid&#8211;base principle, is formed in situ and uniformly on Li2S particles because Li2S itself participates in Li4SnS4 formation. When exposed to air (20% relative humidity), the protective Li4SnS4 layer maintains its components and structure, thus contributing to the enhanced stability of the Li2S@Li4SnS4 composite. In addition, the Li4SnS4 layer can accelerate the sluggish conversion of Li2S because of its favorable interfacial charge transfer, and continuously confine lithium polysulfides owing to its integrity during electrochemical processes. A graphite&#8208;Li2S pouch cell containing a Li2S@Li4SnS4 cathode is constructed, which shows stable cyclability with 97% capacity retention after 100 cycles. Hence, combining a desirable air&#8208;stable Li2S cathode and a highly reversible Li&#8208;free configuration offers potential practical applications of graphite&#8208;Li2S full cells.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cr&#8208;induced in situ reconstruction strategy is proposed to construct robust FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts for highly stable oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysis. Benefiting from its desired electronic states, the FeCoNiMnCr HEA&#8208;HEO catalyst exhibits negligible activity loss under harsh industrial condition (6&#160;m KOH and 85&#160;&#176;C) at a current density of 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 500&#160;h. 








Abstract
Despite of urgent needs for highly stable and efficient electrochemical water&#8208;splitting devices, it remains extremely challenging to acquire highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under harsh industrial conditions. Here, a successful in situ synthesis of FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts via a Cr&#8208;induced spontaneous reconstruction strategy is reported, and it is demonstrated that they deliver excellent ultrastable OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 320&#160;mV at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a negligible activity loss after maintaining at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 240&#160;h. Remarkably, the heterocatalyst holds outstanding long&#8208;term stability under harsh industrial condition of 6&#160;m KOH and 85&#160;&#176;C at a current density of as high as 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 over 500&#160;h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of the HEA&#8208;HEO heterostructure can provide electroactive sites possessing robust valence states to guarantee long&#8208;term stable OER process, leading to the enhancement of electroactivity. The findings of such highly stable OER heterocatalysts under industrial conditions offer a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for practical industrial water splitting.

         <title>Dynamic Li+ Capture through Ligand&#8208;Chain Interaction for the Regeneration of Depleted LiFePO4 Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of the ligand chain within the Zn complex dynamically modulates the variational structure, enlarging the main framework of LFP and expediting the de&#8208;intercalation of Li+. This process revitalizes the composition, structure, and electrochemical performance of LFP, restoring them to levels comparable to that of newly produced LFP even under severe degradation conditions during the operation of regenerated batteries.








Abstract
After application in electric vehicles, spent LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries are typically decommissioned. Traditional recycling methods face economic and environmental constraints. Therefore, direct regeneration has emerged as a promising alternative. However, irreversible phase changes can significantly hinder the efficiency of the regeneration process owing to structural degradation. Moreover, improper storage and treatment practices can lead to metamorphism, further complicating the regeneration process. In this study, a sustainable recovery method is proposed for the electrochemical repair of LFP batteries. A ligand&#8208;chain Zn&#8208;complex (ZnDEA) is utilized as a structural regulator, with its &#9472;NH&#9472; group alternatingly facilitating the binding of preferential transition metal ions (Fe3+ during charging and Zn2+ during discharging). This dynamic coordination ability helps to modulate volume changes within the recovered LFP framework. Consequently, the recovered LFP framework can store more Li&#8208;ions, enhance phase transition reversibility between LFP and FePO4 (FP), modify the initial Coulombic efficiency, and reduce polarization voltage differences. The recovered LFP cells exhibit excellent capacity retention of 96.30% after 1500 cycles at 2&#160;C. The ligand chain repair mechanism promotes structural evolution to facilitate ion migration, providing valuable insights into the targeted ion compensation for environmentally friendly recycling in practical applications.

         <title>Features of Anisotropic Drug Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the current methods are reviewed to introduce anisotropy to micron sized particles or capsules, including non&#8208;spherical shape, loading with various therapeutic cargo, variable physical properties, controlling directional motion, and making Janus particles. The advantages of combining different anisotropy in one entity for delivery and common problems for fabrication are under discussion.








Abstract
Natural materials are anisotropic. Delivery systems occurring in nature, such as viruses, blood cells, pollen, and many others, do have anisotropy, while delivery systems made artificially are mostly isotropic. There is apparent complexity in engineering anisotropic particles or capsules with micron and submicron sizes. Nevertheless, some promising examples of how to fabricate particles with anisotropic shapes or having anisotropic chemical and/or physical properties are developed. Anisotropy of particles, once they face biological systems, influences their behavior. Internalization by the cells, flow in the bloodstream, biodistribution over organs and tissues, directed release, and toxicity of particles regardless of the same chemistry are all reported to be factors of anisotropy of delivery systems. Here, the current methods are reviewed to introduce anisotropy to particles or capsules, including loading with various therapeutic cargo, variable physical properties primarily by anisotropic magnetic properties, controlling directional motion, and making Janus particles. The advantages of combining different anisotropy in one entity for delivery and common problems and limitations for fabrication are under discussion.

         <title>Ferroics in Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Perovskites: Fundamentals, Design Strategies, and Implementation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites are emerging as novel material paradigms with intrinsic ferroic behaviors. This review summarizes the fundamentals and design strategies of ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, and ferromagnetism in hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites, and also discusses the underlying mechanisms of their multiferroic and magnetoelectric properties. The potential implementation in multilevel ferroic modulation, chirality as well as spin orbitronics is also presented.








Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) afford highly versatile structure design and lattice dimensionalities; thus, they are actively researched as material platforms for the tailoring of ferroic behaviors. Unlike single&#8208;phase organic or inorganic materials, the interlayer coupling between organic and inorganic components in HOIPs allows the modification of strain and symmetry by chirality transfer or lattice distortion, thereby enabling the coexistence of ferroic orders. This review focuses on the principles for engineering one or multiple ferroic orders in HOIPs, and the conditions for achieving multiferroicity and magnetoelectric properties. The prospects of multilevel ferroic modulation,&#160;chiral spin textures,&#160;and spin orbitronics in HOIPs are also presented.

         <title>Titanium Multi&#8208;Topology Metamaterials with Exceptional Strength</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thin&#8208;plate lattice (TPL) is seamlessly integrated into the inner space of a hollow&#8208;strut lattice (HSL) as a multi&#8208;topology metamaterial for uniform stress distribution. The LPBF&#8208;fabricated Ti&#8208;6Al&#8208;4V TP&#8208;HSL achieves relative yield strength that well surpasses the empirical upper limit for all cellular metals, while its absolute yield strength far exceeds that of the strongest commercial magnesium alloy of comparable density.








Abstract
Additively manufactured metamaterials are architectured cellular materials that can be engineered through structural innovations to achieve unusual mechanical and multifunctional properties. Among these, hollow&#8208;strut lattice (HSL) metamaterials have proven to allow outstanding structural efficiency, with a multifunctional architecture ideal for lightweight, biomedical, microfluidic, and thermal engineering. To capitalize on their structural efficiency and significantly extend their mechanical envelope, a thin&#8208;plate lattice topology is seamlessly integrated into the inner hollow space of an HSL topology. This integration serves a dual purpose: to radically enhance the resistance of the irregular HSL nodes to deformation and to uniformly distribute the applied stresses in the new topology for unparalleled strength. Fabricated in titanium alloy Ti&#8208;6Al&#8208;4V with densities of 1.0&#8211;1.8&#160;g cm&#8722;3 , this thin&#8208;plate integrated hollow&#8208;strut lattice (TP&#8208;HSL) metamaterials achieve relative yield strength that well surpasses the empirical upper limit of all cellular metals, including HSL and solid&#8208;strut lattice (SSL) metamaterials made from various metallic alloys. Furthermore, their absolute yield strength drastically exceeds that of magnesium alloys with comparable densities while inheriting the high corrosion resistance, biocompatibility, heat resistance, and other unique attributes of Ti&#8208;6Al&#8208;4V. Titanium multi&#8208;topology metamaterials expand the boundaries of lightweight multifunctional metallic materials.

Abstract
The first synthesis and comprehensive characterization of two vinyl tetrazine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COF), TA&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and TA&#8208;COF&#8208;2, are reported. These materials exhibit high crystallinity and high specific surface areas of 1323 and 1114 m2 g&#8722;1. The COFs demonstrate favorable band positions and narrow band gaps suitable for light&#8208;driven applications. These advantages enable TA&#8208;COFs to act as reusable metal&#8208;free photocatalysts in the arylboronic acids oxidation and light&#8208;induced coupling of benzylamines. In addition, these TA&#8208;COFs show acid sensing capabilities, exhibiting visible and reversible color changes upon exposure to HCl&#160;solution, HCl vapor, and NH3 vapor. Further, the TA&#8208;COFs outperform a wide range of previously reported COF photocathodes. The tetrazine linker in the COF skeleton represents a significant advancement in the field of COF synthesis, enhancing the separation efficiency of charge carriers during the photoreaction and contributing to their photocathodic properties. TA&#8208;COFs can also degrade 5&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;one (NTO), an insensitive explosive present in industrial wastewater, in 20 min in a sunlight&#8208;driven photocatalytic process; thus, revealing dual functionality of the protonated TA&#8208;COFs as both photodegradation and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts. This pioneering work opens new avenues for harnessing the potential of the tetrazine linker in COF&#8208;based materials, facilitating advances in catalysis, sensing, and other related fields.

         <title>Angular Engineering Strategy for Enhanced Surface Nonlinear Frequency Conversion in Centrosymmetric Topological Semimetal HfGe0.92Te</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface nonlinearity is essential for integrated photonics and micro/nano optoelectronics. Topological semimetal HfGe0.92Te possesses a giant surface second&#8208;order nonlinear susceptibility and exhibits unprecedented second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) based on an angular engineering strategy. Moreover, this high&#8208;performance SHG response is observed ranging from the visible to deep&#8208;UV regions because of the wide linear dispersion region around the Dirac points.








Abstract
Surface nonlinear optics are essential for developments in integrated photonics and micro/nano optoelectronics. However, the nonlinear optical conversion efficiency on a surface is restricted by the finite nonlinear susceptibility of matter and the intrinsic atomic&#8208;layered interaction length between light and matter. In this work, based on an angular engineering strategy, it is demonstrated that the centrosymmetric topological semimetal HfGe0.92Te crystal has a giant and anisotropic surface second&#8208;order nonlinear susceptibility up to 5535 &#177; 308&#160;pm V&#8722;1 and exhibits efficient and unprecedented second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG). The maximum optical conversion efficiency is found to be up to 3.75&#8240;, which is 104 times higher than that obtained from a silicon surface. Because of the linear dispersion over a wide range of energies around the Dirac points, this high conversion efficiency can be maintained with SHG wavelengths ranging from the visible region (779&#160;nm) to the deep&#8208;UV region (257.5&#160;nm). This study can facilitate the development of topological photonics and integrated nonlinear photonics based on topological semimetals.

         <title>3D Tiled Auxetic Metamaterial: A New Family of Mechanical Metamaterial with High Resilience and Mechanical Hysteresis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
For artificial materials, desired properties often conflict. For example, engineering materials often achieve high energy dissipation by sacrificing resilience and vice versa, or desired auxeticity by losing their isotropy, which limits their performance and applications. To solve these conflicts, a strategy is proposed to create novel mechanical metamaterial via 3D space filling tiles with engaging key&#8208;channel pairs, exemplified via auxetic 3D keyed&#8208;octahedron&#8208;cuboctahedron metamaterials. This metamaterial shows high resilience while achieving large mechanical hysteresis synergistically under large compressive strain. Especially, this metamaterial exhibits ideal isotropy approaching the theoretical limit of isotropic Poisson's ratio,1, as rarely seen in existing 3D mechanical metamaterials. In addition, the new class of metamaterials provide wide tunability on mechanical properties and behaviors, including an unusual coupled auxeticity and twisting behavior under normal compression. The designing methodology is illustrated by the integral of numerical modeling, theoretical analysis, and experimental characterization. The new mechanical metamaterials have broad applications in actuators and dampers, soft robotics, biomedical materials, and engineering materials/systems for energy dissipation.

         <title>Flexible Cages Enable Robust Supramolecular Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Advances in modern industrial technology continue to place stricter demands&#160;on engineering polymeric materials, but simultaneously possessing superior strength and toughness remains a daunting challenge. Herein, we report a pioneering flexible cage&#8208;reinforced supramolecular elastomer (CSE) that exhibits superb robustness, tear resistance, anti&#8208;fatigue, and shape memory properties, achieved by innovatively introducing organic imide cages (OICs) into supramolecular networks. Intriguingly, extremely small amounts of OICs make the elastomer stronger, significantly improving mechanical strength (85.0&#160;MPa; &#8764;10&#8208;fold increase) and toughness (418.4&#160;MJ m&#8722;3; &#8764;7&#8208;fold increase). Significantly, we experimentally and theoretically demonstrate the cooperative effect of gradient hydrogen bonds and OICs as flexible nodes, enabling more robust supramolecular networks. In short, our proposed strengthening strategy of adding flexible cages effectively balances the inherent conflict between material strength and toughness, and the prepared CSEs are anticipated to be served in large&#8208;scale devices such as TBMs in the future.

         <title>Recent Advances in Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation Reactions on Copper&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest advances in copper&#8208;based catalysts for sustainable production of valuable fuels and chemicals via electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions are summarized. The rational design of metallic copper, compounds, alloys, composites, and single&#8208;atom catalysts results in efficient electroreduction of substrates to valorized alkenes, alcohols, ammonia, amines, urea, and so on. The current issues and future opportunities in this area are provided.








Abstract
Hydrogenation reactions play a critical role in the synthesis of value&#8208;added products within the chemical industry. Electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) using water as the hydrogen source has emerged as an alternative to conventional thermocatalytic processes for sustainable and decentralized chemical synthesis under mild conditions. Among the various ECH catalysts, copper&#8208;based (Cu&#8208;based) nanomaterials are promising candidates due to their earth&#8208;abundance, unique electronic structure, versatility, and high activity/selectivity. Herein, recent advances in the application of Cu&#8208;based catalysts in ECH reactions for the upgrading of valuable chemicals are systematically analyzed. The unique properties of Cu&#8208;based catalysts in ECH are initially introduced, followed by design strategies to enhance their activity and selectivity. Then, typical ECH reactions on Cu&#8208;based catalysts are presented in detail, including carbon dioxide reduction for multicarbon generation, alkyne&#8208;to&#8208;alkene conversion, selective aldehyde conversion, ammonia production from nitrogen&#8208;containing substances, and amine production from organic nitrogen compounds. In these catalysts, the role of catalyst composition and nanostructures toward different products is focused. The co&#8208;hydrogenation of two substrates (e.g., CO2 and NOxn, SO32&#8211;, etc.) via C&#9472;N, C&#9472;S, and C&#9472;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions are also highlighted. Finally, the critical issues and future perspectives of Cu&#8208;catalyzed ECH are proposed to accelerate the rational development of next&#8208;generation catalysts.

         <dc:description>
Nanopore templates in 2D carbon nitride matrices control the interatomic distances of cooperative Cu single&#8208;atom sites to synergistically enhance eCO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 production via modulation of energy barriers of the rate limiting steps in the reaction pathway.








Abstract
Renewable&#8208;electricity&#8208;powered carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction (eCO2R) to high&#8208;value fuels like methane (CH4) holds the potential to close the carbon cycle at meaningful scales. However, this kinetically staggered 8&#8208;electron multistep reduction suffers from inadequate catalytic efficiency and current density. Atomic Cu&#8208;structures can boost eCO2R&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 selectivity due to enhanced intermediate binding energies (BEs) resulting from favorably shifted d&#8208;band centers. In this work, 2D carbon nitride (CN) matrices, viz. Na&#8208;polyheptazine (PHI) and Li&#8208;polytriazine imides (PTI), are exploited to host Cu&#8211;N2 type single&#8208;atom sites with high density (&#8776;1.5 at%), via a facile metal&#8208;ion exchange process. Optimized Cu loading in nanocrystalline Cu&#8208;PTI maximizes eCO2R&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 performance with Faradaic efficiency (FECH4) of &#8776;68% and a high partial current density of 348&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.84&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. Multi&#8208;Cu substituted N&#8208;appended nanopores in the CN frameworks yield thermodynamically stable quasi&#8208;dual/triple sites with large interatomic distances dictated by the pore dimensions. First&#8208;principles calculations elucidate the relative Cu&#8211;CN cooperative effects between the matrices and how the Cu local environment dictates the adsorbate BEs, density of states, and CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 energy profile landscape. The 9N pores in Cu&#8208;PTI yield cooperative Cu&#8211;Cu sites that synergistically enhance the kinetics of the rate&#8208;limiting steps in the eCO2R&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 pathway.

         <title>How to Build Plasmon&#8208;Driven Molecular Jackhammers that Disassemble Cell Membranes and Cytoskeletons in Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular jackhammers (MJH) are a type of molecular machine driven by a molecular plasmon that converts photons into mechanical energy. The theoretical and experimental underpinnings of these plasmon&#8208;driven motions in molecules are difficult to assess. Here these are quantified through an experimental plasmonicity index method. This method is utilized to understand how to improve plasmon&#8208;driven MJH for permeabilizing cellular membranes.








Abstract
Plasmon&#8208;driven molecular machines with ultrafast motion at the femtosecond scale are effective for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. It is recently shown that cyanine dyes act as molecular jackhammers (MJH) through vibronic (vibrational and electronic mode coupling) driven activation that causes the molecule to stretch longitudinally and axially through concerted whole molecule vibrations. However, the theoretical and experimental underpinnings of these plasmon&#8208;driven motions in molecules are difficult to assess. Here the use of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;activated plasmons in a broad array of MJH that mechanically disassemble membranes and cytoskeletons in human melanoma A375 cells is described. The characteristics of plasmon&#8208;driven molecular mechanical disassembly of supramolecular biological structures are observed and recorded using real&#8208;time fluorescence confocal microscopy. Molecular plasmon resonances in MJH are quantified through a new experimental plasmonicity index method. This is done through the measurement of the UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR spectra in various solvents, and quantification of the optical response as a function of the solvent polarity. Structure&#8208;activity relationships are used to optimize the synthesis of plasmon&#8208;driven MJH, applying them to eradicate human melanoma A375 cells at low lethal concentrations of 75&#160;nm and 80&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 of 730&#160;nm NIR&#8208;light for 10&#160;min.

         <title>3D&#8208;Architected Alkaline&#8208;Earth Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A newly developed approach enabling custom&#8208;made photoresists suited for additive manufacturing using two&#8208;photon lithography is introduced. The approach permits the production of 3D alkaline&#8208;earth perovskite (BaZrO3, CaZrO3, and SrZrO3) microarchitectures with sub&#8208;micrometer precision. The optical properties of such perovskite architectures are investigated using cathodoluminescence and wide&#8208;field photoluminescence emission to understand the defects and determine the photoluminescence lifetimes.








Abstract
3D ceramic architectures are captivating geometrical features with an immense demand in optics. In this work, an additive manufacturing (AM) approach for printing alkaline&#8208;earth perovskite 3D microarchitectures is developed. The approach enables custom&#8208;made photoresists suited for two&#8208;photon lithography, permitting the production of alkaline&#8208;earth perovskite (BaZrO3, CaZrO3, and SrZrO3) 3D structures shaped in the form of octet&#8208;truss lattices, gyroids, or inspired architectures like sodalite zeolite, and C60 buckyballs with micrometric and nanometric feature sizes. Alkaline&#8208;earth perovskite morphological, structural, and chemical characteristics are studied. The optical properties of such perovskite architectures are investigated using cathodoluminescence and wide&#8208;field photoluminescence emission to estimate the lifetime rate and defects in BaZrO3, CaZrO3, and SrZrO3. From a broad perspective, this AM methodology facilitates the production of 3D&#8208;structured mixed oxides. These findings are the first steps toward dimensionally refined high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index ceramics for micro&#8208;optics and other terrains like (photo/electro)catalysis.

         <title>Enantioselective Adsorption on Magnetic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Racemic helical aromatic hydrocarbons are sublimed in vacuo onto ferromagnetic cobalt nanoislands. Spin&#8208; and chirality&#8208;sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy on the single&#8208;molecule scale reveals that molecules of opposite handedness preferentially adsorb on islands with opposite out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetization. Enantioselection occurs in a transiently occupied physisorbed precursor state, suggesting that spin&#8208; and chirality&#8208;sensitive interactions at the van der Waals level play a role.








Abstract
From the beginning of molecular theory, the interplay of chirality and magnetism has intrigued scientists. There is still the question if enantiospecific adsorption of chiral molecules occurs on magnetic surfaces. Enantiomer discrimination was&#160;conjectured to arise from chirality&#8208;induced spin separation within the molecules and exchange interaction with the substrate's magnetization. Here, it is shown that single helical aromatic hydrocarbons undergo enantioselective adsorption on ferromagnetic cobalt surfaces. Spin and chirality sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy reveals that molecules of opposite handedness prefer adsorption onto cobalt islands with opposite out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetization. As mobility ceases in the final chemisorbed state, it is concluded that enantioselection must occur in a physisorbed transient precursor state. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spin&#8208;resolved ab initio simulations support this scenario by refuting enantio&#8208;dependent chemisorption energies. These findings demonstrate that van der Waals interaction should also include spin&#8208;fluctuations which are crucial for molecular magnetochiral&#160;processes.

         <title>Emerging Antiferromagnets for Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiferromagnetic spintronics has gained remarkable development in recent years. In this Perspective, the latest research progress in this field is reviewed. It is emphasized that, distinct from ferromagnets, the richness in complex antiferromagnetic crystal structures is the unique and essential virtue of antiferromagnets that can endow them with exotic properties for spintronics.








Abstract
Antiferromagnets constitute promising contender materials for next&#8208;generation spintronic devices with superior stability, scalability, and dynamics. Nevertheless, the perception of well&#8208;established ferromagnetic spintronics underpinned by spontaneous magnetization seemed to indicate the inadequacy of antiferromagnets for spintronics&#8212;their compensated magnetization has been perceived to result in uncontrollable antiferromagnetic order and subtle magnetoelectronic responses. However, remarkable advancements have been achieved in antiferromagnetic spintronics in recent years, with consecutive unanticipated discoveries substantiating the feasibility of antiferromagnet&#8208;centered spintronic devices. It is emphasized that, distinct from ferromagnets, the richness in complex antiferromagnetic crystal structures is the unique and essential virtue of antiferromagnets that can open up their endless possibilities of novel phenomena and functionality for spintronics. In this Perspective, the recent progress in antiferromagnetic spintronics is reviewed, with a particular focus on that based on several kinds of antiferromagnets with special antiferromagnetic crystal structures. The latest developments in efficiently manipulating antiferromagnetic order, exploring novel antiferromagnetic physical responses, and demonstrating prototype antiferromagnetic spintronic devices are discussed. An outlook on future research directions is also provided. It is hoped that this Perspective can serve as guidance for readers who are interested in this field and encourage unprecedented studies on antiferromagnetic spintronic materials, phenomena, and devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antiferromagnets constitute promising contender materials for next-generation spintronic devices with superior stability, scalability, and dynamics. Nevertheless, the perception of well-established ferromagnetic spintronics underpinned by spontaneous magnetization seemed to indicate the inadequacy of antiferromagnets for spintronics&#8212;their compensated magnetization has been perceived to result in uncontrollable antiferromagnetic order and subtle magnetoelectronic responses. However, remarkable advancements have been achieved in antiferromagnetic spintronics in recent years, with consecutive unanticipated discoveries substantiating the feasibility of antiferromagnet-centered spintronic devices. It is emphasized that, distinct from ferromagnets, the richness in complex antiferromagnetic crystal structures is the unique and essential virtue of antiferromagnets that can open up their endless possibilities of novel phenomena and functionality for spintronics. In this Perspective, the recent progress in antiferromagnetic spintronics is reviewed, with a particular focus on that based on several kinds of antiferromagnets with special antiferromagnetic crystal structures. The latest developments in efficiently manipulating antiferromagnetic order, exploring novel antiferromagnetic physical responses, and demonstrating prototype antiferromagnetic spintronic devices are discussed. An outlook on future research directions is also provided. It is hoped that this Perspective can serve as guidance for readers who are interested in this field and encourage unprecedented studies on antiferromagnetic spintronic materials, phenomena, and devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrastrong and High Thermal Insulating Porous High&#8208;Entropy Ceramics up to 2000&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiscale design strategy is proposed to fabricate 9&#8208;cation porous high&#8208;entropy diborides (9PHEBs) with exceptional mechanical load&#8208;bearing capability and high thermal insulating performance via an ultrafast high&#8208;temperature synthesis technique. The as&#8208;fabricated 9PHEBs possess ultrahigh compressive strength (&#8776;337 MPa) and low thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.76 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1). More importantly, they show superior thermal stability and strength retention up to 2000 &#176;C.








Abstract
High mechanical load&#8208;carrying capability and thermal insulating performance are crucial to thermal&#8208;insulation materials under extreme conditions. However, these features are often difficult to achieve simultaneously in conventional porous ceramics. Here, for the first time, it is reported a multiscale structure design and fast fabrication of 9&#8208;cation porous high&#8208;entropy diboride ceramics via an ultrafast high&#8208;temperature synthesis technique that can lead to exceptional mechanical load&#8208;bearing capability and high thermal insulation performance. With the construction of multiscale structures involving ultrafine pores at the microscale, high&#8208;quality interfaces between building blocks at the nanoscale, and severe lattice distortion at the atomic scale, the materials with an &#8776;50% porosity exhibit an ultrahigh compressive strength of up to &#8776;337&#160;MPa at room temperature and a thermal conductivity as low as &#8776;0.76&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. More importantly, they demonstrate exceptional thermal stability, with merely &#8776;2.4% volume shrinkage after 2000&#160;&#176;C annealing. They also show an ultrahigh compressive strength of &#8776;690&#160;MPa up to 2000&#160;&#176;C, displaying a ductile compressive behavior. The excellent mechanical and thermal insulating properties offer an attractive material for reliable thermal insulation under extreme conditions.

         <title>Redox Gating for Colossal Carrier Modulation And Unique Phase Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Redox gating, a novel approach distinct from conventional electrolyte gating, combines reversible redox functionalities with common ionic electrolyte moieties to engineer charge transport, enabling power&#8208;efficient electronic phase control. In our study, we achieve a colossal sheet carrier density modulation beyond 1016 cm&#8722;2, sustainable over thousands of cycles, all within the sub&#8208;volt regime for functional oxide thin films. The key advantage of this method lies in the controlled injection of a large quantity of carriers from the electrolyte into the channel material without the deleterious effects associated with traditional electrolyte gating processes, such as the production of ionic defects or intercalated species. The redox gating approach offers a simple and practical means of decoupling electrical and structural phase transitions, enabling the isostructural metal&#8208;insulator transition and improved device endurance. The versatility of redox gating extends across multiple materials, irrespective of their crystallinity, crystallographic orientation, or carrier type (n&#8208; or p&#8208;type). This inclusivity encompasses functional heterostructures and low&#8208;dimensional quantum materials composed of sustainable elements, highlighting the broad applicability and potential of the technique in electronic devices.

         <title>A Tough Monolithic Integrated Triboelectric Bioplastic Enabled&#160;by Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electronic waste is a growing threat to the global environment and human health, raising particular concerns. Triboelectric devices synthesized from sustainable and degradable materials are a promising electronic alternative, but the mechanical mismatch at the interface between the polymer substrate and the electrodes remains unresolved in practical applications. This study used the sulfhydryl silanization reaction and the chemical selectivity and site specificity of the thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange reaction in dynamic covalent chemistry to prepare a tough monolithic integrated triboelectric bioplastic. The stress is dissipated by covalent bond adaptation to the interface interaction, which makes the polymer dielectric layer to the conductive layer have a good interface adhesion effect (220.55&#160;kPa). The interfacial interlocking of the polymer substrate with the conductive layer gives the triboelectric bioplastic excellent tensile strength (87.4&#160;MPa) and fracture toughness (33.3&#160;MJ m&#8722;3). Even when subjected to a tension force of 10000 times its weight, it still maintains a stable triboelectric output with no visible cracks. This study provides new insights into the design of reliable and environmentally friendly self&#8208;powered devices, which is significant for the development of flexible wearable electronics.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Polymer Framework Strategy Enabling Printable And Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells by Mitigating &#8220;Coffee Ring&#8221; Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites are considered ideal candidates for future photovoltaic applications due to their excellent photovoltaic properties. Although solution&#8208;printed manufacturing has shown inherent potential for the low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;throughput production of thin&#8208;film semiconductor electronics, the high&#8208;quality and high&#8208;reproducibility deposition of large&#8208;area perovskite remains a bottleneck that restricts their commercialization due to the droplet coffee&#8208;ring effect (CRE). In this study, we addressed these issues by introducing an in&#8208;situ polymer framework. The three&#8208;dimensional framework formed by spontaneous cross&#8208;linking improved the precursor viscosity and homogenized its heat diffusion coefficient, counteracting the lateral capillary flow of the colloidal particles and anchoring their flocculent movement. Thus, the Marangoni convection intensity was properly controlled to ensure high&#8208;quality perovskite films, which significantly enhanced reproducibility in printing efficient photovoltaics by mitigating the CRE. Subsequently, the perovskite solar cells and modules achieved power conversion efficiencies of 23.94 and 17.53%, and exhibited positive environmental stability, retaining over 90 and 78% efficiency after storage for 2500 and 1600&#160;h, respectively. This work may serve as a foundation for exploring precursor rheology to match the homogeneous deposition requirements of perovskite photovoltaics and facilitating the advancement of their printing manufacturing and commercialization transition.

         <title>Recent Advances of Green Electricity Generation: Potential in Solar Interfacial Evaporation System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) has played a pivotal role in optimizing water&#8208;energy utilization, reducing conventional power costs, and mitigating environmental impacts. The increasing emphasis on the synergistic co&#8208;generation of water and green electricity through SDIE is particularly noteworthy. However, there is a gap of existing reviews that have specifically focused on the mechanistic understanding of green power from WEC systems, the structure&#8208;activity relationship between efficiency of green energy utilization in WEC and materials design in SDIE. Particularly it lacks a comprehensive discussion to address the challenges faced in these areas along with potential solutions. Therefore, this review aims to comprehensively assess the progress and future perspective of green electricity from water&#8208;electricity co&#8208;generation (WEC) systems by investigating the potential expansion of SDIE. Firstly, it provides a comprehensive overview about materials rational design, thermal management and water transportation tunnels in SDIE. Then it summarizes diverse energy sources utilized in the SDIE process, including steaming generation, photovoltaics, salinity gradients effect, temperature gradients effect, and piezoelectric effect. Subsequently, it explores factors that affect generated green electricity efficiency in WEC. Lastly, this review proposes challenges and possible solution in the development of WEC. The timely emergence of this review will promote the sustainable use of energy.

         <title>Freeze&#8208;thaw Microfluidic System Produces &#8220;Themis&#8221; Nanocomplex for Cleaning Persisters&#8208;infected Macrophages and Enhancing Uninfected Macrophages</title>

Abstract
Macrophages are the primary effectors against potential pathogen infections. They can be &#8220;parasitized&#8221; by intracellular bacteria, serving as &#8220;accomplices&#8221;, protecting intracellular bacteria and even switching them to persisters. Here, using a freeze&#8208;thaw strategy&#8208;based microfluidic chip, we created a &#8220;Themis&#8221; nanocomplex (TNC). The TNC consisted of Lactobacillus reuteri&#8208;derived membrane vesicles, heme, and vancomycin, which cleaned infected macrophages and enhanced uninfected macrophages. In infected macrophages, TNC released heme that led to the reconstruction of the respiratory chain complexes of intracellular persisters, forcing them to regrow. The revived bacteria produced virulence factors that destroyed host macrophages (accomplices), thereby being externalized and becoming vulnerable to immune responses. In uninfected macrophages, TNC upregulated the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), contributing to immunoenhancement. The combined effect of TNC of cleaning the accomplice (infected macrophages) and reinforcing uninfected macrophages provides a promising strategy for intracellular bacterial therapy.

         <title>Digital Multiphase Composites via Additive Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Mechanical properties of traditional engineering materials are typically coupled to each other, presenting a challenge to practitioners with multi&#8208;dimensional material property requirements. In this work we&#160;demonstrate continuous, independent control over multiple mechanical properties in composite materials realized using additive manufacturing. For the first time, we&#160;experimentally characterize composites additively manufactured from rigid plastic, soft elastomer, and liquid constituents, demonstrating materials which span four orders of magnitude in modulus and two orders of magnitude in toughness. By forming analytical mappings between relative concentrations of constituents at the microscale and resulting macroscale material properties, we&#160;enable inverse material design; we&#160;showcase the method by printing artifacts with prescribed toughness and elasticity distributions. We&#160;place the properties of these composites in the context of biological tissues, showing they have promise as mechanically plausible tissue&#160;mimics.

         <title>Building Stable Anodes for High&#8208;Rate Na&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Due to the low&#8208;cost and high energy density, sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have attracted growing interests, with great potential to power future electric vehicles (EVs) and mobile electronics, which require the rapid charge/discharge capability. However, the development of high&#8208;rate SMBs has been impeded by the sluggish Na+ ion kinetics, particularly at the sodium metal anode (SMA). The high&#8208;rate operation severely threatens the SMA stability, due to the unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI), the Na dendrite growth, and large volume changes during Na plating&#8208;stripping cycles, leading to rapid electrochemical performance degradations. In this paper, we survey key challenges faced by high&#8208;rate SMAs, and we highlight representative stabilization strategies, including the general modification of SMB components (including the host, Na metal surface, electrolyte, separator, and cathode), and emerging solutions with the development of solid&#8208;state SMBs and liquid metal anodes; we elaborate the working principle, performance, and application of these strategies, to reduce the Na nucleation energy barriers and promote Na+ ion transfer kinetics for stable high&#8208;rate Na metal anodes. This review will inspire further efforts to stabilize SMAs and other metal (e.g., Li, K, Mg, Zn) anodes, promoting high&#8208;rate applications of high&#8208;energy metal batteries towards a more sustainable society.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Alloys Materials for CO2 And CH4 Catalytic Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The catalytic conversion of greenhouse gases CH4 and CO2 constitutes an effective approach for alleviating the greenhouse effect and generating valuable chemical products. However, the intricate molecular characteristics characterized by high symmetry and bond energies, coupled with the complexity of associated reactions, pose challenges for conventional catalysts to attain high activity, product selectivity, and enduring stability. Single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs) materials, distinguished by their tunable composition and unique electronic structures, confer versatile physicochemical properties and modulable functionalities. In recent years, SAAs materials have demonstrated pronounced advantages and expansive prospects in catalytic conversion of CH4 and CO2. In this review, we begin by introducing the challenges entailed in catalytic conversion of CH4 and CO2 and the advantages offered by SAAs. Subsequently, we present the intricacies of synthesis strategies employed for SAAs and introduce characterization techniques and methodologies. The subsequent section furnishes a meticulous and inclusive overview of research endeavors concerning SAAs in CO2 catalytic conversion, CH4 conversion, and synergy CH4 and CO2 conversion. The particular emphasis is directed toward scrutinizing the intricate mechanisms underlying the influence of SAAs on reaction activity and product selectivity. Finally, insights are presented on the development and future challenges of SAAs in CH4 and CO2 conversion reactions.

         <title>Spectral Engineering of Optical Microresonators in Anisotropic Lithium Niobate Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
On&#8208;chip optical microresonators are essential building blocks in integrated optics. The ability to arbitrarily engineer their resonant frequencies is crucial for exploring novel physics in synthetic frequency dimensions and practical applications like nonlinear optical parametric processes and dispersion&#8208;engineered frequency comb generation. Photonic crystal ring (PhCR) resonators are a versatile tool for such arbitrary frequency engineering, by controllably creating mode splitting at selected resonances. To date, these PhCRs have mostly been demonstrated in isotropic photonic materials, while such engineering could be significantly more complicated in anisotropic platforms that often offer more fruitful optical properties. Here, we realize the spectral engineering of chip&#8208;scale optical microresonators in the anisotropic lithium niobate (LN) crystal by a gradient design that precisely compensates for variations in both refractive index and perturbation strength. We experimentally demonstrate controllable frequency splitting at single and multiple selected resonances in LN PhCR resonators with different sizes, while maintaining high Q&#8208;factors up to 1 &#215; 106. Moreover, we experimentally construct a sharp boundary in the synthetic frequency dimension based on an actively modulated x&#8208;cut LN gradient&#8208;PhCR, opening up new paths toward the arbitrary control of electro&#8208;optic comb spectral shapes and exploration of novel physics in the frequency degree of freedom.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Regulated Sulfur Conversion in High&#8208;Content Carbon Layer Confined Sulfur Cathode Maximizes Voltage And Rate Capability of K&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Potassium&#8208;sulfur (K&#8208;S) battery has attracted attention in large&#8208;scale energy storage system. Small&#8208;molecule/covalent sulfur (SMCS) can help to avoid shuttle effect of polysulfide ions via solid&#8208;solid sulfur conversion. However, content of SMCS is relatively low (&#8804;40%), and solid&#8208;solid reaction cause sluggish kinetics and low discharge potentials. Herein, SMCS was confined in turbo carbon layers with content of &#8764;74.1 wt% via a C/S co&#8208;deposition process. In the K&#8208;S battery assembled by using as&#8208;fabricated SMCS@C as cathode and KFSI&#8208;EC/DEC as electrolyte, anion&#8208;regulated two&#8208;plateau solid&#8208;state S conversion chemistry and a novel high discharge potential plateau at 2.5&#8208;2.0&#160;V with remarkable reversible capacity of 384 mAh g&#8722;1 at 3 A g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles were found. The SMCS@C||K full cell showed energy and power density of 72.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 873.2&#160;W kg&#8722;1, respectively, at 3 A g&#8722;1. Mechanism&#160;studies&#160;reveal&#160;that the&#160;enlarged carbon layer space enables the diffusion of K+&#8208;FSI&#8208;&#160;ion pairs, and the coulombic attraction between them accelerates their diffusion in SMCS@C. In addition, FSI&#8722;&#160;regulates sulfur conversion in situ inside the&#160;carbon layers along a two&#8208;plateau solid&#8208;state reaction pathway, which lowers the free energy and weakens the S&#8208;S bond of intermediates, leading to faster and more efficient S conversion.

&lt;p&gt;Potassium-sulfur (K-S) battery has attracted attention in large-scale energy storage system. Small-molecule/covalent sulfur (SMCS) can help to avoid shuttle effect of polysulfide ions via solid-solid sulfur conversion.

         <title>Versatile Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Organic Redox&#8208;Active Materials for Alkali Metal&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Versatile nitrogen&#8208;centered organic redox&#8208;active molecules have gained significant attention in alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries (AMIBs) due to their low cost, low toxicity, and ease of preparation. Specially, their multiple reaction categories (anion/cation insertion types of reaction) and higher operating voltage, when compared to traditional conjugated carbonyl materials, underscore their promising prospects. However, the high solubility of nitrogen&#8208;centered redox active materials in organic electrolyte and their low electronic conductivity contribute to inferior cycling performance, sluggish reaction kinetics, and limited rate capability. This review provides a detailed overview of nitrogen&#8208;centered redox&#8208;active materials, encompassing their redox chemistry, solutions to overcome shortcomings, characterization of charge storage mechanisms, and recent progress. Additionally, we propose prospects and directions for future investigations. It is anticipated that this review will stimulate further exploration of underlying mechanisms and interface chemistry through in situ characterization techniques, thereby promoting the practical application of nitrogen&#8208;centered redox&#8208;active materials in AMIBs.

         <title>Revealing the Substrate Constraint Effect on the Thermodynamic Behaviour of the Pd&#8208;H through Capacitive&#8208;based Hydrogen&#8208;Sorption Measurement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Mechanical constraints imposed on the Pd&#8208;H system can induce significant strain upon hydrogenation&#8208;induced expansion, potentially leading to changes in the thermodynamic behaviour, such as the phase&#8208;transition pressure. However, the investigation of the constraint effect is often tricky due to the lack of simple experimental techniques for measuring hydrogenation&#8208;induced expansion. In this study, we developed a capacitive&#8208;based measurement system to monitor hydrogenation&#8208;induced areal expansion, which allows us to control and evaluate the magnitude of the substrate constraint. By using the measurement technique, we investigate the influence of substrate constraint intensity on the thermodynamic behaviour of the Pd&#8208;H system. Through experiments with different constraint intensities, we found that the difference in the constraint intensity minimally affects the phase&#8208;transition pressure when the Pd&#8208;H system allows the release of constraint stress through plastic deformation. Our experiments can improve the understanding of the substrate constraint behaviours of Pd&#8208;H systems allowing plastic deformation while demonstrating the potential of capacitive&#8208;based measurement systems to study the mechanical&#8211;thermodynamic coupling of M&#8208;H systems.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Fatigue Tandem Organic Photovoltaics for Indoor Illumination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The ability of achieving high efficiency makes tandem organic photovoltaics a competitive technique in potential indoor applications. Except high efficiency, reliable indoor energy supplying also calls for outstanding stability. However, unavoidable instable voltage&#8208;supply from circuit control system for indoor light sources like light emitting diodes and incandescent lamps would cause carrier density fluctuating and device fatigue drove by periodic light/dark switching. In this work, the strobing induced fatigue within bulk heterojunction/interconnecting layer interface is firstly revealed and overcome. Based on reliable and effective interfacial doping between conjugated acceptor and metal oxide, the interfacial capacitance that determines the strobing induced fatigue, has been significantly restrained. The imbalance carrier migration and fierce inter&#8208;layer accommodating during burn&#8208;in stage caused by light strobing are substantially diminished. Benefitted from this method, the stability of tandem device are highly enhanced under strobing indoor illumination and a champion efficiency (35.02%) is obtained. Our method provides a guidance for further material design for interconnecting layer in organic photovoltaics.

         <title>Engineering Semi&#8208;Reversed Quantum Well Photocatalysts for Highly&#8208;Efficient Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Fuels Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Semiconductor quantum wells (QWs) exhibit high charge&#8208;utilization efficiency for light&#8208;emitting applications due to their strong charge confinement effect. Inspired by this effect, herein, we propose a new idea to significantly improve the photo&#8208;generated charge separation for attaining a highly&#8208;efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuels conversion process through &#8220;semi&#8208;reversing&#8221; the conventional QWs to confine only the photo&#8208;generated electrons. This electron confinement&#8208;improved charge separation is implemented in the well&#8208;designed model of the CdS/TiO2/CdS semi&#8208;reversed QW (SRQW) structure. The latter is fabricated by selectively assembling CdS quantum dots (QDs) onto the {101} facets (ultra&#8208;thin edge regions) of the TiO2 nanosheets (NSs). Upon light excitation, the photo&#8208;generated electrons of SRQW can be confined on the TiO2&#8208;{101} facets in the vicinity of the CdS/TiO2 hetero&#8208;interface. Thereby, the continuous multi&#8208;electron injection to the adsorbed reactants on the interfacial active&#8208;sites is significantly accelerated. Thus, the CdS/TiO2/CdS SRQW exhibits &#8764;35.7 and &#8764;56.0&#8208;fold enhancements on the photocatalytic activities for water and CO2 reduction, respectively, compared to those of pure TiO2. Correspondingly, its CH4&#8208;product selectivity is increased by &#8764;180%. Our work provides a novel charge separation mechanism, which is of great importance for the design of the next&#8208;generation quantum&#8208;sized photocatalysts for solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuels conversion.

         <title>Advanced Terahertz Refractive Sensing And Fingerprint Recognition Through Metasurface&#8208;Excited Surface Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;sensitive metasurface&#8208;based sensors are essential for effective substance detection and insightful bio&#8208;interaction studies, which compress light in subwavelength volumes to enhance light&#8208;matter interactions. However, current methods to improve sensing performance always focus on optimizing near&#8208;field response of individual meta&#8208;atom, and fingerprint recognition for bio&#8208;substances necessitates several pixelated metasurfaces to establish a quasi&#8208;continuous spectrum. Here, a novel sensing strategy is proposed to achieve Terahertz (THz) refractive sensing, and fingerprint recognition based on surface waves (SWs). Leveraging the long&#8208;range transmission, strong confinement, and interface sensitivity of SWs, a metasurface&#8208;supporting SWs excitation and propagation is experimentally verified to achieve sensing integrations. Through wide&#8208;band information collection of SWs, the proposed sensor not only facilitates refractive sensing up to 215.5&#176;/RIU, but also enables the simultaneous resolution of multiple fingerprint information within a continuous spectrum. By covering 5&#160;&#956;m thickness of polyimide, quartz and silicon nitride layers, the maximum phase change of 91.1&#176;, 101.8&#176; and 126.4&#176; is experimentally obtained within THz band, respectively. Thus, our strategy broadens the research scope of metasurface&#8208;excited SWs and introduces a novel paradigm for ultrasensitive sensing functions.

         <title>Design of a Biohybrid Materials Circuit with Binary Decoder Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biohybrid materials that communicate with each other via diffusible inhibitory or activating signals are assembled in a circuit topology inspired by an electronical binary 2&#8208;input/4&#8208;output decoder. The decoder is programmed to convert different combinations of two input signals into the release of distinct protease outputs. Such information&#8208;processing biohybrid material circuits can be used for biomolecular computing and signal processing.








Abstract
Synthetic biology applies concepts from electrical engineering and information processing to endow cells with computational functionality. Transferring the underlying molecular components into materials and wiring them according to topologies inspired by electronic circuit boards has yielded materials systems that perform selected computational operations. However, the limited functionality of available building blocks is restricting the implementation of advanced information&#8208;processing circuits into materials. Here, a set of protease&#8208;based biohybrid modules the bioactivity of which can either be induced or inhibited is engineered.

     alt="Design of a Biohybrid Materials Circuit with Binary Decoder Functionality"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biohybrid materials that communicate with each other via diffusible inhibitory or activating signals are assembled in a circuit topology inspired by an electronical binary 2-input/4-output decoder. The decoder is programmed to convert different combinations of two input signals into the release of distinct protease outputs. Such information-processing biohybrid material circuits can be used for biomolecular computing and signal processing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthetic biology applies concepts from electrical engineering and information processing to endow cells with computational functionality. Transferring the underlying molecular components into materials and wiring them according to topologies inspired by electronic circuit boards has yielded materials systems that perform selected computational operations. However, the limited functionality of available building blocks is restricting the implementation of advanced information-processing circuits into materials. Here, a set of protease-based biohybrid modules the bioactivity of which can either be induced or inhibited is engineered. Guided by a quantitative mathematical model and following a design-build-test-learn (DBTL) cycle, the modules are wired according to circuit topologies inspired by electronic signal decoders, a fundamental motif in information processing. A 2-input/4-output binary decoder for the detection of two small molecules in a material framework that can perform regulated outputs in form of distinct protease activities is designed. The here demonstrated smart material system is strongly modular and can be used for biomolecular information processing for example in advanced biosensing or drug delivery applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Proton Conductor for Fuel Cells with Flexible Operational Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A developed dual&#8208;proton conductor composed of ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid and phosphoric acid exhibits efficient and stable proton conductivity over 80&#8211;160 &#176;C owing to the strong interaction between the two proton conductors and enhanced proton dissociation, enabling fuel cell operation with a flexible temperature range and excellent stability.








Abstract
The properties of proton conductors determine the operating temperature range of fuel cells. Typically, phosphoric acid (PA) proton conductors exhibit excellent proton conductivity owing to their high proton dissociation and self&#8208;diffusion abilities. However, at low temperatures or high current densities, water&#8208;induced PA loss causes rapid degradation of cell performance. Maintaining efficient and stable proton conductivity within a flexible temperature range can significantly reduce the start&#8208;up temperature of PA&#8208;doped proton exchange membrane fuel cells. In this study, a dual&#8208;proton conductor composed of an organic phosphonic acid (ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid, EDTMPA) and an inorganic PA is developed for proton exchange membranes. The proposed dual&#8208;proton conductor can operate within a flexible temperature range of 80&#8211;160 &#176;C, benefiting from the strong interaction between EDTMPA and PA, and the enhanced proton dissociation. Fuel cells with the EDTMPA&#8208;PA dual&#8208;proton conductor showed excellent cell stability at 80 &#176;C. In particular, under the high current density of 1.5 A cm&#8722;2 at 160 &#176;C, the voltage decay rate of the fuel cell with the dual&#8208;proton conductor is one&#8208;thousandth of that of the fuel cell with PA&#8208;only proton conductor, indicating excellent stability.

         <title>Bypassing the Single Junction Limit with Advanced Photovoltaic Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Bayesian optimization&#8208;based simulation framework is presented, able to perform virtual optimization of multi&#8208;junction solar cell architectures, both vertical and lateral, in combination with up&#8208; and down&#8208;conversion materials. Microstructure effects on performance are explicitly considered using machine&#8208;learned predictive models from high throughput experimentation on simpler architectures. Vertical and lateral architectures are proposed to surpass the single junction limit of photovoltaic energy conversion.








Abstract
Multijunction devices and photon up&#8208; and down&#8208;conversion are prominent concepts aimed at increasing photovoltaic efficiencies beyond the single junction limit. Integrating these concepts into advanced architectures may address long&#8208;standing issues such as processing complexity, microstructure control, and resilience against spectral changes of the incoming radiation. However, so far, no models have been established to predict the performance of such integrated architectures. Here, a simulation environment based on Bayesian optimization is presented, that can predict and virtually optimize the electrical performance of multi&#8208;junction architectures, both vertical and lateral, in combination with up&#8208; and down&#8208;conversion materials. Microstructure effects on performance are explicitly considered using machine&#8208;learned predictive models from high throughput experimentation on simpler architectures. Two architectures that would surpass the single junction limit of photovoltaic energy conversion at reasonable complexity are identified: a vertical &#8220;staggered half octave system,&#8221; where selective absorption allows the use of 6 different bandgaps, and the lateral &#8220;overlapping rainbow system&#8221; where selective irradiation allows the use of a narrowband energy acceptor with reduced voltage losses, according to the energy gap law. Both architectures would be highly resilient against spectral changes, in contrast with two terminal multi&#8208;junction architectures which are limited by Kirchhoff's law.

         <title>3D Hydrogel Encapsulation Regulates Nephrogenesis in Kidney Organoids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Stem cell&#8208;derived kidney organoids contain nephron segments that recapitulate morphological and functional aspects of the human kidney. However, directed differentiation protocols for kidney organoids are largely conducted using biochemical signals to control differentiation. Here, the hypothesis that mechanical signals regulate nephrogenesis is investigated in three&#8208;dimensional culture by encapsulating kidney organoids within viscoelastic alginate hydrogels with varying rates of stress relaxation. Tubular nephron segments are significantly more convoluted in kidney organoids differentiated in encapsulating hydrogels when compared with those in suspension culture. Hydrogel viscoelasticity regulates the spatial distribution of nephron segments within the differentiating kidney organoids. Consistent with these observations, a particle&#8208;based computational model predicts that the extent of deformation of the hydrogel&#8208;organoid interface regulates the morphology of nephron segments. Elevated extracellular calcium levels in the culture medium, which can be impacted by the hydrogels, decrease the glomerulus&#8208;to&#8208;tubule ratio of nephron segments. These findings reveal that hydrogel encapsulation regulates nephron patterning and morphology and suggest that the mechanical microenvironment is an important design variable for kidney regenerative medicine.

         <title>Polymer Molecules Adsorption&#8208;Induced Zincophilic&#8208;Hydrophobic Protective Layer Enables Highly Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Zn metal, as one of the most promising anode materials for aqueous batteries, suffers from uncontrollable dendrite growth and water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions, which drastically compromise its cycle life and Coulombic efficiency (CE). Herein, we propose a nonionic amphipathic additive Tween&#8208;20 (denoted as TW20) that bears both zincophilic and hydrophobic units. The zincophilic segment of TW20 preferentially adsorbs on the Zn anode, while the hydrophobic segment is exposed on the electrolyte side, forming an electrolyte&#8208;facing hydrophobic layer that shields the anode from active water molecules. Moreover, theoretical calculation and experimental results reveal that the TW20 additive is able to induce the preferential growth of the (002) plane by adsorbing on other facets, enabling a highly reversible and dendrite&#8208;free Zn anode. Benefitting from the multi&#8208;functional TW20 additive, the long&#8208;term stability and reversibility of Zn anodes are substantially improved, reflected by stable cycling for over 2500&#160;h at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 and 500&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/5 mAh cm&#8722;2 as well as high reversibility with a high average CE of 99.4% at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2. The full cells paired with MnO2 demonstrate a long lifespan for more than 700 cycles at 500&#160;mA g&#8722;1. This work is expected to provide a new approach to modulate Zn electrode interface chemistry for highly stable Zn anode in aqueous zinc ion batteries.

         <title>Conducting Polymer Coatings Prepared by Mixed Emulsions Are Highly Conductive and Stable in Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conducting polymer coating is prepared by a mixture of two emulsions: an aqueous emulsion of conducting polymer, and an aqueous emulsion of hydrophobic and rubbery chains copolymerized with silane coupling agents. The coating features percolated nanocrystals which make the coating highly conductive, and the hydrophobic covalent network which stabilizes the coating in water.








Abstract
An aqueous emulsion of conducting polymer is commonly applied on a substrate to form a coating after drying. The coating, however, disintegrates in water. This paper reports a coating prepared using a mixture of two emulsions: an aqueous emulsion of conducting polymer, and an aqueous emulsion of hydrophobic and rubbery chains copolymerized with silane coupling agents. When applied on a substrate and dried, particles of the mixed emulsion merge into a continuous film. While the conducting polymer forms percolated nanocrystals, the silane groups crosslink the rubbery chains and interlink the rubbery chains to the substrate. The percolated nanocrystals make the coating highly conductive. The covalent network of hydrophobic polymer chains stabilizes the coating in water. The high conductivity and stability in water may enable broad applications.

         <title>Light and Magnetism Orchestrating Aquatic Pollutant&#8208;Degradation Robots in Programmable Trajectories</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart aquatic superhydrophobic robot integrated with well&#8208;assembled composite heterojunction minerals is developed based on the liquid film&#8208;confined strategy. Taking advantage of the remarkable photothermal and magnetic properties, the aquatic robot exhibits ultra&#8208;efficient navigation in broad range of surface tensions, and the purification of polluted water is efficiently achieved in situ by the synergistic orchestration of light and magnetism.








Abstract
Interfacial floating robots have promising applications in carriers, environmental monitoring, water treatment, and so on. Even though, engineering smart robots with both precisely efficient navigation and elimination of water pollutants in long term remains a challenge, as the superhydrophobicity greatly lowers resistance for aquatic motion while sacrificing chemical reactivity of the surface. Here, a pollutant&#8208;removing superhydrophobic robot integrated with well&#8208;assembled iron oxide&#8208;bismuth sulfide heterojunction composite minerals, which provide both light and magnetic propulsion, and the ability of catalytic degradation, is reported. The motion velocity of the robot reaches up to 51.9&#160;mm s&#8722;1 within only 300&#160;ms of acceleration under the orchestration of light, and brakes rapidly (&#8776;200&#8211;300&#160;ms) once turn off the light. And magnetism extends the robot to work in broad range of surface tensions in any programmable trajectory. Besides, purification of polluted water is efficiently achieved in situ and the degradation efficiency exhibits eightfold enhancements under the effect of light&#8208;triggered photothermal behavior coupled with magnetic induction, overcoming the dilemma of efficient motion with catalytic superhydrophobicity. This strategy developed here provides guidelines for the explorations of high&#8208;performance smart devices.

         <title>Tandem Catalysis inside Double&#8208;Shelled Nanocages with Separated and Tunable Atomic Catalyst Sites for High Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double&#8208;shelled nano&#8208;cages with separated and tunable single&#8208;atom sites are developed as nano reactors to trigger tandem catalysis and promote the efficient electrochemical conversion of lithium polysulfides. These nanocages can serve as multifunctional sulfur hosts for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, guaranteeing admirable rate performance and high stability in battery cycling.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atomic catalysts are effective in mitigating the shuttling effect and slow redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries, but their ideal performance has yet to be achieved due to the multi&#8208;step conversion of LiPSs requiring multifunctional active sites for tandem catalysis. Here double&#8208;shelled nano&#8208;cages (DSNCs) have been developed to address this challenge, featuring separated and tunable single&#8208;atom sites as nano reactors that trigger tandem catalysis and promote the efficient electrochemical conversion of LiPSs. This enables high capacity and durable Li&#8208;S batteries. The DSNCs, with inner Co&#8208;N4 and outer Zn&#8208;N4 sites (S/CoNC@ZnNC DSNCs), exhibit a high specific capacity of 1186 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C, along with a low capacity fading rate of 0.063% per cycle over 500 cycles. Even with a high sulfur loading (4.2 mg cm&#8722;2) and a low E/S ratio (6 &#181;L mg&#8722;1), the cell displays excellent cycling stability. Moreover, the Li&#8208;S pouch cells are capable of stable cycling for more than 160 cycles. These results demonstrate the feasibility of driving successive sulfur conversion reactions with separated active sites, and are expected to inspire further catalyst design for high performance Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Ionic Polyimine&#8208;Based Composite Membrane with Inductive and Complexation Synergistic Effects for Sensitive and On&#8208;Site Fluorescent Detection of Volatile Iodine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concerns about radioactive iodine emissions and the potential for nuclear leakage are raised. Herein, a fluorescence&#8208;based method using an ionic polyimine network&#8208;polyvinylpyrrolidone composite membrane is developed for on&#8208;site detection of volatile iodine, by utilizing ion&#8208;induced dipole interactions and complexation effects for iodine enrichment and immobilization. The resulting membrane shows rapid response time and low detection limit.








Abstract
Along with the development of nuclear power, concerns about radioactive emissions and the potential for nuclear leakage have been widely raised, particularly of harmful iodine isotopes. However, as a significant component of nuclear air waste, the enrichment and detection of air&#8208;dispersed gaseous iodine remain a challenge. In this work, it is focused on developing an attraction&#8208;immobilization&#8208;detection strategy&#8208;based fluorescence method for the on&#8208;site detection of volatile iodine, by employing a photoluminescent ionic polyimine network&#8208;polyvinylpyrrolidone (IPIN&#8208;PVP) composite membrane. This strategy synergizes ion&#8208;induced dipole interactions from IPIN and complexation effects from PVP, allowing effective iodine enrichment and immobilization. As a result, the optimized IPIN&#8208;PVP membrane exhibits rapid response times of 5 s and a low detection limit of 4.087 &#215; 10&#8722;8&#160;m for gaseous iodine. It also introduces a portable handheld detection device that utilizes the composite membrane, offering a practical solution for real&#8208;time on&#8208;site detection of volatile iodine. This innovation enhances nuclear safety measures and disaster management by providing rapid and reliable iodine detection capabilities.

         <title>Bridging the Catalytic Turnover Gap Between Single&#8208;Atom Iron Nanozymes and Natural Enzymes by Engineering the First and Second Shell Coordination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a first&#8211; and second&#8211;shell coordination tuning strategy of iron&#8211;based SAzymes is reported using Na2S2O5&#8211;mediated thermal activation. Axial ligands of the active sites and functionalities of the carbon host are modulated to elevate the reaction kinetics. The optimized SAzyme exhibits the highest k
cat value (52.7 s&#8722;1) in peroxidase reaction, and consequently, presents remarkable anti&#8211;tumor properties.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) constitute a promising category of enzyme&#8208;mimicking materials with outstanding catalytic performance. The performance of SAzymes improves through modification of the coordination environments around the metal center. However, the catalytic turnover rates of SAzymes, which are key measures of the effectiveness of active site modifications, remain lower than those of natural enzymes, especially in peroxidase&#8208;reactions. Here, the first and second shell coordination tuning strategy that yields SAzymes with structures and activities analogous to those of natural enzymes is reported. The optimized SAzyme exhibits a turnover rate of 52.7 s&#8722;1 and a catalytic efficiency of 6.97 &#215; 105 M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. A computational study reveals that axial S&#8208;ligands induce an alternative reaction mechanism, and SO2&#8722; functional groups provide hydrogen bonds to reduce the activation energy. In addition, SAzyme shows superior anti&#8208;tumor ability in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate the validity of coordination engineering strategies and the carcinostatic potential of SAzymes.

         <title>Injectable MSC Spheroid and Microgel Granular Composites for Engineering Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel microparticles and mesenchymal stromal cell spheroids are combined into granular composites to engineer cartilage tissue. The spheroids allow for important cell&#8211;cell interactions during chondrogenesis and fusion into a cartilage tissue, whereas the granular structure allows for injectability and then stabilization through interparticle crosslinking. This approach advances the use of engineered biomaterials for tissue engineering applications.








Abstract
Many cell types require direct cell&#8211;cell interactions for differentiation and function; yet, this can be challenging to incorporate into 3&#8208;dimensional (3D) structures for the engineering of tissues. Here, a new approach is introduced that combines aggregates of cells (spheroids) with similarly&#8208;sized hydrogel particles (microgels) to form granular composites that are injectable, undergo interparticle crosslinking via light for initial stabilization, permit cell&#8211;cell contacts for cell signaling, and allow spheroid fusion and growth. One area where this is important is in cartilage tissue engineering, as cell&#8211;cell contacts are crucial to chondrogenesis and are missing in many tissue engineering approaches. To address this, granular composites are developed from adult porcine mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) spheroids and hyaluronic acid microgels and simulations and experimental analyses are used to establish the importance of initial MSC spheroid to microgel volume ratios to balance mechanical support with tissue growth. Long&#8208;term chondrogenic cultures of granular composites produce engineered cartilage tissue with extensive matrix deposition and mechanical properties within the range of cartilage, as well as integration with native tissue. Altogether, a new strategy of injectable granular composites is developed that leverages the benefits of cell&#8211;cell interactions through spheroids with the mechanical stabilization afforded with engineered hydrogels.

&lt;p&gt;Hydrogel microparticles and mesenchymal stromal cell spheroids are combined into granular composites to engineer cartilage tissue. The spheroids allow for important cell&#8211;cell interactions during chondrogenesis and fusion into a cartilage tissue, whereas the granular structure allows for injectability and then stabilization through interparticle crosslinking. This approach advances the use of engineered biomaterials for tissue engineering applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many cell types require direct cell&#8211;cell interactions for differentiation and function; yet, this can be challenging to incorporate into 3-dimensional (3D) structures for the engineering of tissues. Here, a new approach is introduced that combines aggregates of cells (spheroids) with similarly-sized hydrogel particles (microgels) to form granular composites that are injectable, undergo interparticle crosslinking via light for initial stabilization, permit cell&#8211;cell contacts for cell signaling, and allow spheroid fusion and growth. One area where this is important is in cartilage tissue engineering, as cell&#8211;cell contacts are crucial to chondrogenesis and are missing in many tissue engineering approaches. To address this, granular composites are developed from adult porcine mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) spheroids and hyaluronic acid microgels and simulations and experimental analyses are used to establish the importance of initial MSC spheroid to microgel volume ratios to balance mechanical support with tissue growth. Long-term chondrogenic cultures of granular composites produce engineered cartilage tissue with extensive matrix deposition and mechanical properties within the range of cartilage, as well as integration with native tissue. Altogether, a new strategy of injectable granular composites is developed that leverages the benefits of cell&#8211;cell interactions through spheroids with the mechanical stabilization afforded with engineered hydrogels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exchange Bias Between van der Waals Materials: Tilted Magnetic States and Field&#8208;Free Spin&#8211;Orbit&#8208;Torque Switching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exchange&#8208;bias interactions between van der Waals ferromagnets and van der Waals antiferromagnets are unusual in that the antiferromagnetic surface can be completely uncompensated. In Pt/Fe3GeTe2/CrSBr heterostructures, this produces interfacial exchange interactions along the in&#8208;plane easy&#8208;axis of CrSBr comparable to the interlayer interactions. Such an effect produces non&#8208;uniform tilted magnetic configurations and enables field&#8208;free deterministic spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque switching of the Fe3GeTe2 layer.








Abstract
Magnetic van der Waals heterostructures provide a unique platform to study magnetism and spintronics device concepts in the 2D limit. Here, studies of exchange bias from the van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr acting on the van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) are reported. The orientation of the exchange bias is along the in&#8208;plane easy axis of CrSBr, perpendicular to the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane anisotropy of the FGT, inducing a strongly tilted magnetic configuration in the FGT. Furthermore, the in&#8208;plane exchange bias provides sufficient symmetry breaking to allow deterministic spin&#8211;orbit torque switching of the FGT in CrSBr/FGT/Pt samples at zero applied magnetic field. A minimum thickness of the CrSBr of &gt;10 nm is needed to provide a non&#8208;zero exchange bias at 30&#160;K.

         <title>High&#8208;throughput Strategies in The Discovery of Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Searching for new high&#8208;performance thermoelectric (TE) materials that are economical and environmentally friendly is an urgent task for TE society, but the advancements are greatly limited by the time&#8208;consuming and high cost of traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error method. The significant progresses achieved in the computing hardware, efficient computing methods, advance artificial intelligence algorithms, and rapidly growing material data have brought a paradigm shift in the investigation of TE materials. Many electrical and thermal performance descriptors have been proposed and efficient high&#8208;throughput calculation methods have been developed with the purpose to quickly screen new potential TE materials from the material databases. Some high&#8208;throughput experiment methods have also been developed which can increase the density of information obtained in a single experiment with less time and lower cost. In addition, the machine learning methods have been also introduced in thermoelectrics. In this review, we systematically summarize the high&#8208;throughput strategies in the discovery of TE materials. The applications of performance descriptor, high&#8208;throughput calculation, high&#8208;throughput experiment, and machine learning in the discovery of new TE materials are reviewed. In addition, the challenges and possible directions in the future research are also discussed.

         <title>Conjugated Phosphonic Acids Enable Robust Hole Transport Layers for Efficient and Intrinsically Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugated phosphonic acid is developed to modify Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD benchmark HTL, leading to superior charge conductivity, reinforced ion immobilization, and remarkable device stability.








Abstract
High efficiency and long&#8208;term stability are the prerequisites for the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, inadequate and non&#8208;uniform doping of hole transport layers (HTLs) still limits the efficiency improvements, while the intrinsic instability of HTLs caused by ion migration and accumulation is difficult to be addressed by external encapsulation. Here it is shown that the addition of a conjugated phosphonic acid (CPA) to the Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD benchmark HTL can greatly enhance the device efficiency and intrinsic stability. Featuring an optimal diprotic&#8208;acid structure, indolo(3,2&#8208;b)carbazole&#8208;5,11&#8208;diylbis(butane&#8208;4,1&#8208;diyl) bis(phosphonic acid) (BCZ) is developed to promote morphological uniformity and mitigate ion migration across both perovskite/HTL and HTL/Ag interfaces, leading to superior charge conductivity, reinforced ion immobilization, and remarkable film stability. The dramatically improved interfacial charge collection endows BCZ&#8208;based n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs with a champion power conversion efficiency of 24.51%. More encouragingly, the BCZ&#8208;based devices demonstrate remarkable stability under harsh environmental conditions by retaining 90% of initial efficiency after 3000&#160;h in air storage. This work paves the way for further developing robust organic HTLs for optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Rewritable Photoluminescence and Structural Color Display for Dual&#8208;Responsive Optical Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both wavelength&#8208;tunable coloration and light intensity&#8208;tunable photoluminescence are independently and reliably manipulated in the thin polymer&#8208;based film. A rewritable dual&#8208;responsive encryption display that has the benefit of direct and intuitive identification of encrypted information by the human eye is presented, enabling high information security and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.








Abstract
Optical encryption using coloration and photoluminescent (PL) materials can provide highly secure data protection with direct and intuitive identification of encrypted information. Encryption capable of independently controlling wavelength&#8208;tunable coloration as well as variable light intensity PL is not adequately demonstrated yet. Herein, a rewritable PL and structural color (SC) display suitable for dual&#8208;responsive optical encryption developed with a stimuli&#8208;responsive SC of a block copolymer (BCP) photonic crystal (PC) with alternating in&#8208;plane lamellae, of which a variety of 3D and 2D perovskite nanocrystals is preferentially self&#8208;assembled with characteristic PL, is presented. The SC of a BCP PC is controlled in the visible range with different perovskite precursor doping times. The perovskite nanocrystals developed in the BCP PC are highly luminescent, with a PL quantum yield of &#8776;33.7%, yielding environmentally stable SC and PL dual&#8208;mode displays. The independently programmed SC and PL information is erasable and rewritable. Dual&#8208;responsive optical encryption is demonstrated, in which true Morse code information is deciphered only when the information encoded by SCs is properly combined with PL information. Numerous combinations of SC and PL realize high security level of data anticounterfeiting. This dual&#8208;mode encryption display offers novel optical encryption with high information security and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Validating Operating Stability And Biosecurity Towards Biocompatible Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Wearable and implantable electronics are standing at the frontiers of science and technology, driven by the increasing demands from modernized lifestyles. Zinc&#8208;based batteries (ZBs) are regarded as ideal energy suppliers for these biocompatible electronics, but the corresponding biocompatibility validation is still in the initial stage. Meanwhile, complicated working conditions and some extreme electrolyte environments raise strict challenges, leaving less choices for biocompatible ZBs. Toward higher biocompatibility, we propose a hydrogel electrolyte featuring the moisture maintaining ability and a robust interface, which could further provide a milder environment for biocompatible Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries and Zn&#8208;air batteries. The cytotoxicity and tissue injury of batteries are evaluated with human cell lines and battery implantations on the animal models, which demonstrate the high biosecurity of biocompatible ZBs, while preliminary wearable devices implementation further verifies their operating stability. This work may provide a pathway for developing and validating biocompatible ZBs, contributing to their future practical employment in relevant fields.

         <title>Biomimetic Self&#8208;Maturation Mineralization System for Enamel Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Enamel repair is crucial for restoring tooth function and halting dental caries. However, contemporary research often overlooks the retention of organic residues within the repair layer, which hinders the growth of dense crystals and compromises the properties of the repaired enamel. During maturation of natural enamel, the organic matrix undergoes enzymatic processing to facilitate further crystal growth, resulting in a highly mineralized tissue. Inspired by this process, a biomimetic self&#8208;maturation mineralization system was developed, comprising RNA&#8208;stabilized amorphous calcium phosphate (RNA&#8208;ACP) and RNase. The RNA&#8208;ACP induced initial mineralization in the form of epitaxial crystal growth, while the RNase present in saliva automatically triggered a biomimetic self&#8208;maturation process. Mechanistic study further indicated that RNA degradation prompted conformational rearrangement of the RNA&#8208;ACP, effectively excluding the organic matter introduced earlier. This exclusion process promoted lateral crystal growth, resulting in the generation of denser enamel&#8208;like apatite crystals that were devoid of organic residues. This strategy of eliminating organic residues from enamel crystals enhanced the mechanical and physiochemical properties of the repaired enamel. The present study introduces a conceptual biomimetic mineralization strategy for effective enamel repair in clinical practice, and offers potential insights into the mechanisms of biomineral formation.

         <title>Strategies for the Nuclear Delivery of Metal Complexes to Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The nucleus is an essential organelle for the function of cells. It holds most of the genetic material and plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation. Since many antitumoral therapies target nucleic acids to induce cell death, tumor&#8208;specific nuclear drug delivery could potentiate therapeutic effects and prevent potential off&#8208;target side effects on healthy tissue. Due to their great structural variety, good biocompatibility and unique physico&#8208;chemical properties, organometallic complexes and other metal&#8208;based compounds have sparked great interest as promising anticancer agents. In this review, strategies for specific nuclear delivery of metal complexes are summarized and discussed to highlight crucial parameters to consider for the design of new metal complexes as anticancer drug candidates. Moreover, the existing opportunities and challenges of tumor&#8208;specific, nucleus&#8208;targeting metal complexes are emphasized to outline some new perspectives and help in the design of new cancer treatments.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Optical Detection and Elimination of Residual Microtumors with A Postoperative Implantable Hydrogel Sensor for Preventing Cancer Recurrence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In vivo optical imaging of trace biomarkers in residual microtumors holds significant promise for cancer prognosis but poses a formidable challenge. Here, we present a novel hydrogel sensor designed for ultrasensitive and specific imaging of the elusive biomarker. This hydrogel sensor seamlessly integrates a molecular beacon nanoprobe with fibroblasts, offering both high tissue retention capability and an impressive signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio for imaging. Signal amplification is accomplished through exonuclease I&#8208;mediated biomarker recycling. The resulting hydrogel sensor sensitively detected the biomarker carcinoembryonic antigen with a detection limit of 1.8 pg/mL in test tubes. Moreover, it successfully identified residual cancer nodules with a median diameter of less than 2&#160;mm in mice bearing partially removed primary triple&#8208;negative breast carcinomas (4T1). Notably, this hydrogel sensor was proven effective for the sensitive diagnosis of invasive tumors in post&#8208;surgical mice with infiltrating 4T1 cells, leveraging the role of fibroblasts in locally enriching tumor cells. Furthermore, the residual microtumor is rapidly photothermal ablation by polydopamine&#8208;based nanoprobe under the guidance of visualization, achieving nearly 100% suppression of tumor recurrence and lung metastasis. Our work offers a promising alternative strategy for visually detecting residual microtumors, potentially enhancing the prognosis of cancer patients following surgical interventions.

         <title>Constructing Ultra&#8208;Shallow Near&#8208;Edge States for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electronic band structure engineering of metal&#8208;halide perovskites (MHP) lies at the core of fundamental materials research and photovoltaic applications. However, reconfiguring the band structures in MHP for optimized electronic properties remains challenging. Here, we report a generic strategy for constructing near&#8208;edge states to improve carrier properties, leading to enhanced device performances. The near&#8208;edge states are designed around the valence band edge using theoretical prediction and constructed through tailored material engineering. These states are experimentally revealed with activation energies of around 23 milli&#8208;electron volts by temperature&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy. Such small activation energies enable prolonged carrier lifetime with efficient carrier transition dynamics and low non&#8208;radiative recombination losses, as corroborated by the millisecond lifetimes of microwave conductivity. By constructing near&#8208;edge states in positive&#8208;intrinsic&#8208;negative inverted cells, we achieve a champion efficiency of 25.4% (25.0% certified) for a 0.07&#8208;cm2 cell and 23.6% (22.7% certified) for a 1&#8208;cm2 cell. The most stable encapsulated cell retains 90% of its initial efficiency after 1,100 hours of maximum power point tracking under one sun illumination (100&#160;mW/cm2) at 65 &#176;C in ambient air.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Adaptive Pyroptosis Inducer: Optimizing the Catalytic Microenvironment of Nanozymes by Membrane&#8208;Adhered Microbe Enables Potent Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs a self&#8208;adaptive pyroptosis inducer to optimize catalytic performance of nanozyme by the respiration of membrane&#8208;adhered microbe, which induces eruptive ROS to trigger pyroptosis for potent cancer immunotherapy. The utilization of self&#8208;adaptive pyroptosis inducer will motivate the development of self&#8208;adaptive nano&#8208;catalytic drugs for cancer immunotherapy and provide new insights into the treatments of other diseases.








Abstract
Pyroptosis has garnered increasing attention in cancer immunotherapy. Moreover, increasing plasma membrane damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is considered an effective strategy for promoting pyroptosis. However, the current tactics for enhancing membrane rupture in pyroptosis are limited by the inherent drawbacks of ROS and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Herein, a self&#8208;adaptive pyroptosis inducer (LPZ) is designed by integrating Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and an enzyme&#8208;like metal&#8208;organic framework to achieve potent pyroptosis immunotherapy. LPZ can adhere to cancer cell membranes through the interaction between the pili of LGG and the mucin of cancer cells. In particular, the adaptive formula can gradually enhance the ability of nanozymes to produce ROS by creating an acidic microenvironment through anaerobic respiration. These results verify that LPZ could generate high levels of ROS both on the membrane and within cancer cells, leading to pyroptotic cell death and strong antitumor immunity. Meanwhile, LGG are eventually killed by ROS in this process to halt their respiration and prevent potential biosafety concerns. Overall, this work provides new inspiration for the design of self&#8208;adaptive nanocatalytic drugs for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>ACE2 Receptor&#8208;Targeted Inhaled Nanoemulsions Inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Attenuate Inflammatory Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peptide&#8208;modified inhaled nanoemulsions (NEs) are developed, which can target the Angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in airway epithelial cells. The inhaled remdesivir NEs inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection and replication. The inhaled drug delivery system loaded with anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs can significantly alleviate the lung tissue injury of mice.








Abstract
Three kinds of coronaviruses are highly pathogenic to humans, and two of them mainly infect humans through Angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 &#65288;ACE2&#65289;receptors. Therefore, specifically blocking ACE2 binding at the interface with the receptor&#8208;binding domain is promising to achieve both preventive and therapeutic effects of coronaviruses. Alternatively, drug&#8208;targeted delivery based on ACE2 receptors can further improve the efficacy and safety of inhalation drugs. Here, these two approaches are innovatively combined by designing a nanoemulsion (NE) drug delivery system (termed NE&#8208;AYQ) for inhalation that targets binding to ACE2 receptors. This inhalation&#8208;delivered remdesivir nanoemulsion (termed RDSV&#8208;NE&#8208;AYQ) effectively inhibits the infection of target cells by both wild&#8208;type and mutant viruses. The RDSV&#8208;NE&#8208;AYQ strongly inhibits Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at two dimensions: they not only block the binding of the virus to host cells at the cell surface but also restrict virus replication intracellularly. Furthermore, in the mouse model of acute lung injury, the inhaled drug delivery system loaded with anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs (TPCA&#8208;1&#8208;NE&#8208;AYQ) can significantly alleviate the lung tissue injury of mice.

     alt="ACE2 Receptor-Targeted Inhaled Nanoemulsions Inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and Attenuate Inflammatory Responses"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A peptide-modified inhaled nanoemulsions (NEs) are developed, which can target the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in airway epithelial cells. The inhaled remdesivir NEs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. The inhaled drug delivery system loaded with anti-inflammatory drugs can significantly alleviate the lung tissue injury of mice.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three kinds of coronaviruses are highly pathogenic to humans, and two of them mainly infect humans through Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 &#65288;ACE2&#65289;receptors. Therefore, specifically blocking ACE2 binding at the interface with the receptor-binding domain is promising to achieve both preventive and therapeutic effects of coronaviruses. Alternatively, drug-targeted delivery based on ACE2 receptors can further improve the efficacy and safety of inhalation drugs. Here, these two approaches are innovatively combined by designing a nanoemulsion (NE) drug delivery system (termed NE-AYQ) for inhalation that targets binding to ACE2 receptors. This inhalation-delivered remdesivir nanoemulsion (termed RDSV-NE-AYQ) effectively inhibits the infection of target cells by both wild-type and mutant viruses. The RDSV-NE-AYQ strongly inhibits Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at two dimensions: they not only block the binding of the virus to host cells at the cell surface but also restrict virus replication intracellularly. Furthermore, in the mouse model of acute lung injury, the inhaled drug delivery system loaded with anti-inflammatory drugs (TPCA-1-NE-AYQ) can significantly alleviate the lung tissue injury of mice. This smart combination provides a new choice for dealing with possible emergencies in the future and for the rapid development of inhaled drugs for the treatment of respiratory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hard Magnetic Graphene Nanocomposite for Multimodal, Reconfigurable Soft Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The HMGN combines the advantages of porous conductive materials and hard magnetic materials to enable multimodal, reconfigurable soft electronics with magnetism&#8208;enhanced sensing performance and magnetism&#8208;assisted electrical interconnection, allowing for wearable sensing with customizable sensitivity, modality, and spatial coverage.








Abstract
Soft electronics provide effective means for continuous monitoring of a diverse set of biophysical and biochemical signals from the human body. However, the sensitivities, functions, spatial distributions, and many other features of such sensors remain fixed after deployment and cannot be adjusted on demand. Here, laser&#8208;induced porous graphene is exploited as the sensing material, and dope it with permanent magnetic particles to create hard magnetic graphene nanocomposite (HMGN) that can self&#8208;assemble onto a flexible carrying substrate through magnetic force, in a reversible and reconfigurable manner. A set of soft electronics in HMGN exhibits enhanced performances in the measurements of electrophysiological signals, temperature, and concentrations of metabolites. All these flexible HMGN sensors can adhere to a carrying substrate at any position and in any spatial arrangement, to allow for wearable sensing with customizable sensitivity, modality, and spatial coverage. The HMGN represents a promising material for constructing soft electronics that can be reconfigured for various applications.

         <title>Electron Localization&#8208;Triggered Proton Pumping Toward Cu Single Atoms for Electrochemical CO2 Methanation of Unprecedented Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;bird strategy of electron transfer and directional *H transport enabled by electron localization is developed. VBi as an initiator can induce the electron localization at Cu single atoms, which enhances the adsorption and activation of CO2 in single&#8208;atom Cu sites for electrocatalytic CH4 synthesis of unprecedented selectivity, apart from acting as active sites of H2O dissociation and pumping proton.








Abstract
Slow multi&#8208;proton coupled electron transfer kinetics and unexpected desorption of intermediates severely hinder the selectivity of CO2 methanation. In this work, a one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;bird strategy of pumping protons and improving adsorption configuration/capability enabled by electron localization is developed to be highly efficient for CH4 electrosynthesis over Cu single atoms anchored on bismuth vacancies of BiVO4 (Bi1&#8208;xVO4&#9472;Cu), with superior kinetic isotope effect and high CH4 Faraday efficiency (92%), far outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts for CO2 methanation. Control experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the bismuth vacancies (VBi) not only act as active sites for H2O dissociation but also induce electron transfer toward Cu single&#8208;atom sites. The VBi&#8208;induced electron localization pumps *H from VBi sites to Cu single atoms, significantly promoting the generation and stabilization of the pivotal intermediate (*CHO) for highly selective CH4 electrosynthesis. The metal vacancies as new initiators show enormous potential in the proton transfer&#8208;involved hydrogenative conversion processes.

         <title>Ultrafast Negative Capacitance Transition for 2D Ferroelectric MoS2/Graphene Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The subthreshold swing (SS) serves as the key performance parameter for high&#8208;speed and low&#8208;power electronics. Boltzmann distribution limits the SS to 60&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 in conventional field effect transistors. Here, in a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device architecture, ultralow SS across the five decades of drain current is&#160;achieved by utilizing efficient Dirac contacts and ultrafast negative&#8208;capacitance transition in layered ferroelectric gate insulator.








Abstract
Negative capacitance gives rise to subthreshold swing (SS) below the fundamental limit by efficient modulation of surface potential in transistors. While negative&#8208;capacitance transition is reported in polycrystalline Pb(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 (PZT) and HfZrO2 (HZO) thin&#8208;films in few microseconds timescale, low SS is not persistent over a wide range of drain current when used instead of conventional dielectrics. In this work, the clear nano&#8208;second negative transition states in 2D single&#8208;crystal CuInP2S6 (CIPS) flakes have been demonstrated by an alternative fast&#8208;transient measurement technique. Further, integrating this ultrafast NC transition with the localized density of states of Dirac contacts and controlled charge transfer in the CIPS/channel (MoS2/graphene) a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device architecture, negative capacitance Dirac source drain field effect transistor (FET) is introduced. This yields an ultralow SS of 4.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 with an average sub&#8208;10 SS across five decades with on&#8208;off ratio exceeding 107, by simultaneous improvement of transport and body factors in monolayer MoS2&#8208;based FET, outperforming all previous reports. This approach could pave the way to achieve ultralow&#8208;SS FETs for future high&#8208;speed and low&#8208;power electronics.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Protein&#8208;Escaping Dyes Enable High&#8208;Contrast and Long&#8208;Term Prognosis Evaluation of Flap Transplantation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein&#8208;escaping dyes are designed to exhibit a low affinity for serum proteins, allowing them to avoid in situ covalent binding with proteins while maintaining much&#8208;enhanced imaging contrast. These dyes enable short&#8208;term repeatable injections for vascular imaging, serving as a noninvasive and reliable method for monitoring flap viability after transplantation.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time vascular positioning, postoperative flap monitoring, and vascular reconstruction assessment are of great importance in flap transplantation. Cyanine dyes offer the advantage of high resolution in the Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II)&#160;imaging window. However, the nonspecific binding of many cyanine dyes to endogenous albumin leads to high organ accumulation and skin absorption, resulting in low&#8208;quality imaging and poor reproducibility of contrast during long&#8208;term (e.g., 7 days) postoperative monitoring. Here, a novel strategy is proposed that can be widely applied to prevent protein binding for NIR&#8208;I/II&#160;Cl&#8208;containing cyanine dyes. This strategy produces protein&#8208;escaping dyes, ensuring high fluorescence enhancement in the blood with rapid clearance and no residual fluorescence, allowing for short&#8208;term repeatable injections for vascular imaging. This strategy in the perioperative monitoring of pedicle perforator flap models in mice and rats is successfully applied. Furthermore, leveraging the universality of this strategy, multiple nonoverlapping protein&#8208;escaping probes that achieve dual&#8208;excitation (808 and 1064&#160;nm) interference&#8208;free imaging of nerve&#8208;vessel and tumor&#8208;vessel simultaneously are designed and synthesized. These protein&#8208;escaping dyes enable long&#8208;term repeatable dual&#8208;color imaging of tumor localization, resection, and tumor&#8208;vessel reconstruction at the wound site.

         <title>Pericardial Delivery of SDF&#8208;1&#945; Puerarin Hydrogel Promotes Heart&#160;Repair and Electrical Coupling</title>

Although the SDF&#8208;1&#945;/CXCR4 is effective for MI treatment, excessive monocytes/macrophages recruitment or activation can cause unwanted inflammation simultaneously. More seriously, the increased inflammation contributes to abnormal cardiomyocyte electrical coupling. The degradable SDF&#8208;1&#945;@PUE hydrogel simultaneously enhances the recruitment of endogenous cells and reverses the adverse effects, which improves cardiac function and reduces the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.








Abstract
The stromal&#8208;derived factor 1&#945;/chemokine receptor 4 (SDF&#8208;1&#945;/CXCR4)&#160;axis contributes to myocardial protection after myocardial infarction (MI) by recruiting endogenous stem cells into the ischemic tissue. However, excessive inflammatory macrophages are also recruited simultaneously, aggravating myocardial damage. More seriously, the increased inflammation contributes to abnormal cardiomyocyte electrical coupling, leading to inhomogeneities in ventricular conduction and retarded conduction velocity. It is highly desirable to selectively recruit the stem cells but block the inflammation. In this work, SDF&#8208;1&#945;&#8208;encapsulated Puerarin (PUE) hydrogel (SDF&#8208;1&#945;@PUE) is capable of enhancing endogenous stem cell homing and simultaneously polarizing the recruited monocyte/macrophages into a repairing phenotype. Flow cytometry analysis of the treated heart tissue shows that endogenous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, hemopoietic stem cells, and immune cells are recruited while SDF&#8208;1&#945;@PUE efficiently polarizes the recruited monocytes/macrophages into the M2 type. These macrophages influence the preservation of connexin 43 (Cx43) expression which modulates intercellular coupling and improves electrical conduction. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the improved &#8220;soil&#8221;, the recruited stem cells mediate an improved cardiac function by preventing deterioration, promoting neovascular architecture, and reducing infarct size. These findings demonstrate a promising therapeutic platform for MI that not only facilitates heart regeneration but also reduces the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.

         <title>Modulating Charge Separation of Oxygen&#8208;Doped Boron Nitride with Isolated Co Atoms for Enhancing CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated Co atoms are successfully anchored on oxygen&#8208;doped boron nitride (Co/BNF) to enhance photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. The uniformly dispersed Co atoms with a CoO2N1 coordination geometry play an essential role in promoting the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and lowering the reaction energy barriers, thus boosting the activity and selectivity of Co/BNF for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.








Abstract
To alleviate the greenhouse effect and address the related energy crisis, solar&#8208;driven reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to value&#8208;added products is considered as a sustainable strategy. However, the insufficient separation and rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers during photocatalysis greatly limit their reduction efficiency and practical application potential. Here, isolated Cobalt (Co) atoms are successfully decorated into oxygen&#8208;doped boron nitride (BN)&#160;via an in situ pyrolysis method, achieving greatly improved catalytic activity and selectivity to the carbon monoxide (CO) product. X&#8208;ray absorption fine spectroscopy demonstrates that the isolated Co atoms are stabilized by the O and N atoms with an unsaturated CoO2N1 configuration. Further experimental investigation and theoretical simulations confirm that the decorated Co atoms not only work as the real active center during the CO2 reduction process, but also perform as the electron pump to promote the electron/hole separation and transfer, resulting in greatly accelerated reaction kinetics and improved activity. In addition, the CoO2N1 coordination geometry is favorable to the conversion from *CO2 to *COOH, which shall be considered as a selectivity&#8208;determining step for the evolution of the CO products. The surface modulation strategy at the atomic level opens a new avenue for regulating the reaction kinetics for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Assisted Surface Modification of Lithium&#8208;Rich Manganese&#8208;Based Oxide toward High Anionic Redox Reversibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;assisted modification is introduced for the construction of SnS2&#8722;x&#8722;&#963;Oy coating and sulfur atoms substituting lattice oxygen. The sulfur anions in the lattice enhance the reversibility of the anionic redox by modulating the band of the redox&#8208;active center. The additional coating effectively traps the escaping active oxygen, and the trapped oxygen and coating return to the pristine upon discharge.








Abstract
Energy storage via anionic redox provides extra capacity for lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxide cathodes at high voltage but causes gradual structural collapse and irreversible capacity loss with generation of On&#8722; (0 &#8804; n &lt; 2) species upon deep oxidation. Herein, the stability and reversibility of anionic redox reactions are enhanced by a simple sulfur&#8208;assisted surface modification method, which not only modulates the material's energy band allowing feasible electron release from both bonding and antibonding bands, but also traps the escaping On&#8722; via an as&#8208;constructed SnS2&#8722;x&#8722;&#963;Oy coating layer and return them to the host lattice upon discharge. The regulation of anionic redox inhibits the irreversible structural transformation and parasitic reactions, maintaining the specific capacity retention of as&#8208;modified cathode up to 94% after 200 cycles at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1, along with outstanding voltage stability. The reported strategy incorporating energy band modulation and oxygen trapping is promising for the design and advancement of other cathodes storing energy through anion redox.

         <title>Modular Aptamer Switches for the Continuous Optical Detection of Small&#8208;Molecule Analytes in Complex Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A duplex&#8208;bubble switch architecture enables precise modulation of kinetics and thermodynamics without prior knowledge of the ligand binding site. Its integration with fiber&#8208;optic probes and applicability in real&#8208;time optical detection by achieving reversible and binding&#8208;induced fluorescence responses to dopamine and cortisol in complex matrices are demonstrated. This approach promises a universal solution for rapid aptamer&#8208;based sensor development in biomedical applications.








Abstract
Aptamers are a promising class of affinity reagents because signal transduction mechanisms can&#160;be built into the reagent, so that they can directly produce a physically measurable output signal upon target binding. However, endowing the signal transduction functionality into an aptamer remains a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error process that can compromise its affinity or specificity and typically requires knowledge of the ligand binding domain or its structure. In this work, a design architecture that can convert an existing aptamer into a &#8220;reversible aptamer switch&#8221; whose kinetic and thermodynamic properties can be tuned without a priori knowledge of the ligand binding domain or its structure is described. Finally, by combining these aptamer switches with evanescent&#8208;field&#8208;based optical detection hardware that minimizes sample autofluorescence, this study demonstrates the first optical biosensor system that can continuously measure multiple biomarkers (dopamine and cortisol) in complex samples (artificial cerebrospinal fluid and undiluted plasma) with second and subsecond&#8208;scale time responses at physiologically relevant concentration ranges.

This study unveils the synthesis of a robust, bifunctional electrocatalyst via the electrochemical evolution of Ru&#8208;based polyoxometalates into Si,W&#8208;codoped RuOx (RuSiW) for efficient acidic water splitting. Exploiting the synergistic effects of Si and W codoping, RuSiW catalyst achieves remarkable activity and stability for acidic hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions.








Abstract
Despite intensive studies over decades, the development of electrocatalysts for acidic water splitting still relies on platinum group metals, especially Pt and Ir, which are scarce, expensive, and poorly sustainable. Because such problems can be alleviated, Ru&#8208;based bifunctional catalysts such as rutile RuO2 have recently emerged. However, RuO2 has a relatively low activity for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and low stability for oxygen evolution reactions (OER) under acidic conditions. In this study, the synthesis of a RuOx&#8208;based bifunctional catalyst (RuSiW) for acidic water splitting via the electrochemical evolution from Ru&#8208;based polyoxometalates at cathodic potentials is reported. RuSiW consists of the nanocrystalline RuO2 core and Si,W&#8208;codoped RuOx shell. RuSiW exhibits outstanding HER and OER activity comparable to Pt/C and RuO2, respectively, with high stability. Computational analysis suggests that the codoping of RuOx with W and Si synergistically improves the HER activity of otherwise poor RuO2 by shifting the d&#8208;band center and optimizing atomic configurations beneficial for proper hydrogen adsorption. This study provides insights into the design and synthesis of unprecedented bifunctional electrocatalysts using catalytically inactive and less explored elements, such as Si and W.

         <title>Humidity/Oxygen&#8208;Insensitive Organic Synaptic Transistors Based on Optical Radical Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The improvement of the stability and environmental durability of organic electronics is a challenge for the promising applications in universal environments. Herein, a stable organic photosynaptic transistor based on a photoinitiator is developed with broad operation capabilities in vacuum, dried air, and high&#8208;humidity environment. This design provides a promising platform for long&#8208;term stable organic synaptic electronics.








Abstract
For most organic synaptic transistors based on the charge trapping effect, different atmosphere conditions lead to significantly different device performance. Some devices even lose the synaptic responses under vacuum or inert atmosphere. The stable device performance of these organic synaptic transistors under varied working environments with different humidity and oxygen levels can be a challenge. Herein, a moisture&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;insensitive organic synaptic device based on the organic semiconductor and photoinitiator molecules is reported. Unlike the widely reported charge trapping effect, the photoinduced free radical is utilized to realize the photosynaptic performance. The resulting synaptic transistor displays typical excitatory postsynaptic current, paired&#8208;pulse facilitation, learning, and forgetting behaviors. Furthermore, the device exhibits decent and stable photosynaptic performances under high humidity and vacuum conditions. This type of organic synaptic device also demonstrates high potential in ultraviolet B perception based on its environmental stability and broad ultraviolet detection capability. Finally, the contrast&#8208;enhanced capability of the device is successfully validated by the single&#8208;layer&#8208;perceptron/double&#8208;layer network based Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology pattern recognition. This work could have important implications for the development of next&#8208;generation environment&#8208;stable organic synaptic devices and systems.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Functional MXene&#8208;Based Bioanode for Wearable Self&#8208;Charging Biosupercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;functional MXene&#8208;based bioanode is prepared with a 3D hierarchical structure for wearable self&#8208;charging biosupercapacitors. The device is designed in the &#8220;island&#8211;bridge&#8221; structure, and successfully realizes conformal and adhesion with human skin in a flexible environment. The skin&#8208;mountable device exhibits superior energy harvesting and storing performance from human sweat under both relaxed and stretching conditions.








Abstract
As a reliable energy&#8208;supply platform for wearable electronics, biosupercapacitors combine the characteristics of biofuel cells and supercapacitors to harvest and store the energy from human's sweat. However, the bulky preparation process and deep embedding of enzyme active sites in bioelectrodes usually limit the energy&#8208;harvesting process, retarding the practical power&#8208;supply sceneries especially during the complicated in vivo motion. Herein, a MXene/single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube/lactate oxidase hierarchical structure as the dual&#8208;functional bioanode is designed, which can not only provide a superior 3D catalytic microenvironment for enzyme accommodation to harvest energy from sweat, but also offers sufficient capacitance to store energy via the electrical double&#8208;layer capacitor. A wearable biosupercapacitor is fabricated in the &#8220;island&#8211;bridge&#8221; structure with a composite bioanode, active carbon/Pt cathode, polyacrylamide hydrogel substrate, and liquid metal conductor. The device exhibits an open&#8208;circuit voltage&#160;of 0.48&#160;V and the high power density of 220.9 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The compact conformal adhesion with skin is successfully maintained under stretching/bending conditions. After repeatedly stretching the devices, there is no significant power attenuation in pulsed output. The unique bioelectrode structure and attractive energy harvesting/storing properties demonstrate the promising potential of this biosupercapacitor as a micro self&#8208;powered platform of wearable electronics.

         <title>Enhancing the Carrier Transport in Monolayer MoS2 through Interlayer Coupling with 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacing of monolayer MoS2 with 2DCOF films determines a major enhancement in the charge transport through the 2D semiconductor. Electron doping intensity is amplified by the superlattice's long&#8208;range order, while the lattice vibration is suppressed by the high mechanical stiffness yielding a confinement effect. The MoS2 /2D&#8208;COF heterostructures represent a novel strategy to develop high&#8208;performance 2D electronics.








Abstract
The coupling of different 2D materials (2DMs) to form van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) is a powerful strategy for adjusting the electronic properties of 2D semiconductors, for applications in opto&#8208;electronics and quantum computing. 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) represents an archetypical semiconducting, monolayer thick versatile platform for the generation of hybrid vdWH with tunable charge transport characteristics through its interfacing with molecules and assemblies thereof. However, the physisorption of (macro)molecules on 2D MoS2 yields hybrids possessing a limited thermal stability, thereby jeopardizing their technological applications. Herein, the rational design and optimized synthesis of 2D covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) for the generation of MoS2/2D&#8208;COF vdWHs exhibiting strong interlayer coupling effects are reported. The high crystallinity of the 2D&#8208;COF films makes it possible to engineer an ultrastable periodic doping effect on MoS2, boosting devices&#8217; field&#8208;effect mobility at room temperature. Such a performance increase can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the efficient interfacial electron transfer process and the pronounced suppression of MoS2&#8217;s lattice vibration. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept work validates an unprecedented approach for the efficient modulation of the electronic properties of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides toward high&#8208;performance (opto)electronics for CMOS digital circuits.

         <title>Overcoming Barriers Associated with Oral Delivery of Differently Sized Fluorescent Core&#8208;Shell Silica Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interactions between poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;coated (PEGylated) core&#8208;shell silica nanoparticles (5&#8211;50) nm and major barriers associated with oral delivery are studied. Ultrasmall nanoparticles (&lt;10 nm) rapidly diffuse through intestinal mucus, passively permeate intestinal epithelial cell layers, and are found in mouse urine after oral gavage. Together with earlier in vivo results, suggest these nanoparticles are promising candidates for oral administration.








Abstract
Oral delivery, while a highly desirable form of nanoparticle&#8208;drug administration, is limited by challenges associated with overcoming several biological barriers. Here, the authors study how fluorescent and poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;coated (PEGylated) core&#8208;shell silica nanoparticles sized 5 to 50&#160;nm interact with major barriers including intestinal mucus, intestinal epithelium, and stomach acid. From imaging fluorescence correlation spectroscopy studies using quasi&#8208;total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, diffusion of nanoparticles through highly scattering mucus is progressively hindered above a critical hydrodynamic size around 20&#160;nm. By studying Caco&#8208;2 cell monolayers mimicking the intestinal epithelia, it is observed that ultrasmall nanoparticles below 10&#160;nm diameter (Cornell prime dots, [C&#8217; dots]) show permeabilities correlated with high absorption in humans from primarily enhanced passive passage through tight junctions.

     alt="Overcoming Barriers Associated with Oral Delivery of Differently Sized Fluorescent Core-Shell Silica Nanoparticles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interactions between poly(ethylene glycol)-coated (PEGylated) core-shell silica nanoparticles (5&#8211;50) nm and major barriers associated with oral delivery are studied. Ultrasmall nanoparticles (&amp;lt;10 nm) rapidly diffuse through intestinal mucus, passively permeate intestinal epithelial cell layers, and are found in mouse urine after oral gavage. Together with earlier in vivo results, suggest these nanoparticles are promising candidates for oral administration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oral delivery, while a highly desirable form of nanoparticle-drug administration, is limited by challenges associated with overcoming several biological barriers. Here, the authors study how fluorescent and poly(ethylene glycol)-coated (PEGylated) core-shell silica nanoparticles sized 5 to 50&#160;nm interact with major barriers including intestinal mucus, intestinal epithelium, and stomach acid. From imaging fluorescence correlation spectroscopy studies using quasi-total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, diffusion of nanoparticles through highly scattering mucus is progressively hindered above a critical hydrodynamic size around 20&#160;nm. By studying Caco-2 cell monolayers mimicking the intestinal epithelia, it is observed that ultrasmall nanoparticles below 10&#160;nm diameter (Cornell prime dots, [C&#8217; dots]) show permeabilities correlated with high absorption in humans from primarily enhanced passive passage through tight junctions. Particles above 20&#160;nm diameter exclusively show active transport through cells. After establishing C&#8217; dot stability in artificial gastric juice, in vivo oral gavage experiments in mice demonstrate successful passage through the body followed by renal clearance without protein corona formation. Results suggest C&#8217; dots as viable candidates for oral administration to patients with a proven pathway towards clinical translation and may generate renewed interest in examining silica as a food additive and its effects on nutrition and health.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>MOFs for Ultrahigh Efficiency Pulsed Laser Micropropulsion</title>

Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), which are composed of metal cations and organic ligands forming ordered structures through coordination, with their unique composition eliminating the problem of local hot zones and uneven mixing encountered in laser micropropulsion (LMP), allowing for enhanced propulsion efficiency.








Abstract
Conventional propellant materials, such as polymers and single metal elements, have long been investigated for their potential in pulsed laser micropropulsion (LMP) technology. However, achieving superior LMP efficiency through physical mixing of these materials remains a significant challenge. This study presents a paradigm shift by introducing porous crystalline polymers, known as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), as novel propellants in pulsed LMP. MOFs are composed of metal cations and organic ligands that form ordered structures through coordination, eliminating the problem of local hot zones arising from uneven physical mixing encountered in LMP. In direct comparison to conventional polymers and single element targets, MOFs exhibit substantially higher LMP efficiency. By precisely tailoring the metal atom fraction within MOFs, an extraordinary ultrahigh efficiency of 51.15% is achieved in pulsed LMP, surpassing the performance of similar materials previously reported in the literature. This pioneering application of MOFs not only revolutionizes the field of LMP but also opens up new frontiers for MOF utilization in various energy applications.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Biohybrid Microstructures Enable Transplantation and Vascularization of Microtissues in the Anterior Chamber of the Eye</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transplanting 3D&#8208;printed biohybrid microstructures to the anterior chamber of the eye (ACE) with the aim of vascular engraftment is investigated. The ACE is an ideal platform for studying interactions between host tissues and transplant, as well as for biomedical device trans/&#8208;implantation. The results identify pupillary dynamics as an effective factor involved in graft integrity to the host. Microstructures that provide a more static configuration lead to successful vascularization even in a no&#8208;contact mode (to the vessel source) and a fluidic microenvironment.








Abstract
Hybridizing biological cells with man&#8208;made sensors enable the detection of a wide range of weak physiological responses with high specificity. The anterior chamber of the eye (ACE) is an ideal transplantation site due to its ocular immune privilege and optical transparency, which enable superior noninvasive longitudinal analyses of cells and microtissues. Engraftment of biohybrid microstructures in the ACE may, however, be affected by the pupillary response and dynamics. Here, sutureless transplantation of biohybrid microstructures, 3D printed in IP&#8208;Visio photoresin, containing a precisely localized pancreatic islet to the ACE of mice is presented. The biohybrid microstructures allow mechanical fixation in the ACE, independent of iris dynamics. After transplantation, islets in the microstructures successfully sustain their functionality for over 20 weeks and become vascularized despite physical separation from the vessel source (iris) and immersion in a low&#8208;viscous liquid (aqueous humor) with continuous circulation and clearance. This approach opens new perspectives in biohybrid microtissue transplantation in the ACE, advancing monitoring of microtissue&#8211;host interactions, disease modeling, treatment outcomes, and vascularization in engineered tissues.

         <title>Conducting Polymer Nanoparticles with Intrinsic Aqueous Dispersibility for Conductive Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable, dispersible conductive particles are simply afforded via acid crystallization of commercial poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrenesulfonate) in solution. The particles feature a tunable internal surfactant which enables intrinsic aqueous processibility for incorporation within hydrogels without complex additives or surfactants. The particles are loaded into a resin and printed via microstereolithography, offering hydrogels with biocompatibility, structural fidelity, and high conductivity (1&#8211;10 S cm&#8722;1).








Abstract
Conductive hydrogels are promising materials with mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conduction to interface living tissue (ionic signal transmission) with medical devices (electronic signal transmission). The hydrogel form factor also uniquely bridges the wet/soft biological environment with the dry/hard environment of electronics. The synthesis of hydrogels for bioelectronics requires scalable, biocompatible fillers with high electronic conductivity and compatibility with common aqueous hydrogel formulations/resins. Despite significant advances in the processing of carbon nanomaterials, fillers that satisfy all these requirements are lacking. Herein, intrinsically dispersible acid&#8208;crystalized PEDOT:PSS nanoparticles (ncrys&#8208;PEDOTX) are reported which are processed through a facile and scalable nonsolvent induced phase separation method from commercial PEDOT:PSS without complex instrumentation. The particles feature conductivities of up to 410 S cm&#8722;1, and when compared to other common conductive fillers, display remarkable dispersibility, enabling homogeneous incorporation at relatively high loadings within diverse aqueous biomaterial solutions without additives or surfactants. The aqueous dispersibility of the ncrys&#8208;PEDOTX particles also allows simple incorporation into resins designed for microstereolithography without sonication or surfactant optimization; complex biomedical structures with fine features (&lt; 150 &#181;m)&#160;are&#160;printed with up to 10% particle loading . The ncrys&#8208;PEDOTX particles overcome the challenges of traditional conductive fillers, providing a scalable, biocompatible, plug&#8208;and&#8208;play platform for soft organic bioelectronic materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Area&#8208;Emissive White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistor for Full&#8208;Color Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uniform area&#8208;emissive white OLET device with an efficiency of 13.9% is realized by incorporating phosphorescent blue emissive and fluorescent yellow emissive guests in the active layer based on a unique lateral&#8208;integrated device configuration, which is the highest value in the field and demonstrates great potential for full&#8208;color display as backlight source for the first time.








Abstract
The construction of high&#8208;performance white organic light&#8208;emitting transistor (OLET) with uniform area emission is crucial for smart display technologies but remains greatly challenging. Herein, high&#8208;efficiency uniform area&#8208;emissive OLETs based on a unique lateral&#8208;integrated device configuration which incorporates efficient energy transfer of phosphorescent and fluorescent guests, enabling color&#8208;tunable and white emission, are demonstrated. Through precisely regulating the energy transfer between host and guests, high external quantum efficiency of 13.9% for white&#8208;emission OLETs is achieved due to the improved high exciton utilization and light outcoupling efficiency which is the highest value reported so far for OLETs and prevents exciton&#8208;charge annihilation and electrode photon losses. Moreover, good loop stability is also achieved, along with effective gate tunability and ultralow driving voltage of below 5&#160;V. Finally, a 4 &#215; 6 white&#8208;emission OLET array for full&#8208;color display is demonstrated for the first time, suggesting its great potential applications for advanced display technologies.

         <title>Rejuvenating Aged Perovskite Quantum Dots for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ defect healing treatment is reported to rejuvenate the aged perovskite quantum dots (PQDs), which could effectively heal the surface matrix defects and revive the morphology of aged PQDs, substantially improving the optoelectronic properties and orientation of PQD solids. Consequently, solar cells fabricated using rejuvenated PQDs show comparable photovoltaic performance with the control solar cells.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) have emerged as one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation solar cells owing to its remarkable optoelectronic properties and solution processability. However, the optoelectronic properties of PQDs suffer from severe degradation in storage due to the dynamically binding ligands, predominantly affecting photovoltaic applications. Herein, an in situ defect healing treatment (DHT) is reported to effectively rejuvenate aged PQDs. Systematically, experimental studies and theoretical calculations are performed to fundamentally understand the causes leading to the recovered optoelectronic properties of aged PQDs. The results reveal that the I3&#8722; anions produced from tetra&#8208;n&#8208;octylammonium iodide and iodine could strongly anchor on the surface matrix defects of aged PQDs, substantially diminishing the nonradiative recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Meanwhile, an DHT could also renovate the morphology of aged PQDs and thus improve the stacking orientation of PQD solids, substantially ameliorating charge carrier transport within PQD solids. Consequently, by using a DHT, the PQD solar cell (PQDSC) yields a high efficiency of up to 15.88%, which is comparable with the PQDSCs fabricated using fresh PQDs. Meanwhile, the stability of PQDSCs fabricated using the rejuvenated PQDs is also largely improved.

         <title>In Situ Formation of 2D Perovskite Seeding for Record&#8208;Efficiency Indoor Perovskite Photovoltaic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the issue of efficiency loss due to increased cell size for indoor perovskite photovoltaics by developing an in situ pre&#8208;nucleation strategy is addressed. A trace amount of &#946;&#8208;alaninamide hydrochloride (AHC) is introduced into the perovskite precursor solution, which spontaneously reacts with PbI2 to form 2D perovskite seed crystals to facilitate 3D perovskite growth.








Abstract
With 40% efficiency under room light intensity, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) will be promising power supplies for low&#8208;light applications, particularly for Internet of Things (IoT) devices and indoor electronics, shall they become commercialized. Herein, &#946;&#8208;alaninamide hydrochloride (AHC) is utilized to spontaneously form a layer of 2D perovskite nucleation seeds for improved film uniformity, crystallization quality, and solar cell performance. It is found that the AHC addition indeed improves film quality as demonstrated by better uniformity, lower trap density, smaller lattice stress, and, as a result, a 10&#8208;fold increase in charge carrier lifetime. Consequently, not only does the small&#8208;area (0.09 cm2) PSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency of 42.12%, the large&#8208;area cells (1.00 cm2, and 2.56 cm2) attain efficiency as high as 40.93%, and 40.07% respectively. All of these are the highest efficiency values for indoor photovoltaic cells with similar sizes, and more importantly, they represent the smallest efficiency loss due to area scale&#8208;up. This work provides a new method to fabricate high&#8208;performance indoor PSCs (i&#8208;PSCs) for IoT devices with great potential in large&#8208;area printing technology.

         <title>A Practical Approach Toward Highly Reproducible and High&#8208;Quality Perovskite Films Based on an Aging Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quality and reproducibility of perovskite thin films are severely influenced by spin&#8208;coating parameters and annealing conditions. Here, a facile and cost&#8208;effective aging treatment is developed to improve film coverage and uniformity. The resulting devices achieve higher device performance reproducibility and impressive operational stability under both air and vacuum conditions.








Abstract
Solution processing of hybrid perovskite semiconductors is a highly promising approach for the fabrication of cost&#8208;effective electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, challenges with this approach lie in overcoming the controllability of the perovskite film morphology and the reproducibility of device efficiencies. Here, a facile and practical aging treatment (AT) strategy is reported to modulate the perovskite crystal growth to produce sufficiently high&#8208;quality perovskite thin films with improved homogeneity and full&#8208;coverage morphology. The resulting AT&#8208;films exhibit fewer defects, faster charge carrier transfer/extraction, and suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination compared with reference. The AT&#8208;devices achieve a noticeable improvement in the reproducibility, operational stability, and photovoltaic performance of devices, with the average efficiency increased by 16%. It also demonstrates the feasibility and scalability of AT strategy in optimizing the film morphology and device performance for other perovskite components including MAPbI3, (MAPbBr3)15(FAPbI3)85, and Cs0.05(MAPbBr3)0.17(FAPbI3)0.83. This method opens an effective avenue to improve the quality of perovskite films and photovoltaic devices in a scalable and reproducible manner.

         <title>Sampling the Materials Space for Conventional Superconducting Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large&#8208;scale, machine&#8208;learning&#8208;accelerated study of conventional superconducting materials is presented, wherein the transition temperatures of approximately 200 000 metallic compounds are evaluated, all of which are close to the convex hull of thermodynamic stability to maximize the probability of synthesizability. This work is complemented with a detailed examination of several interesting materials, including nitrides, hydrides, and intermetallic compounds.








Abstract
A large scale study of conventional superconducting materials using a machine&#8208;learning accelerated high&#8208;throughput workflow is performed, starting by creating a comprehensive dataset of around 7000 electron&#8211;phonon calculations performed with reasonable convergence parameters. This dataset is then used to train a robust machine learning model capable of predicting the electron&#8211;phonon and superconducting properties based on structural, compositional, and electronic ground&#8208;state properties. Using this machine, the transition temperatures (Tc) of approximately 200&#160;000 metallic compounds are evaluated, all of which are on the convex hull of thermodynamic stability (or close to it) to maximize the probability of synthesizability. Compounds predicted to have Tc values exceeding 5&#160;K are further validated using density&#8208;functional perturbation theory. As a result, 541 compounds with Tc values surpassing 10&#160;K, encompassing a variety of crystal structures and chemical compositions, are identified. This work is complemented with a detailed examination of several interesting materials, including nitrides, hydrides, and intermetallic compounds. Particularly noteworthy is LiMoN2, which is predicted to be superconducting in the stoichiometric trigonal phase, with a Tc exceeding 38&#160;K. LiMoN2 has previously been synthesized in this phase, further heightening its potential for practical&#160;applications.

         <title>Atomic Zincophilic Sites Regulating Microspace Electric Fields for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CoSA/C additive with strong Zn affinity can preferentially absorb on the Zn surface in which the curvature&#8208;adjusted absorption enables a self&#8208;adaptive distribution. Atomic zincophilic Co&#8208;N3 sites with strong charge polarization effect redistribute the microspace electric field and ion flux, thus guiding uniform Zn deposition. Moreover, the dynamic adsorption/desorption of CoSA/C upon plating/stripping guarantees a sustainable regulation.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn metal batteries are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their intrinsic advantages. However, Zn tends to deposit irregularly and forms dendrites driven by the uneven space electric field distribution near the Zn&#8208;electrolyte interphase. Herein it is demonstrated that trace addition of Co single atom anchored carbon (denoted as CoSA/C) in the electrolyte regulates the microspace electric field at the Zn&#8208;electrolyte interphase and unifies Zn deposition. Through preferential adsorption of CoSA/C on the Zn surface, the atomically dispersed Co&#8208;N3 with strong charge polarization effect can redistribute the local space electric field and regulate ion flux. Moreover, the dynamic adsorption/desorption of CoSA/C upon plating/stripping offers sustainable long&#8208;term regulation. Therefore, Zn||Zn symmetric cells with CoSA/C electrolyte additive deliver stable cycling up to 1600&#160;h (corresponding to a cumulative plated capacity of 8 Ah cm&#8722;2) at a high current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, demonstrating the sustainable feature of microspace electric field regulation at high current density and capacity.

&lt;p&gt;The CoSA/C additive with strong Zn affinity can preferentially absorb on the Zn surface in which the curvature-adjusted absorption enables a self-adaptive distribution. Atomic zincophilic Co-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sites with strong charge polarization effect redistribute the microspace electric field and ion flux, thus guiding uniform Zn deposition. Moreover, the dynamic adsorption/desorption of CoSA/C upon plating/stripping guarantees a sustainable regulation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous Zn metal batteries are promising candidates for large-scale energy storage due to their intrinsic advantages. However, Zn tends to deposit irregularly and forms dendrites driven by the uneven space electric field distribution near the Zn-electrolyte interphase. Herein it is demonstrated that trace addition of Co single atom anchored carbon (denoted as CoSA/C) in the electrolyte regulates the microspace electric field at the Zn-electrolyte interphase and unifies Zn deposition. Through preferential adsorption of CoSA/C on the Zn surface, the atomically dispersed Co-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with strong charge polarization effect can redistribute the local space electric field and regulate ion flux. Moreover, the dynamic adsorption/desorption of CoSA/C upon plating/stripping offers sustainable long-term regulation. Therefore, Zn||Zn symmetric cells with CoSA/C electrolyte additive deliver stable cycling up to 1600&#160;h (corresponding to a cumulative plated capacity of 8 Ah cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) at a high current density of 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, demonstrating the sustainable feature of microspace electric field regulation at high current density and capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering A Boron&#8208;Rich Interphase with Nonflammable Electrolyte toward Stable Li||NCM811 Cells Under Elevated Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of boron&#8208;rich CEI is proposed by selecting salts and solvents with reasonable HOMO levels, which can stabilize the NCM811 at both RT and high temperature by suppressing the degradation of particles and decreasing the consumption of electrolytes. Besides, it improves the flame&#8208;retardancy to decrease the safety risk of NCM811||Li battery.








Abstract
Despite the high energy of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode, it still suffers serious decay due to the continuous solvents decomposition and unstable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layers, especially under high temperatures. The intense exothermic reaction between delithiated NCM811 and flammable electrolyte, on the other hand, pushes the batteries to their safety limit. Herein, these two issues are tackled via engineering the electrolytes, that is, utilizing salts with higher HOMO levels and nonflammable solvents with lower HOMO levels, to reduce the massive decomposition of solvents and improve battery safety under elevated temperatures. Consequently, a thin and boron&#8208;rich CEI is generated, which effectively inhibited the side reactions, thus improving the cycling stability and safety. Deviated from the highly concentrated electrolytes which heavily relies on the usage of massive salts, the electrolyte recipe can introduce a robust inorganic&#8208;rich CEI but use much less salt (i.e., dilute electrolyte), and thus, offer an encouraging alternative toward practical applications. As such, the NCM811 cathode exhibits a high&#8208;capacity retention of 81.2% after 950 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C and 75% after 300 cycles at 55&#160;&#176;C. This work provides a universal electrolyte design strategy for designing stable and safe high&#8208;temperature electrolytes for the NCM811 cathode.

         <title>Covalently Functionalized Nanopores for Highly Selective Separation of Monovalent Ions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalized graphene nanopores exhibit distinct monovalent ions transport behaviors including transport&#8208;rectification and exquisite intercation or anion/cation selectivity through precise pore structure and surface functional groups regulation. These prominent performances not only strongly rely on the ultra&#8208;low permeability resistance of atomically thin graphene but also attribute to the synergistic effects of steric hindrance and electrostatic interactions.








Abstract
Biological ion channels possess prominent ion transport performances attributed to their critical chemical groups across the continuous nanoscale filters. However, it is still a challenge to imitate these sophisticated performances in artificial nanoscale systems. Herein, this work develops the strategy to fabricate functionalized graphene nanopores in pioneer based on the synergistic regulation of the pore size and chemical properties of atomically thin confined structure through decoupling etching combined with in situ covalent modification. The modified graphene nanopores possess asymmetric ion transport behaviors and efficient monovalent metal ions sieving (K+/Li+ selectivity &#8776;48.6). Meanwhile, it also allows preferential transport for cations, the resulting membranes exhibit a K+/Cl&#8722; selectivity of 76 and a H+/Cl&#8722; selectivity of 59.3. The synergistic effects of steric hindrance and electrostatic interactions imposing a higher energy barrier for Cl&#8722; or Li+ across nanopores lead to ultra&#8208;selective H+ or K+ transport. Further, the functionalized graphene nanopores generate a power density of 25.3&#160;W m&#8722;2 and a conversion efficiency of 33.9%, showing potential application prospects in energy conversion. The theoretical studies quantitatively match well with the experimental results. The feasible preparation of functionalized graphene nanopores paves the way toward direct investigation on ion transport mechanism and advanced design in devices.

         <dc:description>
Schematic of threshold response in the MAPbI3:Ag&#8208;based artificial nociceptor neurons and threshold firing of output current. The mechano&#8208;nociceptive system, utilizing halide perovskites&#8208;based memristors with a force sensing resistor, demonstrates the capability to detect detrimental impacts through sensitization responses. Scaling up to a 5 &#215; 5 crossbar array, the artificial skin system achieves successful stereoscopic nociception of uneven impulses.








Abstract
Numerous efforts for emulating organ systems comprised of multiple functional units have driven substantial advancements in bio&#8208;realistic electronics and systems. The resistance change behavior observed in diffusive memristors shares similarities with the potential change in biological neurons. Here, the diffusive threshold switching phenomenon in Ag&#8208;incorporated organometallic halide perovskites is utilized to demonstrate the functions of afferent neurons. Halide perovskites&#8208;based diffusive memristors show a low threshold voltage of &#8776;0.2&#160;V with little variation, attributed to the facile migration of Ag ions uniformly dispersed within the halide matrix. Based on the reversible and reliable volatile threshold switching, the memristors successfully demonstrate fundamental nociceptive functions including threshold firing, relaxation, and sensitization. Furthermore, to replicate the biological mechano&#8208;nociceptive phenomenon at a system level, an artificial mechano&#8208;nociceptive system is built by integrating a diffusive memristor with a force&#8208;sensing resistor. The presented system is capable of detecting and discerning the detrimental impact caused by a heavy steel ball, effectively exhibiting the corresponding sensitization response. By further extending the single nociceptive system into a 5 &#215; 5 array, successful stereoscopic nociception of uneven impulses is achieved in the artificial skin system through array&#8208;scale sensitization. These results represent significant progress in the field of bio&#8208;inspired electronics and systems.

         <title>Inkjet Printed Photonic Cellulose Nanocrystal Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Patterned arrays of photonic cellulose nanocrystal microfilms are prepared by inkjet printing. By dispensing directly through an oil layer, the printing and drying processes can be decoupled, which avoids the coffee stain effect and enables complex arrays to be produced. By adjusting the formulation of each individual drop via overprinting and coalescence, a spectrum of colors can be printed on&#8208;demand.








Abstract
Naturally&#8208;sourced cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are elongated, birefringent nanoparticles that can undergo cholesteric self&#8208;assembly in water to produce vibrant, structurally colored films. As such, they are an ideal candidate for use as sustainable and cost&#8208;effective inks in the printing of scalable photonic coatings and bespoke patterns. However, the small volume and large surface area of a sessile CNC drop typically leads to rapid evaporation, resulting in microfilms with a coffee&#8208;stain&#8208;like morphology and very weak coloration. Here, it is demonstrated that inkjet printing of CNC drops directly through an immiscible oil layer can immediately inhibit water loss, resulting in reduced internal mass flows and greater time for cholesteric self&#8208;assembly. The color of each microfilm is determined by the initial composition of the drop, which can be tuned on&#8208;demand by exploiting the overprinting and coalescence of multiple smaller drops of different inks. This enables the production of multicolored patterns with complex optical behaviors, such as angle&#8208;dependent color and polarization&#8208;selective reflection. Finally, the array can be made responsive to stimuli (e.g., UV light, polar solvent) by the inclusion of a degradable additive. This suite of functional properties promotes inkjet&#8208;printed photonic CNC arrays for smart colorimetric labeling or optical anticounterfeiting applications.

The color of each microfilm is determined by the initial composition of the drop, which can be tuned on-demand by exploiting the overprinting and coalescence of multiple smaller drops of different inks. This enables the production of multicolored patterns with complex optical behaviors, such as angle-dependent color and polarization-selective reflection. Finally, the array can be made responsive to stimuli (e.g., UV light, polar solvent) by the inclusion of a degradable additive. This suite of functional properties promotes inkjet-printed photonic CNC arrays for smart colorimetric labeling or optical anticounterfeiting applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Suppressing Bulk Strain and Surface O2 Release in Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes by Just Tuning the Li Content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coherent thin spinel&#8208;like structure is formed on the surface of lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides by controlling the Li content during the synthesis. The combined in situ XRD and atomic&#8208;scale imaging of the structural evolution reveal that the surface layer simultaneously suppresses the bulk strain accumulation and surface O2 release, resulting in outstanding electrochemical performance and structural stability.








Abstract
Layered oxides represent a prominent class of cathodes employed in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The structural degradation of layered cathodes causes capacity decay during cycling, which is generally induced by anisotropic lattice strain in the bulk of cathode particle and oxygen release at the surface. However, particularly in lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs) that undergo intense oxygen redox reactions, the challenge of simultaneously addressing bulk and surface issues through a singular modification technique remains arduous. Here a thin (1&#8208;nm) and coherent spinel&#8208;like phase is constructed on the surface of LLOs particle to suppress bulk strain and surface O2 release by just adjusting the amount of lithium source during synthesis. The spinel&#8208;like phase hinders the surface O2 release by accommodating O2 inside the surface layer, while the trapped O2 in the bulk impedes strain evolution by &#8776;70% at high voltages compared with unmodified LLOs. Consequently, the enhanced structural stability leads to an improved capacity retention of 97.6% and a high Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99.5% after 100 cycles at 0.1&#176;C. These findings provide profound mechanistic insights into the functioning of surface structure and offer guidance for synthesizing high&#8208;capacity cathodes with superior cyclability.

         <title>Manipulating Surface Band Bending of III&#8208;Nitride Nanowires with Ambipolar Charge&#8208;Transfer Characteristics: A Pathway Toward Advanced Photoswitching Logic Gates and Encrypted Optical Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports a novel postepitaxy method: thickness&#8208;tunable carbon layer decoration to continuously manipulate the surface band bending of III&#8208;nitride semiconductors for the first time. Enabled by the accurate modulation of the thickness of carbon layers, a spectrally distinctive bipolar photoresponse with a controllable polarity&#8208;switching&#8208;point over a wide spectrum range can be achieved, further demonstrating reprogrammable photoswitching logic gates and secured image transmission system.








Abstract
The operational principle of semiconductor devices critically relies on the band structures that ultimately govern their charge&#8208;transfer characteristics. Indeed, the precise orchestration of band structure within semiconductor devices, notably at the semiconductor surface and corresponding interface, continues to pose a perennial conundrum. Herein, for the first time, this work reports a novel postepitaxy method: thickness&#8208;tunable carbon layer decoration to continuously manipulate the surface band bending of III&#8208;nitride semiconductors. Specifically, the surface band bending of p&#8208;type aluminum&#8208;gallium&#8208;nitride (p&#8208;AlGaN) nanowires grown on n&#8208;Si can be precisely controlled by depositing different carbon layers as guided by theoretical calculations, which eventually regulate the ambipolar charge&#8208;transfer behavior between the p&#8208;AlGaN/electrolyte and p&#8208;AlGaN/n&#8208;Si interface in an electrolyte environment. Enabled by the accurate modulation of the thickness of carbon layers, a spectrally distinctive bipolar photoresponse with a controllable polarity&#8208;switching&#8208;point over a wide spectrum range can be achieved, further demonstrating reprogrammable photoswitching logic gates &#8220;XOR&#8221;, &#8220;NAND&#8221;, &#8220;OR&#8221;, and &#8220;NOT&#8221; in a single device. Finally, this work constructs a secured image transmission system where the optical signals are encrypted through the &#8220;XOR&#8221; logic operations. The proposed continuous surface band tuning strategy provides an effective avenue for the development of multifunctional integrated&#8208;photonics systems implemented with nanophotonics.

         <title>Dynamically Adaptive Bubbling for Upgrading Oxygen Evolution Reaction Using Lamellar Fern&#8208;Like Alloy Aerogel Self&#8208;Standing Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a unique lamellar fern&#8208;like alloy aerogel (LFA) as a self&#8208;standing electrode, showing a unique dynamically adaptive bubbling capability and can effectively avoid stress concentration caused by bubble aggregation. LFA not only shows superior gas evacuation capability but also exhibits significantly improved stability at high current densities.








Abstract
Adopting renewable electricity to produce &#8220;green&#8221; hydrogen has been a critical challenge because at a high current density the mass transfer capability of most catalytic electrodes deteriorates significantly. Herein, a unique lamellar fern&#8208;like alloy aerogel (LFA) electrode, showing a unique dynamically adaptive bubbling capability and can effectively avoid stress concentration caused by bubble aggregation is reported. The LFA electrode is intrinsically highly catalytic&#8208;active and shows a highly porous, resilient, hierarchically ordered, and well&#8208;percolated conductive network. It not only shows superior gas evacuation capability but also exhibits significantly improved stability at high current densities, showing the record lowest oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 244&#160;mV at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and stably over 6000 h. With the merits of mechanical robustness, excellent electron transport, and efficient bubble evacuation, LFA can be self&#8208;standing catalytic electrode and&#160;gas diffusion layers in anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE), which can achieve 3000 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low voltage of 1.88&#160;V and can sustain stable electrolysis at 2000&#8201;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 1300 h. This strategy can be extended to various gas evolution reactions as a general design rule for multiphase catalysis applications.

         <title>Regulating Crystal Orientation via Ligand Anchoring Enables Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells and Tandems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystal orientation regulation strategy by introducing dodecyl&#8208;benzene&#8208;sulfonic&#8208;acid as an additive in perovskite precursors is proposed, which significantly promotes the desired (001) crystal orientation. Thus, opaque and semitransparent 1.66 eV bandgap methylamine&#8208;free perovskite solar cells realize efficiencies of 22.40% and 20.13%, respectively. Furthermore, four&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells deliver a remarkable efficiency of 28.06%.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells have attracted considerable interest for their potential applications in tandem solar cells. However, the predominant obstacles impeding their widespread adoption are substantial open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit and severe photo&#8208;induced halide segregation. To tackle these challenges, a crystal orientation regulation strategy by introducing dodecyl&#8208;benzene&#8208;sulfonic&#8208;acid as an additive in perovskite precursors is proposed. This method significantly promotes the desired crystal orientation, passivates defects, and mitigates photo&#8208;induced halide phase segregation in perovskite films, leading to substantially reduced nonradiative recombination, minimized VOC deficits, and enhanced operational stability of the devices. The resulting 1.66&#160;eV bandgap methylamine&#8208;free perovskite solar cells achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.40% (certified at 21.97%), with the smallest VOC deficit recorded at 0.39&#160;V. Furthermore, the fabricated semitransparent WBG devices exhibit a competitive PCE of 20.13%. Consequently, four&#8208;terminal tandem cells comprising WBG perovskite top cells and 1.25&#160;eV bandgap perovskite bottom cells showcase an impressive PCE of 28.06% (stabilized 27.92%), demonstrating great potential for efficient multijunction tandem solar cell applications.

         <title>Oligo(phenylenevinylene)&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Kagome Lattice for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two kagome (kgm)&#160;topologic oligo(phenylenevinylene)&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are rationally designed for boosting photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via a &#8220;two in one&#8221; strategy. COF&#8208;954 shows high and stable photocatalytic hydrogen production performance in water, 3% NaCl solution, and seawater. The water&#8208;drainage experiments also suggest the potential of COF&#8208;954 in the practical applications for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have shown great advantages as photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. However, the effect of linkage geometry and type of linkage on the extent of &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation in the plane of the framework and photocatalytic properties of COFs remains a significant challenge. Herein, two Kagome (kgm) topologic oligo(phenylenevinylene)&#8208;based COFs are designed and synthesized for boosting photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via a &#8220;two in one&#8221; strategy. Under visible light irradiation, COF&#8208;954 with 5 wt% Pt as cocatalyst exhibits high hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 137.23&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, outperforming most reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. More importantly, even in natural seawater, COF&#8208;954 shows an average HER of 191.70&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under ultraviolet&#8211;visible (UV&#8211;vis) light irradiation. Additionally, the water&#8208;drainage experiments indoors and outdoors demonstrate that 25 and 8&#160;mL hydrogen gas could be produced in 80 min under UV&#8211;vis light and natural sunlight, respectively, corresponding to a high HER of 167.41 and 53.57&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1. This work not only demonstrates an effective design strategy toward highly efficient COF&#8208;based photocatalysts, but also shows the great potential of using the COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue Narrowband Hetero[6]helicenes Showing Circularly Polarized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Toward High&#8208;Performance OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A helical extension strategy is introduced to engineer deep&#8208;blue hetero[6]helicene&#8208;based emitters for circularly polarized OLEDs. Besides satisfactory chiroptical performance, this strategy endows the emitters with enhanced quantum yield and narrower emission bands compared to their precursor. The devices display record efficiencies, high color purity, and distinct circularly polarized electroluminescence, marking a significant advance in chiroptical materials for high&#8208;definition displays.








Abstract
Helicenes exhibit substantial potential as circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) active molecules. However, their application in circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) is typically hindered by the challenge of integrating both high color purity and efficient triplet&#8208;harvesting capability, particularly in the blue spectral region. Herein, a series of hetero[6]helicene&#8208;based emitters that is strategically engineered through the helical extension of a deep&#8208;blue double&#8208;boron&#8208;based multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) motif, is introduced. Importantly, the helical extension does not cause apparent structural deformation or perturb frontier molecular orbitals; thus, preserving the deep&#8208;blue emission and MR&#8208;TADF characteristics of the parent molecule. This approach also leads to reduced reorganization energy, resulting in emitters with narrower linewidth and higher photoluminescence quantum yield. Further, the helical motif enhances the racemization barrier and leads to improved CPL performance with luminescence dissymmetry factor values up to 1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3. Exploiting these merits, devices incorporating the chiral dopants demonstrate deep&#8208;blue emission within the Broadcast Service Television 2020 color&#8208;gamut range, record external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) up to 29.3%, and have distinctive circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) signals. Overall, the authors&#8217; findings underscore the helical extension as a promising strategy for designing narrowband chiroptical materials and advancing high&#8208;definition displays.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Nanolayer&#8208;Derived Zincophilicity Suppressing Metallic Zinc Dendrites and Its Efficacy in Improving Electrochemical Stability of Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>

From the initial Zn deposition, a Zn&#8208;Au alloy grows from the Au&#8208;coating layer. This further results in smooth Zn deposition, which stabilizes long&#8208;term Zn stripping/plating without Zn dendrite via the &#8216;embracing effect&#8217;.








Abstract
Herein, an Au&#8208;coating layer adjusted on the surface of a Zn metal electrode that effectively suppresses the dendrite growth as well as the mechanisms underlying the dendrite suppression as a result of the zincophilic character of Au is introduced. For the Au&#8208;coated Zn metal symmetric cell, uniform deposition of Zn&#8208;derived compounds&#160;was revealed by operando synchrotron tomography. Microscopic studies demonstrate that the Au&#8208;coating layer is induced to form a new Zn&#8211;Au alloy during the initial Zn deposition, resulting in stabilized long&#8208;term stripping/plating of Zn via the &#8216;embracing effect&#8217; that intimately accommodates Zn deposition for further cycles. This property supports the successful operation of symmetrical cells up to 50 mA cm&#8722;2. According to Zn electrodeposition simulation, it is verified that the suppression of dendrite growth is responsible for the electro&#8208;conducting Au nanolayer that uniformly distributes the electric field and protects the Zn electrode from corrosion, ultimately promoting uniform Zn growth. The compatibility of the Au&#8208;coating layer for full cell configuration is verified using NaV3O8 as a cathode material over 1&#160;000 cycles. This finding provides a new pathway for the enhancement of the electrochemical performance of ZIBs by suppressing the dendritic growth of Zn by means of a zincophilic Au nanolayer.

         <title>Conjugated Polyelectrolyte Thin Films for Pseudocapacitive Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slow evaporation from a pure water solution provides high charging rate pseudocapacitive conjugated polyelectrolyte films that are stable in aqueous electrolytes. Key to stability is increased crystallinity and a high electrolyte concentration for decreasing interchain electrostatic repulsion. This strategy may be applied for integrating organic mixed ionic electronic conductors in applications such as batteries, organic electrochemical transistors, or electrochemical sensors.








Abstract
A subclass of organic semiconductors known as conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) is characterized by a conjugated backbone with ionic pendant groups. The water solubility of CPEs typically hinders applications of thin films in aqueous media. Herein, it is reported that films of an anionic CPE, namely CPE&#8208;K, drop cast from water produces single&#8208;component solid&#8208;state pseudocapacitive electrodes that are insoluble in aqueous electrolyte. That X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments reveal a more structurally ordered film, relative to the as&#8208;obtained powder from chemical synthesis, and dynamic light scattering measurements show an increase in aggregate particle size with increasing [KCl] indicate that CPE&#8208;K films are insoluble because of tight interchain contacts and electrostatic screening by the electrolyte. CPE&#8208;K film electrodes can maintain 85% of their original capacitance (84 F g&#8722;1) at 500 A g&#8722;1 and exhibit excellent cycling stability, where a capacitance retention of 93% after 100&#160;000 cycles at a current density of 35 A g&#8722;1. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to use initially water soluble ionic&#8208;organic materials in aqueous electrolytes, by increasing the electrolyte concentration. This strategy can be applied to the application of conjugated polyelectrolytes in batteries, organic electrochemical transistors, and electrochemical sensors, where fast electron and ion transport are required.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Surface&#8208;to&#8208;Bulk Modification of High&#8208;Voltage and Long&#8208;Life LiCoO2 Cathode with Concentration Gradient Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The essence of the currently proposed one&#8208;step multi&#8208;modification strategy for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode candidates&#160;lies in its &#8243;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8243; functionality, which systematically and comprehensively considers both the localized environment (e.g., TM&#9472;O bonding state, Li/Co migration pathway, TM&#8208;derived catalytic site for electrolyte decomposition) and the overall architecture (e.g., cathode/electrolyte interface reinforcement, gliding stacking faults reformation).








Abstract
Raising the charging cut&#8208;off voltage of layered oxide cathodes can improve their energy density. However, it inevitably introduces instabilities regarding both bulk structure and surface/interface. Herein, exploiting the unique characteristics of high&#8208;valence Nb5+ element, a synchronous surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk&#8208;modified LiCoO2 featuring Li3NbO4 surface coating layer, Nb&#8208;doped bulk, and the desired concentration gradient architecture through one&#8208;step calcination is achieved. Such a multifunctional structure facilitates the construction of high&#8208;quality cathode/electrolyte interface, enhances Li+ diffusion, and restrains lattice&#8208;O loss, Co migration, and associated layer&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase distortion. Therefore, a stable operation of Nb&#8208;modified LiCoO2 half&#8208;cell is achieved at 4.6&#160;V (90.9% capacity retention after 200 cycles). Long&#8208;life 250&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 4.7&#160;V&#8208;class 550&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 pouch cells assembled with graphite and thin Li anodes are harvested (both beyond 87% after 1600 and 200 cycles). This multifunctional one&#8208;step modification strategy establishes a technological paradigm to pave the way for high&#8208;energy density and long&#8208;life lithium&#8208;ion cathode materials.

         <title>Designing Chemically Replaced Interfacial Layer via Unveiling the Influence of Zn Crystal Facets for Practical Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unveiling the effect of Zn crystal facets in Sn&#8208;based chemical replacement reaction (CRR), a Sn&#8208;based interfacial architecture (ZnTCF@Sn) via a novel two&#8208;step CRR is developed. Owing to its unique crystallographic (high zincophilicity and surface energy), morphological (abundant active sites and uniform current/Zn2+ flux), and compositional (suppressed side reactions of metallic Sn) merits, ZnTCF@Sn can approach a practical Zn&#8208;metal anode.








Abstract
Zn metal anodes (ZMAs) undergo irregular deposition and unfavorable side reactions, which hinders the practical application of aqueous rechargeable Zn metal batteries (ARZMBs). Chemical replacement reaction (CRR) strategies can achieve stable ZMAs, but the effect of the crystal facets of metallic Zn as reductants remains poorly understood. In this study, based on the observation that preferentially exposed Zn crystal facets affect the surface characteristics of chemically replaced layers in Sn&#8208;based CRR, a multifunctional Sn&#8208;based interfacial layer (ZnTCF@Sn) is designed on the Zn with textured crystal facets using a novel two&#8208;step CRR process. ZnTCF@Sn simultaneously provides abundant zincophilic sites and high surface energy and homogenizes the distribution of current/Zn2+ flux, resulting in fast electrochemical kinetics and dendrite&#8208;free deposition. Furthermore, the uniform Sn coverage on the ZnTCF@Sn surface inhibits side reactions and enhances reversibility during Zn deposition/dissolution. Thus, the ZnTCF@Sn achieves exceptional cyclability over 1200&#160;h even under harsh operating conditions with a cumulative capacity of 24 Ah cm&#8722;2. This study contributes to the development of practical ARZMBs by providing new insights into the effect of the Zn crystal facets on the surface modification of ZMAs through various CRRs.

         <title>Targeting DNA Damage and Repair Machinery via Delivering WEE1 Inhibitor and Platinum (IV) Prodrugs to Stimulate STING Pathway for Maximizing Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy in Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a glutathione&#8208;responsive nanoparticle loaded with cisplatin prodrug (Pt (IV)) and WEE1 inhibitor (MK1775), which can increase DNA damage, activate the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon gene (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway, and upregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression in tumor cells, ultimately enhancing chemo&#8208;immunotherapy for bladder cancer. Moreover, the nanoparticle elicits long&#8208;term immune responses in both primary and metastatic tumors when combined with &#945;PD&#8208;L1.








Abstract
Both cisplatin&#8208;based chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs)&#8208;based immunotherapy are the first&#8208;line treatments for patients with advanced bladder cancer. Cancer cells can develop resistance to cisplatin through extensive DNA repair, while a low response rate to ICBs is mostly due to the presence of an immunosuppressive microenvironment and low PD&#8208;L1 expression. Herein, a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive nanoparticle (NP2) loaded with cisplatin prodrug (Pt (IV)) and WEE1 inhibitor (MK1775) is designed. NP2 can be triggered by GSH in cancer cells, and the released MK1775 can inhibit the activity of WEE1 protein, which ultimately increases DNA damage by cisplatin. Genome&#8208;wide RNA sequencing first reveals that NP2 can inhibit DNA repair machinery by interfering with the cell cycle and significantly activate the stimulator of interferon genes pathway. Tumor growth is significantly inhibited by NP2 in vivo. As innate and adaptive immune responses are stimulated, the immunosuppressive microenvironment is modified, and the &#8220;immune cold tumor&#8221; is transformed into an &#8220;immune hot tumor". In addition, NP2 can upregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression in tumor cells, thereby increasing the response rate of PD&#8208;L1 monoclonal antibody (&#945;PD&#8208;L1) and eliciting long&#8208;term immune responses in both primary and metastatic tumors.

         <title>Energy Band Engineering Guided Design of Bidirectional Catalyst for Reversible Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, the design of catalysts at the molecular or atomic level and understanding of the relationship between structure and performance are essential. Under the guidance of energy band engineering, a highly efficient catalyst is designed and shows obvious bidirectional effect for CO2 redox. This work offers new avenues for designing excellent electrocatalysts in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.








Abstract
Li&#8211;CO2 batteries arouse great interest in the context of carbon neutralization, but their practicability is severely hindered by the sluggish CO2 redox reaction kinetics at the cathode, which brings about formidable challenges such as high overpotential and low Coulombic efficiency. For the complex multi&#8208;electron transfer process, the design of catalysts at the molecular or atomic level and the understanding of the relationship between electron state and performance are essential for the CO2 redox. However, little attention is paid to it. In this work, using Co3S4 as a model system, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the adjusted d&#8208;band and p&#8208;band centers of Co3S4 with the introduction of Cu and sulfur vacancies are hybridized between CO2 and Li species, respectively, which is conducive to the adsorption of reactants and the decomposition of Li2CO3, and the experimental results further verify the effectiveness of energy band engineering. As a result, a highly efficient bidirectional catalyst is produced and shows an ultra&#8208;small voltage gap of 0.73&#160;V and marvelous Coulombic efficiency&#160;of 92.6%, surpassing those of previous catalysts under similar conditions. This work presents an effective catalyst design and affords new insight into the high&#8208;performance cathode catalyst materials for Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.

A new super fuel cell (SFC) with single&#8208;atomic Pt on hollow porous carbon nanorods catalyst has super&#8208;high output ability through two creations of &#8220;oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) + electric double&#8208;layer capacitance (EDLC)&#8221; parallel discharging and self&#8208;charging to overcome sluggish ORR process. The promising SFC offers a new pathway to boost the power density of FCs with extra&#8208;low Pt loading.








Abstract
Pursuing high power density with low platinum catalysts loading is a huge challenge for developing high&#8208;performance fuel cells (FCs). Herein, a new super fuel cell (SFC) is proposed with ultrahigh output power via specific electric double&#8208;layer capacitance (EDLC) + oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) parallel discharge, which is achieved using the newly prepared catalyst, single&#8208;atomic platinum on bimetallic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived hollow porous carbon nanorods (PtSA/HPCNR). The PtSA&#8208;1.74/HPCNR&#8208;based SFC has a 3.4&#8208;time higher transient specific power density and 13.3&#8208;time longer discharge time with unique in situ self&#8208;charge and energy storage ability than 20% Pt/C&#8208;based FCs. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure, aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscope, and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the synergistic effect of Pt single&#8208;atoms anchored on carbon defects significantly boosts its electron transfer, ORR catalytic activity, durability, and rate performance, realizing rapid &#8220; ORR+EDLC&#8221; parallel discharge mechanism to overcome the sluggish ORR process of traditional FCs. The promising SFC leads to a new pathway to boost the power density of FCs with extra&#8208;low Pt loading.

         <title>High&#8208;Reversibility Sulfur Anode for Advanced Aqueous Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8596;Na2S conversion is identified as a promising anodic reaction with low potential. The viability of S anode is established in S&#8211;I2 battery that uses a cost&#8208;effective and scalable sulfonated polysulfone membrane to mitigate &#8220;shuttle effects.&#8221; Compared to Zn anode, S anode avoids dendrite formation and hydrogen evolution, and it can withstand super&#8208;high utilization (100% vs &lt; 1% for Zn).








Abstract
Despite being extensively explored as cathodes in batteries, sulfur (S) can function as a low&#8208;potential anode by changing charge carriers in electrolytes. Here, a highly reversible S anode that fully converts from S80 to S2&#8722; in static aqueous S&#8211;I2 batteries by using Na+ as the charge carrier is reported. This S anode exhibits a low potential of &#8722;0.5&#160;V (vs standard hydrogen electrode) and a near&#8208;to&#8208;theoretical capacity of 1404&#160;mA h g&#8722;1. Importantly, it shows significant advantages over the widely used Zn anode in aqueous media by obviating dendrite formation and H2 evolution. To suppress &#8220;shuttle effects&#8221; faced by both S and I2 electrodes, a scalable sulfonated polysulfone (SPSF) membrane is proposed, which is superior to commercial Nafion in cost (US$1.82 m&#8722;2&#160;vs $3500 m&#8722;2) and environmental benignity. Because of its ultra&#8208;high selectivity in blocking polysulfides/iodides, the battery with SPSF displays excellent cycling stability. Even under 100% depth of discharge, the battery demonstrates high capacity retention of 87.6% over 500 cycles, outperforming Zn&#8211;I2 batteries with 3.1% capacity under the same conditions. These findings broaden anode options beyond metals for high&#8208;energy, low&#8208;cost, and fast&#8208;chargeable batteries.

         <title>Reinforcing the Electrode/Electrolyte Interphases of Lithium Metal Batteries Employing Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte based on trifluoromethoxybenzene cosolvent is proposed for lithium metal batteries with nickel&#8208;rich cathodes, through a comparative study of three fluorinated aromatic cosolvents. The generated solid electrolyte interphase rich in inorganic species on anodes and, particularly, a uniform cathode/electrolyte interphase rich in organic cation&#8208;derived species on cathodes enable stable cycling of Li/LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 cells.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with nickel&#8208;rich cathodes are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, but the lack of sufficiently protective electrode/electrolyte interphases (EEIs) limits their cyclability. Herein, trifluoromethoxybenzene is proposed as a cosolvent for locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes (LCILEs) to reinforce the EEIs. With a comparative study of a neat ionic liquid electrolyte (ILE) and three LCILEs employing fluorobenzene, trifluoromethylbenzene, or trifluoromethoxybenzene as cosolvents, it is revealed that the fluorinated groups tethered to the benzene ring of the cosolvents not only affect the electrolytes&#8217; ionic conductivity and fluidity, but also the EEIs&#8217; composition via adjusting the contribution of the 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cation (Emim+) and bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anion. Trifluoromethoxybenzene, as the optimal cosolvent, leads to a stable cycling of LMBs employing 5 mAh cm&#8722;2 lithium metal anodes (LMAs), 21&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05 (NCA) cathodes, and 4.2&#160;&#181;L mAh&#8722;1 electrolytes for 150 cycles with a remarkable capacity retention of 71%, thanks to a solid electrolyte interphase rich in inorganic species on LMAs and, particularly, a uniform cathode/electrolyte interphase rich in Emim+&#8208;derived species on NCA cathodes. By contrast, the capacity retention under the same condition is only 16%, 46%, and 18% for the neat ILE and the LCILEs based on fluorobenzene and benzotrifluoride, respectively.

         <title>All&#8208;Inorganic Polyoxometalates Act as Superchaotropic Membrane Carriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inorganic anions of the polyoxometalate type display a new biological activity: They efficiently transport cationic peptides across lipidic and cellular membranes. This function is related to their superchaotropic nature, resulting in strong and concomitant interactions with peptides and lipids. Mixed&#8208;metal Keggin&#8208;type anions show the required hydrolytic stability and sufficiently low charge density that are prerequisites for the desirable carrier utility.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are known antitumoral, antibacterial, antiviral, and anticancer agents and considered as next&#8208;generation metallodrugs. Herein, a new biological functionality in neutral physiological media, where selected mixed&#8208;metal POMs are sufficiently stable and able to affect membrane transport of impermeable, hydrophilic, and cationic peptides (heptaarginine, heptalysine, protamine, and polyarginine) is reported. The uptake is observed in both, model membranes as well as cells, and attributed to the superchaotropic properties of the polyoxoanions. In view of the structural diversity of POMs these findings pave the way toward their biomedical application in drug delivery or for cell&#8208;biological uptake studies with biological effector molecules or staining agents.

         <title>Recycled Tandem Catalysts Promising Ultralow Overpotential Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>

One critical challenge&#160;of lithium&#8208;carbon dioxide (Li&#8208;CO2) batteries&#160;is to develop highly efficient and low&#8208;cost catalysts with precise structure. A tandem catalyst with an in&#8208;built electric field is elaborately recycled from the spent batteries and exhibits remarkable bidirectional activities. This work affords new opportunities to fabricate low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts and inspires fresh perceptions of interfacial regulation to engineer better Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;carbon dioxide (Li&#8208;CO2) batteries are regarded as a prospective technology to relieve the pressure of greenhouse emissions but are confronted with sluggish CO2 redox kinetics and low energy efficiency. Developing highly efficient and low&#8208;cost catalysts to boost bidirectional activities is craved but remains a huge challenge. Herein, derived from the spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries, a tandem catalyst is subtly synthesized and significantly accelerates the CO2 reduction and evolution reactions (CO2RR and CO2ER) kinetics with an in&#8208;built electric field (BEF). Combining with the theoretical calculations and advanced characterization techniques, this work reveals that the designed interface&#8208;induced BEF regulates the adsorption/decomposition of the intermediates during CO2RR and CO2ER, endowing the recycled tandem catalyst with excellent bidirectional activities. As a result, the spent electronics&#8208;derived tandem catalyst exhibits remarkable bidirectional catalytic performance, such as an ultralow voltage gap of 0.26&#160;V and an ultrahigh energy efficiency of 92.4%. Profoundly, this work affords new opportunities to fabricate low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts from recycled spent electronics and inspires fresh perceptions of interfacial regulation including but not limited to BEF to engineer better Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Thermochromic Photonic Crystal Paper with Integrated Multilayer Structure and Fast Thermal Response: A Waterproof and Mechanically Stable Material for Structural&#8208;Colored Thermal Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermochromic polyurethane/hydrophobic&#8208;SiO2 photonic crystal/paraffin (PU/HPO&#8208;SiO2&#8208;PC/Para) multilayer film is fabricated for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state and single&#8208;step thermal printing. The fast thermal response enables high&#8208;resolution and grayscale printing. The integrated and hydrophobic multilayer structure ensures good stability in daily liquids and enhances its mechanical stability for better user experience.








Abstract
Thermochromic photonic crystals are promising materials for thermal printing due to their unfaded colors under chemical/illuminated environments and the absence of toxic chemicals. However, the slow thermochromic response, the multistep printing procedures, the use of inks or developing liquids, and the requirement of expensive parts in printers limit their applications. Here, a thermochromic polyurethane/hydrophobic&#8208;SiO2 photonic crystal/paraffin (PU/HPO&#8208;SiO2&#8208;PC/Para)&#160;film with an integrated multilayer structure is fabricated for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state and single&#8208;step thermal printing that is fully compatible with commercial printers. The fast thermochromic response in milliseconds enables high&#8208;resolution and grayscale printing as the paraffin infiltration and the color change can be finely controlled in a microscale range. The integrated and hydrophobic multilayer structure renders the thermochromic film good stability in daily liquids, which addresses the long&#8208;existing concern of print fading. Meanwhile, the integrated multilayer structure also enhances the mechanical stability when it is deposited on fibrous paper so that people can fold, cut, or staple the thermal papers, and make notes confidently in practical usage.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Modulated Ionic Polymer as an Adaptable Electron Transport Material for Optically Switchable Pixel&#8208;Free Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adaptive photosensitive ionic polymer comprising photocrosslinkable moieties and electron transport moieties enables organic light&#8208;emitting devices to be switched by external optical direct writing and erasing. Independent solution&#8208;processed electron transport layer (ETL) using photo&#8208;modulated ionic polymer realizes the fabrication of optically switchable pixel&#8208;free displays (OSPFDs) with tunable illuminants and seamless imaging capability.








Abstract
In addition to electrically driven organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED)&#160;displays that rely on complicated and costly circuits for switching individual pixel illumination, developing a facile approach that structures pixel&#8208;free light&#8208;emitting displays with exceptional precision and spatial resolution via external photo&#8208;modulation holds significant importance for advancing consumer electronics. Here, optically switchable organic light&#8208;emitting pixel&#8208;free displays (OSPFDs) are presented and fabricated by judiciously combining an adaptive photosensitive ionic polymer as electron transport materials (ETM) with external photo&#8208;modulation as the switching mode while ensuring superior illumination performance and seamless imaging capability. By irradiating the solution&#8208;processed OSPFDs with light at specific wavelengths, efficient and reversible tuning of both electron transport and electroluminescence is achieved simultaneously. This remarkable control is achieved by altering the energetic matching within OSPFDs, which also exhibits a high level of universality and adjustable flexibility in the three primary color&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting displays. Moreover, the ease of creating and erasing desired pixel&#8208;free emitting patterns through a non&#8208;invasive photopatterning process within a single OSPFD is demonstrated, thereby rendering this approach promising for commercial displaying devices and highly precise pixelated illuminants.

         <title>Fabrication of Oriented Polycrystalline MOF Superstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have progressed beyond powdery and single&#8208;crystalline materials towards polycrystalline superstructures. A current challenge is&#160;the fabrication of superstructures with defined crystalline orientation to access anisotropic properties. This perspective examines methods for the fabrication of oriented MOF superstructures (colloidal assembly, external fields, heteroepitaxial ceramic&#8208;to&#8208;MOF, and other emerging methods), to promote the development of systems with oriented pore channels.








Abstract
The field of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) has progressed beyond the design and exploration of powdery and single&#8208;crystalline materials. A current challenge is the fabrication of organized superstructures that can harness the directional properties of the individual constituent MOF crystals. To date, the progress in the fabrication methods of polycrystalline MOF superstructures has led to close&#8208;packed structures with defined crystalline orientation. By controlling the crystalline orientation, the MOF pore channels of the constituent crystals can be aligned along specific directions: these systems possess anisotropic properties including enhanced diffusion along specific directions, preferential orientation of guest species, and protection of functional guests. In this perspective, we&#160;discuss the current status of MOF research in the fabrication of oriented polycrystalline superstructures focusing on the specific crystalline directions of orientation. Three methods are examined in detail: the assembly from colloidal MOF solutions, the use of external fields for the alignment of MOF particles, and the heteroepitaxial ceramic&#8208;to&#8208;MOF growth. This perspective aims at promoting the progress of this field of research and inspiring the development of new protocols for the preparation of MOF systems with oriented pore channels, to enable advanced MOF&#8208;based devices with anisotropic properties.

         <title>Amphoteric Ion Bridged Buried Interface for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphoteric organic salt, 4FPEAPSA, is applied as the buried interface bridged layer to induce large&#8208;grain perovskite film with uniform morphology. 4FPEAPSA treatment can facilitate the matchable energy level alignment at the perovskite buried interface, reducing defect recombination loss. Such a multi&#8208;functional bridged layer enables a high efficiency of 25.03% and preferable stability in the inverted perovskite solar cells (PerSCs).








Abstract
Synergistic morphology and defects management at the buried perovskite interface are challenging but crucial for the further improvement of inverted perovskite solar cells (PerSCs). Herein, an amphoteric organic salt, 2&#8208;(4&#8208;fluorophenyl)ethylammonium&#8208;4&#8208;methyl benzenesulfonate (4FPEAPSA), is designed to optimize the film morphology and energy level alignment at the perovskite buried interface. 4FPEAPSA treatment promotes the growth of a void&#8208;free, coarse&#8208;grained, and hydrophobic film by inducing the crystal orientation. Besides, the dual&#8208;functional 4FPEAPSA can chemically interact with the perovskite film, and passivate the defects of iodine and formamidine vacancies, tending to revert the fermi level of perovskite to its defect&#8208;free state. Meanwhile, the formation of a p&#8208;type doping buried interface can facilitate the interfacial charge extraction and transport of PerSCs for reduced carrier recombination loss. Consequently, 4FPEAPSA treatment improves the efficiency of the perovskite devices to 25.03% with better storage, heat, and humidity stability. This work contributes to strengthening the systematic understanding of the perovskite buried interface, providing a synergetic approach to realize precise morphology control, effective defect suppression, and energy level alignment for efficient PerSCs.

Such a multi-functional bridged layer enables a high efficiency of 25.03% and preferable stability in the inverted perovskite solar cells (PerSCs).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synergistic morphology and defects management at the buried perovskite interface are challenging but crucial for the further improvement of inverted perovskite solar cells (PerSCs). Herein, an amphoteric organic salt, 2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethylammonium-4-methyl benzenesulfonate (4FPEAPSA), is designed to optimize the film morphology and energy level alignment at the perovskite buried interface. 4FPEAPSA treatment promotes the growth of a void-free, coarse-grained, and hydrophobic film by inducing the crystal orientation. Besides, the dual-functional 4FPEAPSA can chemically interact with the perovskite film, and passivate the defects of iodine and formamidine vacancies, tending to revert the fermi level of perovskite to its defect-free state. Meanwhile, the formation of a p-type doping buried interface can facilitate the interfacial charge extraction and transport of PerSCs for reduced carrier recombination loss. Consequently, 4FPEAPSA treatment improves the efficiency of the perovskite devices to 25.03% with better storage, heat, and humidity stability. This work contributes to strengthening the systematic understanding of the perovskite buried interface, providing a synergetic approach to realize precise morphology control, effective defect suppression, and energy level alignment for efficient PerSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selenophene Substitution Enabled High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;Type Polymeric Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors for Organic Electrochemical Transistors and Glucose Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With selenophene substitution, the resulting polymers demonstrate enhanced charge transport properties and improved ion&#8208;uptake capabilities, resulting in unprecedented performance for n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors. These advancements hold great promise for various biosensing applications, exemplified by the successful development of a highly sensitive glucose sensor.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymeric mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (PMIECs) are essential for realizing organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs)&#8208;based low&#8208;power complementary circuits and biosensors, but their development still remains a great challenge. Herein, by devising two novel n&#8208;type polymers (f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;SVSCN and f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN) containing varying selenophene contents together with their thiophene&#8208;based counterpart as the control, it is demonstrated that gradually increasing selenophene loading in polymer backbones can simultaneously yield lowered lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels, boosted charge&#8208;transport properties, and improved ion&#8208;uptake capabilities. Therefore, a remarkable volumetric capacitance (C*) of 387.2 F cm&#8722;3 and a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OECT electron mobility (&#181;e,OECT) of 0.48 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 are synchronously achieved for f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN having the highest selenophene content, yielding an unprecedented geometry&#8208;normalized transconductance (gm,norm) of 71.4 S cm&#8722;1 and record figure of merit (&#181;C*) value of 191.2 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for n&#8208;type OECTs. Thanks to such excellent performance of f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN&#8208;based OECTs, a glucose sensor with a remarkably low detection limit of 10&#160;nMm and decent selectivity is further implemented, demonstrating the power of selenophene substitution strategy in enabling high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type PMIECs for biosensing applications.

&lt;p&gt;High-performance n-type polymeric mixed ionic-electronic conductors (PMIECs) are essential for realizing organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs)-based low-power complementary circuits and biosensors, but their development still remains a great challenge.

         <title>Unraveling the Coupling Effect between Cathode and Anode toward Practical Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Butler&#8211;Volmer equation fundamentally describes the relationship between electrode overpotential and local current densities. Inspired by the equation, a binary descriptor (IBD) is proposed to guide the design of sulfur cathodes. This descriptor can evaluate the influence of mass transport and charge transfer on reaction kinetics, and unravel the coupling effect between sulfur cathode and Li anode.








Abstract
The localized reaction heterogeneity of the sulfur cathode and the uneven Li deposition on the Li anode are intractable issues for lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries under practical operation. Despite impressive progress in separately optimizing the sulfur cathode or Li anode, a comprehensive understanding of the highly coupled relationship between the cathode and anode is still lacking. In this work, inspired by the Butler&#8211;Volmer equation, a binary descriptor (IBD) assisting the rational structural design of sulfur cathode by simultaneously considering the mass&#8208;transport index (Imass) and the charge&#8208;transfer index (Icharge) is identified, and subsequently the relationship between IBD and the morphological evolution of Li anode is established. Guided by the IBD, a scalable electrode providing interpenetrated flow channels for efficient mass/charge transfer, full utilization of active sulfur, and mechanically elastic support for aggressive electrochemical reactions under practical conditions is reported. These characteristics induce a homogenous distribution of local current densities and reduced reaction heterogeneity on both sides of the cathode and anode. Impressive energy density of 318&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 473&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 in an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell can be achieved by the design concept. This work offers a promising paradigm for unlocking the interaction between cathode and anode and designing high&#8208;energy practical Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>A Layered Bi2Te3@PPy Cathode for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries: Mechanism and Application in Printed Flexible Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors analyze the reaction mechanism of Bi2Te3&#8208;based cathode for zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) and demonstrate that, in the aqueous system, Zn2+ is not inserted into the cathode as previously assumed. In contrast, proton charge storage dominates the process. The authors also demonstrate the great application prospect of aqueous ZIBs in flexible electronics via jet printing technology.








Abstract
Low&#8208;cost, safe, and environmental&#8208;friendly rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising as next&#8208;generation energy storage devices for wearable electronics among other applications. However, sluggish ionic transport kinetics and the unstable electrode structure during ionic insertion/extraction hamper their deployment. Herein, a new cathode material based on a layered metal chalcogenide (LMC), bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3), coated with polypyrrole (PPy) is proposed. Taking advantage of the PPy coating, the Bi2Te3@PPy composite presents strong ionic absorption affinity, high oxidation resistance, and high structural stability. The ZIBs based on Bi2Te3@PPy cathodes exhibit high capacities and ultra&#8208;long lifespans of over 5000 cycles. They also present outstanding stability even under bending. In addition, here the reaction mechanism is analyzed using in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and computational tools and it is demonstrated that, in the aqueous system, Zn2+ is not inserted into the cathode as previously assumed. In contrast, proton charge storage dominates the process. Overall, this work not only shows the great potential of LMCs as ZIB cathode materials and the advantages of PPy coating, but also clarifies the charge/discharge mechanism in rechargeable ZIBs based on LMCs.

         <title>Regulating Phase Separation Kinetics for High&#8208;Efficiency and Mechanically Robust All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By synthesizing a random terpolymer PBDB&#8208;TFCl and combining a ternary blending strategy, favorable phase separation and reinforced molecular packing are obtained. Resulting flexible organic solar modules exhibit maximum power conversion efficiency of 12.7% and excellent mechanical properties and photostability.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) possess excellent operation stability and mechanical robustness than other types of organic solar cells, thereby attracting considerable attention for wearable flexible electron devices. However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all&#8208;PSCs are still lagging behind those of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based systems owing to the limitation of photoactive materials and unsatisfactory blend morphology. In this work, a novel terpolymer, denoted as PBDB&#8208;TFCl (poly4,8&#8208;bis(5&#8208;(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;4&#8208;fluorothiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8243;]dithiophene&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;5,7&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;4H,8H&#8208;benzo[1,2&#8208;c:4,5&#8208;c&#8243;]dithiophene&#8208;4,8&#8208;dione&#8208;4,8&#8208;bis(4&#8208;chloro&#8208;5&#8208;(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene), is used as an electron donor coupled with a ternary strategy to optimize the performance of all&#8208;PSCs. The addition of PBDB&#8208;TCl unit deepens the highest occupied molecular orbital energy level, reducing voltage losses. Moreover, the introduction of the guest donor (D18&#8208;Cl) effectively regulates the phase&#8208;transition kinetics of PBDB&#8208;TFCl:D18&#8208;Cl:PY&#8208;IT during the film formation, leading to ideal size of aggregations and enhanced crystallinity. PBDB&#8208;TFCl:D18&#8208;Cl:PY&#8208;IT devices exhibit a PCE of 18.6% (certified as 18.3%), judged as the highest value so far obtained with all&#8208;PSCs. Besides, based on the ternary active layer, the manufactured 36 cm2 flexible modules exhibit a PCE of 15.1%. Meanwhile, the ternary PSCs exhibit superior photostability and mechanical stability. In summary, the proposed strategy, based on molecular design and the ternary strategy, allows optimization of the all&#8208;polymer blend morphology and improvement of the photovoltaic performance for stable large&#8208;scale flexible PSCs.

&lt;p&gt;By synthesizing a random terpolymer PBDB-TFCl and combining a ternary blending strategy, favorable phase separation and reinforced molecular packing are obtained. Resulting flexible organic solar modules exhibit maximum power conversion efficiency of 12.7% and excellent mechanical properties and photostability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) possess excellent operation stability and mechanical robustness than other types of organic solar cells, thereby attracting considerable attention for wearable flexible electron devices. However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all-PSCs are still lagging behind those of small-molecule-acceptor-based systems owing to the limitation of photoactive materials and unsatisfactory blend morphology. In this work, a novel terpolymer, denoted as PBDB-TFCl (poly4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b&#8243;]dithiophene-1,3-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-5,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;,8&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c&#8243;]dithiophene-4,8-dione-4,8-bis(4-chloro-5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b&#8242;]dithiophene), is used as an electron donor coupled with a ternary strategy to optimize the performance of all-PSCs. The addition of PBDB-TCl unit deepens the highest occupied molecular orbital energy level, reducing voltage losses. Moreover, the introduction of the guest donor (D18-Cl) effectively regulates the phase-transition kinetics of PBDB-TFCl:D18-Cl:PY-IT during the film formation, leading to ideal size of aggregations and enhanced crystallinity. PBDB-TFCl:D18-Cl:PY-IT devices exhibit a PCE of 18.6% (certified as 18.3%), judged as the highest value so far obtained with all-PSCs. Besides, based on the ternary active layer, the manufactured 36 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; flexible modules exhibit a PCE of 15.1%. Meanwhile, the ternary PSCs exhibit superior photostability and mechanical stability. In summary, the proposed strategy, based on molecular design and the ternary strategy, allows optimization of the all-polymer blend morphology and improvement of the photovoltaic performance for stable large-scale flexible PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>How Photogenerated I2 Induces I&#8208;Rich Phase Formation in Lead Mixed Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photogenerated I2 in the mixed I&#8208;Br perovskite induces I&#8208;rich phase formation through a chemical chain reaction. The Br&#8722; binding strength in the perovskite regulates the chemical chain reaction and thus the I&#8208;rich phase formation. This study demonstrates the increasing of Br&#8208;binding strength and eliminating of defects leading to I2 photogeneration in the lattice to stabilize the mixed I&#8208;Br perovskite.








Abstract
Bandgap tunability of lead mixed halide perovskites (LMHPs) is a crucial characteristic for versatile optoelectronic applications. Nevertheless, LMHPs show the formation of iodide&#8208;rich (I&#8208;rich) phase under illumination, which destabilizes the semiconductor bandgap and impedes their exploitation. Here, it is shown that how I2, photogenerated upon charge carrier trapping at iodine interstitials in LMHPs, can promote the formation of I&#8208;rich phase. I2 can react with bromide (Br&#8722;) in the perovskite to form a trihalide ion I2Br&#8722; (I&#948;&#8722;&#8208;I&#948;+&#8208;Br&#948;&#8722;), whose negatively charged iodide (I&#948;&#8722;) can further exchange with another lattice Br&#8722; to form the I&#8208;rich phase. Importantly, it is observed that the effectiveness of the process is dependent on the overall stability of the crystalline perovskite structure. Therefore, the bandgap instability in LMHPs is governed by two factors, i.e., the density of native defects leading to I2 production and the Br&#8722; binding strength within the crystalline unit. Eventually, this study provides rules for the design of chemical composition in LMHPs to reach their full potential for optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Grain Engineering of Sb2S3 Thin Films to Enable Efficient Planar Solar Cells with High Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work achieves large&#8208;grained Sb2S3 films by incorporating Ce3+ into the precursor solution for hydrothermal deposition. The formation of ultrathin Ce2S3 at the CdS/Sb2S3 interface is proposed to mediate the nucleation and growth of Sb2S3 grains. Planar Sb2S3 solar cells are achieved with an open&#8208;circuit voltage&#160;close to 800 mV (the highest reported to date), along with competitive efficiencies up to 7.66%.








Abstract
Sb2S3 is a promising environmentally friendly semiconductor for high performance solar cells. But, like many other polycrystalline materials, Sb2S3 is limited by nonradiative recombination and carrier scattering by grain boundaries (GBs). This work shows how the GB density in Sb2S3 films can be significantly reduced from 1068&#160;&#177;&#160;40&#160;to 327&#160;&#177;&#160;23&#160;nm &#181;m&#8722;2 by incorporating an appropriate amount of Ce3+ into the precursor solution for Sb2S3 deposition. Through extensive characterization of structural, morphological, and optoelectronic properties, complemented with computations, it is revealed that a critical factor is the formation of an ultrathin Ce2S3 layer at the CdS/Sb2S3 interface, which can reduce the interfacial energy and increase the adhesion work between Sb2S3 and the substrate to encourage heterogeneous nucleation of Sb2S3, as well as promote lateral grain growth. Through reductions in nonradiative recombination at GBs and/or the CdS/Sb2S3 heterointerface, as well as improved charge&#8208;carrier transport properties at the heterojunction, this work achieves high performance Sb2S3 solar cells with a power conversion efficiency reaching 7.66%. An impressive open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 796&#160;mV is achieved, which is the highest reported thus far for Sb2S3 solar cells. This work provides a strategy to simultaneously regulate the nucleation and growth of Sb2S3 absorber films for enhanced device performance.

         <title>Spontaneous Vortex&#8208;Antivortex Pairs and Their Topological Transitions in a Chiral&#8208;Lattice Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging field of quantum computing, which relies on multiple electronic states, has recently garnered significant attention. Here, the on&#8208;demand creation of multiple states in a helimagnet Fe0.5Co0.5Ge, including (anti)merons with N&#160;=&#160;&#177;1/2, bimerons, and skyrmions with N&#160;=&#160;&#8722;1 is presented. The transformations among these states through the application of magnetic fields and electric currents are demonstrated.








Abstract
The spontaneous formation and topological transitions of vortex&#8208;antivortex pairs have implications for a broad range of emergent phenomena, for example, from superconductivity to quantum computing. Unlike magnets exhibiting collinear spin textures, helimagnets with noncollinear spin textures provide unique opportunities to manipulate topological forms such as (anti)merons and (anti)skyrmions. However, it is challenging to achieve multiple topological states and their interconversion in a single helimagnet due to the topological protection for each state. Here, the on&#8208;demand creation of multiple topological states in a helimagnet Fe0.5Co0.5Ge, including a spontaneous vortex pair of meron with topological charge N&#160;=&#160;&#8722;1/2 and antimeron with N&#160;=&#160;1/2, and a vortex&#8208;antivortex bundle, that is, a bimeron (meron pair) with N&#160;=&#160;&#8722;1 is reported. The mutual transformation between skyrmions and bimerons with respect to the competitive effects of magnetic field and magnetic shape anisotropy is demonstrated. It is shown that electric currents drive the individual bimerons to form their connecting assembly and then into a skyrmion lattice. These findings signify the feasibility of designing topological states and offer new insights into the manipulation of noncollinear spin textures for potential applications in various fields.

It is shown that electric currents drive the individual bimerons to form their connecting assembly and then into a skyrmion lattice. These findings signify the feasibility of designing topological states and offer new insights into the manipulation of noncollinear spin textures for potential applications in various fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Printed Cellulose Nanofiber Aerogel Scaffold with Hierarchical Porous Structures for Fast Solar&#8208;Driven Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cellulose nanofiber&#8208;based bilayer scaffold for atmospheric water harvesting has been developed through 3D printing combined with freeze&#8208;drying, which introduces both a&#160;millimeter&#8208;sized grid structure for water sorption and evaporation enhancement, and a micrometer&#8208;sized pore structure for lithium chloride confinement. Benefiting from the milli/micrometer pore structures, the scaffold shows an excellent water sorption/release performance and good cyclic stability.








Abstract
Hygroscopic salt&#8208;based composite sorbents are considered ideal candidates for solar&#8208;driven atmospheric water harvesting. The primary challenge for the sorbents lies in exposing more hygroscopically active sites to the surrounding air while preventing salt leakage. Herein, a hierarchically structured scaffold is constructed by integrating cellulose nanofiber and lithium chloride (LiCl) as building blocks through 3D printing combined with freeze&#8208;drying. The milli/micrometer multiscale pores can effectively confine LiCl and simultaneously provide a more exposed active area for water sorption and release, accelerating both water sorption and evaporation kinetics of the 3D printed structure. Compared to a conventional freeze&#8208;dried aerogel, the 3D printed scaffold exhibits a water sorption rate that is increased 1.6&#8208;fold, along with a more than 2.4&#8208;fold greater water release rate. An array of bilayer scaffolds is demonstrated, which can produce 0.63&#160;g g&#8722;1 day&#8722;1 of water outdoors under natural sunlight. This article provides a sustainable strategy for collecting freshwater from the atmosphere.

         <title>Orderly Nanodendritic Nickel Substitute for Raney Nickel Catalyst Improving Alkali Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orderly dendritic nickel catalyst enables more effective charge/mass transport for high current density hydrogen evolution and promises an alternative to commercial Raney nickel in alkaline water electrolyzers.








Abstract
The development of nonprecious metal catalysts to meet the activity&#8208;stability balance at industrial&#8208;grade large current densities remains a challenge toward practical alkali&#8208;water electrolysis. Here, this work develops an orderly nanodendritic nickel (ND&#8208;Ni) catalyst that consists of ultrafine nanograins in chain&#8208;like&#160;conformation, which shows both excellent activity and robust stability for large current density hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media, superior to currently applied Raney nickel (R&#8208;Ni) catalyst in commercial alkali&#8208;water electrolyzer (AWE). The ND&#8208;Ni catalyst featured by a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) interconnecting microporous structure endows with high specific surface area and excellent conductivity and hydrophilicity, which together afford superior charge/mass transport favorable to HER kinetics at high current densities. An actual AWE with ND&#8208;Ni catalyst demonstrates durable water splitting with 1.0&#8201;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.71&#160;V under industrial conditions and renders a record&#8208;low power consumption of 3.95&#160;kW h Nm&#8722;3 with an energy efficiency close to 90%. The hydrogen price per gallon of gasoline equivalent (GGE) is calculated to be &#8776;$0.95, which is less than the target of $2.0 per GGE by 2026 from the U.S. Department of Energy. The results suggest the feasibility of ND&#8208;Ni substitute for R&#8208;Ni catalyst in commercial AWE.

         <title>Electrochemically and Thermally Stable Inorganics&#8211;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Robust Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An F&#8208;/N&#8208;containing inorganics&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase is constructed, which is electrochemically and thermally stable during the long&#8208;term cycles and safety abuse conditions. More than 6 times longer cycles compared with routine cells are achieved in 1.0 Ah pouch&#8208;type cells. The onset and triggering temperatures during the thermal runaway are increased from 70.8 and 117.4 to 100.6 and 153.1&#160;&#176;C, respectively.








Abstract
Severe dendrite growth and high&#8208;level activity of the lithium metal anode lead to a short life span and poor safety, seriously hindering the practical applications of lithium metal batteries. With a trisalt electrolyte design, an F&#8208;/N&#8208;containing inorganics&#8211;rich solid electrolyte interphase on a lithium anode is constructed, which is electrochemically and thermally stable over long&#8208;term cycles and safety abuse conditions. As a result, its Coulombic efficiency can be maintained over&#160;98.98% for 400 cycles. An 85.0% capacity can be retained for coin&#8208;type full cells with a 3.14 mAh cm&#8722;2 LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode after 200 cycles and 1.0 Ah pouch&#8208;type full cells with a 4.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 cathode after 72 cycles. During the thermal runaway tests of a cycled 1.0 Ah pouch cell, the onset and triggering temperatures&#160;were increased from 70.8 &#176;C&#160;and 117.4 &#176;C&#160;to 100.6 &#176;C&#160;and 153.1&#160;&#176;C, respectively, indicating a greatly enhanced safety performance. This work gives&#160;novel insights into electrolyte and interface design, potentially paving the way for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, long&#8208;life&#8208;span, and thermally safe lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Manipulating Electron Redistribution in Ni2P for Enhanced Alkaline Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv is successfully synthesized through manipulation of electron redistribution in Ni2P addressed by cation doping and vacancy engineering. Bifunctional Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv achieves the industrially required high current densities at low voltages for overall seawater splitting at 60 &#176;C in 6.0&#160;m KOH seawater. In Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv, P vacancies greatly improve the electrical conductivity, and Ni sites are the dominant oxygen evolution reaction active centers; meanwhile Fe atoms as active centers for the HER, synergistically improve electrocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Developing bifunctional electrocatalyst for seawater splitting remains a persistent challenge. Herein, an approach is proposed through density functional theory (DFT) preanalysis to manipulate electron redistribution in Ni2P addressed by cation doping and vacancy engineering. The needle&#8208;like Fe&#8208;doped Ni2P with P vacancy (Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv) is successfully synthesized on nickel foam, exhibiting a superior bifunctional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity for seawater electrolysis in alkaline condition. As a result, bifunctional Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv achieves the industrially required current densities of 1.0 and 3.0 A cm&#8722;2 at low voltages of 1.68 and 1.73&#160;V, respectively, for seawater splitting at 60 &#176;C in 6.0&#160;m KOH circumstances. The theoretical calculation and the experimental results collectively reveal the reasons for the enhancement of catalyst activity. Specifically, Fe doping and P vacancies can accelerate the reconstruction of OER active species and optimize the hydrogen adsorption free energy (&#916;GH*) for HER. In addition, the active sites of Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv are identified, where P vacancies greatly improve the electrical conductivity and Ni sites are the dominant OER active centers, meanwhile Fe atoms as active centers for the HER. The study provides a deep insight into the exploration for the enhancement of activity of nickel&#8208;based phosphide catalysts and the identification of their real active centers.

In addition, the active sites of Fe-Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pv are identified, where P vacancies greatly improve the electrical conductivity and Ni sites are the dominant OER active centers, meanwhile Fe atoms as active centers for the HER. The study provides a deep insight into the exploration for the enhancement of activity of nickel-based phosphide catalysts and the identification of their real active centers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries
Chemically replaced interfacial layer design, via unveiling the influence of zinc (Zn) crystal facets for aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries, is introduced by Dong&#8208;Wan Kim and co&#8208;workers in article number 2308684. Owing to the unique crystallographic (high zincophilicity and surface energy), morphological (abundant active sites and uniform current/Zn2+ flux), and compositional (suppressed side&#8208;reactions of metallic Sn) merits of the chemically replaced layer, uniform dendrite&#8208;free Zn(002)&#8208;preferred Zn deposition is guided and unfavorable side&#8208;reactions are suppressed. A superior performance even under practical operating conditions is thereby achieved.

Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries
In article number 2305128, Qing Sun, Shang Wang, Yanhong Tian, Andreu Cabot, and co&#8208;workers report an investigation of the energy&#8208;storage mechanism of a layered Bi2Te3&#8208;based cathode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). They demonstrate that the zinc ion is not inserted into the cathode as previously assumed; in contrast, proton charge&#8208;storage dominates the process. They also demonstrate the great application prospects of aqueous ZIBs in flexible electronics via jet printing technology.

Zinc Anodes
In article number 2307219, Huanlei Wang, Jingyi Wu, Guihua Yu, and co&#8208;workers report Co single atoms as an electrolyte additive to facilitate dendrite&#8208;free zinc anodes. The additive can be preferentially adsorbed on the zinc surface in which the atomically dispersed zincophilic active site with strong charge polarization effect regulates the microspace electric field at the Zn&#8211;electrolyte interphase, thus promoting uniform zinc deposition.

Graphene Nanopores
In article number 2307242, Liping Guo, Luda Wang, and co&#8208;workers report functionalized graphene nanopores that exhibit distinct monovalent&#8208;ion transport behaviors including exquisite intercation or anion/cation selectivity. These prominent performances not only strongly rely on the ultralow permeability resistance of atomically thin graphene, but they also are attributed to the synergistic effects of steric hindrance and electrostatic interactions.

These prominent performances not only strongly rely on the ultralow permeability resistance of atomically thin graphene, but they also are attributed to the synergistic effects of steric hindrance and electrostatic interactions.

Atmospheric Water Harvesting
In article number 2306653, Wenshuai Chen, Gang Chen, Feng Jiang, and co&#8208;workers report a hierarchically structured cellulose nanofiber/lithium chloride scaffold through 3D printing combined with freeze&#8208;drying methods for solar&#8208;driven atmospheric water harvesting. The milli&#8208;/micrometer multiscale pores provide more exposed active area with the surrounding air, thus accelerating both water sorption and evaporation kinetics of the 3D&#8208;printed structure.

         <title>Liquid Metal Actuators: A Comparative Analysis of Surface Tension Controlled Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the operation and design principles of surface tension&#8208;controlled actuation by liquid metals and discusses their performance and functionalities. Theoretical pathways toward higher performances, thanks to the unique scaling law of surface tension, are analyzed and compared to other popular soft actuators. The review concludes by offering a roadmap for future research&#160;directions.








Abstract
Liquid metals, with their unique combination of electrical and mechanical properties, offer great opportunities for actuation based on surface tension modulation. Thanks to the scaling laws of surface tension, which can be electrochemically controlled at low voltages, liquid metal actuators stand out from other soft actuators for their remarkable characteristics such as high contractile strain rates and higher work densities at smaller length scales. This review summarizes the principles of liquid metal actuators and discusses their performance as well as theoretical pathways toward higher performances. The objective is to provide a comparative analysis of the ongoing development of liquid metal actuators. The design principles of the liquid metal actuators are analyzed, including low&#8208;level elemental principles (kinematics and electrochemistry), mid&#8208;level structural principles (reversibility, integrity, and scalability), and high&#8208;level functionalities. A wide range of practical use cases of liquid metal actuators from robotic locomotion and object manipulation to logic and computation is reviewed. From an energy perspective, strategies are compared for coupling the liquid metal actuators with an energy source toward fully untethered robots. The review concludes by offering a roadmap of future research directions of liquid metal actuators.

         <title>Coplanar Conformational Structure of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coplanar conformational segment of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer is a unique structure with a rigid backbone, long effective conjugated length, and narrow bandgap, which may enhance emission behavior, strengthen &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, and improve charge transport. This overview mainly reports the recent development of coplanar conformational structure of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers. The characteristics, analysis methods, preparation, and their optoelectronic application are introduced and summarized systematically.








Abstract
Hierarchical structure of conjugated polymers is critical to dominating their optoelectronic properties and applications. Compared to nonplanar conformational segments, coplanar conformational segments of conjugated polymers (CPs) demonstrate favorable properties for applications as a semiconductor. Herein, recent developments in the coplanar conformational structure of CPs for optoelectronic devices are summarized. First, this review comprehensively summarizes the unique properties of planar conformational structures. Second, the characteristics of the coplanar conformation in terms of optoelectrical properties and other polymer physics characteristics are emphasized. Five primary characterization methods for investigating the complanate backbone structures are illustrated, providing a systematical toolbox for studying this specific conformation. Third, internal and external conditions for inducing the coplanar conformational structure are presented, offering guidelines for designing this conformation. Fourth, the optoelectronic applications of this segment, such as light&#8208;emitting diodes, solar cells, and field&#8208;effect transistors, are briefly summarized. Finally, a conclusion and outlook for the coplanar conformational segment regarding molecular design and applications are provided.

         <title>3D Motion Manipulation for Micro&#8208; and Nanomachines: Progress and Future Directions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into the latest progress made in micro&#8208; and nanomachines (MNMs) with three&#8208;dimensional (3D) motion capabilities by different manipulation approaches, discusses the underlying motion mechanisms and their corresponding applications, explores potential design concepts inspired by nature for guiding the future design direction in controllable 3D motile MNMs, and presents the available 3D observation and tracking systems.








Abstract
In the past decade, micro&#8208; and nanomachines (MNMs) have made outstanding achievements in the fields of targeted drug delivery, tumor therapy, microsurgery, biological detection, and environmental monitoring and remediation. Researchers have made significant efforts to accelerate the rapid development of MNMs capable of moving through fluids by means of different energy sources (chemical reactions, ultrasound, light, electricity, magnetism, heat, or their combinations). However, the motion of MNMs is primarily investigated in confined two&#8208;dimensional (2D) horizontal setups. Furthermore, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) motion control remains challenging, especially for vertical movement and control, significantly limiting its potential applications in cargo transportation, environmental remediation, and biotherapy. Hence, an urgent need is to develop MNMs that can overcome self&#8208;gravity and controllably move in 3D spaces. This review delves into the latest progress made in MNMs with 3D motion capabilities under different manipulation approaches, discusses the underlying motion mechanisms, explores potential design concepts inspired by nature for controllable 3D motion in MNMs, and presents the available 3D observation and tracking systems.

         <title>Bistable Spin&#8208;Crossover Nanoparticles for Molecular Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;crossover materials showing bistability are very attractive for fabricating molecular electronic devices. Departing from chemical design, this paper reports on how the miniaturization as nanoparticles and their integration into various architectures, in particular combining them with two&#8208;dimensional materials,&#160;provides a suitable approach to prepare robust and resilient devices for electrically sensing spin transitions.








Abstract
The field of spin&#8208;crossover complexes is rapidly evolving from the study of the spin transition phenomenon to its exploitation in molecular electronics. Such spin transition is gradual in a single&#8208;molecule, while in bulk it can be abrupt, showing sometimes thermal hysteresis and thus a memory effect. A convenient way to keep this bistability while reducing the size of the spin&#8208;crossover material is to process it as nanoparticles (NPs). Here, the most recent advances in the chemical design of these NPs and their integration into electronic devices, paying particular attention to optimizing the switching ratio are reviewed. Then, integrating spin&#8208;crossover NPs over 2D materials is focused to improve the endurance, performance, and detection of the spin state in these hybrid devices.

         <title>Inorganic All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries: Electrolyte Designing and Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes various inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (such as oxide&#8208;based, NASICON&#8208;type, sulfide&#8208;based, etc.) for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries. Their crystal structures, and modification strategies to enhance ionic conductivity are discussed. Additionally, methods for modifying the interfaces between solid electrolytes and cathodes/anodes, and optimizing full battery performance are explored. Lastly, the future development directions of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries are proposed.








Abstract
Inorganic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries (IASSSBs) are emerged as promising candidates to replace commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems due to their potential advantages, such as abundant raw materials, robust safety, low price, high&#8208;energy density, favorable reliability and stability. Inorganic sodium solid electrolytes (ISSEs) are an indispensable component of IASSSBs, gaining significant attention. Herein, this review begins by discussing the fundamentals of ISSEs, including their ionic conductivity, mechanical property, chemical and electrochemical stabilities. It then presents the crystal structures of advanced ISSEs (e.g., &#946;/&#946;''&#8208;alumina, NASICON, sulfides, complex hydride and halide electrolytes) and the related issues, along with corresponding modification strategies. The review also outlines effective approaches for forming intimate interfaces between ISSEs and working electrodes. Finally, current challenges and critical perspectives for the potential developments and possible directions to improve interfacial contacts for future practical applications of ISSEs are highlighted. This comprehensive review aims to advance the understanding and development of next&#8208;generation rechargeable IASSSBs.

         <title>Leveraging Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles for Combination Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have been widely used in tumor treatment. Through modification, SPNs can encapsulate or conjugate with various types of immune modulators. This review summarizes the recent progress of SPNs&#8208;based combination cancer immunotherapy and highlights the synergetic effect that amplifies the anti&#8208;tumor immune response.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy has become a promising method for cancer treatment, bringing hope to advanced cancer patients. However, immune&#8208;related adverse events caused by immunotherapy also bring heavy burden to patients. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as an emerging nanomaterial with high biocompatibility, can eliminate tumors and induce tumor immunogenic cell death through different therapeutic modalities, including photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and sonodynamic therapy. In addition, SPNs can work as a functional nanocarrier to synergize with a variety of immunomodulators to amplify anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. In this review, SPNs&#8208;based combination cancer immunotherapy is comprehensively summarized according to the SPNs&#8217; therapeutic modalities and the type of loaded immunomodulators. The in&#8208;depth understanding of existing SPNs&#8208;based therapeutic modalities will hopefully inspire the design of more novel nanomaterials with potent anti&#8208;tumor immune effects, and ultimately promote their clinical translation.

         <title>Wearable and Implantable Cortisol&#8208;Sensing Electronics for Stress Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable and implantable device can be placed on the body to continuously monitor the status of the subject. Cortisol, a hormone released in response to stress, varies in concentration among individuals and its fluctuations are not consistent. In this review, recent research that utilizes continuous measurements to analyze the dynamic stress response is examined.








Abstract
Cortisol is a steroid hormone that is released from the body in response to stress. Although a moderate level of cortisol secretion can help the body maintain homeostasis, excessive secretion can cause various diseases, such as depression and anxiety. Conventional methods for cortisol measurement undergo procedures that limit continuous monitoring, typically collecting samples of bodily fluids, followed by separate analysis in a laboratory setting that takes several hours. Thus, recent studies demonstrate wearable, miniaturized sensors integrated with electronic modules that enable wireless real&#8208;time analysis. Here, the primary focus is on wearable and implantable electronic devices that continuously measure cortisol concentration. Diverse types of cortisol&#8208;sensing techniques, such as antibody&#8208;, DNA&#8208;aptamer&#8208;, and molecularly imprinted polymer&#8208;based sensors, as well as wearable and implantable devices that aim to continuously monitor cortisol in a minimally invasive fashion are discussed. In addition to the cortisol monitors that directly measure stress levels, other schemes that indirectly measure stress, such as electrophysiological signals and sweat are also summarized. Finally, the challenges and future directions in stress monitoring and management electronics are reviewed.

         <title>Material Breakthroughs in Smart Food Monitoring: Intelligent Packaging and On&#8208;Site Testing Technologies for Spoilage and Contamination Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper comprehensively reviews material breakthroughs in in situ and on&#8208;site food monitoring. Base material substrates are discussed, both with regards to their intrinsic material properties and their contributions within recently reported sensing platforms. Biogenic amine, pH, and pathogen monitoring are all examined. Finally, a situational assessment and anticipated future directions are outlined.








Abstract
Despite extensive commercial and regulatory interventions, food spoilage and contamination continue to impose massive ramifications on human health and the global economy. Recognizing that such issues will be significantly eliminated by the accurate and timely monitoring of food quality markers, smart food sensors have garnered significant interest as platforms for both real&#8208;time, in&#8208;package food monitoring and on&#8208;site commercial testing. In both cases, the sensitivity, stability, and efficiency of the developed sensors are largely informed by underlying material design, driving focus toward the creation of advanced materials optimized for such applications. Herein, a comprehensive review of emerging intelligent materials and sensors developed in this space is provided, through the lens of three key food quality markers &#8211; biogenic amines, pH, and pathogenic microbes. Each sensing platform is presented with targeted consideration toward the contributions of the underlying metallic or polymeric substrate to the sensing mechanism and detection performance. Further, the real&#8208;world applicability of presented works is considered with respect to their capabilities, regulatory adherence, and commercial potential. Finally, a situational assessment of the current state of intelligent food monitoring technologies is provided, discussing material&#8208;centric strategies to address their existing limitations, regulatory concerns, and commercial considerations.

         <title>Review of Carbon Support Coordination Environments for Single Metal Atom Electrocatalysts (SACS)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon support single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are widely investigated in numerous electrocatalytic systems due to their high selectivity and activity from size effects and unique metal&#8208;support interactions. This review summarizes the recent progress on carbon&#8208;supported SACs in key electrocatalytic systems from the perspective of their coordination environment regulations that greatly affect the electrocatalytic activity and electrocatalytic selectivity.








Abstract
This topical review focuses on the distinct role of carbon support coordination environment of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for electrocatalysis. The article begins with an overview of atomic coordination configurations in SACs, including a discussion of the advanced characterization techniques and simulation used for understanding the active sites. A summary of key electrocatalysis applications is then provided. These processes are oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The review then shifts to modulation of the metal atom&#8208;carbon coordination environments, focusing on nitrogen and other non&#8208;metal coordination through modulation at the first coordination shell and modulation in the second and higher coordination shells. Representative case studies are provided, starting with the classic four&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single metal atom (M&#63743;N4) based SACs. Bimetallic coordination models including homo&#8208;paired and hetero&#8208;paired active sites are also discussed, being categorized as emerging approaches. The theme of the discussions is the correlation between synthesis methods for selective doping, the carbon structure&#8211;electron configuration changes associated with the doping, the analytical techniques used to ascertain these changes, and the resultant electrocatalysis performance. Critical unanswered questions as well as promising underexplored research directions are identified.

         <title>J&#8208;Aggregation Strategy toward Potentiated NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Bioimaging of Molecular Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review emphatically concentrates on the detailed summary of strategic design and comprehensive overview of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) J&#8208;aggregated scaffolds for perfecting and extending the NIR&#8208;II imaging window. By overviewing the nowadays research advances, this review paves the way for constructing bright NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregated emitters to promote bioimaging applications.








Abstract
Molecular fluorophores emitting in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700 nm) window with strong optical harvesting and high quantum yields hold great potential for in vivo deep&#8208;tissue bioimaging and high&#8208;resolution biosensing. Recently, J&#8208;aggregates are harnessed to engineer long&#8208;wavelength NIR&#8208;II emitters and show unique superiority in tumor detection, vessel mapping, surgical navigation, and phototheranostics due to their bathochromic&#8208;shifted optical bands in the required slip&#8208;stacked arrangement aggregation state. However, despite the preliminary progress of NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates and theoretical study of structure&#8208;property relationships, further paradigms of NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates remain scarce due to the lack of study on aggregated fluorophores with slip&#8208;stacked fashion. In this effort, how to utilize the specific molecular structure to form slip&#8208;stacked packing motifs with J&#8208;type aggregated exciton coupling is emphatically elucidated. First, several molecular regulating strategies to achieve NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates containing intermolecular interactions and external conditions are positively summarized and deeply analyzed. Then, the recent reports on J&#8208;aggregates for NIR&#8208;II bioimaging and theranostics are systematically summarized to provide a clear reference and direction for promoting the development of NIR&#8208;II organic fluorophores. Eventually, the prospective efforts on ameliorating and promoting NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates to further clinical practices are outlined.

         <title>2D Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Liquid&#8208;Phase Molecular Separations: State of the Field, Common Pitfalls, and Future Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D covalent organic framework (COF) membranes are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation molecular sieves due to their uniform, tunable pores, but inconsistent characterization practices are currently leading this subfield astray. This review identifies common characterization pitfalls in existing 2D COF membrane literature and establishes rigorous protocols for assigning membrane structures and molecular transport mechanisms to direct the field toward achieving its long&#8208;term promise.








Abstract
2D covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) are attractive candidates for next&#8208;generation membranes due to their robust linkages and uniform, tunable pores. Many publications have claimed to achieve selective molecular transport through COF pores, but reported performance metrics for similar networks vary dramatically, and in several cases the reported experiments are inadequate to support such conclusions. These issues require a reevaluation of the literature. Published examples of 2D COF membranes for liquid&#8208;phase separations can be broadly divided into two categories, each with common performance characteristics: polycrystalline COF films (most &gt;1&#160;&#181;m thick) and weakly crystalline or amorphous films (most &lt;500&#160;nm thick). Neither category has demonstrated consistent relationships between the designed COF pore structure and separation performance, suggesting that these imperfect materials do not sieve molecules through uniform pores. In this perspective, rigorous practices for evaluating COF membrane structures and separation performance are described, which will facilitate their development toward molecularly precise membranes capable of performing previously unrealized chemical separations. In the absence of this more rigorous standard of proof, reports of COF&#8208;based membranes should be treated with skepticism. As methods to control 2D polymerization improve, precise 2D polymer membranes may exhibit exquisite and energy efficient performance relevant for contemporary separation challenges.

         <title>3D Printed Architectured Silicones with Autonomic Self&#8208;Healing and Creep&#8208;Resistant Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Self&#8208;healing silicones that are able to restore the functionalities and extend the lifetime of soft devices hold great potential in many applications. However, currently available silicones need to be triggered to self&#8208;heal or suffer from creep&#8208;induced irreversible deformation during use. Here, we design and print silicone objects that are programmed at the molecular and architecture levels to achieve self&#8208;healing at room temperature while simultaneously resisting creep. At the molecular scale, dioxaborolanes moieties are incorporated into silicones to synthesize self&#8208;healing vitrimers, whereas conventional covalent bonds are exploited to make creep&#8208;resistant elastomers. When combined into architectured printed parts at a coarser length scale, layered materials exhibit fast healing at room temperature without compromising the elastic recovery obtained from covalent polymer networks. A patient&#8208;specific vascular phantom is printed to demonstrate the potential of architectured silicones in creating damage&#8208;resilient functional devices using molecularly designed elastomer materials.

         <title>Revamping Triboelectric Output by Deep Trap Construction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible TENG with ultrahigh electrical output for application in IoT is developed by constructing deep traps from the incorporation of KH556. The deep traps can effectively trap triboelectric charges and reduce the rate of charge dissipation, resulting in a 1300% enhancement in output power density.








Abstract
High output performance is critical for building triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) for future multifunctional applications. Unfortunately, the high triboelectric charge dissipation rate has a significant negative&#160;impact on its electrical output performance. Herein, a new&#160;tribolayer is designed through introducing self&#8208;assembled molecules with large energy gaps on commercial PET fibric to&#160;form carrier deep traps, which improve charge retention while decreasing dissipation rates. The deep trap density of the PET increases by two orders of magnitude, resulting in an 86% reduction in the rate of charge dissipation and a significant increase in the charge density that can be accumulated on tribolayer during physical contact. The key explanation is that increasing the density of deep traps improves the dielectric's ability to store charges, making it more difficult for the triboelectric charges trapped by the tribolayer to escape from the deep traps, lowering the rate of charge dissipation. This TENG has a 1300% increase in output power density as a result of altering the deep trap density, demonstrating a significant improvement. This work describes a simple yet&#160;efficient method for building TENGs with&#160;ultra&#8208;high electrical output and promotes their practical implementation in the sphere of the Internet of Things.

         <title>Wearable Sensors for Breath Monitoring Based on Water&#8208;based Hexagonal Boron Nitride Inks Made with Supramolecular Functionalization</title>

Abstract
Wearable humidity sensors are attracting strong attention as they allow to continuously monitor in real time important physiological information by enabling activity tracking as well as air quality assessment. Amongst 2&#8208;Dimensional (2D) materials, Graphene Oxide (GO) is very attractive for humidity sensing due to its tuneable surface chemistry, high surface area, processability in water and easy integration onto flexible substrates. However, large hysteresis, low sensitivity and strong cross&#8208;sensitivity issues limit the use of GO in practical applications, where continuous monitoring is preferred. Herein, we demonstrate a wearable and wireless impedance&#8208;based humidity sensor made with pyrene&#8208;functionalized hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) nanosheets, which shows enhanced sensitivity towards relative humidity, RH (&gt;1010 Ohms/%RH in the range from 5% to 100%RH), fast response (0.1&#160;ms), no appreciable hysteresis and cross&#8208;sensitivity in the range of 25&#8211;60&#176;C. We finally demonstrate that the h&#8208;BN based sensor is able to monitor the whole breathing cycle process of exhaling and inhaling, hence enabling to record in real time the subtlest changes of respiratory signals associated with different daily activities as well as various symptoms of flu, without requiring any direct contact with the individual.

         <title>Ultraviolet Light Debondable Optically Clear Adhesives for Flexible Displays through Efficient Visible&#8208;Light Curing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A UV&#8208;removable optically clear adhesive (OCA) is introduced, ideal for the sustainability&#8208;focused electronics industry, particularly for foldable devices requiring easy disassembly and robust, eco&#8208;friendly materials.








Abstract
With growing sustainability concerns, the need for products that facilitate easy disassembly and reuse has increased. Adhesives, initially designed for bonding, now face demands for selective removal, enabling rapid assembly&#8208;disassembly and efficient maintenance across industries. This need is particularly evident in the display industry, with the rise of foldable devices necessitating specialized adhesives. A novel optically clear adhesive (OCA) is presented for foldable display, featuring a unique UV&#8208;stimulated selective removal feature. This approach incorporates benzophenone derivatives into the polymer network, facilitating rapid debonding under UV irradiation. A key feature of this method is the adept use of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical polymerization for OCA film fabrication. This method shows remarkable compatibility with various monomers and exhibits orthogonal reactivity to benzophenone, rendering it ideal for large&#8208;scale production. The resultant OCA not only has high transparency and balanced elasticity, along with excellent resistance to repeated folding, but it also exhibits significantly reduced adhesion when exposed to UV irradiation. By merging this customized formulation with strategically integrated UV&#8208;responsive elements, an effective solution is offered that enhances manufacturing efficiency and product reliability in the rapidly evolving field of sustainable electronics and displays. This research additionally contributes to eco&#8208;friendly device fabrication, aligning with emerging technology demands.

         <title>Localization of Cancer Cells for Subsequent Robust Photodynamic Therapy by ROS Responsive Polymeric Nanoparticles With Anti&#8208;Metastasis Complexes NAMI&#8208;A</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most cancer&#8208;related deaths are caused by tumor metastasis. This study pioneers a new photodynamic therapy that can precisely target the primary tumor while capable of halting tumor metastasis, enabling the siege of highly metastatic triple&#8208;negative breast tumors and providing a promising paradigm for the treatment of highly metastatic cancers.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), as a new type of light&#8208;mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) cancer therapy, has the advantages of high therapeutic efficiency, non&#8208;resistance, and less trauma than traditional cancer therapy such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. However, oxygen&#8208;dependent PDT further exacerbates tumor metastasis. To this end, a strategy that circumvents tumor metastasis to improve the therapeutic efficacy of PDT is proposed. Herein, a near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;activated photosensitive polymer is synthesized and branched the anti&#8208;metastatic ruthenium complex NAMI&#8208;A on the side, which is further assembled to form nanoparticles (NP2) for breast cancer therapy. NP2 can kill tumor cells by generating ROS under 808&#160;nm radiation (NP2 + L), reduce the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2/9) in cancer cells, decrease the invasive and migration capacity of cancer cells, and eliminate cancer cells. Further animal experiments show that NP2 + L can inhibit tumor growth and reduce liver and lung metastases. In addition, NP2 + L can activate the immune system in mice to avoid tumor recurrence. In conclusion, a PDT capable of both preventing tumor metastasis and precisely hitting the primary tumor to achieve effective treatment of highly metastatic cancers is developed.

         <dc:description>
This review paper focuses on memristor&#8208;based neuromorphic chips, which provide an extensive description of the working principle and characteristic features of memristors, along with their applications in the realm of neuromorphic chips. Additionally, the key performance metrics of the chip is highlighted, as well as the key metrics related to the memristor devices are employed to realize both the synaptic and neuronal components.








Abstract
In the era of information, characterized by an exponential growth in data volume and an escalating level of data abstraction, there has been a substantial focus on brain&#8208;like chips, which are known for their robust processing power and energy&#8208;efficient operation. Memristors are widely acknowledged as the optimal electronic devices for the realization of neuromorphic computing, due to their innate ability to emulate the interconnection and information transfer processes witnessed among neurons. This review paper focuses on memristor&#8208;based neuromorphic chips, which provide an extensive description of the working principle and characteristic features of memristors, along with their applications in the realm of neuromorphic chips. Subsequently, a thorough discussion of the memristor array, which serves as the pivotal component of the neuromorphic chip, as well as an examination of the present mainstream neural networks, is delved. Furthermore, the design of the neuromorphic chip is categorized into three crucial sections, including synapse&#8208;neuron cores, networks on chip (NoC), and neural network design. Finally, the key performance metrics of the chip is highlighted, as well as the key metrics related to the memristor devices are employed to realize both the synaptic and neuronal components.

         <title>Perspectives on the Novel Multifunctional Nerve Guidance Conduits: From Specific Regenerative Procedures to Motor Function Rebuilding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review highlights the contribution of multifunctional nerve guidance conduits (NGC) and influence of their microscale biomaterial architecture on the nerve repairment. Chemical molecule induction, heterogeneous topographical morphology, anisotropic assembly microstructure, electroactivity and magnetic&#8208;sensitivity are expected to be pioneering features in the effective NGCs. The biosafety assessment and clinical trials of multifunctional NGCs are urgently required before the commercial application.








Abstract
Peripheral nerve injury potentially destroys the quality of life by inducing functional movement disorders and sensory capacity loss, which results in severe disability and substantial psychological, social, and financial burdens. Autologous nerve grafting has been commonly used as treatment in the clinic; however, its rare donor availability limits its application. A series of artificial nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) with advanced architectures are also proposed to promote injured peripheral nerve regeneration, which is a complicated process from axon sprouting to targeted muscle reinnervation. Therefore, exploring the interactions between sophisticated NGC complexes and versatile cells during each process including axon sprouting, Schwann cell dedifferentiation, nerve myelination, and muscle reinnervation is necessary. This review highlights the contribution of functional NGCs and the influence of microscale biomaterial architecture on biological processes of nerve repair. Progressive NGCs with chemical molecule induction, heterogenous topographical morphology, electroactive, anisotropic assembly microstructure, and self&#8208;powered electroactive and magnetic&#8208;sensitive NGCs are also collected, and they are expected to be pioneering features in future multifunctional and effective NGCs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal nanoclusters (NCs) are well&#8208;recognized as novel nano&#8208;agents for addressing deficiency in nanomedicine, whose biology&#8208;related fundamentals and recent advances are summarized in this review with emphasis on their multiscale bioresponses from the molecular, cellular, to organismal levels, allowing a clear and comprehensive understanding to meet the design requirements toward the highly efficient nanomedical modalities.








Abstract
Metal nanoclusters (NCs) are well&#8208;recognized novel nano&#8208;agents that hold great promise for applications in nanomedicine because of their ultrafine size, low toxicity, and high renal clearance. As foreign substances, however, an in&#8208;depth understanding of the bioresponses to metal NCs is necessary but is still far from being realized. Herein, this review is deployed to summarize the biofates of metal NCs at various biological levels, emphasizing their multiscale bioresponses at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. In the parts&#8208;to&#8208;whole schema, the interactions between biomolecules and metal NCs are discussed, presenting typical protein&#8208;dictated nano&#8211;bio interfaces, hierarchical structures, and in vivo trajectories. Then, the accumulation, internalization, and metabolic evolution of metal NCs in the cellular environment and as&#8208;imparted theranostic functionalization are demonstrated. The organismal metabolism and transportation processes of the metal NCs are subsequently distilled. Finally, this review ends with the conclusions and perspectives on the outstanding issues of metal NC&#8208;mediated bioresponses in the near future. This review is expected to provide inspiration for tailoring the customization of metal NC&#8208;based nano&#8208;agents to meet practical requirements in different sectors of nanomedicine.

         <title>Terahertz Conductivity of Free&#8208;Standing 3D Covalent Organic Framework Membranes Fabricated via Triple&#8208;Layer&#8208;Dual Interfacial Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a unique triple&#8208;layer&#8208;dual interfacial (TLDI) approach for the simultaneous synthesis of two 3D covalent organic framework membranes (3D COFMs) is developed. Besides, the optical conductivity of these free&#8208;standing 3D COFMs is analyzed using terahertz (THz) spectroscopy in transmission mode. Interestingly, these membranes show excellent transmittance at THz frequencies with high intrinsic THz conductivities.








Abstract
Processable covalent organic framework membranes (COFM) are emerging as potential semiconducting materials for device applications. Nevertheless, the fabrication of crystalline and free&#8208;standing 3D COFMs is challenging. In this work, a unique time and solvent&#8208;efficient triple&#8208;layer&#8208;dual interfacial (TLDI) approach for the simultaneous synthesis of two 3D COFMs from a single system is developed. Besides, for the first time, the optical conductivity of these free&#8208;standing 3D COFMs is analyzed using terahertz (THz) spectroscopy in transmission mode. Interestingly, these membranes show excellent transmittance at THz frequencies with very high intrinsic THz conductivities. The evaluated scattering time and plasma frequency of the free carriers of the COFMs are highly promising for future applications in optoelectronic devices in THz frequencies.

Porifera&#8208;inspired lightweight, thin, wrinkle&#8208;resistant, and multifunctional MXene foam. Schematic illustration of the fabrication, structure, multifunction, and potential application of porifera&#8208;inspired MXene foam.








Abstract
Transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes) demonstrate a massive potential in constructing lightweight, multifunctional wearable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shields for application in various fields. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to develop a facile, scalable approach to prepare the MXene&#8208;based macrostructures characterized by low density, low thickness, high mechanical flexibility, and high EMI SE at the same time. Herein, the ultrathin MXene/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/Ag foams with a porifera&#8208;inspired hierarchically porous microstructure are prepared by combining Zn2+ diffusion induction and hard template methods. The hierarchical porosity, which includes a mesoporous skeleton and a microporous MXene network within the skeleton, not only exerts a regulatory effect on stress distribution during compression, making the foams rubber&#8208;like resistant to wrinkling but also provides more channels for multiple reflections of electromagnetic waves. Due to the interaction between Ag nanosheets, MXene/rGO, and porous structure, it is possible to produce an outstanding EMI shielding performance with the specific surface shielding effectiveness reaching 109152.4&#160;dB&#160;cm2&#160;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, the foams exhibit multifunctionalities, such as transverse Joule heating, longitudinal heat insulation, self&#8208;cleaning, fire resistance, and motion detection. These discoveries open up a novel pathway for the development of lightweight MXene&#8208;based materials with considerable application potential in wearable electromagnetic anti&#8208;interference devices.

         <title>Mechanochemically Reprogrammed Interface Orchestrates Neutrophil Bactericidal Activity and Apoptosis for Preventing Implant&#8208;Associated Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The implant surface with phytic acid&#8211;Zn2+ coordinated nanopillars and oxygen self&#8208;supporting nanoparticles, named as CPZTs, is mechanochemically reprogrammed. CPZTs prevent implant&#8208;associated infection by repelling bacterial adhesion, killing attached bacteria, and facilitating neutrophil bactericidal activity. Meanwhile, self&#8208;supporting oxygen allows neutrophils to orchestrate intracellular bactericidal activity and apoptosis under hypoxia, contributing to inflammation resolution.








Abstract
The onset of implant&#8208;associated infection (IAI) triggers a cascade of immune responses, which are initially dominated by neutrophils. Bacterial aggregate formation and hypoxic microenvironment, which occur shortly after implantation, may be two major risk factors that impair neutrophil function and lead to IAI. Here, the implant surface with phytic acid&#8211;Zn2+ coordinated TiO2 nanopillar arrays (PA&#8211;Zn@TiNPs) and oxygen self&#8208;supporting CaO2 nanoparticles, named as CPZTs, is mechanochemically reprogrammed. The engineered CPZTs interface integrates multiple properties to inhibit the formation of nascent biofilm, encompassing antibacterial adhesion, mechanobactericidal effect, and chemobiocidal effect. Meanwhile, continuous oxygenation fuels the neutrophils with reactive oxygen species (ROS) for efficient bacterial elimination on the implant surface and inside the neutrophils. Furthermore, this surface modulation strategy accelerates neutrophil apoptosis and promotes M2 macrophage&#8208;mediated osteogenesis both in vitro and in a rat model of IAI. In conclusion, targeting neutrophils for immunomodulation is a practical and effective strategy to prevent IAI and promote bone&#8211;implant integration.

         <title>Ordered Mesoporous Crystalline Frameworks Toward Promising Energy Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ordered mesoporous crystalline frameworks (MCFs), which possess both functional frameworks and well&#8208;defined porosity, have been receiving considerable attention because of their unique properties including high surface areas, large pore sizes, tailored porous structures and compositions. Construction of novel crystalline mesoporous architectures that allows for rich accessible active sites and efficient mass transfer is envisaged to offer ample opportunities for potential energy&#8208;related applications. In this review, the rational synthesis, unique structures, and energy applications of MCFs are the main focus. After summarizing the synthetic approaches, an emphasis is placed on the delicate control of crystallites, mesophases, nano&#8208;architectures by concluding basic principles and showing representative examples. Afterwards, the currently fabricated components of MCFs such as metals, metal oxides, metal sulfides, metal&#8208;organic frameworks are described in sequence. Furthermore, typical applications of MCFs in rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, electrocatalysis, photocatalysis are highlighted. This review ends with the possible development and synthetic challenges of MCFs as well as a future prospect for high&#8208;efficiency energy applications, which underscores a pathway for developing advanced materials.

         <title>Additively Manufactured Flexible Liquid Metal&#8211;Coated Self&#8208;Powered Magnetoelectric Sensors with High Design Freedom</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible magnetoelectric sensors with high design freedom are fabricated through selective laser sintering and the subsequent liquid metal 3D transfer printing process. Liquid metal forms a conductive network to serve as the conductive part of the magnetoelectric sensor that has the capability of mechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical conversion. The induced voltage can be generated through compression, stretching, bending, and torsion.








Abstract
Although additive manufacturing enables controllable structural design and customized performance for magnetoelectric sensors, their design and fabrication still require careful matching of the size and modulus between the magnetic and conductive components. Achieving magnetoelectric integration remains challenging, and the rigid coils limit the flexibility of the sensors. To overcome these obstacles, this study proposes a composite process combining selective laser sintering (SLS) and 3D transfer printing for fabricating flexible liquid metal&#8208;coated magnetoelectric sensors. The liquid metal forms a conformal conductive network on the SLS&#8208;printed magnetic lattice structure. Deformation of the structure alters the magnetic flux passing through it, thereby generating voltage. A reverse model segmentation and summation method is established to calculate the theoretical magnetic flux. The impact of the volume fraction, unit size, and height of the sensors on the voltage is studied, and optimization of these factors yields a maximum voltage of 45.6 &#181;V. The sensor has excellent sensing performance with a sensitivity of 10.9&#160;kPa&#8722;1 and a minimum detection pressure of 0.1&#160;kPa. The voltage can be generated through various external forces. This work presents a significant advancement in fabricating liquid metal&#8208;based magnetoelectric sensors by improving their structural flexibility, magnetoelectric integration, and design freedom.

     alt="Additively Manufactured Flexible Liquid Metal&#8211;Coated Self-Powered Magnetoelectric Sensors with High Design Freedom"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexible magnetoelectric sensors with high design freedom are fabricated through selective laser sintering and the subsequent liquid metal 3D transfer printing process. Liquid metal forms a conductive network to serve as the conductive part of the magnetoelectric sensor that has the capability of mechanical-to-electrical conversion. The induced voltage can be generated through compression, stretching, bending, and torsion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although additive manufacturing enables controllable structural design and customized performance for magnetoelectric sensors, their design and fabrication still require careful matching of the size and modulus between the magnetic and conductive components. Achieving magnetoelectric integration remains challenging, and the rigid coils limit the flexibility of the sensors. To overcome these obstacles, this study proposes a composite process combining selective laser sintering (SLS) and 3D transfer printing for fabricating flexible liquid metal-coated magnetoelectric sensors. The liquid metal forms a conformal conductive network on the SLS-printed magnetic lattice structure. Deformation of the structure alters the magnetic flux passing through it, thereby generating voltage. A reverse model segmentation and summation method is established to calculate the theoretical magnetic flux. The impact of the volume fraction, unit size, and height of the sensors on the voltage is studied, and optimization of these factors yields a maximum voltage of 45.6 &#181;V. The sensor has excellent sensing performance with a sensitivity of 10.9&#160;kPa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a minimum detection pressure of 0.1&#160;kPa. The voltage can be generated through various external forces. This work presents a significant advancement in fabricating liquid metal-based magnetoelectric sensors by improving their structural flexibility, magnetoelectric integration, and design freedom.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Analogous Design of a Microlayered Silicon Oxide&#8208;Based Electrode to the General Electrode Structure for Thin&#8208;film Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
Development of miniaturized thin&#8208;film lithium&#8208;ion batteries (TF&#8208;LIBs) using vacuum deposition techniques are crucial for low&#8208;scale applications, but addressing low energy density remains a challenge. In this work, we designed structures analogous to SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film electrodes with close resemblance to traditional LIB slurry formulations including active material, conductive agent, and binder. The thin&#8208;film was produced using mid&#8208;frequency (MF) sputtering with a single hybrid target consisting of SiOx nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The thin&#8208;film SiOx/PPFC involved a combination of SiOx and conductive carbon within the plasma&#8208;polymerized fluorocarbon (PPFC) matrix. This resulted in enhanced electronic conductivity and superior elasticity and hardness in comparison to a conventional pure SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film. The electrochemical performance of the half&#8208;cell consisting of thin&#8208;film SiOx/PPFC demonstrated remarkable cycling stability, with a capacity retention of 74.8% up to the 1000th cycle at 0.5 C. In addition, a full cell using the LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 thin&#8208;film as the cathode material exhibited an exceptional initial capacity of &#8764;120 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.1 C and cycle performance, marked by a capacity retention of 90.8% from the first cycle to the 500th cycle at a 1 C rate. This work will be a steppingstone for the AM/CB/B composite electrodes in TF&#8208;LIBs.

         <title>Electrolyte Engineering with Tamed Electrode Interphases for High&#8208;Voltage Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) hold great promise for next&#8208;generation grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the highly instable electrolyte/electrode interphases threat long&#8208;term cycling of high&#8208;energy SIBs. In particular, the instable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) at high voltage causes persistent electrolyte decomposition, transition metal dissolution and fast capacity fade. Here we propose a balanced principle for molecular design of SIB electrolytes that enable an ultra&#8208;thin, homogeneous and robust CEI layer by coupling an intrinsically oxidation stable succinonitrile solvent with moderately solvating carbonates. The proposed electrolyte not only shows limited anodic decomposition thus leading to a thin CEI, but also suppresses dissolution of CEI components at high voltage. Consequently, the tamed electrolyte/electrode interphases enable extremely stable cycling of Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) cathodes with outstanding capacity retention (&gt; 90%) over 3000 cycles (eight months) at 1 C with a high charging voltage of 4.3&#8201;V. Further, the NVOPF||hard carbon full cell shows stable cycling over 500&#8201;cycles at 1 C with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.6%. The electrolyte also endows high&#8208;voltage operation of SIBs with great temperature adaptability from &#8722;25 oC to 60&#160;&#176;C, shedding light on the essence of fundamental electrolyte design for SIBs operating under harsh conditions.

         <title>Important Role of Ion Flux Regulated by Separators in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polyolefin separators are the most common separators used in rechargeable lithium (Li)&#8208;ion batteries. However, the influence of different polyolefin separators on the performance of Li metal batteries (LMBs) has not been well studied. By performing particle injection simulations on the reconstructed three&#8208;dimensional pores of different polyolefin separators, it was revealed that the pore structure of the separator had a significant impact on the ion flux distribution, the Li deposition behavior and consequently, the cycle life of LMBs. It was also discovered that the homogeneity factor of Li ion toward Li metal electrode was positively correlated to the longevity and reproducibility of LMBs. This work not only emphasizes the importance of pore structure of polyolefin separators, but also provides an economic and effective method to screen favorable separators for LMBs.

         <title>Protonation Stimulates the Layered to Rock Salt Phase Transition of Ni&#8208;Rich Sodium Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Protonation of oxide cathodes triggers surface transition metal dissolution and accelerates the performance degradation of Li&#8208;ion batteries. While strategies are developed to improve cathode material surface stability, little is known about the effects of protonation on bulk phase transitions in these cathode materials or their sodium&#8208;ion battery counterparts. Here, using NaNiO2 in electrolytes with different proton&#8208;generating levels as model systems, we present a holistic picture of the effect of incorporated protons. Protonation of lattice oxygens stimulates transition metal migration to the alkaline layer and accelerates layered&#8208;rock&#8208;salt phase transition, which leads to bulk structure disintegration and anisotropic surface reconstruction layers formation. A cathode that undergoes severe protonation reactions attains a porous architecture corresponding to its multifold performance fade. This work reveals that interactions between electrolyte and cathode that result in protonation can dominate the structural reversibility/stability of bulk cathodes, and the insight sheds light for the development of future batteries.

         <title>Fast and Facile Liquid Metal Printing via Projection Lithography for Highly Stretchable Electronic Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Soft electronic circuits are crucial for wearable electronics, biomedical technologies and soft robotics, requiring soft conductive materials with high conductivity, high strain limit and stable electrical performance under deformation. Liquid metals (LMs) have become an attractive candidate with high conductivity and fluidic compliance, while effective manufacturing methods are demanded. Digital light processing (DLP)&#8208;based projection lithography is a high&#8208;resolution and high&#8208;throughput printing technique for primarily polymers and some metals. If LMs can be printed with DLP as well, the entire soft devices can be fabricated by one printer in a streamlined and highly&#8208;efficient process. Herein, we achieved fast and facile DLP&#8208;based liquid metal printing. Simply with 5&#8211;10 seconds of patterned UV&#8208;light exposure, a highly conductive and stretchable pattern can be printed using a photo&#8208;crosslinkable LM particle ink. The printed eutectic gallium indium traces feature high resolution (&#8764;20 &#956;m), conductivity (3.0&#215;106 S m&#8722;1), stretchability (&#8764;2500%) and excellent stability (consistent performance at different deformation). Various patterns have been printed in diverse material systems for broad applications, including stretchable displays, epidermal strain sensors, heaters, humidity sensors, conformal electrodes for electrography, and multi&#8208;layer actuators. The facile and scalable process, the excellent performance, diverse applications ensure its broad impact on soft electronic manufacturing.
