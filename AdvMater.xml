         <title>Design of a Tunable, High&#8208;performance Mixed Matrix Membrane Platform for Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance, flexible, tunable, and non&#8208;aging mixed matrix membrane platform is developed by incorporating CHA zeolites, featuring a 3D pore system with precise molecular&#8208;sieving and tunable chemical interactions, into a polyimide matrix at exceptionally high loadings. This tunable membrane platform significantly outperforms state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes across a wide range of critical applications and can be beneficial for next&#8208;generation molecular separation membrane developments with vast industrial potential.








Abstract
Membrane technology offers substantial economic and environmental benefits for energy&#8208;intensive chemical separations. Chabazite&#8208;type zeolite, possessing a 3&#8208;D channel system with molecular&#8208;sieving windows, can be an ideal membrane material, but conditions to synthesize zeolite&#8208;only membranes limit optimization strategies. Guided by advanced quantum chemistry calculations on inner&#8208;pore molecular interactions, zeolite properties are tailored for different separations and optimized particles incorporated in polyimide at very high loadings. A membrane platform is thus created that largely outperforms state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes for a broad variety of industry&#8208;relevant applications, that is, carbon capture, natural gas/biogas purification, hydrocarbon, helium and hydrogen recovery. Accurate size&#8208;sieving of gas molecules is realized together with rational determination of optimal gas&#8208;zeolite interactions. Crucial for industrial applications, these well&#8208;tuned membranes displayed excellent non&#8208;aging properties, high flexibility and higher mixed&#8208;gas selectivities than ideal&#8208;gas selectivities. Moreover, they performed even better at low CO2&#8208;partial pressure in CO2&#8208;removal and can be made humidity&#8208;insensitive.

         <title>A Hydrophobic and High Surface Charge Phosphate Interphase for High Areal Capacity Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust hydrophobic and high&#8208;surface&#8208;charge phosphate interphase dramatically fosters uniform Zn deposition at the (100) plane, realizing an unprecedented Sand's capacity of over 64 mAh cm&#8722;2. The synergy of a narrower Zn2&#8314;&#8208;rich electric double layer and suppressed side reactions delivers stable Zn metal batteries with high areal capacity, long lifespan, and practical viability.








Abstract
Commercial zinc metal batteries require an areal capacity above 4 mAh cm&#8722;2 at high rates. However, such performance is rarely reported due to slow mass transport between the diffuse layer and the outer Helmholtz layer at the interface. Herein, it is reported an unprecedented Sand's capacity exceeding 64 mAh cm&#8722;2&#160;at 20 mA cm&#8722;2, enabled by a hydrophobic and high surface charge iron/zinc phosphate (FZP) nanofilm serving as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase for zinc anode. It is identified the key role of high surface charge with strong Zn2&#8314; affinity, which mitigates depletion zones by forming a narrower and Zn2+&#8208;rich electric double layer, thereby achieving high areal capacities and promoting preferential exposure of the Zn (100) plane. Consequently, FZP/Zn exhibits stable cycling for 400 h under 60% depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge (2.14 mAh cm&#8722;2). Full cells with a low N/P ratio deliver an energy density of 176.5 Wh kg&#8722;1 electrodes at 6 mAh cm&#8722;2. The practical Zn&#8208;I2 pouch cells are further demonstrated with &#8776;97 Ah of cumulative capacity and a high areal capacity of 5.12 mAh cm&#8722;2. These findings establish FZP nanofilms as a viable strategy for realizing commercial high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Ternary Inert Element Co&#8208;Doping: a New Approach to Stable 4.7&#160;V LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al&#8211;Mg&#8211;Ni inert co&#8208;doping synergistically enhances structural stability of LiCoO2 at highly delithiated state, with Mg/Ni stabilizing Li layers and suppressing oxygen loss, while Al reinforcing Co&#8211;O octahedra, giving a capacity retention of 58.6% after 600 cycles at 4.7&#160;V.








Abstract
LiCoO2 (LCO) has long dominated the cathode materials in portable electronic batteries due to its high volumetric energy density. However, the pursuit of higher voltages to achieve larger capacities remains a challenge due to severer structural degradation. Herein, a ternary inert element co&#8208;doping strategy that can greatly improve the structure stability of LCOs at elevated voltages is reported. Mg and Ni doping at Li site support the layered structure in the highly delithiated state, while Ni also facilitates the separation of O 2p and Co 3d orbits, thereby suppressing oxygen loss. Meanwhile, Al doping at Co site suppresses the distortion of Co&#8211;O octahedra and stabilizes the Co layers. The synergistic effects of Al, Mg and Ni co&#8208;doping inhibit the irreversible H3&#8211;H1&#8208;3 phase transitions and mitigate internal stress accumulation. The Al&#8211;Mg&#8211;Ni co&#8208;doped LCO exhibits a capacity of 221&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 65.5% after 1500 cycles at 4.6&#160;V. At a higher voltage of 4.7&#160;V, it delivers a capacity of 225.8&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 58.6% after 600 cycles. This multiple inert elements co&#8208;doping strategy gives an effective method for stabilizing the high&#8208;voltage LCO and other related layered oxide materials.

         <title>Unlocking NIR&#8208;II Photoluminescence in 2D Copper Tetrasilicate Nanosheets through Flame Spray Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flame&#8208;spray&#8208;pyrolysis method is presented to synthesize ultra&#8208;bright CTS nanosheets with tunable NIR&#8208;II emission. Achieving quantum yields up to 34%, these materials support high&#8208;speed imaging and enable super&#8208;resolution in vivo applications such as transcranial microcirculation mapping and macrophage tracking.









Abstract
Expanding fluorescence bioimaging into the second near&#8208;infrared spectrum (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#160;nm) unlocks advanced possibilities for diagnostics and therapeutics, offering superior tissue penetration and resolution. 2D copper tetrasilicate (CTS) pigments (MCuSi4O10, M = Ca, Sr, Ba) are known for their brightness and stability, yet synthetic challenges have curbed their integration into bioimaging. Here, flame&#8208;spray&#8208;pyrolysis (FSP) is introduced as a versatile and scalable synthesis approach to produce ultra&#8208;bright, metastable CTS nanosheets (NS) by annealing multi&#8208;element metal oxide nanoparticles into 2D crystals through calcination or laser irradiation. Group&#8208;II ion incorporation shifts emission into the NIR&#8208;II range, with Ba0.33Sr0.33Ca0.33CuSi4O10 peaking at 1007&#160;nm, while minor Mg&#8208;doping induces a hypsochromic shift and extends fluorescence lifetimes. The engineered CTS achieves quantum yields of up to 34%, supporting NS high&#8208;frame&#8208;rate imaging (&gt; 200 fps). These unique properties enable CTS&#8208;NS to serve as powerful contrast agents for super&#8208;resolution NIR bioimaging, demonstrated in vivo through transcranial microcirculation mapping and macrophage tracking in mice using diffuse optical localization imaging (DOLI). This pioneering synthesis strategy unlocks wavelength&#8208;tunable NS for advanced NIR&#8208;II bioimaging applications.

         <title>Porogen&#8208;Integrated Rapid Oxidation Enables Structured Mesoporous Metal Oxide Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porogen&#8208;integrated rapid oxidation (PiRO) is a method for high throughput manufacturing of mesoporous metal oxide thin films. PiRO generates up to 500 nm thick layers with through&#8208;plane 5&#8211;10 nm spheroidal close&#8208;packed pores at 230&#160;&#176;C in 30 min or less. The reduced temperatures enable deposition on both rigid and flexible polymeric substrates using roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll compatible techniques.









Abstract
Structured metal oxide films have promise in optoelectronics, sensing, energy storage, and catalysis but their uptake is predominately limited due to their long and high&#8208;temperature syntheses. Here, a self&#8208;assembling polymer is used which can act as a chelating fuel source in a solution combustion reaction to generate highly structured mesoporous aluminum oxide films at &lt;250&#160;&#176;C in a matter of minutes through a process termed porogen&#8208;integrated rapid oxidation (PiRO). The resulting films with thicknesses up to 500 nm show an open&#8208;cell, face&#8208;centered cubic structure of spheroidal pores. Further, an additional ligand can be included to control the self&#8208;assembly step to yield both through&#8208;film ordering or tunable disordering for increased pore volume as confirmed by both grazing incidence small angle X&#8208;ray scattering and ellipsometry. Finally, roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufacturing with PiRO is demonstrated on flexible polymeric substrates. The method offers a tunable, scalable, low&#8208;temperature, and lower&#8208;cost method to generate large&#8208;area structured mesoporous metal oxide films.

         <title>Scalable Jet Swimmer Driven by Pulsatile Artificial Muscles&#160;and Soft Chamber Buckling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by nautiluses, a scalable robotic jet swimmer is developed, featuring a soft chamber that buckles instantly to amplify jetting speed. It demonstrates the successful integration of smart materials and smart structures in a robotic system, offering a promising pathway for developing efficient, adaptable, and intelligent underwater soft robots.








Abstract
Cephalopods, such as squid and nautilus, achieve fast swimming by jetting water swiftly from their chambers, offering benefits in swimming speed, energy efficiency, and silent operation. Inspired by these animals, a scalable soft robotic jet swimmer that utilizes soft chamber buckling to enable rapid water jetting is proposed. The design incorporates three main components: the knotted artificial muscle (KAM), an origami&#8208;inspired soft chamber, and a custom control module. The KAM generates significant force and stroke with minimal self&#8208;weight, but its actuation speed is insufficient for propelling water. To address this limit, an origami&#8208;inspired soft chamber that buckles instantly when the KAM's pulling force reaches a critical threshold is designed, thereby amplifying actuation speed and enabling rapid water jetting. The control module periodically activates the KAM to tighten and release, facilitating effective pulsatile propulsion. Similar to Cephalopods, this design is scalable and robust. Effective swimming of two robots is demonstrated with drastically different sizes, achieving a top speed of 0.62 body length per second. We also show that the propulsion is minimally compromised even when the KAM is significantly damaged. To further enable guided locomotion, a shape memory alloy rudder is incorporated for steering via infrared stimulation. This work demonstrates successful pulsatile jet swimming through the integration of smart materials and smart structures, laying the groundwork for future innovations in underwater soft&#160;robotics.

         <title>On&#8208;the&#8208;Fly Synthesis of Freestanding Spin&#8208;Crossover Architectures With Tunable Magnetic Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D flow&#8208;focusing devices are an ideal platform for the processing and integration of functional materials within polymeric matrices. In this article, A. Tuan Ngo, D. Aguil&#224;, T. Sotto Mayor, M. Palacios&#8208;Corella, J. Puigmart&#237;&#8208;Luis show the on&#8208;the&#8208;fly processing of a prototypical SCO material&#8212;known for its challenging processability&#8212;thereby opening new avenues for its implementation in real&#8208;world applications.









Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) molecular&#8208;based switches have shown promise across a range of applications since their discovery, including sensing, information storage, actuators, and displays. Yet limited processability remains a barrier to their real&#8208;world implementation, as traditional methods for integrating SCO materials into polymer matrices are often complex, expensive, and prone to producing uneven material distributions. Herein, we demonstrate how 3D flow&#8208;focusing chemistry enables unprecedented control for the direct fabrication of SCO composite materials, addressing key challenges in processability, scalability, and cost. By using a 3D coaxial flow&#8208;focusing microfluidic device, we simultaneously synthesize [Fe(Htrz)2(trz)](BF4) and achieve its homogeneous incorporation into alginate fibers in a continuous manner. The device&#8217;s versatility allows for precise manipulation of the reaction&#8208;diffusion (RD) zone, resulting in SCO composite fibers with tunable physicochemical and magnetic properties. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to isolate these fibers as freestanding architectures and highlight the potential for printing them with defined shapes. Finally, we show that the 3D control of the RD zone granted by continuous flow microfluidic devices offers precise spatiotemporal control over the distribution of SCO complexes within the fibers, effectively encoding SCO materials into them. SCO&#8208;encoded fibers can seamlessly combine adaptability and functionality, offering innovative solutions for application&#8208;specific customization.

         <title>Homogeneous &#8220;Hard&#8208;Soft&#8221; Biphasic Bone Adhesives Promote Comminuted Fracture Healing through Interfacial Adaptation and Mechanical Property Maintenance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the instant and sustainable fixation of bone fragments in treating highly comminuted fractures, phase engineering is employed to construct a homogeneous hard&#8208;soft biphasic bone adhesive (PTN). The conversion of tetracalcium phosphate in the hard phase and the deposition of hydroxyapatite in the soft phase endow its anti&#8208;swelling and mechanical resistance while adapting to the interfacial changes for sustainable adhesion.








Abstract
Bone adhesives provide remarkable clinical solutions in treating highly comminuted fractures that are difficult to perform surgery with metal fixation. However, no commercial bone adhesives exhibit high adhesion, strength, and osteogenic activity for instant and sustainable fixation in dynamic, wet humoral environments at weight&#8208;bearing sites. Here, phase engineering is employed to construct a homogeneous hard&#8208;soft biphasic bone adhesive (HB&#8208;PTN) with a sea urchin&#8208;inspired structure of phosphorylated polyglutamic acid (P&#8208;PGA) encapsulating tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP) (hard phase) and a viscoelastic hydrogel composed of amino&#8208;functionalized PEGylated poly (glycerol sebacate) (PEGS&#8208;NH2) and P&#8208;PGA (soft phases) for immediate, stable fixation. The adhesion and strength of the HB&#8208;PTN hydrogel can be tuned by modulating the soft phase/hard phase ratio. The PTN&#8208;2 hydrogel exhibited an adhesive strength of &#8776;280 kPa, a compressive modulus of &#8776;1.02 MPa, and high fatigue resistance (92%). Moreover, the PTN&#8208;2 hydrogel showed limited swelling (130%) and maintained mechanical properties (102%) after immersion in simulated human body fluid. Furthermore, this strategy avoids the agglomeration of inorganic particles and the formation of cracks due to stress concentration observed with traditional mixing methods. In vivo, the PTN adhesives reveal durable and stable adhesion and accelerate fracture healing, demonstrating great clinical potential in comminuted fracture repair.

         <title>Electric Field Driven Soft Morphing Matter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents soft morphing matter robots that exhibit extremely high morphological adaptability and complex multimodal electric field response. They can undergo large, controlled body deformation and show complex locomotion on different terrains under the manipulation of external electric fields, making a significant step beyond current electroactive and soft robots.








Abstract
The manipulation of soft morphing robots using external electric fields and wireless control is challenging. Electric field&#8208;driven soft morphing matter, termed electro&#8208;morphing gel (e&#8208;MG), that exhibits complex multimodal large&#8208;scale deformation (showing up to 286% strain, and strain rates up to 500%&#160;s&#8722;1) and locomotion under external electric fields applied using compact and lightweight electrodes is presented. The distinctive capabilities of e&#8208;MG derive from the combination of an elastomeric matrix and nanoparticulate paracrystalline carbon. The material properties, electroactive principle, and control strategies are explored and demonstrate fundamental morphing matter behaviors including rotating, translating, stretching, spreading, bending, and twisting. A range of potential bio&#8208;inspired applications, including slim mold&#8208;like spreading, snail&#8208;like jumping over a gap, object transport, wall climbing, and a frog tongue&#8208;inspired gripper is shown. The e&#8208;MG provides morphing capabilities beyond the current limitations in wireless control for a wide range of applications in soft and bio&#8208;inspired robotics, dexterous manipulation, and space exploration.

Electric field-driven soft morphing matter, termed electro-morphing gel (e-MG), that exhibits complex multimodal large-scale deformation (showing up to 286% strain, and strain rates up to 500%&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and locomotion under external electric fields applied using compact and lightweight electrodes is presented. The distinctive capabilities of e-MG derive from the combination of an elastomeric matrix and nanoparticulate paracrystalline carbon. The material properties, electroactive principle, and control strategies are explored and demonstrate fundamental morphing matter behaviors including rotating, translating, stretching, spreading, bending, and twisting. A range of potential bio-inspired applications, including slim mold-like spreading, snail-like jumping over a gap, object transport, wall climbing, and a frog tongue-inspired gripper is shown. The e-MG provides morphing capabilities beyond the current limitations in wireless control for a wide range of applications in soft and bio-inspired robotics, dexterous manipulation, and space exploration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Materials Evolution by Programmed Twisting: a DNA&#8208;Inspired Ultrastrong Supercoiled Conformational Fiber for Energy&#8208;Storage and Buffering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the supercoiled conformational structures and behaviors of the DNA chain, a material evolution strategy via supercoiled conformational fibers (SCFs) is proposed to achieve a number of extra&#8208;ordinary properties/functions, including pseudo&#8208;entropic elasticity, high&#8208;performance torsional energy&#8208;storage, stimulus&#8208;triggered energy release, impact buffering, and self&#8208;reinforcement.








Abstract
The conformational folding/unfolding behaviors of DNA supercoils serve as a fundamental mechanism governing ultradense bio&#8208;information storage and precise genetic transcription. Mimicking those nanoscale dynamic conformational behaviors for macroscopic materials to achieve unusual functionalities will be of great interest but remains unexplored. Herein, a DNA&#8208;inspired materials evolution paradigm is presented to create multifunctional supercoiled conformational fibers (SCFs) by programmed twisting controlled self&#8208;buckling. Through the programmed twist&#8208;stress modulation, a low&#8208;density polyethylene strip is transformed into high&#8208;performance DNA&#8208;like SCF through a unique multiscale microstructure evolution process. This DNA&#8208;like SCF exhibits five hallmark characteristics unattainable before, including ultra&#8208;large elastic deformability (900 &#177; 50%), metal&#8208;level mechanical strength (330 &#177; 30&#160;MPa), unprecedented torsional energy&#8208;storage density (16.1 &#177; 0.6&#160;kJ&#160;kg&#8722;1), torsional energy release upon appropriate stimulations, and impact buffering through conformation&#8208;mediated energy&#8208;dissipation. Characterization reveals that these unexpected energy&#8208;related properties mainly are contributed by the multiscale twisting&#8208;reinforced microstructures and conformation mechanics. Potential applications of the SCFs are demonstrated finally by harvest&#8208;and&#8208;storage of wind energy and soft&#8208;landing. The DNA&#8208;like SCFs indicate a general platform for materials evolution with extraordinary mechanics and functions.

         <title>Integrated Polarization, Distance, and Rotation for Multi&#8208;DoF Diffractive Processor and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;DoF processor is designed to perform versatile inference tasks, including single&#8208;/dual&#8208;digit and single&#8208;/dual&#8208;fashion product classification, logic operations, and image transformation. Moreover, a high&#8208;security information transmission framework is experimentally demonstrated that transforms a large volume of input data&#8212;encoded across multiple channels&#8212;into Morse code, with the true information subsequently synthesized through further decoding.








Abstract
All&#8208;optical diffractive deep neural networks (D2NNs) offer significant advantages in processing speed and power consumption, thereby accelerating the development of optical computing and artificial intelligence (AI). Integrating multiple degrees of freedom (multi&#8208;DoF) into D2NNs is a pivotal role in improving information processing and task&#8208;loading capacity, an enormous challenge in current all&#8208;optical diffractive computing/processors. Here, a multi&#8208;DoF diffractive processor is proposed and experimentally demonstrated that leverages a metasurfaces&#8208;based approach to integrate polarization, distance, and rotation channels for versatile inference tasks and information encryption. The approach is validated using three&#8208;layer metasurfaces that enable high task&#8208;capacity tasks, including single&#8208;/dual&#8208;digit and single&#8208;/dual&#8208;fashion&#8208;product classification, logic operators, and image transformation. Moreover, by mapping large volumes of input data into multi&#8208;DoF channels and encoding the information in Morse code with our D2NNs framework, a high&#8208;security information transmission system is experimentally implemented. The integration of polarization, distance, and rotation channels into an all&#8208;optical diffractive processor with multifunctional capabilities paves the way for multifunctional integrated devices and communication.

         <title>Fluorine&#8211;Mediated Interfacial Microenvironment for Boosting pH&#8211;Universal CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni species (single atoms and atomic clusters) are successfully anchored onto fluorocarbon substrates (FC), forming a highly efficient and stable CO2RR electrocatalyst. The optimized Ni/FC exhibits excellent FECO in acidic, neutral, and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. More importantly, Ni/FC can maintain excellent FECO while operating at industrial currents density for 3000&#160;h. Mechanistic studies reveal that the high&#8211;electronegativity of F will cause the formation of a positive C&#948;+ center, which inhibits the adsorption of hydrogen and elevates the dissociation energy barrier of interfacial water, thereby suppressing the competitive HER process.








Abstract
Achieving highly efficient and stable conversion of carbon dioxide&#160;reduction reaction (CO2RR) into value&#8208;added chemicals at industrial current density is crucial but challenging due to its complex gas&#8211;solid&#8211;liquid interface. Here the local microenvironment of three&#8211;phase interface is successfully regulated to boost the CO2RR performance of Ni species in the universal pH range by introducing the highly electronegative F. The optimized Ni/FC achieves high&#8211;performance in converting CO2 to CO with Faraday efficiencies (FEs) over 90% in pH&#8211;universal conditions, while the main product of Ni/C is H2, especially under acidic conditions. Significantly, it can steadily operate at a high current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 3000&#160;h in a broad pH range, outperforming most recently reported CO2RR electrocatalysts. Detail in situ experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the presence of highly electronegative F will cause the formation of a positive C&#948;+ center, which inhibits the adsorption of hydrogen and increases the dissociation energy barrier of interfacial water, thereby suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This work highlights the importance of regulating the local microenvironment of interfacial water, providing a new perspective in the field of electrocatalysis for suppressing competitive HER.

         <title>Unveiling the Multifunctional Potential of MXenes in Rechargeable Batteries beyond Electrode Active Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides comprehensive perspectives on MXene's application as passive components in rechargeable battery systems, as current collectors, electrolytes additives, separators, binders, and hosts for active materials. It aims to forecast the multifunctional potential of MXenes in batteries, gain valuable insights into their broader applicability, and contribute to the innovation of energy storage systems.








Abstract
MXene materials have emerged as prominent candidates for revolutionizing energy storage technologies due to their unique properties and versatile applications. This review highlights the multifaceted roles of MXenes (beyond electrode active materials) in improving various components of rechargeable batteries. MXenes exhibit exceptional electrical conductivity, tunable surface functionalities, and a 2D structure, rendering them suitable for enhancing electrode or electrolyte materials, current collectors, binders, and separators. As electrode hosts, MXenes accommodate active materials such as sulfur, silicon, selenium, and novel compounds, addressing challenges related to volume expansion, electronic conductivity, and chemical interactions. Furthermore, MXene&#8208;based conductive agents and additives ameliorate the stability and performance of solid&#8208;state devices, overcoming issues associated with flammable liquid electrolytes. MXene materials excel as current collectors by improving contact between active materials, mitigating dendrite formation, extending battery lifespan, and improving safety. Additionally, MXene&#8208;modified separators and interlayers effectively hinder the shuttle effect and dendrite growth in Li&#8208;S and other battery systems with stability and longevity. With their distinct attributes to offer transformative opportunities for addressing limitations in next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries, MXenes hold the promise of shaping a more efficient, secure, and sustainable energy storage landscape.

For rechargeable lithium batteries with high energy density, lithium metal anode is an ideal candidate due to its high theoretical capacity (3860 mAh g&#8722;1) and low electrode potential (&#8722;3.04&#160;V versus standard hydrogen electrode). Despite its promising characteristics, it faces formidable obstacles such as dendritic growth and poor formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. To overcome such obstacles, multifaceted unconventional surface engineering approaches are hypothesized, tested, and examined. In this review, in addition to the conventional SEI and surface coatings, the principles and recent progress of the unconventional surface engineering methods are summarized and assessed, based on the interfacial thermodynamics and factors governing the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte. It connects and provides the newest insight on material science, design methodologies, and fabrication techniques, which require significant attention. This review reveals the significance of unconventional methods in enhancing both electrochemical performance and safety of the next&#8208;generation lithium metal batteries, providing a comprehensive understanding of the current research landscape and roadmaps for future technological breakthroughs.

         <title>Dynamic Gradient Oxygen Layer Enables Stable Sn Anode for Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During lithiation/delithiation, SnOx helped to form a stable solid electrolyte interface film. In addition, the disordered SnOx lamellar structures can release stress to prevent particle pulverization during its transformation into a denser amorphous layer. Its mechanism of lithium storage in the intercalation layer and dynamic oxygen concentration gradient can enable the rapid exchange of lithium ions.









Abstract
Sn&#8208;based anodes are of significant interest due to their high capacity and resource abundance for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, incomplete lithiation and severe volume expansion result in their low capacity and electrode pulverization. Here, a rationally designed coating layer, composed of disordered SnOx (x = 1, 2) lamellar structures, on the Sn particles surface (Sn@SnOx) is proposed. This coating effectively mitigates volume expansion and minimizes lithium consumption owing to the intercalation behaviors of SnOx. During lithiation and delithiation, a dense, amorphous, mechanical coating with a dynamic gradient of oxygen forms in situ, providing excellent protection against continuous pulverization of the Sn particles. The intercalation&#8208;type dynamic gradient oxygen with high ionic conductivity enables rapid exchange of lithium ions, thus promoting the deep lithiation of Sn to form Li4.4Sn. Such gradient oxygen protection mechanism of the oxide layer in Sn@SnOx brings a high reversible capacity after 900 cycles with a capacity retention of 84%. This work offers a new strategy to design a protective coating layer on alloy&#8208;based anodes for high&#8208;performance lithium storage.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Sensitive Optoelectronics Enabled by Atomically Tailored Interfaces Engineering for Advanced Perceptual Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A broadband, self&#8208;powered photodetector is developed by integrating Cl&#8208;substituted 2D perovskites with MoS2/WSe2 heterostructures via interface engineering. The device enables weak&#8208;light detection down to 0.54&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2, offering enhanced carrier transport and photogating effects. This strategy highlights a general approach to boosting the performance of 2D material&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Ultra&#8208;weak light detection represents a critical enabling technology for next&#8208;generation imaging, remote monitoring, and autonomous systems, where efficient charge transfer is essential to achieve ultralow detection thresholds. Herein, an interfacial lattice&#8208;distortion engineering strategy is proposed by selectively substituting phenylethyl ammonium (PEA) cations with 4&#8208;chlorophenylethylammonium (Cl&#8208;PEA) at perovskite heterointerfaces. This substitution induces beneficial octahedral distortions, boosting hole transport efficiency in few&#8208;layer 2D perovskites by 26%. When integrated with MoS2/WSe2 heterostructures, the optimized van der Waals contact and enhanced energy&#8208;level alignment yield a high&#8208;performance photodetection, including a responsivity of 2.7 &#215; 104 A/W, a detectivity up to 5.26 &#215; 1014&#160;Jones, and an exceptionally low noise equivalent power of 0.42&#160;fW&#160;Hz&#8722;1/2. Notably, the device operates self&#8208;powered at incident power densities as low as 0.54&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2, enabling real&#8208;time, on&#8208;chip image processing even under dim&#8208;light conditions. This functionality is further utilized for noise reduction in traffic&#8208;light images prior to object detection with YOLOv11 network, establishing a direct bridge between device&#8208;level photodetection and machine&#8208;learning&#8208;driven recognition. This interfacial lattice distortion engineering paradigm in van der Waals&#8208;contacted 2D devices opens new avenues for designing ultrasensitive, low&#8208;noise, and functionally integrated optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Direct&#8208;Ink&#8208;Writing Printed Aerogels with Dynamically Reversible Thermal Management and Tunable Electromagnetic Interference Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Honeycomb&#8208;structured (Ti3C2Tx/Fe3O4/CCMC)&#8211;(AgNW/CCMC) aerogels with tunable EMI shielding performance up to 80 dB are fabricated via DIW 3D printing, achieving compression&#8208;driven shielding adjustability, infrared stealth, and reversible thermal insulation&#8211;conduction conversion for dynamic thermal management in harsh environments.








Abstract
Achieving both structural precision and tunable performance in electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials remains a critical challenge, particularly for adaptive applications. Herein, a strategy is proposed that integrates calcium chloride (CaCl&#8322;)&#8208;induced elastic activation of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) with direct ink writing (DIW) 3D printing to address the limitations in structural design and performance adjustability of EMI shielding materials. By leveraging CaCl&#8322;&#8208;crosslinked CMC (CCMC) as a flexible matrix, honeycomb&#8208;structured (Ti&#8323;C&#8322;Tx/Fe&#8323;O&#8324;/CCMC)&#8211;(Ag nanowire (AgNW)/CCMC) aerogels is fabricated with precise architecture and tunable shielding effectiveness under mechanical compression. With a 35% printing fill density, 40 wt% Ti&#8323;C&#8322;Tx, and 60% compressive strain, the aerogel achieves an optimal shielding effectiveness of 80&#160;dB. Additionally, the aerogel exhibits reversible infrared stealth and dynamically switchable thermal properties (from 0.08 to 0.67 W&#183;m&#8315;&#185;&#183;K&#8315;&#185;) in response to environmental humidity variations. This work demonstrates a versatile approach for structurally adaptive EMI shielding materials with self&#8208;regulating thermal behavior, offering promising applications in harsh environment protection, intelligent thermal camouflage, and adaptive shielding for next&#8208;generation aerospace and communication technologies.

         <title>Constructing Immunomodulator Biosynthesis Factory in Grafting&#8208;From DNA Hydrogel for Heart Valve Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis factory is constructed on decellularized heart valves (DHVs) through a grafting from DNA hydrogel, utilizing tailored rolling circle amplification (RCA) on DHVs. Anti&#8208;coagulation NU172 aptamers are incorporated into the hydrogel to recruit heme from the bloodstream and heme oxygenase 1 (HO&#8208;1) is encapsulated to convert heme into biliverdin, achieving long&#8208;term immune regulation and valve regeneration.








Abstract
The development of heart valve prostheses with regenerative capabilities offers significant potential to overcome the limitations of existing commercial artificial valves in clinical practice. Immune modulation plays a crucial role in heart valve regeneration by reversing the coagulation and inflammatory microenvironment, thereby facilitating recellularization. In this study, a biosynthesis factory is constructed on decellularized heart valves (DHVs) to continuously convert the abundant heme in the blood into immunomodulators, supporting long&#8208;term immune modulation and tissue regeneration. This biosynthesis factory is achieved through a grafting from DNA hydrogel, utilizing tailored rolling circle amplification (RCA) on DHVs. Anti&#8208;coagulation NU172 aptamers are incorporated into the DNA hydrogel to recruit heme from the bloodstream, while heme oxygenase 1 (HO&#8208;1) is encapsulated to simultaneously convert heme into biliverdin. This system ensures the sustained production of biliverdin, facilitating anti&#8208;inflammatory immune modulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, thus creating a regenerative immune microenvironment. Additionally, the DNA coating is further crosslinked with zwitterionic polymers, which protect the functional DNA layer and provide anti&#8208;calcification and anti&#8208;adhesion properties. This comprehensive design promotes full endothelial cell coverage and significant extracellular matrix remodeling within one&#8208;month post&#8208;implantation.

         <title>The Versatility of Layered Two&#8208;Dimensional Heterostructures for Energy Storage: Bridging Scientific Insights and Practical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the potential of 2D&#8208;2D heterostructures (HRs) in advancing monovalent ion&#8208;based energy storage. It examines their role in tailoring charge interactions mechanisms, optimizing interfacial properties, and overcoming the limitations of individual layered materials. Covering synthesis methods, structural designs, and electrochemical advances, the review offers insights into design strategies and challenges, positioning 2D HRs as promising anode materials. 









Abstract
Nanoscale manipulation of electronic and ionic charge interactions within electrode materials is the cornerstone for advancing electrochemical energy storage. Compared to bulk materials, 2D confined anodes provide lamellar channels to mobile ions for electrochemical interactions. However, individual 2D layers are often inefficient in delivering desired properties for stable and rapid kinetics in battery operations. To address this, 2D&#8208;2D heterostructures (2D HRs) that integrate the properties of two or more layers via van der Waals or covalent bonds can give optimized interfacial features. These structures modulate electronic properties, such as band positions, activation energies, diffusion barriers, and binding energies for intercalating ions, thereby regulating the electrochemical characteristics of batteries to meet practical challenges. In this context, this review includes the latest experimental and theoretical investigations to explore the multifunctional roles of 2D HRs in monovalent ion (Li+, Na+, and K+) batteries (MIBs). First, it elucidates the fundamentals concerning the impacts of HRs in charge storage mechanisms and outlines pathways for synthesizing their novel designs. Then, it summarizes the different configurations of 2D HRs utilized in designing MIBs. Finally, it underscores the current challenges and future perspectives for implementing 2D HRs as advanced anode materials in batteries.

         <title>Reengineering Endogenous Targeting Lipid Nanoparticles (ENDO) for Systemic Delivery of mRNA to Pancreas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ENDO lipid nanoparticles containing cholecalciferol as a fifth component demonstrate mRNA delivery to the pancreas with 99% selectivity, including beta cells. This platform shows minimal toxicity and sustained protein expression for up to 3 days in a dose&#8208;dependent manner, offering a novel approach to pancreas&#8208;specific mRNA delivery and gene therapy that is suitable for repeat administration with clinical relevance.









Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) hold transformative potential for nucleic acid delivery, with applications ranging from clinical use, particularly in COVID&#8208;19 vaccines, to gene therapy and cancer immunotherapy. However, a major limitation lies in their preferential accumulation in the liver following intravenous administration, making most targets hard&#8208;to&#8208;reach. In this study, a novel platform called endogenous targeting lipid nanoparticles (ENDO), containing cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) as a fifth component is reported, that selectively delivers mRNA to the pancreas &#8211; a target previously inaccessible through intravenous administration. The top formulation, C&#8208;CholF3, demonstrates an unprecedented 99% pancreas selectivity with robust and sustained protein expression for up to 3 days in a dose&#8208;dependent manner with minimal toxicity that makes it suitable for repeat administration. This organ&#8208;specific delivery is proposed to be mediated by an endogenous targeting mechanism involving the Vitamin D receptor (VDR). C&#8208;CholF3 also enables selective pancreatic delivery of plasmid DNA and circular mRNA, underscoring its versatility and therapeutic potential. Furthermore, C&#8208;CholF3 exhibits pancreas&#8208;specific gene editing in the Ai14 transgenic mouse model, showing high expression of tdTomato in the &#946; cells. These findings highlight its potential for translational applications in protein replacement and CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated gene editing for currently incurable pancreatic diseases, including pancreatic cancer and diabetes.

         <title>The Goldilocks Paradox of Bioelectronics: Misreporting Piezoresistive Gauge Factor Is Obstructing Research Advancements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The misreporting of piezoresistive gauge factor for bioelectronic devices impacts the ability of researchers to assess the status of the field. Like Goldilocks, researchers need the ability to take similar bowls of porridge, or devices, and perform &#8220;taste&#8221; tests. A systematic analysis of published data outlines reporting and performance standards that must be adhered to by editors and researchers alike.








Abstract
In the fable Goldilocks and The Three Bears, Goldilocks discerns between seemingly similar bowls of porridge using temperature. In the field of wearable bioelectronics, researchers do not have the same luxury of simple comparative analysis. Devices based on composite materials applying electrically conductive nanomaterial and polymer networks present a technology path towards an Internet of Things driven healthcare system. However, research progress has been obstructed by a lack of consistency with regards to the industry standard performance metric, the gauge factor (G). Paradoxically, studies cannot be compared, as no one study measures G the same. However, extrapolating the correct value for G, its intrinsic relationship between the signal linearity figure of merit outlines fieldwide performance limitations for devices, new metrics and materials selection criteria.

         <title>Low&#8208;Field&#8208;Driven Domain Wall Motion in Wurtzite Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During polarization switching in AlScN, domain&#8208;wall transverse motion invariably precedes longitudinal motion due to a 98% reduction in energy barriers. By controlling nucleation polarity to promote transverse motion, this work enables low&#8208;field&#8208;driven domain wall motion, reducing&#160;Ec by 25% while maintaining high&#160;Pr and suppressing wake&#8208;up behavior across 6&#8208;inch wafers to advance energy&#8208;efficient wurtzite ferroelectric devices for CMOS integration.








Abstract
Wurtzite&#8208;type nitride ferroelectrics emerge as a breakthrough platform for silicon&#8208;compatible nonvolatile memory technology. However, the inherent polarization reversal mechanisms involving diatomic displacements introduce complex domain dynamics and elevate energy barriers, manifesting as excessive coercive fields (Ec) and pronounced wake&#8208;up effects that hinder reliable device operation. Here, these challenges are resolved by enabling the low&#8208;field&#8208;driven domain wall motion in representative wurtzite ferroelectrics (Al0.75Sc0.25N). In situ transmission electron microscopy measurements reveal that polarization switching proceeds via preferential domain&#8208;wall transverse propagation perpendicular to the [0001] axis, preceding longitudinal propagation along the [0001] axis. First&#8208;principles simulations quantify a striking 98% reduction in energy barrier for transverse migration (0.00188&#160;eV&#160;f.u&#8722;1). Compared to longitudinal motion (0.092&#160;eV&#160;f.u&#8722;1). This switching kinetic fundamentally challenges the conventional Kolmogorov&#8208;Avrami&#8208;Ishibashi model. By controlling nucleation polarity to promote the transverse motion of the domain wall, Ec is reduced by 25%, with a high remanent polarization maintained and wake&#8208;up effects eliminated across 6&#8208;inch films. The methodology establishes a universal design principle for manipulating polarization switching in wurtzite ferroelectrics, paving the way for integrated low&#8208;energy, high&#8208;stability, uniformly&#8208;performing ferroelectric devices in large&#8208;scale complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)&#160;architectures.

2D antimony (Sb)&#8208;based materials have drawn tremendous attention in the field of next&#8208;generation integrated circuits due to their outstanding properties, high stability, and earth abundance. Despite their potential, a comprehensive review summarizing advancements in 2D Sb&#8208;based materials remains absent. This review addresses this critical gap by presenting an in&#8208;depth analysis of recent progress in 2D Sb&#8208;based materials. Our review aims to inspire further research into the practical applications and address the challenges that lie ahead for future electronics and optoelectronics.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, with their atomic&#8208;layer thickness and exceptional properties, have garnered significant attention for next&#8208;generation integrated circuits. Among these, 2D antimony (Sb)&#8208;based materials distinguish themselves through outstanding physical properties, natural abundance, and remarkable stability. Despite their potential, a comprehensive review summarizing advancements in 2D Sb&#8208;based materials remains absent. This review addresses this critical gap by presenting an in&#8208;depth analysis of recent progress in 2D Sb&#8208;based materials, specifically, antimonene, antimony chalcogenides (Sb2X3, X = S, Se, Te), antimony oxides (&#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;Sb2O3, and SbO1.93), antimonides (e.g., NdSb2), and complex polycompounds such as quaternary CdSb2Se3Br2, focusing on their crystal structures, synthesis techniques, applications, and future prospects. By providing valuable insights into the potential of 2D Sb&#8208;based materials, our review aims to inspire further research into their practical applications and address the challenges that lie ahead for future electronics and optoelectronics.

&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) materials, with their atomic-layer thickness and exceptional properties, have garnered significant attention for next-generation integrated circuits. Among these, 2D antimony (Sb)-based materials distinguish themselves through outstanding physical properties, natural abundance, and remarkable stability. Despite their potential, a comprehensive review summarizing advancements in 2D Sb-based materials remains absent. This review addresses this critical gap by presenting an in-depth analysis of recent progress in 2D Sb-based materials, specifically, antimonene, antimony chalcogenides (Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, X = S, Se, Te), antimony oxides (&#945;-, &#946;-, and &#947;-Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and SbO&lt;sub&gt;1.93&lt;/sub&gt;), antimonides (e.g., NdSb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and complex polycompounds such as quaternary CdSb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, focusing on their crystal structures, synthesis techniques, applications, and future prospects. By providing valuable insights into the potential of 2D Sb-based materials, our review aims to inspire further research into their practical applications and address the challenges that lie ahead for future electronics and optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Tunable Amplified Spontaneous Emission in Rb&#8208;Cs Alloyed Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskites with Low Threshold and Exceptional Spectral Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rb&#8208;Cs alloyed quasi&#8208;2D perovskites with low&#8208;threshold ASEs and exceptional spectral stability are synthesized. Tuning Rb&#8208;Cs ratio enables broad ASE tunability across blue and green regions. Alloying optimizes the inter&#8208;well energy transfer and suppresses Auger recombination, yielding a record&#8208;low ASE threshold, &#8776;50% lower than mixed&#8208;halide perovskites. Their micro&#8208;ring laser arrays exhibit high Q&#8208;factors and low thresholds, showcasing superior lasing performance.








Abstract
Blue&#8208;green lasers are essential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronics. While GaN&#8208;InGaN lasers offer excellent performance, their complex fabrication and challenges in precise bandgap tuning remain significant limitations. Hybrid lead halide perovskites present a promising alternative, with tunable bandgaps and cost&#8208;effective solution processing. However, halide migration in these materials causes spectral instability and luminescence shifts under operational conditions. Here, a novel class of Rb&#8208;Cs alloyed quasi&#8208;2D perovskites is introduced that achieve both low amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) thresholds and exceptional spectral stability. By precisely tuning the Rb&#8208;Cs ratio, it realizes ASE across the blue&#8208;green spectrum (481&#8211;532&#160;nm). Rb&#8208;Cs alloying critically modulates the quantum well distribution, optimizes the energy landscape, and suppresses Auger recombination, resulting in a record&#8208;low ASE threshold of 1.94 &#181;J&#183;cm&#8722;2&#8212;over 50% lower than that of mixed&#8208;halide perovskites. These materials exhibit remarkable spectral robustness, with ASE spectra remaining stable even after prolonged thermal annealing, thereby overcoming halide migration&#8208;induced degradation. Furthermore, micro&#8208;ring laser arrays fabricated from these Rb&#8208;Cs alloyed perovskites demonstrate superior lasing characteristics, including high&#8208;quality whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode resonances and low lasing thresholds, underscoring their potential for advanced laser technologies.

         <title>Magnetic Moment Descriptor&#8208;Guided Multifunctional Co Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Enable Wide&#8208;Temperature Uninterrupted Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of CoN4&#8208;X configurations are screened using density functional theory (DFT) simulations through second coordination sphere anion modulation (X = B, O, F, P, S, Cl). The magnetic moment is revealed as a critical descriptor for establishing dual volcano&#8208;type correlations with both chloride ion (Cl&#8722;) adsorption energy and Gibbs free energy of reaction&#8208;related intermediates.








Abstract
Developing chloride ion&#8208;resistant trifunctional catalysts is imperative and of great significance for application in renewable energy&#8208;driven seawater splitting systems (S&#8208;WSS). However, there is currently a lack of unified descriptors for the rational design of catalysts that possess both high corrosion resistance and excellent catalytic activity. Herein, the magnetic moment is proposed as the descriptor through second&#8208;coordination&#8208;shell anion engineering of CoN&#8324; moieties (named as CoN4&#8208;X, X = B/O/F/P/S/Cl). Systematic density functional theory calculations reveal that precisely modulating the spin states of CoN&#8324; centers via X&#8208;anion coordination establishes dual volcano&#8208;type relationships between magnetic moments and the adsorption energetics of Cl&#8315; ions or key reaction intermediates for oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, and hydrogen evolution reactions (ORR/OER/HER). Experimental validation demonstrates the optimized CoN&#8324;&#8208;B configuration&#8208;based catalyst (Co SAs&#8208;N/B&#8208;HCS) achieves minimized Cl&#8315; adsorption energy while delivering exceptional trifunctional ORR/OER/HER activity, as well as excellent stability in chloride ion&#8208;rich seawater&#8208;based environments (over 1000 h for seawater&#8208;based Zn&#8208;air batteries, over 800 h for seawater splitting). Notably, the Co SAs&#8208;N/B&#8208;HCS enables temperature&#8208;adaptive hydrogen production rates of 853 &#181;mol h&#8315;&#185; (60&#160;&#176;C), 616 &#181;mol h&#8315;&#185; (25&#160;&#176;C), and 397 &#181;mol h&#8315;&#185; (&#8722;30&#160;&#176;C). This work establishes a spin state engineering paradigm that simultaneously addresses catalyst corrosion and trifunctional synergy in marine energy systems.

         <title>Reconfigurable Liquid Crystal&#8208;Based Physical Unclonable Function Integrating Optical and Electrical Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconfigurable physical unclonable function (PUF) integrating optical and electrical responses in organic field&#8208;effect transistor is developed by using unique optical fingerprint textures and random molecular alignment of the semiconductive smectic liquid crystal. This approach enhances security by enabling hierarchical authentication, providing robust solutions for anticounterfeiting and cryptographic applications.








Abstract
Physical unclonable functions (PUFs)&#8212;a hardware&#8208;based security device using randomness&#8212;have evolved from basic integrated circuit designs to advanced systems using diverse materials and mechanisms. However, most PUFs are limited by single&#8208;factor challenges and fixed key generation, making them vulnerable to brute&#8208;force attacks. A reconfigurable and multidimensional liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;based PUF is presented integrated into an organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) to address limitations. This system combines optical and electrical PUFs through unique optical fingerprint textures and random molecular alignment of the semiconductive smectic LC material. The PUF can be reconfigured by a simple heating and cooling process, overcoming the limitations of fixed&#8208;structure PUFs. Furthermore, this approach enhances security by enabling hierarchical authentication due to the multi&#8208;response factors, providing robust solutions for anticounterfeiting and cryptographic applications.

         <title>Inner&#8208;Layer Indium Doping Achieved Highly Active and Stable Sulfur Vacancies in MoS2 for Superior Sulfur Redox Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indium doping in the inner layer of MoS&#8322; is introduced to significantly reduce the high surface energy associated with sulfur vacancies, achieving highly active and stable catalysts for enhancing sulfur redox kinetics in high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries. The novel In&#8208;Vs catalytic sites effectively lower reaction&#8208;free energies and diffusion energy barriers, accelerate redox kinetics, ensure stable catalytic performance, and mitigate the shuttling effect.








Abstract
Defect engineering in MoS2 via sulfur vacancies (Vs&#8208;MoS2) has shown potential in enhancing lithium&#8211;sulfur battery (LSB) performance by mitigating the polysulfide shuttle effect. However, the high surface energy of Vs&#8208;MoS2 impedes long&#8208;term catalyst stability. Herein, indium (In) doping is introduced into the inner layer of Vs&#8208;MoS2 lattice (In&#8208;Vs&#8208;MoS2), which effectively stabilizes the catalyst by reducing surface energy and enhancing sulfur redox kinetics. Theoretical calculations confirm that In doping, in conjunction with surface vacancies, optimizes charge distribution and generates unpaired electrons near the Fermi level, thus improving polysulfide adsorption and lowering Li2S formation barriers. LSBs with In&#8208;Vs&#8208;MoS2 separators deliver stable cycling at 0.5 C with a favorable capacity of 1042&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 retained after 100 cycles. Moreover, even at high current density (5 C) and high S loading (8.7 mg cm&#8722;2) scenario, stable cycling is realized, demonstrating the strategy's effectiveness in advancing LSB electrocatalysis. This work offers a straightforward strategy for practical LSBs and deepens the understanding of vacancy&#8208;modulated electrocatalysts for sulfur redox.

         <title>Unveiling the Effects of Hydroxyl&#8208;Induced Trap States on the Charge Transport in p&#8208; and n&#8208;Channel Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors through Variable&#8208;Temperature Characterization</title>

         <dc:description>
A full high vacuum preparation and characterization chain unveils that hydroxyl&#8208;induced trap states affect the charge transport in p&#8208; and n&#8208;channel OFETs similarly. The variable&#8208;temperature TLM analysis suggests that the activation energy of charge transport plays a more significant role than the density of trap states. Furthermore, the injection barrier is significantly lower in devices with a hydroxyl&#8208;free dielectric.








Abstract
Trap states at the gate dielectric&#8208;organic semiconductor (OSC) interface are one of the main sources of extrinsic traps in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). However, they are often overlooked and their effects on the charge transport are attributed to the exposure of devices to ambient air. Here a first variable&#8208;temperature transfer length method characterization of both p&#8208; and n&#8208;channel OFETs under full high vacuum conditions is reported. By comparing a hydroxylated aluminum oxide (Al2O3) gate dielectric with a hydroxyl&#8208;free, tetradecylphosphonic acid&#8208;functionalized Al2O3 dielectric, it is shown that hydroxyl&#8208;induced trap states reduce the charge carrier mobility in OFETs regardless of the channel type. This observation challenges the common belief that the hydroxyl&#8208;induced traps are affecting primarily the n&#8208;channel transport. The variable&#8208;temperature analysis yields a high activation energy of charge transport as the main effect of a hydroxylated gate dielectric. Moreover, the injection barrier at the interface between the source&#8208;drain electrodes and the OSC layer is significantly lower for devices with a hydroxyl&#8208;free dielectric and correlates with the activation energy of charge transport. This work identifies previously hidden limitations of charge transport in OFETs, opening opportunities for further improvements in device performance and potential device&#160;applications.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Regulated Solvation and Interphase Engineering for Long&#8208;Life and Safe Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Batteries</title>

Polymer regulation shapes a weakly solvating polymer&#8208;stabilized anion&#8208;rich Na+ solvation structure and robust dual&#8208;layered solid electrolyte interphase, enabling long&#8208;life and safe quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free sodium battery with high energy.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) offer a promising solution to enhance the inherently low energy of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) while circumventing the challenges in processing highly reactive Na metal anodes. However, their practical viability is severely hindered by short lifespan, driven by accelerated irreversible Na loss in zero&#8208;Na&#8208;excess cell configurations, alongside safety concerns of liquid electrolyte leakage. Here, a design of long&#8208;life quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state AFSMBs is demonstrated by leveraging polymer regulation of Na+ solvation behavior and anode interphase chemistry to reduce Na loss while enhancing cell safety. The polyoxymethylene with reduced local steric hindrance and weak Na+ chelation shapes a weakly solvating polymer&#8208;stabilized anion&#8208;rich Na+ solvation structure. It facilitates Na+ transport and formation of robust inorganic&#8211;organic dual&#8208;layered solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), enabling smooth Na metal deposition in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes. This chemistry yields quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state AFSMBs with a long lifespan of 500 cycles and 79% capacity retention at a high rate of 1 C. The 1.2 Ah pouch cells retain 81% capacity over 200 cycles, delivering a volumetric energy of 340&#160;Wh L&#8315;1, surpassing LiFePO4||graphite lithium&#8208;ion batteries, while achieving a comparable gravimetric energy of 190&#160;Wh kg&#8315;1. Such cells also exhibit high reliability against nail penetration in the open air at a fully charged state.

         <title>Ionogels Reinforced by Ionophobic Coordination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A major advancement in gel technology is presented with the introduction of &#8220;Ionophobic Coordination Reinforcement.&#8221;(ICR). This strategy combines ionic liquid&#8208;phobic microphase separation with lithium&#8208;ion coordination crosslinking, enabling a novel thermoplastic gel network. ICR achieves remarkable mechanical performance, efficient self&#8208;healing at room&#8208;temperature, and exceptional melt&#8208;processability, overcoming key challenges in gel materials.








Abstract
As the key materials for next&#8208;generation wearable and flexible electronics, ionogels are expected to combine excellent mechanical performance, efficient room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing, and facile processability. Current ionogels typically face a significant trade&#8208;off between mechanical strength and self&#8208;healing efficiency, limiting their practical applications. Here, &#8220;Ionophobic Coordination Reinforcement&#8221; (ICR) is introduced, a strategy that integrates ionic liquid&#8208;phobic microphase separation with lithium&#8208;ion coordination crosslinking. The ICR design yields a dual glass transition temperature (Tg): &#8722;60.27&#160;&#176;C for maintaining soft phase mobility and 55.33&#160;&#176;C for reinforcing hard phase strength. This architecture achieves simultaneous high mechanical performance (6.4&#8208;fold increase in tensile strength, 4&#8208;fold increase in toughness, and 35.6&#8208;fold increase in Young's modulus) and efficient self&#8208;healing at ambient conditions. Furthermore, this dynamic supramolecular architecture also provides exceptional melt&#8208;processability, facilitating advanced fabrication techniques such as melt spinning. Taking advantage of the high specific surface area of ionogel fibers, the sensor exhibits enhanced humidity sensitivity and rapid response to respiratory moisture changes compared to film counterparts. Integrated into a wireless platform, it enables real&#8208;time, non&#8208;invasive respiratory monitoring, while intrinsic self&#8208;healing ensures long&#8208;term stability. ICR effectively resolves the trade&#8208;off between strength and self&#8208;healing, offering a new paradigm for high&#8208;performance wearable electronics, soft robotics, and adaptive sensors.

         <title>Promotion of C&#9472;C Coupling in the CO2 Electrochemical Reduction to Valuable C2+ Products: From Micro&#8208;Foundation to Macro&#8208;Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Promotion of C&#9472;C Coupling in electrochemical reduction of CO2 to valuable C2+ products is reviewed from microcosmic to macroscopic. The discussed advances and outstanding challenges in the strategies of efficient catalyst design, the influence of local environment in electrolyte, and the design of potential industrial flow cells provided the guidelines for future research in promoted C&#9472;C coupling from foundation to application.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to valuable C2+ products emerges as a promising strategy for converting intermittent renewable energy into high&#8208;energy&#8208;density fuels and feedstock. Leveraging its substantial commercial potential and compatibility with existing energy infrastructure, the electrochemical conversion of CO2 into multicarbon hydrocarbons and oxygenates (C2+) holds great industrial promise. However, the process is hampered by complex multielectron&#8208;proton transfer reactions and difficulties in reactant activation, posing significant thermodynamic and kinetic barriers to the commercialization of C2+ production. Addressing these barriers necessitates a comprehensive approach encompassing multiple facets, including the effective control of C&#9472;C coupling in industrial electrolyzers using efficient catalysts in optimized local environments. This review delves into the advancements and outstanding challenges spanning from the microcosmic to macroscopic scales, including the design of nanocatalysts, optimization of the microenvironment, and the development of macroscopic electrolyzers. By elucidating the influence of the local electrolyte environment, and exploring the design of potential industrial flow cells, guidelines are provided for future research aimed at promoting C&#9472;C coupling, thereby bridging microscopic insights and macroscopic applications in the field of CO2 electroreduction.

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Quantum Wires and Nanorods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on low&#8208;dimensional perovskite materials and discusses their applications in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Special attention is given to the introduction of perovskite quantum wires and nanorods, two unique types of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) materials, and their interesting optoelectronic properties. Moreover, the applications of low&#8208;dimensional perovskite materials can extend beyond LEDs to others, such as photodetectors and memristors.








Abstract
Perovskite materials, celebrated for their exceptional optoelectronic properties, have seen extensive application in the field of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), where research is as abundant as the proverbial &#8220;carloads of books.&#8221; In this review, the research of perovskite materials is delved into from a dimensional perspective, with a focus on the exemplary performance of low&#8208;dimensional perovskite materials in LEDs. This discussion predominantly revolves around perovskite quantum wires and perovskite nanorods. Perovskite quantum wires are versatile in their growth, compatible with both solution&#8208;based and vapor&#8208;phase growth, and can be deposited over large areas&#8212;even on spherical substrates&#8212;to achieve commendable electroluminescence (EL). Perovskite nanorods, on the other hand, boast a suite of superior characteristics, such as polarization properties and tunability of the transition dipole moment, endowing them with the great potential to enhance light extraction efficiency. Furthermore, zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) perovskite materials like nanocrystals (NCs) are also the subject of widespread research and application. This review reflects on and synthesizes the unique qualities of the aforementioned materials while exploring their vital roles in the development of high&#8208;efficiency perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs).

Abstract
Implantable medical devices (IMDs), like pacemakers regulating heart rhythm or deep brain stimulators treating neurological disorders, revolutionize healthcare. However, limited battery life necessitates frequent surgeries for replacements. Ultrasound power transfer (UPT) emerges as a promising solution for sustainable IMD operation. Current research prioritizes implantable materials, with less emphasis on sound field analysis and maximizing energy transfer during wireless power delivery. This review addresses this gap. A comprehensive analysis of UPT technology, examining cutting&#8208;edge system designs, particularly in power supply and efficiency is provided. The review critically examines existing efficiency models, summarizing the key parameters influencing energy transmission in UPT systems. For the first time, an energy flow diagram of a general UPT system is proposed to offer insights into the overall functioning. Additionally, the review explores the development stages of UPT technology, showcasing representative designs and applications. The remaining challenges, future directions, and exciting opportunities associated with UPT are discussed. By highlighting the importance of sustainable IMDs with advanced functions like biosensing and closed&#8208;loop drug delivery, as well as UPT's potential, this review aims to inspire further research and advancements in this promising field.

         <title>Developing Cathode Films for Practical All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries offers higher specific energies and lower costs compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, a lack of mechanistic understanding hinders advancement. This review analyzes key electrode parameters, evaluates progress in enhancing ion/electron percolation, and addresses electrochemical&#8208;mechanical degradation, offering future research directions.








Abstract
The development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) toward large&#8208;scale electrochemical energy storage is driven by the higher specific energies and lower cost in comparison with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;ion batteries. Yet, insufficient mechanistic understanding and quantitative parameters of the key components in sulfur&#8208;based cathode hinders the advancement of the ASSLSB technologies. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of electrode parameters, including specific capacity, voltage, S mass loading and S content toward establishing the specific energy (Wh kg&#8722;1) and energy density (Wh L&#8722;1) of the ASSLSBs. Additionally, this work critically evaluates the progress in enhancing lithium ion and electron percolation and mitigating electrochemical&#8208;mechanical degradation in sulfur&#8208;based cathodes. Last, a critical outlook on potential future research directions is provided to guide the rational design of high&#8208;performance sulfur&#8208;based cathodes toward practical ASSLSBs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stretchable interconnects are one of the fundamental components in achieving robust wearable devices, but their importance is often overlooked. This review highlights their importance and provides insightful information on various materials, configurations, and manufacturing approaches being studied for interconnects. Their practical potentials for wearable bioelectronics are also discussed for future research opportunities.








Abstract
Since wearable technologies for telemedicine have emerged to tackle global health concerns, the demand for well&#8208;attested wearable healthcare devices with high user comfort also arises. Skin&#8208;wearables for health monitoring require mechanical flexibility and stretchability for not only high compatibility with the skin's dynamic nature but also a robust collection of fine health signals from within. Stretchable electrical interconnects, which determine the device's overall integrity, are one of the fundamental units being understated in wearable bioelectronics. In this review, a broad class of materials and engineering methodologies recently researched and developed are presented, and their respective attributes, limitations, and opportunities in designing stretchable interconnects for wearable bioelectronics are offered. Specifically, the electrical and mechanical characteristics of various materials (metals, polymers, carbons, and their composites) are highlighted, along with their compatibility with diverse geometric configurations. Detailed insights into fabrication techniques that are compatible with soft substrates are also provided. Importantly, successful examples of establishing reliable interfacial connections between soft and rigid elements using novel interconnects are reviewed. Lastly, some perspectives and prospects of remaining research challenges and potential pathways for practical utilization of interconnects in wearables are laid out.

Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction of COx (including CO2 and CO) into value&#8208;added fuels and chemicals, particularly multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) alcohols, presents a significant opportunity to close the manmade carbon cycle and support sustainable energy systems. The catalytic performance of electrochemical reduction reactions of CO2 and CO (COxRR)&#160;is strongly correlated with the local microenvironments, the flow electrolyzer, and the catalysis approaches with flow electrolyzers, which contribute to the kinetic and thermodynamic landscape of the reaction, ultimately determining the efficiency and selectivity of the COxRR toward desired reduction products. However, controllable microenvironment construction, rationally designed flow electrolyzers, and matchable flow electrolyzers derived catalysis approaches chosen for improving COxRR&#8208;to&#8208;alcohol performance still face challenges. Building upon the foundation laid by previous research, this review article will provide an in&#8208;depth summary of the regulation of the catalytic reaction interface microenvironment, the design of flow electrolyzers, and the development of derived stepwise catalysis approaches with the flow electrolyzers, which provide a comprehensive and strategic approach to enhancing the COxRR process for alcohol production, offering valuable insights and innovative solutions that can significantly impact the field of COxRR conversion to alcohol and contribute to the development of more sustainable chemical production methods.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymeric charge transporters hold immense potential for inverted perovskite solar cells due to their tunable structures, high conductivity, and inherent flexibility. This review comprehensively explores recent advancements in these polymeric materials, while also delving into the remaining challenges and proposing practical design strategies for their future optimization.








Abstract
Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) hold exceptional promise as next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technology, where both perovskite absorbers and charge&#8208;transporting materials (CTMs) play critical roles in cell performance. In recent years, polymeric CTMs have played an important role in developing efficient, stable, and large&#8208;area inverted PSCs due to their unique properties of high conductivity, tunable structures, and mechanical flexibility. This review provides a comprehensive overview of polymeric CTMs used in inverted PSCs, encompassing polymeric hole transport materials (HTMs) and electron transport materials (ETMs). the relationship between their molecular structures, modification strategies are systematically summarized and analyzed for adjusting energy levels, and improving charge extraction, enabling a deep understanding of these widely used materials. The review also explores effective strategies for designing even more efficient polymeric CTMs. Finally, an outlook is proposed on the exciting research of novel polymeric CTMs, paving the way for their commercialized applications in PSCs.

         <title>Engineering CAR&#8208;T Therapeutics for Enhanced Solid Tumor Targeting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
CART cell therapy has proven effective for blood cancers but struggles with solid tumors due to diverse antigens and complex environments. Recent efforts focus on improving CAR design and validation platforms. Advances in protein engineering, machine learning, and organoid systems aim to enhance CAR&#8208;T therapy against solid tumors. Some solid tumors, like neuroblastoma, have responded well in trials.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy, specifically Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)&#8208;T cell therapy, represents a significant breakthrough in treating cancers. Despite its success in hematological cancers, CAR&#8208;T exhibits limited efficacy in solid tumors, which account for more than 90% of all cancers. Solid tumors commonly present unique challenges, including antigen heterogeneity and complex tumor microenvironment (TME). To address these, efforts are being made through improvements in CAR design and the development of advanced validation platforms. While efficacy is limited, some solid tumor types, such as neuroblastoma and gastrointestinal cancers, have shown responsiveness to CAR&#8208;T therapy in recent clinical trials. In this review, it is first examined both experimental and computational strategies, such as protein engineering coupled with machine learning, developed to enhance T cell specificity. The challenges and methods associated with T cell delivery and in vivo reprogramming in solid tumors is discussed. It is also explored the advancements in engineered organoid systems, which are emerging as high&#8208;fidelity in vitro models that closely mimic the complex human TME and serve as a validation platform for CAR discovery. Collectively, these innovative engineering strategies offer the potential to revolutionize the next generation of CAR&#8208;T therapy, ultimately paving the way for more effective treatments in solid tumors.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Charging Solid&#8208;State Li Batteries: Materials, Strategies, and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review addresses challenges and recent advances in fast&#8208;charging solid&#8208;state batteries, focusing on solid electrolyte and electrode materials, as well as interfacial chemistries. The role of multiscale modeling and simulation in understanding Li+ transport and interfacial phenomena is emphasized, providing insights into materials, strategies, and future prospects for high&#8208;performance, fast&#8208;charging solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
The ability to rapidly charge batteries is crucial for widespread electrification across a number of key sectors, including transportation, grid storage, and portable electronics. Nevertheless, conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries with organic liquid electrolytes face significant technical challenges in achieving rapid charging rates without sacrificing electrochemical efficiency and safety. Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) offer intrinsic stability and safety over their liquid counterparts, which can potentially bring exciting opportunities for fast charging applications. Yet realizing fast&#8208;charging SSBs remains challenging due to several fundamental obstacles, including slow Li+ transport within solid electrolytes, sluggish kinetics with the electrodes, poor electrode/electrolyte interfacial contact, as well as the growth of Li dendrites. This article examines fast&#8208;charging SSB challenges through a comprehensive review of materials and strategies for solid electrolytes (ceramics, polymers, and composites), electrodes, and their composites. In particular, methods to enhance ion transport through crystal structure engineering, compositional control, and microstructure optimization are analyzed. The review also addresses interface/interphase chemistry and Li+ transport mechanisms, providing insights to guide material design and interface optimization for next&#8208;generation fast&#8208;charging SSBs.

         <title>Advanced Catalysts for the Chemical Recycling of Plastic Waste</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advanced catalysts applied in thermal catalysis, microwave&#8208;assisted catalysis, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and enzymatic catalysis reaction systems for the chemical recycling of plastic waste into valuable feedstocks.








Abstract
Plastic products bring convenience to various aspects of the daily lives due to their lightweight, durability and versatility, but the massive accumulation of post&#8208;consumer plastic waste is posing significant environmental challenges.

         <title>Utilizing the Elimination Reaction of Linear Fluorinated Carbonate to Stabilize LiCoO2 Cathode up to 4.6 V</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating tris(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;based additives, this work addresses the elimination reaction of methyl trifluoroethyl carbonate (FEMC) to contrast a homogeneous robust polymer&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase. Using the optimized electrolyte, the LiCoO2 cathode can maintain 95% after 500 cycles with a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6 V. This study establishes a foundational framework for employing linear fluorocarbonates in high voltage systems and provides innovative insights into CEI design and construction.








Abstract
Stabilizing LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode at high voltages is still challenging in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Although fluorinated solvents are utilized in high&#8208;voltage systems for their superior oxidation resistance, linear fluorinated carbonates still undergo elimination reactions at high voltages, producing corrosive substances that compromise electrode materials. This study addresses the elimination reaction of methyl trifluoroethyl carbonate (FEMC) by incorporating tris(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;based additives, thereby constructing a homogeneous and robust polymer&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI). With the incorporation of tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphite in the optimized electrolyte, the capacity of the coin cell with LCO as the cathode can maintain 95% after 500 cycles with a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6 V. This study establishes a foundational framework for employing linear fluorocarbonates in high&#8208;voltage systems and provides innovative insights into CEI design and construction.

         <title>Integrated Pristine van der Waals Homojunctions for Self&#8208;Powered Image Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pristine van der Waals homojunctions consisting of 2H&#8208;MoTe2 layers with asymmetric thickness are constructed to eliminate heterogenous interfaces and obtain clean boundaries. The layer&#8208;engineered energy bands of 2H&#8208;MoTe2 layers induce a built&#8208;in electric field at the interface, enabling self&#8208;powered photodetection. Furthermore, a 10 &#215; 10 array based on 2H&#8208;MoTe2 homojunction devices realize zero&#8208;power consumption imaging functions.








Abstract
Van der Waals junctions hold significant potentials for various applications in multifunctional and low&#8208;power electronics and optoelectronics. The multistep device fabrication process usually introduces lattice mismatch and defects at the junction interfaces, which deteriorate device performance. Here the layer engineering synthesis of van der Waals homojunctions consisting of 2H&#8208;MoTe2 with asymmetric thickness to eliminate heterogenous interfaces and thus obtain clean interfaces is reported. Experimental results confirm that the homostructure nature gives rise to the formation of pristine van der Waals junctions, avoiding chemical disorders and defects. The ability to tune the energy bands of 2H&#8208;MoTe2 continuously through layer engineering enables the creation of adjustable built&#8208;in electric field at the homojunction boundaries, which leads to the achievement of self&#8208;powered photodetection based on the obtained 2H&#8208;MoTe2 films. Furthermore, the successful integration of 2H&#8208;MoTe2 homojunctions into an image sensor with 10 &#215; 10 pixels, brings about zero&#8208;power consumption and near&#8208;infrared imaging functions. The pristine van der Waals homojunctions and effective integration strategies shed new insights into the development of large&#8208;scale application for two&#8208;dimensional&#160;materials in advanced electronics and optoelectronics.

A self&#8208;lithiated tin (Sn)&#8208;carbon (C)&#160;composite interlayer (LSCI) capable of enhancing electrochemical/structural stability and homogenizing lithium (Li)&#8208;ion transport across the Li/solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) interfaces enables an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;sulfur battery (ASSLSBs) with high cycling stability and rate capability.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) have attracted intense interest due to their high theoretical energy density and intrinsic safety. However, constructing durable lithium (Li) metal anodes with high cycling efficiency in ASSLSBs remains challenging due to poor interface stability. Here, a compositionally stable, self&#8208;lithiated tin (Sn)&#8208;carbon (C) composite interlayer (LSCI) between Li anode and solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE), capable of homogenizing Li&#8208;ion transport across the interlayer, mitigating decomposition of SSE, and enhancing electrochemical/structural stability of interface, is developed for ASSLSBs. The LSCI&#8208;mediated Li metal anode enables stable Li plating/stripping over 7000&#160;h without Li dendrite penetration. The ASSLSBs equipped with LSCI thus exhibit excellent cycling stability of over 300 cycles (capacity retention of &#8776;80%) under low applied pressure (&lt;8&#160;MPa) and demonstrate improved rate capability even at 3C. The enhanced electrochemical performance and corresponding insights of the designed LSCI broaden the spectrum of advanced interlayers for interface manipulation, advancing the practical application of ASSLSBs.

         <title>Heterogeneous NASICON&#8208;Type Cathode With Reversible Multielectron Reaction for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel heterogeneous Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)/Na2VTi(PO4)3 material achieves high purity and high crystallization by the mutual promotion of intergrowth structures. Benefiting from the interfacial charge redistribution effect between the heterogeneous phases, the electronic conductivity and ion diffusion are greatly improved. The optimized Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)/Na2VTi(PO4)3 cathode, with a reversible three&#8208;electron redox reaction, exhibits high specific capacity and long cycling life.








Abstract
Na superionic conductor (NASICON)&#8208;structured compounds demonstrate great application potential by their robust framework and compositional diversity. However, they are blamed for the mediocre energy density, and achieving both multielectron reaction and good cycling stability simultaneously is challenging. Herein, a novel heterogeneous Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)/Na2VTi(PO4)3 (NFPP/NVTP) material with stable multielectron reaction is constructed by spray drying technology. The mutual promotion effect of intergrowth structures effectively improves the purity and the crystallization of NFPP/NVTP during the fabrication process, which is beneficial to the high capacity and cycling stability. As a result, the optimized NFPP/NVTP demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 155.3 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and outstanding cycling stability with 82.9% capacity retention over 2500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1, which are much superior to those of NFPP and NVTP individually. Even in full cell configuration, the energy density remains high at &#8776;380&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 based on the cathode mass. The high capacity of NFPP/NVTP is also attributed to the successive reduction/oxidation mechanism involving the introduction of Ti3+ and interfacial charge redistribution effect between the heterogeneous phases, which greatly improve the electronic and ionic conductivity. Moreover, high reversible structural evolution during the multisodium storage process further guarantees excellent cycling stability.

         <title>Molecular Control of the Donor/Acceptor Interface Suppresses Charge Recombination Enabling High&#8208;Efficiency Single&#8208;Component Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The outstanding double&#8208;cable&#8208;based single&#8208;component material, DCPY2, exhibits a suppressed charge recombination process alongside efficient charge generation. This results in a high fill factor and short&#8208;circuit current, yielding an efficiency to 13.85%. The slow recombination process in DCPY2 compared to binary systems is attributed to the reduced wavefunction overlap between donor and acceptor from inherent alkyl linker and enhanced acceptor aggregation.








Abstract
Single&#8208;component organic solar cells based on double cable polymers have achieved remarkable performance, with DCPY2 reaching a high efficiency of over 13%. In this study, DCPY2 is further optimized with an efficiency of 13.85%, maintaining a high fill factor (FF) without compromising the short circuit current. Despite its intermixed morphology, DCPY2 shows a reduced recombination rate compared to their binary counterpart (PBDB&#8208;T:Y&#8208;O6). This slower recombination in DCPY2 is attributed to the reduced wavefunction overlap of delocalized charges, achieved by spatially separating the donor and acceptor units with an alkyl linker, thereby restricting the recombination pathways. Adding 1,8&#8208;diiodooctane (DIO) into DCPY2 further reduced the recombination rate by facilitating acceptor aggregation, allowing free charges to become more delocalized. The DIO&#8208;assisted aggregation in DCPY2 (5% DIO) is evidenced by an increased pseudo&#8208;pure domain size of Y&#8208;O6. Fine molecular control at the donor/acceptor interface in the double&#8208;cable polymer achieves reduced non&#8208;geminate recombination under efficient charge generation, increased mobility, and charge carrier lifetime, thereby achieving superior performance. Nevertheless, the FF is still limited by relatively low mobility compared to the blend, suggesting the potential for further mobility improvement through enhanced higher&#8208;dimensional packing of the double&#8208;cable material.

         <title>Clickable, Thermally Responsive Hydrogels Enabled by Recombinant Spider Silk Protein and Spy Chemistry for Sustained Neurotrophin Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable hydrogel comprising recombinant spider silk proteins is formed through ultrasound and thermally induced phase transition. Thanks to SpyTag/SpyCatcher chemistry, neurotrophins such as CNTF are covalently immobilized onto the hydrogels, enabling sustained protein delivery, prolonged neuroprotection, and enhanced axon regrowth following optic nerve injury. This system serves as a safe and versatile platform for the delivery of therapeutic proteins.









Abstract
The ability to deliver protein therapeutics in a minimally invasive, safe, and sustained manner, without resorting to viral delivery systems, will be crucial for treating a wide range of chronic injuries and diseases. Among these challenges, achieving axon regeneration and functional recovery post&#8208;injury or disease in the central nervous system remains elusive to most clinical interventions, constantly calling for innovative solutions. Here, a thermally responsive hydrogel system utilizing recombinant spider silk protein (spidroin) is developed. The protein solution undergoes rapid sol&#8208;gel transition at an elevated temperature (37&#160;&#176;C) following brief sonication. This thermally triggered gelation confers injectability to the system. Leveraging SpyTag/SpyCatcher chemistry, the hydrogel, composed of SpyTag&#8208;fusion spidroin, can be functionalized with diverse SpyCatcher&#8208;fusion bioactive motifs, such as neurotrophic factors (e.g., ciliary neurotrophic factor) and cell&#8208;binding ligands (e.g., laminin), rendering it well&#8208;suited for neuronal culturing. More importantly, the intravitreous injection of the protein materials decorated with SpyCatcher&#8208;fusion CNTF into the vitreous body after optic nerve injury leads to prolonged JAK/STAT3 signaling, increased neuronal survival, and enhanced axon regeneration. This study illustrates a generalizable material system for injectable and sustained delivery of protein therapeutics for neuroprotection and regeneration, with the potential for extension to other chronic diseases and injuries.

         <title>Perspectives on Devices for Integrated Phononic Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phononic devices offer unique advantages in RF applications due to their shorter wavelengths compared to photons. This perspective explores functional phononic devices that can enable integrated phononic circuits. These circuits promise to enable miniaturized communication systems with improved SWaP&#8208;C characteristics, while also finding applications in quantum information science, sensing, and biomedical engineering.








Abstract
The phonon wavelength, being much shorter than that of photons at the same frequency, offers phononic devices a unique niche in radio frequency (RF)&#160;applications. However, the current limitations of these devices, particularly their restricted functionality, hinder their broader integration and application. Currently, many functions are achieved using alternative signal forms like electric and photonic signals, requiring bulky converters to transform between phonon signals and other forms. The development of functional phononic devices paves the way for integrated phononic circuits, which aim to minimize the need for signal conversion while accomplishing all necessary functions. In this perspective, a brief overview of several types of functional phononic devices is provided that hold promise for integration, such as phononic modulators, amplifiers, lasers, nonreciprocal devices, and those inspired by topological physics. It is envisioned that through continued developments in materials, fabrication techniques, and designs, it's possible to realize integrated phononic circuits which will be applied in miniaturized communication devices with reduced size, weight, power consumption, and cost (SWaP&#8208;C), as well as in other fields including quantum information science, sensing, biomedical engineering, and beyond.

         <title>Optoelectronic Devices for In&#8208;Sensor Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The raw data obtained directly from sensors in the noisy analogue domain is often unstructured, which lacks a predefined format or organization and does not conform to a specific data model. Optoelectronic devices for in&#8208;sensor visual processing can integrate perception, memory, and processing functions in the same physical units, which can compress and structure vision without extra optoelectronic conversion.








Abstract
The demand for accurate perception of the physical world leads to a dramatic increase in sensory nodes. However, the transmission of massive and unstructured sensory data from sensors to computing units poses great challenges in terms of power&#8208;efficiency, transmission bandwidth, data storage, time latency, and security. To efficiently process massive sensory data, it is crucial to achieve data compression and structuring at the sensory terminals. In&#8208;sensor computing integrates perception, memory, and processing functions within sensors, enabling sensory terminals to perform data compression and data structuring. Here, vision sensors are adopted as an example and discuss the functions of electronic, optical, and optoelectronic hardware for visual processing. Particularly, hardware implementations of optoelectronic devices for in&#8208;sensor visual processing that can compress and structure multidimensional vision information are examined. The underlying resistive switching mechanisms of volatile/nonvolatile optoelectronic devices and their processing operations are explored. Finally, a perspective on the future development of optoelectronic devices for in&#8208;sensor computing is provided.

         <title>Mastering Proton Activities in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced aqueous batteries are promising alternatives for grid energy storage. Understanding and mastering the proton activities in aqueous electrolytes will guide the design of sustainable and long&#8208;lasting aqueous batteries. This Perspective comments on the current understanding of the thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives of proton activities and highlights future research directions for aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Advanced aqueous batteries are promising solutions for grid energy storage. Compared with their organic counterparts, water&#8208;based electrolytes enable fast transport kinetics, high safety, low cost, and enhanced environmental sustainability. However, the presence of protons in the electrolyte, generated by the spontaneous ionization of water, may compete with the main charge&#8208;storage mechanism, trigger unwanted side reactions, and accelerate the deterioration of the cell performance. Therefore, it is of pivotal importance to understand and master the proton activities in aqueous batteries. This Perspective comments&#160;on the following scientific questions: Why are proton activities relevant? What are proton activities? What do&#160;we&#160;know about proton activities in aqueous batteries? How do&#160;we&#160;better understand, control, and utilize proton activities?

Abstract
High&#8208;voltage cathodes (HVCs) have emerged as a paramount role for the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the pursuit of HVCs comes with inherent challenges related to defective structures, which significantly impact the electrochemical performance of LIBs. The current obstacle lies in the lack of a comprehensive understanding of defects and their precise effects. This perspective aims to provide insights into defect chemistry for governing HVCs. The classifications, formation mechanisms, and evolution of defects are outlined to explore the intricate relationship between defects and electrochemical behavior. The pressing need for cutting&#8208;edge characterization techniques that comprehensively investigate defects across various temporal and spatial scales is emphasized. Building on these fundamental understandings, engineering strategies such as composition tailoring, morphology design, interface modification, and structural control to mitigate or utilize defects are thoroughly discussed for enhanced HVCs performance. These insights are expected to provide vital guidelines for developing high&#8208;performance HVCs for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Responsive Metasurface for Directional Control of Laser and Thermal Emission Dynamic Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multispectral&#8208;responsive metasurface simultaneously modulates directional laser reflection and dynamic infrared emissivity, enabling robust dual&#8208;band camouflage and dual&#8208;modal anti&#8208;counterfeiting. By synergistically integrating spatial and spectral control, this approach greatly expands capabilities for manipulating multiple physical parameters, providing a versatile approach for advanced information encryption, holography, and thermal management applications in complex scenarios.









Abstract
Responsive metasurfaces can efficiently control the propagation and spectral properties of electromagnetic (EM) waves, emerging as an attractive technology in energy and information fields. However, achieving non&#8208;interference manipulation of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser wavelength and mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) region with spatial and spectral responsive capabilities is a challenging and long&#8208;sought task for applications, such as multispectral adaptive camouflage and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Here, a multispectral responsive metasurface is demonstrated that enables independent modulation of MIR thermal emission while maintaining robust, spatially directional control of NIR laser reflections. This metasurface simultaneously achieves superior ultralow specular reflectivity of 0.049 (0.8&#8211;1.2 &#181;m) and high thermal emission regulation capability of 0.51 (8&#8211;13 &#181;m), attributed to NIR reflection splitting and a photonically amplified metal&#8208;insulator transition, respectively. The metasurface's exceptional capability to realize temperature&#8208;invariant NIR laser and dynamic MIR camouflage is experimentally proved under significant fluctuating thermal environments, superior to existing laser&#8208;IR&#8208;compatible camouflage technologies. Dual&#8208;mode information anti&#8208;counterfeiting is further demonstrated through independent channels for detection angles and temperature responses. This work provides a new pathway for stimulus&#8208;responsive materials with spatial and spectral modulation toward diverse multispectral application scenarios.

         <title>Multifunctional Interfacial Molecular Bridging Strategy Enables Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional interfacial molecular bridging strategy is proposed, for the first time, to address the upper interfacial issues of inverted PSCs by stabilizing the upper interface between perovskites and PCBM electron transport layer (ETL), passivating interfacial defects, and improving the energy band alignment.








Abstract
Interface engineering in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) faces critical challenges arising from nonideal interfacial contact, defect accumulation, impeded carrier transport, and energy&#8208;level misalignment between the perovskite and electron transport layer, for example, phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). These interfacial deficiencies collectively induce nonradiative recombination and degrade device stability. Herein, a multifunctional interfacial molecular bridging strategy using (benzhydrylthio)acetic acid (DSA) addresses the upper interfacial issues of inverted PSCs, achieving three synergistic roles. 1) Interfacial stabilization. A stable molecular&#8208;bridging layer is constructed with DSA at the perovskite/PCBM interface through carboxylate&#8211;Pb2&#8314; coordination bonds, along with &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between DSA and PCBM. 2) Defect passivation. Multiple active sites in DSA molecules, such as thioether and carboxylic acid groups, can synchronously achieve chemical passivation with undercoordinated Pb2+ sites. 3) Energy band alignment: DSA induces n&#8208;type band bending through electron donation by the thioether, reducing the work function and enhancing the electron&#8208;extraction kinetics. As a result, DSA&#8208;treated devices achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 26.08% along with an open&#8208;circuit voltage loss of only 53&#160;mV. Finally, the DSA&#8208;treated devices demonstrate remarkable operational stability, retaining 96% of the initial efficiency after being tracked at the maximum power point for 2000&#160;h.

         <title>Adaptive Epitaxy of C&#8208;Si&#8208;Ge&#8208;Sn: Customizable Bulk and Quantum Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pushes the boundaries of epitaxy by achieving all&#8208;group&#8208;IV semiconductor heterostructures and extensive characterization. The alloys open new research topics in material properties investigation for next&#8208;generation electronic and optoelectronic device technologies.








Abstract
The successful demonstration of (Si)Ge1&#8208;xSnx alloys as direct&#8208;gap materials for infrared lasers has driven intense research on group IV&#8208;based devices for nanoelectronics, energy harvesting, and quantum computing applications. The material palette of direct&#8208;gap group&#8208;IV alloys can be further extended by introducing carbon to fine&#8208;tune their structural and electronic properties, significantly expanding their functionality. This work presents heteroepitaxial growth of C(Si)GeSn alloys using an industry&#8208;standard reduced&#8208;pressure chemical vapor deposition reactor. The introduction of CBr4 as a precursor enables controlled incorporation of C atoms (&lt;1 at.%) into the epilayer lattice, while simultaneously increasing the Sn content in the CGeSn alloy up to &#8776;18 at.%. Carbon plays a key role in modulating strain, stabilizing the crystal structure, and influencing material properties. By leveraging alloying and strain engineering, quaternary CSiGeSn bulk layers and CGeSn/GeSn heterostructures are epitaxially grown. The impact of C incorporation on optical emission is investigated in LEDs based on CGeSn/GeSn multiple quantum wells, demonstrating enhanced near&#8208;infrared emission at 2.54 &#181;m, which is sustained up to room temperature.

         <title>Smart Materials and Devices for Enhanced Delivery of Extracellular Vesicles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart materials and biomedical devices are increasingly used to overcome limitations in extracellular vesicle (EV) delivery. This review highlights recent advances in surface modification, exogenous and endogenous stimuli&#8208;responsive systems, and device&#8208;assisted strategies including scaffolds, microneedles, hydrogels, and microfluidic platforms, to achieve precise, efficient, and targeted EV&#8208;based therapeutic delivery.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are vesicle&#8208;like structures secreted by various cell types, playing a crucial role in cell communication. As an efficient and safe therapeutic carrier, EVs offer new insights and methods for disease treatment and drug development due to high stability, low immunogenicity, and broad resources. However, current applications on EV&#8208;based delivery systems are still challenging, and additional strategies are needed to achieve precise and targeted delivery, enhance stability and safety, and avoid unnecessary immune reactions or side effects. This review summarizes the latest progress in using smart materials or devices to enhance EV delivery, aiming to provide a reference for designing novel and efficient EV&#8208;based targeted delivery strategies.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Spin Transport in Chiral Gold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that in chiral gold film, spin information can be transferred to distances of several microns at room temperature. The conduction of spins is accompanied by the Hall effect that exists without applying an external magnetic field. The spin diffusion length is consistent with the frequency&#8208;dependent Hall effect which indicates spin effective lifetime on the order of nanoseconds.








Abstract
Any attempt to use spintronics&#8208;based logic elements will need to have spin interconnects to transfer information between its elements. Typically, the mean free path of an electron's spin in metals, at room temperature, is of the order of tens to hundreds of nanometers. Here chiral gold films are used to demonstrate that spin information can be transferred to distances of several microns at room temperature. The conduction of spins is accompanied by a Hall effect that exists without applying an external magnetic field. It is verified that the spin diffusion length is consistent with the frequency&#8208;dependent Hall effect which indicates a spin&#8208;effective lifetime in the order of nanoseconds. A theoretical model is presented that involves the anisotropic electronic polarizability of the system, its spin&#8211;orbit coupling, and spin exchange interactions.

         <title>Regulating Electron Transfer in Vanadium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks via the Synergy of Linker Engineering and Machine Learning for Efficient and Reversible Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a ligand&#8208;engineering strategy to construct a series of functionalized X&#8208;MIL(V)&#8208;47 framework materials, enabling a systematic elucidation of the synergistic mechanisms between surface functionalization and morphological features in enhancing the electrochemical performance of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. By integrating machine learning with advanced characterization techniques, the zinc&#8208;storage mechanism and the structural evolution during cycling are comprehensively revealed.








Abstract
Precise regulation of ligands in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to modulate the local electronic structure and charge distribution has become an effective strategy for optimizing their electrochemical performance. However, utilizing ligand&#8208;functionalized MOFs to activate their potential in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries remains a challenge. Herein, eight ligand&#8208;functionalized X&#8208;MIL&#8208;47 (X represents the functional groups) samples are prepared using a one&#8208;pot solvothermal method. The polar substituents on the ligand regulated the electronic structure of the MOFs through inductive and conjugative effects, altering the electron density of the metal center and thereby facilitating the optimization of the Zn2+ insertion/extraction kinetics. The coordination environment of X&#8208;MIL&#8208;47 is analyzed using X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and the Zn2+ storage mechanism is thoroughly investigated through both in situ/ex situ spectroscopic techniques. The experimental results are consistent with DFT calculations, indicating that the introduction of polar substituents induces charge redistribution within the MOFs, thereby enhancing the reversibility of the redox reaction. Furthermore, a machine learning model based on the orthogonal expansion method and experimental data is developed to predict electrode material performance under varying conditions. This study provides new insights into the design of functional MOFs for energy storage applications.

         <title>Engineering CRISPR System&#8208;Based Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicle Potentiates T Cell Immunity for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a multifunctional CRISPR&#8208;dCas9&#8208;based OMV platform termed OMV&#8208;C9I12, which facilitates the coexpression of CXCL9 and IL&#8208;12 within tumor cells. This platform enhances T cell recruitment and activation, synergizes with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 immunotherapy, and amplifies antitumor T cell immunity. This demonstrates significant therapeutic efficacy in a broad range of tumors and offers a promising strategy to overcome immunotherapy resistance.








Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment but only benefits a subset of patients because of insufficient infiltration and inactivation of effector T cells. Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) can activate immunity and deliver therapeutic agents for immunotherapy. However, efficiently targeting and packaging therapeutic molecules into OMVs remains challenging. Here, the engineered E. coli BL21&#8208;derived OMVs enable the packaging of multiple genes, resulting in a 7&#8208;fold increase in DNA enrichment efficiency and gene silencing in vitro. Moreover, the engineered OMVs carrying genes encoding CXCL9 and IL12 (OMV&#8208;C9I12) reprogram tumor cells to secrete these factors, significantly enhancing T&#8208;cell chemotaxis and activation. More importantly, this system markedly inhibits tumors, extends survival, and synergizes with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 therapy in murine MB49 and B16F10 tumor models. Single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) further reveals significant upregulation of T&#8208;cell chemotaxis and activation&#8208;related pathways following OMV&#8208;C9I12 treatment. Finally, OMV&#8208;C9I12 potentiates T cell&#8208;mediated immunotherapy and suppresses the growth of bladder and breast cancer tumors in humanized mouse models. These findings highlight the potential of this engineered OMV platform for cancer gene therapy and provide novel strategies to overcome resistance to immunotherapy.

         <title>Hierarchically Structured Hollow Fiber Membranes for Efficient, Selective, and Scalable Mercury Ion Removal from Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchically structured sulfurized polyacrylonitrile hollow fiber membranes are fabricated via wet spinning for efficient and selective mercury ion removal. The membranes demonstrate excellent adsorption performance and exceptional reusability, maintaining over 99% efficiency after multiple regeneration cycles. Integrated into a scalable purification device, they provide a robust and sustainable solution for large&#8208;scale mercury remediation in water systems.









Abstract
Mercury ions (Hg2+) pose serious threats to aquatic ecosystems and human health due to their high toxicity and bioaccumulation. Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) nanoparticles, which contain soft Lewis base groups interact strongly with the soft Lewis acid Hg2+, demonstrating excellent adsorption performance and chemical stability. However, traditional methods typically involve dispersing SPAN nanoparticles in water or coating them on substrates, leading to uneven distribution, poor material stability, and potential secondary pollution. To overcome challenges in mercury removal, this study presents a highly selective, regenerable, and structurally stable SPAN&#8208;integrated hollow fiber membrane fabricated by wet spinning. The hierarchical structure significantly improves pore architecture, adsorption capacity, and long&#8208;term stability. The membrane achieves an initial Hg2+ removal efficiency of 98.31% and retains &#8776;99.7% efficiency after five regeneration cycles. When integrated into a scalable purification device, it removes 90.94% of Hg2+ from water with an initial Hg2+ concentration of 4.69 mg L&#8722;1. This work offers a novel, sustainable, and cost&#8208;effective approach for large&#8208;scale mercury remediation.

         <title>Polymerization&#8208;Induced Crystallization to Form Stretchable Hydrogels with Banded Spherulites and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stretchable hydrogels with large spherulites are developed by polymerization&#8208;induced crystallization of dopant molecules. Regular spherulites are formed in relatively stiff gels, whereas banded spherulites are obtained in soft gels. The formation of twisted crystal fibers is related to dynamic variations of crystallization pressure and network impedance, affording the gels with circularly polarized luminescence.








Abstract
Reported here is the synthesis of stretchable hydrogels with large spherulites of different morphologies by polymerization&#8208;induced crystallization of dopant molecules. By varying the concentrations of chemical crosslinker and initiator, or the light intensity for photopolymerization, the stiffness of polyacrylamide network is tunable to regulate the crystallization of dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8&#8208;ether molecules that form spherulites in the hydrogels. Regular spherulites are formed in relatively stiff gels, whereas banded spherulites with twisted crystal fibers are obtained in soft gels. The structure of spherulites is investigated by microscopy and scattering measurements. The formation of twisted crystal fibers is related to dynamic variations of crystallization pressure and network impedance. The gels with regular spherulites show stronger fluorescence and phosphorescence than those with banded spherulites. A remarkable fact is that the latter gels exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with dissymmetry factor up to +1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;2. This luminescence arises from the clusterization&#8208;triggered emission of the network constrained by the crystals, while the twisted fibers render the achiral clusterluminogens with CPL. The mutual influences between polymer network and crystal growth account for the collective functions of the composite gels. The design principle and chiral transfer mechanism should open opportunities for developing other soft materials with tailored crystals and optical properties.

         <title>From Physical Cross&#8208;Linking to Tailored Phosphorylation: Unlocking High&#8208;Performance and Biocompatible Xanthan&#8208;Konjac Hydrogels for Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phos&#8208;XK, a novel hydrogel electrolyte, is crafted from xanthan gum and konjac gum through physical crosslinking and targeted phosphorylation. This design balances mechanical strength and ionic conductivity, enabling Zn//MnO&#8322; batteries with long cycle life and high Coulombic efficiency. Its biocompatibility and biodegradability offer a sustainable solution for flexible, wearable energy storage electronics.








Abstract
Natural polymer&#8208;based hydrogel electrolytes, though biocompatible and cost&#8208;effective, often exhibit poor mechanical strength and ionic conductivity, limiting their use in high&#8208;performance energy storage. Phos&#8208;XK, a novel hydrogel electrolyte derived from xanthan gum (XG) and konjac glucomannan (KGM), has been developed via physical cross&#8208;linking and targeted phosphorylation. Specifically, physical cross&#8208;linking forms a robust 3D network that provides a stable structural foundation. Building on this, the phosphorylation process introduces phosphate monoesters (MPE) and diesters (DPE) in a precisely controlled ratio. MPE groups enhance ionic conductivity by facilitating Zn2+ desolvation and ion migration, while DPE strengthens mechanical integrity through enhanced cross&#8208;linking. These distinct roles of MPE and DPE are confirmed through both theoretical calculations and experimental results. Optimizing the phosphorylation ratio achieves a balance between mechanical strength (2.524&#160;MPa) and ionic conductivity (20.72 mS cm&#8722;1), resulting in remarkable electrochemical performance, including an extended cycle life exceeding 3000 h and a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.45% in Zn//Cu batteries. Moreover, Phos&#8208;XK is biocompatible and biodegradable, ideal for sustainable energy storage. This work highlights the potential of bio&#8208;based materials to overcome the limitations of traditional hydrogel electrolytes and stresses the importance of molecular engineering in achieving high&#8208;performance, eco&#8208;friendly energy storage.

         <title>A PROTAC&#8208;Based Cuproptosis Sensitizer in Lung Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PROTAC&#8208;based cuproptosis sensitizer CuS&#8208;MD@CS is developed in this work, which sensitizes cells to cuprotosis by modulating the p53 pathway through the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome systemcan. CuS&#8208;MD@CS not only can effectively deplete endogenous glutathione but also can promote the transition from glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration, thereby enhancing cancer cells' sensitivity to cuproptosis and achieving effective therapeutic effects of cuprotosis and apoptosis.








Abstract
As an autonomous form of regulated cell death, cuproptosis depends on copper (Cu) and mitochondrial metabolism. However, the principle metabolic pathway known as glycolysis (Warburg effect) and high glutathione (GSH) levels of tumor cells inevitably lead to suboptimal efficacy in cuproptosis. Hence, depleting the endogenous GSH within tumors and shifting from glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration are crucial factors for augmenting cuproptosis. In this study, a proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC)&#8208;based cuproptosis sensitizer (CuS&#8208;MD@CS) is innovatively constructed, which not only can induce cuproptosis and reactive oxygen species production via copper ions but also can regulate the expression of p53 protein via PROTACs through the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system in tumor cells, thus achieving endogenous GSH depletion and a shift from glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration, making cancer cells more sensitive to cuproptosis. Importantly, in vitro and in vivo experiments have verified that CuS&#8208;MD@CS effectively targets A549 cells and suppresses tumor growth through cuproptosis and apoptosis, exhibiting promising therapeutic responses. The novel PROTAC&#8208;based cuproptosis sensitizer CuS&#8208;MD@CS provides a new strategy for sensitizing cuproptosis and offers new hope for effective lung cancer treatment.

         <title>Bimetallic Nanocluster&#8208;Based Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes With High External Quantum Efficiency and Saturated Red Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the fabrication of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LED) using self&#8208;emissive bimetallic gold&#8208;copper nanoclusters (NCs) is reported. The NC&#8208;LED shows a maximum brightness of 1246 cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and the highest external quantum efficiency (EQE; 12.60%) value with pure red emission among the solution&#8208;processed and non&#8208;doped NC&#8208;based LEDs.








Abstract
Self&#8208;emissive atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs) are emerging as promising emissive layer material for next&#8208;generation light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), thanks to their solid&#8208;state luminescence, well&#8208;defined structures, photo/thermal stability, low toxicity, and unique excited&#8208;state properties. However, achieving high external quantum efficiency (EQE) in solid&#8208;state NCs remains a formidable challenge. In this study, a highly stable bimetallic gold&#8208;copper NC forming [Au2Cu6(Sadm)6(DPPEO)2] stabilized with 1&#8208;adamantanethiol (HSadm) and 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (DPPE) as the primary and secondary ligands, respectively is reported. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and spectroscopic analyses suggest that the as&#8208;synthesized NC contains one phosphine bound to gold and the second phosphine has oxidized to phosphine oxide (P&#9552;O). The presence of such P&#9552;O moieties in the NC facilitated C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions along with C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; and H&#183;&#183;&#183;H interactions between ligands, promoting rapid crystallization. Due to the exceptional photo/thermal stability and enhanced solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), [Au2Cu6(Sadm)6(DPPEO)2] NC is utilized to fabricate the NC&#8208;based LED (NC&#8208;LED) via the solution&#8208;processed technique, without using any additional host materials. The fabricated NC&#8208;LED shows a maximum brightness of 1246 cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and an EQE of 12.60% with a pure red emission &#8776;668 nm. This EQE value coupled with saturated pure red emission is the best among solution&#8208;processed and non&#8208;doped NC&#8208;LEDs, suggesting the enormous potential of the NCs for electro&#8208;optical devices.

The NC-LED shows a maximum brightness of 1246 cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and the highest external quantum efficiency (EQE; 12.60%) value with pure red emission among the solution-processed and non-doped NC-based LEDs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-emissive atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs) are emerging as promising emissive layer material for next-generation light-emitting diodes (LEDs), thanks to their solid-state luminescence, well-defined structures, photo/thermal stability, low toxicity, and unique excited-state properties. However, achieving high external quantum efficiency (EQE) in solid-state NCs remains a formidable challenge. In this study, a highly stable bimetallic gold-copper NC forming [Au&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(Sadm)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(DPPEO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] stabilized with 1-adamantanethiol (HSadm) and 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (DPPE) as the primary and secondary ligands, respectively is reported. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction and spectroscopic analyses suggest that the as-synthesized NC contains one phosphine bound to gold and the second phosphine has oxidized to phosphine oxide (P&#9552;O). The presence of such P&#9552;O moieties in the NC facilitated C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions along with C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt; and H&#183;&#183;&#183;H interactions between ligands, promoting rapid crystallization. Due to the exceptional photo/thermal stability and enhanced solid-state photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), [Au&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(Sadm)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(DPPEO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] NC is utilized to fabricate the NC-based LED (NC-LED) via the solution-processed technique, without using any additional host materials. The fabricated NC-LED shows a maximum brightness of 1246 cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and an EQE of 12.60% with a pure red emission &#8776;668 nm. This EQE value coupled with saturated pure red emission is the best among solution-processed and non-doped NC-LEDs, suggesting the enormous potential of the NCs for electro-optical devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Natural Design of a Stabilized Cross&#8208;&#946; Fold: Structure of the FuA FapC from Pseudomonas Sp. UK4 Reveals a Critical Role for Stacking of Imperfect Repeats</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a 3.2 &#197; cryoEM structure of functional amyloid protein FapC from Pseudomonas sp. UK4, an essential component of bacterial biofilm, which reveals a Greek key&#8208;shaped protofilament, supports bioinformatically determined motifs, nuances AlphaFold predictions, emphasizes heterogeneous cross&#8208;&#946; stacking in amyloid cross&#8208;seeding and shows strain&#8208;dependent nanomechanical properties. FapC fibrils are intrinsically catalytic. This provides a structural foundation to design novel biomaterials.








Abstract
An essential structural component of bacterial biofilms is functional amyloid (FuA), which also has great potential as an engineerable nano&#8208;biomaterial. However, experimentally based high resolution structures of FuA that resolve individual residues are lacking. A fully experimentally based 3.2 &#197; resolution cryo&#8208;electron microscopy density map of the FuA protein FapC from Pseudomonas sp. UK4 is presented, which reveals a Greek key&#8208;shaped protofilament. The structure supports bioinformatic identification of conserved motifs and is broadly consistent with the AlphaFold prediction but with important modifications. Each FapC monomer consists of three imperfect repeats (IRs), with each repeat forming one cross&#8208;&#946; layer. An array of highly conserved Asn and Gln residues with an extensive H&#8208;bonding network underpins this conserved Greek key&#8208;shape and reveals the role of heterogeneous cross&#8208;&#946; stacking in amyloid cross&#8208;seeding. The covariation of residues in the hydrophobic core among different IRs suggests a cooperative monomer folding process during fibril elongation, while heterogeneous stacking of IRs reduces charge repulsion between layers to stabilize the monomer fold. The FapC fibrils show intrinsic catalytic activity and strain&#8208;dependent nanomechanical properties. Combined with mutagenesis data, the structure provides mechanistic insights into formation of FapC FuA from disordered monomers and a structural foundation for the design of novel biomaterials.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Mode Mechanochromic Responses from Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Elastomer Tubes of Uniform Sheath</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural&#8208;colored tube is created from cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers, exhibiting uniform color changes with high strain sensitivity upon extension and inflation. The color change occurs across multiple mechanochromic modes, highlighting the influence of molecular anisotropy and tubular geometry on strain sensitivity. The tubes demonstrate reconfigurable alphabet displays and 3D photonic skins.









Abstract
Materials that exhibit varied optical responses to different modes of mechanical stimuli are attractive for complex sensing and adaptive functionalities. However, most mechanochromic materials are fabricated from films or fibers with limited actuation modes. Here, hollow tubes of a symmetric sheath are created using cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers (CLCEs) at the sub&#8208;millimeter scale. The oligomeric precursor is sheared in an elastomeric microchannel to form uniform thickness, overcoming gravity effect and Plateau&#8208;Rayleigh instability. In addition, the coloration is achieved to be faster and have higher reflectivity compared to that of solid fibers. The tube can undergo axial, circumferential, and radial strains upon extension and inflation. The combination of molecular anisotropy and geometry of the tube enables highly sensitive mechanochromic responses in both azimuthal and axial directions: inflation causes red&#8208;to&#8208;violet shift (&#8776;220&#160;nm) at a circumferential strain of 0.57. The inflation of a bent tube generates another mechanochromic mode with a higher sensitivity to strain. Finally, display of 26 alphabets is achieved using 5 tubes, of which the positions can be reconfigured, and curvature&#8208;dependent 3D photonic skins are demonstrated from tubes wrapped around 3D objects. The multi&#8208;mode mechanochromic tubes will find applications for soft robotics, adaptive displays, wearable sensors, and spectrometers.

         <title>Exclusive Encapsulation Adhesive in a Neutral&#8208;Plane Model for Ultrahigh Mechanical Stability of Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The detachment behavior between the adhesives and the electrodes are always caused by significant interlayer shear stress during bending in neutral plane flexible perovskite solar cells (NP&#8208;FPSCs). A crosslinkable polymer named acrylated isoprene rubber (AIR) is introduced to form a stable network, ensuring a strong bond between the protective layer and FPSCs. The resultant NP&#8208;FPSCs demonstrate excellent mechanical stability &#8212; the most mechanically stable devices reported to date.









Abstract
The functional layers of flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs) are subjected to significant stress during bending, causing structural failure and declining power conversion efficiency. To alleviate stress, a neutral plane (NP) is introduced by positioning the functional layers at the center of the device, with top metal electrode encapsulated by a protective layer. However, adhesive detachment remains a critical issue during multiple bending cycles, and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, a systematic analysis of the detachment behavior in NP&#8208;FPSC reveals that commercial adhesives with high Young's modulus and low adhesion strength struggle to withstand interlayer shear stress during bending, which triggers detachment between adhesives and electrodes. To address this issue, a crosslinkable polymer acrylated isoprene rubber (AIR) is designed with long linear polyisoprene main chain and acrylate side chains, providing high flexibility and reduced chain segment movement. AIR can be crosslinked under UV irradiation to form a stable network with ultralow Young's modulus and high adhesion strength, ensuring a strong bond between the protective layer and FPSCs, constructing stable NP&#8208;FPSCs. The resultant NP&#8208;FPSCs demonstrate excellent mechanical stability, retaining 92.8% of their initial efficiency after 50&#8201;000 bending cycles at a radius of 4 mm, meeting the IEC 62715&#8208;6&#8208;3 standards.

         <title>Deep Reconstruction of RuPdOx Hollow Nanofibers for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrazine Oxidation&#8208;Assisted Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and deep reconstruction of RuPdOx hollow nanofibers to generate RuO2/Pd heterostructure is achieved to regulate the local electronic environment of catalyst during hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) processes. Thus the obtained material exhibits exceptional ampere&#8208;grade&#8208;current&#8208;density HER and HzOR properties, enabling significnat energy&#8208;saving H2 production performance.








Abstract
Manipulating the reconstruction of a heterostructured material is highly desirable to achieve high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic performance. Here, an in situ reconstruction of RuPdOx hollow nanofibers (HNFs) is presented to generate RuO2/Pd from both the electrochemical and chemical reconstruction processes. The reconstructed catalyst is highly efficient for both hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at industrial&#8208;grade current densities, significantly outperforming the benchmark Pt/C catalyst. Furthermore, it maintains a record&#8208;breaking durability of 500 h for HzOR at 1 A cm&#8722;2. Remarkably, with the catalyst as electrodes, a two&#8208;electrode overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) cell is constructed, which requires only 0.263 kWh of electricity to produce 1 m3 H2 at 100 mA cm&#8722;2, significantly lower than that in overall water splitting (OWS) system (4.286 kWh m&#8722;3 H2), exhibiting an exceptional energy&#8208;saving H2 production property. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal an efficient electron transfer from Pd to RuO2 at their interface from the reconstruction of RuPdOx HNFs, which regulates the local electronic environment of atoms, modulates the adsorption and desorption for intermediates, and reduces the energy barriers for enhancing the electrocatalytic process. This study offers a robust reconstruction strategy for the design of electrocatalysts that exhibit superior efficiency in energy conversion devices.

This study offers a robust reconstruction strategy for the design of electrocatalysts that exhibit superior efficiency in energy conversion devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Origami Crawlers: Exploring A Single Origami Vertex for Complex Path Navigation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that the nonlinear kinematics of origami sheets can be exploited to realize crawlers capable of multimodal locomotion under a single actuation input. In particular, it focuses on one of the simplest origami building blocks &#8208; a rigid degree&#8208;four vertex &#8208; and identifies designs that enable movement in a straight line as well as turning left or right by simply controlling the folding range of the actuated fold.








Abstract
The ancient art of origami, traditionally used to transform simple sheets into intricate objects, also holds potential for diverse engineering applications, such as shape morphing and robotics. In this study, it is demonstrated that one of the most basic origami structures&#8211;a rigid, foldable degree&#8208;four vertex&#8211;can be engineered to create a crawler capable of navigating complex paths using only a single input. Through a combination of experimental studies and modeling, it is shown that modifying the geometry of a degree&#8208;four vertex enables sheets to move either in a straight line or turn. Furthermore, it is illustrated that leveraging the nonlinearities in folding allows the design of crawlers that can switch between moving straight and turning. Remarkably, these crawling modes can be controlled by adjusting the range of the folding angle's actuation. This study opens avenues for simple machines that can follow intricate trajectories with minimal&#160;actuation.

         <title>Designing the Self&#8208;Assembly of Disordered Materials Via Color Frustration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What if disorder can be designed? This work introduces a strategy to self&#8208;assemble amorphous materials by designing bonding rules for patchy particles that suppress crystallinity and promote frustration. The designer particles nucleate a network of dodecahedral cages from the liquid, yielding a novel equilibrium amorphous phase. This approach redefines how disorder and function can be programmed at the colloidal scale.








Abstract
The ability to control self&#8208;assembly with atomic&#8208;level precision has led to remarkable advances in the rational design of crystalline materials. However, similar design strategies have yet to be developed for amorphous materials. Here, a strategy is devised for programming the self&#8208;assembly of amorphous structures by encoding frustration into the building block design. The building blocks are tailored to locally favor the formation of five&#8208;member rings and yield a network of face&#8208;sharing dodecahedral cages whose icosahedral symmetry prevents long&#8208;range order. Surprisingly, unlike geometrically frustrated glasses that form through kinetic arrest, the network nucleates spontaneously from the liquid phase, representing a novel type of thermodynamically stable disordered phase. The stabilization of this frustrated phase via programmable interactions paves the way for a new generation of disordered&#160;materials.

         <title>Morphotropic Phase Boundary in Irradiated Ferroelectric Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Irradiation rather than composition is used to induce helix/trans morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) in ferroelectric polymers. Markedly enhanced piezoelectric coefficient d33 of &#8208;69.8 pC N&#8722;1 is achieved in ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene) copolymers. This postprocessing approach is generally applicable to different ferroelectric polymer compositions and sources of irradiation, offering a scalable tool to design of ferroelectric polymers with high piezoelectric properties.








Abstract
Morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) enables a large piezoelectric effect in ferroelectric polymers. However, till now MPB has only been observed in a few polymers, which is induced by compositional tuning of the polymer composition. Here a distinct approach to design MPB in ferroelectric polymers is reported via ion irradiation. Without changing composition as required by the conventional compositional approach, the formation of helix/trans MPB in ferroelectric polymers is achieved upon increasing the irradiation dose, near which a substantially enhanced piezoelectric coefficient d33 of &#8208;69.8 pC N&#8722;1 is observed. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by using different sources of irradiation and polymer compositions, which offers a general and scalable postprocessing tool to effectively improve the piezoelectric response of ferroelectric polymers.

         <title>Enhanced Kinetics and Stability of Zn&#8208;MnO2 Batteries with a Multifunctional TiO2 Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TiO2&#8208;coated MnO2 cathodes enhance the cycling stability and capacity of zinc&#8208;ion batteries by improving kinetics and inhibiting Mn dissolution. The multifunctional TiO2 coating forms a coherent interface with MnO2, creating an electron&#8208;enriched surface that promotes rapid electron/ion transport and proton&#8208;dominated reactions. Additionally, the coating mitigates Mn dissolution and buffers volume changes, offering a promising solution for advanced energy storage.









Abstract
Zinc&#8208;ion batteries are a promising energy storage alternative, offering safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and environment&#8208;friendliness. MnO2 is appealing for its high capacity and output voltage, but it suffers from slow kinetics and poor stability due to severe Mn dissolution during cycling. Here, the performance of MnO2 is enhanced by coating it with a uniform TiO2 nanolayer that incorporates oxygen vacancies. The TiO2&#8208;MnO2 heterogeneous interface results in the formation of Ti&#9472;O&#9472;Mn bonds and a reduction in the interfacial valence state, thereby leading to the creation of an interface electron&#8208;enriched region that facilitates faster electron and ion transport. This multifunctional TiO2 coating not only promotes proton&#8208;dominated electrochemical reactions and ion diffusion but also acts as a protective barrier, preventing Mn dissolution and buffering volume changes during cycling. Consequently, the MnO2@TiO2 cathode demonstrates excellent specific capacity (299 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1) and cycling stability, achieving 91.4% capacity retention after 2500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1 and 92.7% capacity retention after 600 cycles at a low current density of 0.2 A g&#8722;1. These results outperform many previously reported manganese&#8208;based cathodes, demonstrating MnO2@TiO2&#8217;s potential as a high&#8208;performance and durable cathode material for zinc&#8208;ion batteries and advancing the development of efficient energy storage solutions.

         <title>Efficient Cu&#9472;Co Dual&#8208;Sites in Cobalt Oxide Nanoboxes for Electrocatalytic Reduction of Low&#8208;Concentration NO to NH3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical reduction of low&#8208;concentration NO presents a promising avenue for NH3 production, offering a sustainable solution to environmental challenges. Cu&#9472;Co dual&#8208;sites in hollow cobalt oxide nanoboxes are developed for NO electroreduction, boasting a Faraday efficiency of 94.13% and an NH3 yield of 54.28 &#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1. A Zn&#8208;NO battery has also been successfully demonstrated for simultaneous NO elimination, NH3 generation, and power output.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic conversion of nitric oxide (NO) to ammonia (NH3) epitomizes an advanced approach in NH3 synthesis, crucial for efficiently converting low&#8208;concentration industrial NO exhaust and contributing significantly to environmental preservation. Catalyst design remains one pivotal element in addressing this challenge. Here, efficient Cu&#9472;Co dual active sites embedded in hollow cobalt oxide nanoboxes are created for the electrocatalytic low&#8208;concentration NO reduction reaction (NORR). Cu&#8208;modified cobalt oxide (Cu&#8208;Co3O4) and its heterophase interface with copper oxide (Cu&#8208;Co3O4/CuO) both exhibit over 93% Faraday efficiency for NH3 synthesis, with a yield reaching up to 59.10 &#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode by utilizing simulated industrial NO exhaust (1 vol %) as the feedstock, surpassing those of pure cobalt oxide and some reported catalysts. Theoretical calculations and NO temperature&#8208;programmed desorption experiments demonstrate that the incorporation of Cu significantly enhances NO adsorption and reduces the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step. The integration of Cu&#8208;Co3O4 and Cu&#8208;Co3O4/CuO within the cathode of the Zn&#8211;NO battery demonstrates a notable power density of 2.02 mW cm&#8722;2, highlighting a propitious direction for investigating highly efficient conversion of low&#8208;concentration NO exhaust gas.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. A Zn-NO battery has also been successfully demonstrated for simultaneous NO elimination, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; generation, and power output.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrocatalytic conversion of nitric oxide (NO) to ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) epitomizes an advanced approach in NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis, crucial for efficiently converting low-concentration industrial NO exhaust and contributing significantly to environmental preservation. Catalyst design remains one pivotal element in addressing this challenge. Here, efficient Cu&#9472;Co dual active sites embedded in hollow cobalt oxide nanoboxes are created for the electrocatalytic low-concentration NO reduction reaction (NORR). Cu-modified cobalt oxide (Cu-Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and its heterophase interface with copper oxide (Cu-Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CuO) both exhibit over 93% Faraday efficiency for NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis, with a yield reaching up to 59.10 &#181;g h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; mg&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;0.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode by utilizing simulated industrial NO exhaust (1 vol %) as the feedstock, surpassing those of pure cobalt oxide and some reported catalysts. Theoretical calculations and NO temperature-programmed desorption experiments demonstrate that the incorporation of Cu significantly enhances NO adsorption and reduces the energy barrier of the rate-determining step. The integration of Cu-Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Cu-Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CuO within the cathode of the Zn&#8211;NO battery demonstrates a notable power density of 2.02 mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, highlighting a propitious direction for investigating highly efficient conversion of low-concentration NO exhaust gas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effect of Combination Model of MoTe2 and MXene Layers on Sodium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared with MX@MoTe2&#8208;V, in which the (002) crystal plane of MoTe2 is perpendicular to the MXene layer, MX@MoTe2&#8208;P with MoTe2 (002) crystal plane parallel to MXene layer has a more stable interface structure and more sodium ion storage sites, thereby achieving excellent electrochemical performance.








Abstract
The integration of different crystal planes between two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials results in various combinations, which always exert different effects on the electrochemical properties of materials. The metallic 1T&#8242; phase of molybdenum telluride is a promising anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), but its rearrangement and restacking during charge/discharge process causes a decline in cycle. Herein, MX@MoTe2&#8208;P with MoTe2 (002) planes parallel to MXene layers and MX@MoTe2&#8208;V with MoTe2 (002) planes perpendicular to MXene layers are controllably constructed. Compared with MX@MoTe2&#8208;V, the new interface formed between MoTe2 and MXene in MX@MoTe2&#8208;P has a stronger van der Waals interaction and larger contact area, helpful to store more sodium ions and contributing to its excellent structural stability and battery capacity. Although MX@MoTe2&#8208;V has a higher sodium adsorption energy than MX@MoTe2&#8208;P, the small interface area lowers the storage capacity and it further aggravates the collapse of the structure. When used as the anode for SIBs, MX@MoTe2&#8208;P offers excellent cycle stability and specific capacity. In particular, sodium&#8208;ion full cell consisting of MX@MoTe2&#8208;P anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode shows the excellent performance (147.2 mAh g&#8722;1@1000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1) surpassing all the reported MoTe2&#8208;based materials. This work provides a guide for the manufacture of new electrode materials.

         <title>Nanozyme&#8208;Reinforced Hydrogel Spray as a Reactive Oxygen Species&#8208;Driven Oxygenator to Accelerate Diabetic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors fabricate a reactive oxygen species&#8208;driven oxygenation hydrogel (OxyGel) spray, which can rebalance the oxidative and hypoxic microenvironment of the diabetic wound, promote M1&#8208;to&#8208;M2 macrophage repolarization, and enhance the survival, migration, and angiogenesis of endothelial cells. A single administration of the OxyGel spray accelerates full&#8208;thickness back skin wound and refractory foot ulcer wound healing in diabetic rats.









Abstract
The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and poor oxygen supply are two prominent factors of the inflammatory microenvironment that delay diabetic wound healing. However, current clinical treatments cannot achieve effective ROS scavenging and sustained oxygenation. Herein, a ROS&#8208;driven oxygenation hydrogel (OxyGel) spray that integrates a multifunctional nanozyme with a dynamically crosslinked sprayable hydrogel matrix is presented. The nanozyme, which is fabricated based on the ceria&#8208;zoledronic acid nanoparticles modified with tannic acid (TCZ nanozymes), can mimic the cascade catalytic activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) to effectively scavenge ROS while generating oxygen. These synergistic actions rebalance the oxidative and hypoxic microenvironment of the diabetic wound, promote M1&#8208;to&#8208;M2 macrophage repolarization, and enhance the survival, migration, and angiogenesis of endothelial cells. A single administration of the nanozyme via the hydrogel spray stably deposits the nanozymes at the target sites to accelerate full&#8208;thickness back skin wound and refractory foot ulcer wound healing in diabetic rats. Furthermore, RNA&#8208;seq results revealed the upregulation of multiple signaling pathways related to wound healing by the OxyGel spray, highlighting the potential of this platform not only for the treatment of refractory diabetic wounds but also other diseases associated with oxidative stress and hypoxia.

         <title>Crystalline&#8208;Dependent Magnon Torques in All&#8208;Sputtered Hf/Cr2O3/Ferromagnet Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnon torques can overcome the Joule heating issue in traditional spintronic devices. The crystalline dependence of magnon torques in Hf/Cr2O3/FM heterostructures is demonstrated. Magnon torques are generated when the N&#233;el vector of Cr2O3 is parallel to the spin polarization generated in Hf. Furthermore, the magnetization switching of perpendicularly magnetized CoFeB is achieved using magnon torques.








Abstract
Electron motion in spin&#8208;orbit torque devices inevitably leads to the Joule heating issue. Magnon torques can potentially circumvent this issue, as it enables the transport of spin angular momentum in insulating magnetic materials. In this work, a sandwich structure composed of Hf/antiferromagnetic Cr2O3/ferromagnet is fabricated and demonstrates that the magnon torque is strongly dependent on the crystalline structure of Cr2O3. Magnon torques are stronger when the N&#233;el vector of Cr2O3 aligns parallel to the spin polarization generated in Hf, while they are suppressed when the N&#233;el vector is perpendicular to the spin polarization. The magnon torque efficiency is estimated to be &#8722;0.134 using in&#8208;plane second harmonic Hall measurements. Using magnon torques, perpendicular magnetization switching of CoFeB is achieved, with a critical switching current density of 4.09 &#215; 107 A&#160;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the spin angular momentum loss due to the insertion of Cr2O3 is found to be lower than that of polycrystalline NiO. The work highlights the role of antiferromagnet crystalline structures in controlling magnon torques, broadening the potential applications of magnon torques.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Splitting Magnetoresistance in Altermagnetic RuO2 Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel magnetoresistance effect termed spin&#8208;splitting magnetoresistance (SSMR) is demonstrated in (101)&#8208;RuO2/Co bilayers. The SSMR is underpinned by the spin&#8211;charge interconversion process induced by the nonrelativistic spin&#8208;splitting effect in altermagnets. Utilizing the SSMR, a [001]&#8208;oriented N&#233;el vector in an epitaxial thin film of RuO2 is revealed, which evidences its altermagnetism.








Abstract
The recently discovered altermagnets, featured by the exotic correlation of magnetic exchange interaction and alternating crystal environments, have offered exciting cutting&#8208;edge opportunities for spintronics. Nevertheless, the altermagnetism of RuO2, one of the earliest&#8208;discovered altermagnets, is currently under intense debate. Here, this controversy is attempted to be resolved by demonstrating a spin&#8208;splitting magnetoresistance (SSMR) effect that is driven by a spin current associated with the giant nonrelativistic spin splitting of an altermagnet. Compared to the spin Hall magnetoresistance induced by a conventional relativistic spin current, the SSMR is characterized by unusual angular dependence with a phase&#8208;shift feature underpinned by the N&#233;el&#8208;vector orientation and pronounced temperature dependence caused by its susceptibility to electron scattering. Through systematical investigations on the magnetoresistance of (101)&#8208;RuO2/Co bilayers, a sizable SSMR is disentangled and hence a N&#233;el vector along [001] direction is unveiled. This work not only demonstrates a simple electric avenue for probing the N&#233;el vector of altermagnets, but also indicates long&#8208;range magnetic order in thin films of RuO2.

This work not only demonstrates a simple electric avenue for probing the N&#233;el vector of altermagnets, but also indicates long-range magnetic order in thin films of RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Native Defect Elimination and Lattice Framework Reinforcement Toward Ultra&#8208;Stable Sodium&#8208;Ion Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional solid&#8208;phase sintered samples have native surface defects, mainly consisting of lattice mismatches and elemental distortions, and pose problems of TM dissolution and crack growth during subsequent cycles. With an understanding of the spatial distribution of the defects and an appreciation of the importance of the surface state, a strategy of surface defect elimination and crystal framework enhancement is applied and demonstrated to provide strong stability of the cathodes treated by this strategy.








Abstract
Structural and performance degradation in layered transition metal oxide (TMO) cathode materials is often attributed to phase transition induction during sodium de&#8208;embedding, while the significance of native defects during complex synthesis is frequently overlooked. Here, the role of native surface remodeling in progressive capacity degradation in P2&#8208;type Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 is emphasized, where lattice mismatches and elemental distortions are found on the surface of the particles and result in the accumulation of low&#8208;valent TMs. Interestingly, the accumulation gradually became the center of cathodic degradation rather than phase transition induction. Given the apparent spatiality of the primary defects and recognizing the importance of the surface state, the stripping repair of the defects and gradient introduction of La can be manipulated. The unique LaO6 configuration enhanced the rigid framework of TMO6 and suppressed the emergence of low&#8208;valent TMs, resulting in surface&#8208;corrected and reinforced particles, which can be explained by generalized functional density calculations and ex&#8208;situ hard X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. As a result, the reinforced cathode brought about a capacity retention of up to 98% for 500 cycles at 2 C and 87% for 4000 cycles at 10 C and stable electrochemical performance over a wide temperature range (&#8722;20&#160;&#176;C&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C).

         <title>Highly Robust and Conductive Polymer Electrodes for Droplet Energy Harvesting and Printable On&#8208;Skin Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bi&#8208;continuous polymer electrode (BC&#8208;PE) is developed by using PBFDO as the electrical phase and TPU as the mechanical phase, featuring exceptional properties including high conductivity, mechanical toughness, robustness, stretchability, stability, recyclability, and biocompatibility. Leveraging the capabilities of the BC&#8208;PE, a record high&#8208;performance droplet electricity generator and a self&#8208;powered electronic skin for the human&#8208;machine interface are achieved.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable conductive polymers have exhibited promising electrical properties. However, their brittleness and unsatisfactory mechanical characteristics have hindered their creation of flexible electrodes. Here, a robust bi&#8208;continuous polymer electrode (BC&#8208;PE) is reported that features a stable and high electrical conductivity (&gt;60&#8201;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), remarkable stretchability (&gt;600%), high fracture strength (&gt;57 MPa), excellent toughness (&gt;230&#160;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), recyclability, and biocompatibility. The BC&#8208;PE is fabricated by facilely blending a high&#8208;conducting polymer poly(benzodifurandione)(PBFDO) with thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). Serving as a flexible electrode for a droplet electricity generator, a record high current density of 29.2 A m&#8722;2 and a power density of 1124.2 W m&#8722;2 have been attained. Moreover, the versatility of the BC&#8208;PE is validated by the direct ink writing technique, and a soft, thin, BC&#8208;PE&#8208;based self&#8208;powered electronic skin is demonstrated for touch&#8208;track recognition. This work presents a straightforward strategy for the development of advanced conductive polymer electrodes that well address the tradeoffs between conductivity and mechanical properties, showcasing their promising applications in energy harvesting and on&#8208;skin human&#8208;machine interfaces.

         <title>Designing an Anionic Layer in Low&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes to Promote In&#8208;Plane Ion Diffusion for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optimization model for zinc anodes centered on anion traction in a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte system is proposed. The fluoride&#8208;ion enriched interfacial layer on the zinc anode surface enhances the concentration of Zn2+ in a lateral direction through electrostatic forces, thereby facilitating horizontal zinc plating. Moreover, the repulsion between the anion&#8208;rich layer and sulfate ions can effectively inhibit the formation of byproducts.








Abstract
In contrast to high&#8208;concentration electrolyte systems, low&#8208;concentration electrolytes provide a cost&#8208;effective strategy to advance the commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). However, such electrolytes frequently exhibit severe dendrite formation caused by localized Zn2+ concentration gradients, which critically compromise the cycling stability and operational safety of AZIBs. In this work, an innovative approach is proposed that involves the in situ construction of a fluoride&#8208;ion (F&#8722;) enriched interfacial layer on zinc anodes. This method facilitates in&#8208;plane diffusion of zinc ions at the anode interface, resulting in accelerated lateral growth of zinc deposits rather than dendritic formation. The results indicate that this orientated growth is closely associated with an anionic layer that effectively reduces random and irregular deposition as well as undesirable side reactions. The proposed system exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance within a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte framework, achieving a battery lifespan exceeding 1500 h at a current density of 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, it maintains Coulombic efficiency above 99% after 800 h of cycling. Additionally, the Na2V6O16&#183;3H2O (NVO)//Zn full battery incorporating this additive showcases enhanced long&#8208;term cycling performance and improved capacity retention, further confirming the excellent reversibility of the plating/stripping processes for zinc anode.

         <title>Broadband Excitation from X&#8208;Ray to UV for Afterglow Emission in Monodisperse Lanthanide&#8208;Doped Nanoengineered Molecular Nanotransducers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyan and green long&#8208;afterglow luminescence in NaLuF4:Tb(15 mol%)@NaYF4@SiO2 is achieved through a molecular doping strategy under UV and X&#8208;ray excitation, respectively. The rationally designed structure of NaLuF4:Tb(15 mol%)@NaYF4@4&#8208;PP&#8208;doped SiO2 NCs, facilitated by hydrogen bonding and physical interactions, stabilizes the triplet state of 4&#8208;PP, thereby enabling afterglow emission under UV and X&#8208;ray excitation. This approach expands the library of optical codes for information encryption.








Abstract
The rational design of uniform afterglow nanoparticles (NPs) is critical for applications such as bioimaging and information storage. However, excitation of afterglow NPs remains largely limited to either X&#8208;ray or UV light. Integrating both X&#8208;ray&#8208; and UV&#8208;responsive afterglow components into a single NP platform remains a major challenge. Here, a broadband excitation strategy (X&#8208;ray to UV) is reported for afterglow emission using lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoengineered molecular nanotransducers. A 4&#8208;phenylpyridine (4&#8208;PP)&#8208;doped SiO2 shell is grown on NaLuF4:Tb(15 mol%)@NaYF4 NPs. The SiO2 shell is first coated onto the core, then functionalized via hydrothermal reaction with 4&#8208;PP. Hydrogen bonding and physical interactions between 4&#8208;PP and the SiO2 matrix enable blue afterglow emission at 472&#160;nm with a 2.41 s lifetime under 290&#160;nm excitation. Under X&#8208;ray excitation, high&#8208;energy photons induce defect formation in the NaLuF4:Tb3+ core, where stored energy is transferred to Tb3+ ions, producing green afterglow with a persistence time exceeding 600 s. This dual&#8208;mode excitation expands the operational versatility of afterglow materials. This approach demonstrates a promising strategy for integrating multiple optically active components into a single core&#8211;shell NP structure, offering tunable and extended afterglow performance for advanced optoelectronic and imaging applications.

         <title>Monodisperse Os&#8208;O&#8208;Co Modules Enable Ampere&#8208;Level Hydrazine&#8208;Assisted Seawater Splitting in Membraneless Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monodispersed Os&#8208;O&#8208;Co modules are constructed within a cobalt hydroxide structure via an in situ osmium (Os) single&#8208;atom modification strategy to serve as a bifunctional catalyst (Os&#8208;Co(OH)2). By leveraging d&#8208;p orbital hybridization, the adsorption energy of active sites is optimally tuned, endowing the catalyst with exceptional intrinsic activity for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR).








Abstract
Hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted seawater electrolysis (HzOR&#8208;SWE) is critical for addressing freshwater scarcity and energy crises. However, the development of this technology has been significantly impeded by the absence of efficient catalysts capable of cleaving N&#9472;H bonds during the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Herein, Monodispersed Os&#8208;O&#8208;Co modules are constructed within a cobalt hydroxide structure via an in situ osmium (Os) single&#8208;atom modification strategy to serve as a bifunctional catalyst. The d&#8208;p orbital hybridization in the structure shifts the d&#8208;band center of Os sites away from the Fermi level, weakening the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates and exhibiting the lowest N&#9472;H dehydrogenation energy barrier for HzOR and moderate active hydrogen adsorption energy for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). When integrated into a membraneless flow cell (MFC), the catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance in HzOR&#8208;SWE, requiring only 0.768 V to deliver 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 with a remarkable rate of 31.9 moles of hydrogen per kilowatt&#8208;hour (kWh). This represents a 70.7% energy saving compared to conventional seawater splitting systems (2.62 V, 7.6 kWh mol&#8722;1). This work holds significant importance for advancing the economic viability of low&#8208;energy seawater electrolysis for hydrogen production.

         <title>Data Readout Techniques for DNA&#8208;Based Information Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a universal genetic material, DNA can inherently encode and transmit information. Various DNA data storage systems are reported as attractive alternatives to current digital data storage media. This review provides a detailed analysis of the characteristics and evolution of readout techniques of DNA storage systems, and discusses challenges and opportunities in readout techniques of DNA data storage systems.








Abstract
DNA is a natural chemical substrate that carries genetic information, which also serves as a powerful toolkit for storing digital data. Compared to traditional&#160;storage media, DNA molecules offer higher storage density, longer lifespan, and lower maintenance energy consumption. In DNA storage process, data readout is a critical step that bridges the gap between DNA molecular/structures with stored digital information. With the continued development of strategies in DNA data storage technology, the readout techniques have evolved. However, there is a lack of systematic introduction and discussion on the readout techniques for reported DNA data storage systems, especially the correlation between the design of the data storage system and the corresponding selection of readout techniques. This review first introduces two main categories of DNA data storage units (i.e., sequence and structure) and their corresponding readout techniques (i.e., sequencing and nonsequencing methods), and then reviewed representative examples of notable advancements in DNA data storage technology, focusing on data storage unit design, and readout technique selection. It also introduces emerging approaches to assist data readout techniques, such as implementation of microfluidic and fluorescent probes. Finally, the paper discusses the limitations, challenges, and potential of DNA data readout approaches.

This review provides a holistic overview of biopolymers&#8208;derived electronic skins (Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins), highlighting their exceptional attributes, nature&#8208;inspired engineering constructions, promising applications, and remaining fundamental and technical challenges. These insights provide a design framework to provoke the advancement of e&#8208;skins with high adaptivity, mechanical robustness, and sustainability that contribute to the development of high&#8208;performance wearable electronic systems.








Abstract
The past few years have witnessed the rapid exploration of natural and synthetic materials to construct electronic skins (e&#8208;skins) to emulate the multisensory functions of human skins driven by promising applications. Among various materials employed in functional e&#8208;skins, biopolymers are particularly notable for their exceptional biocompatibility and abundant resources. Despite remarkable progress in engineering biopolymeric materials, a timely and holistic review focusing on the design, synthesis, and modification of biopolymers tailored for biopolymers&#8208;derived e&#8208;skins (Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins) is lacking. In this review, the key attributes of biopolymers are introduced&#160;to establish a fundamental understanding fordeveloping functional Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins. Next, the recent progress in harnessing various natural and synthetic biopolymers as building blocks for constructing Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins is systematically discussed, providing insights into maximizing the distinctive attributes of biopolymers. Subsequently, the benefits of nature&#8208;inspired Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins achieved through heterogeneous composite and structural engineering are highlighted, infusing fresh momentum into the advancement of e&#8208;skins. Then, the promising applications of Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins in multisensory functions are summarized, including both local monitoring and remote teleoperation, as well as sustainable energy harvesting that empowers e&#8208;skins. Finally, the remaining fundamental and technical challenges in advancing Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins are presented to provoke future designs that emulate and even go beyond human skins.

         <title>Functional Biomaterials Derived from Protein Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation and Liquid&#8208;to&#8208;Solid Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein can undergo liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition to form liquid condensates and solid aggregates. These phase transitions can be influenced by post&#8208;translational modifications, mutations, and various environmental factors. Effective modulation of protein phase behavior offers promising applications in drug discovery, delivery, and fabrication of multifunctional protein&#8208;based liquid and solid materials.








Abstract
Protein phase transitions play a vital role in both cellular functions and pathogenesis. Dispersed proteins can undergo liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation to form condensates, a process that is reversible and highly regulated within cells. The formation and physicochemical properties of these condensates, such as composition, viscosity, and multiphase miscibility, are precisely modulated to fulfill specific biological functions. However, protein condensates can undergo a further liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid state, forming &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich aggregates that may disrupt cellular function and lead to diseases. While this phenomenon is crucial for biological processes and has significant implications for neurodegenerative diseases, the phase behavior of naturally derived or engineered proteins and polypeptides also presents opportunities for developing high&#8208;performance, multifunctional materials at various scales. Additionally, the unique molecular recruitment capabilities of condensates inspire innovative advancements in biomaterial design for applications in drug discovery, delivery, and biosynthesis. This work highlights recent progress in understanding the mechanisms underlying protein phase behavior, particularly how it responds to internal molecular changes and external physical stimuli. Furthermore, the fabrication of multifunctional materials derived from diverse protein sources through controlled phase transitions is demonstrated.

Abstract
Biopolymer&#8208;based fibrous aggregate materials (BFAMs) have gained increasing attention in biomedicine due to their excellent biocompatibility, processability, biodegradability, and multifunctionality. Especially, the medical applications of BFAMs demand advanced structure, performance, and function, which conventional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods struggle to provide. This necessitates the rational selection of materials and manufacturing methods to design BFAMs with various intended functions and structures. This review summarizes the current progress in raw material selection, structural and functional design, processing technology, and application of BFAMs. Additionally, the challenges encountered during the development of BFAMs are discussed, along with perspectives for future research offered.

&lt;p&gt;Biopolymer-based fibrous aggregate materials (BFAMs) have gained increasing attention in biomedicine due to their excellent biocompatibility, processability, biodegradability, and multifunctionality. Especially, the medical applications of BFAMs demand advanced structure, performance, and function, which conventional trial-and-error methods struggle to provide. This necessitates the rational selection of materials and manufacturing methods to design BFAMs with various intended functions and structures. This review summarizes the current progress in raw material selection, structural and functional design, processing technology, and application of BFAMs. Additionally, the challenges encountered during the development of BFAMs are discussed, along with perspectives for future research offered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Artificial Intelligence and Multiscale Modeling for Sustainable Biopolymers and Bioinspired Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the multiscale architectures and functional mechanisms of biopolymers and bioinspired materials, from hierarchical structures to AI&#8208;powered methodologies. It covers sustainable configurations, multiscale modeling techniques, and AI applications for enhancing functionality, biodegradability, and design. The work concludes with a forward&#8208;looking perspective on biopolymer advancements and potential for broad lifecycle impacts in advanced material manufacturing.








Abstract
Biopolymers and bioinspired materials contribute to the construction of intricate hierarchical structures that exhibit advanced properties. The remarkable toughness and damage tolerance of such multilevel materials are conferred through the hierarchical assembly of their multiscale (i.e., atomistic to macroscale) components and architectures. Here, the functionality and mechanisms of biopolymers and bio&#8208;inspired materials at multilength scales are explored and summarized, focusing on biopolymer nanofibril configurations, biocompatible synthetic biopolymers, and bio&#8208;inspired composites. Their modeling methods with theoretical basis at multiple lengths and time scales are reviewed for biopolymer applications. Additionally, the exploration of artificial intelligence&#8208;powered methodologies is emphasized to realize improvements in these biopolymers from functionality, biodegradability, and sustainability to their characterization, fabrication process, and superior designs. Ultimately, a promising future for these versatile materials in the manufacturing of advanced materials across wider applications and greater lifecycle impacts is foreseen.

         <title>Autonomous Bioelectronic Devices Based on Silk Fibroin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the unique autonomous features of silk fibroin (SF), including self&#8208;healing, shape&#8208;morphing, and biodegradability, which enable its integration into bioelectronics. Key applications such as smart textiles, epidermal sensors, and adaptable implants are explored. The discussion addresses challenges in scalability, reproducibility, and bio&#8208;integration while presenting future directions for sustainable and multifunctional silk&#8208;based technologies.








Abstract
The development of autonomous bioelectronic devices capable of dynamically adapting to changing biological environments represents a significant advancement in healthcare and wearable technologies. Such systems draw inspiration from the precision, adaptability, and self&#8208;regulation of biological processes, requiring materials with intrinsic versatility and seamless bio&#8208;integration to ensure biocompatibility and functionality over time. Silk fibroin (SF) derived from Bombyx mori cocoons, has emerged as an ideal biomaterial with a unique combination of biocompatibility, mechanical flexibility, and tunable biodegradability. Adding autonomous features into SF, including self&#8208;healing, shape&#8208;morphing, and controllable degradation, enables dynamic interactions with living tissues while minimizing immune responses and mechanical mismatches. Additionally, structural tunability and environmental sustainability of SF further reinforce its potential as a platform for adaptive implants, epidermal electronics, and intelligent textiles. This review explores recent progress in understanding the structure&#8211;property relationships of SF, its modification strategies, and its great potential for integration into advanced autonomous bioelectronic systems while addressing challenges related to scalability, reproducibility, and multifunctionality. Future opportunities, such as AI&#8208;assisted material design, scalable fabrication techniques, and the incorporation of wireless and personalized technologies, are also discussed, positioning SF as a key material in bridging the gap between biological systems and artificial technologies.

         <title>Designing for Degradation: Transient Devices Enabled by (Nano)Cellulose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in transient devices enabled by (nano)cellulosic materials is reviewed. Transiency mechanisms, advantages of nanocelluloses, and a suite of applications are discussed. A circular thinking approach coupled with life cycle assessment is applied to critically revisit the potential, advantages, and challenges of nanocellulose&#8208;enabled transient devices for future materials innovation.








Abstract
Transient technology involves materials and devices that undergo controlled degradation after a reliable operation period. This groundbreaking strategy offers significant advantages over conventional devices based on non&#8208;renewable materials by limiting environmental exposure to potentially hazardous components after disposal, and by increasing material circularity. As the most abundant naturally occurring polymer on Earth, cellulose is an attractive material for this purpose. Besides, (nano)celluloses are inherently biodegradable and have competitive mechanical, optical, thermal, and ionic conductivity properties that can be exploited to develop sustainable devices and avoid the end&#8208;of&#8208;life issues associated with conventional systems. Despite its potential, few efforts have been made to review current advances in cellulose&#8208;based transient technology. Therefore, this review catalogs the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments in transient devices enabled by cellulosic materials. To provide a wide perspective, the various degradation mechanisms involved in cellulosic transient devices are introduced. The advanced capabilities of transient cellulosic systems in sensing, photonics, energy storage, electronics, and biomedicine are also highlighted. Current bottlenecks toward successful implementation are discussed, with material circularity and environmental impact metrics at the center. It is believed that this review will serve as a valuable resource for the proliferation of cellulose&#8208;based transient technology and its implementation into fully integrated, circular, and environmentally sustainable devices.

Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) play a crucial role in attaining sustainable energy for various wearable devices. Polymer materials are essential components of TENGs. Biopolymers are suitable materials for TENGs because of their degradability, natural sourcing, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, the latest progress in commonly used biopolymers and well&#8208;designed biomimetic techniques for TENG is summarized. The applications of natural rubber, polysaccharides, protein&#8208;based biopolymers, and other common synthetic biopolymers in TENG technology are summarized in detail. Each biopolymer is discussed based on its electrification capability, polarity variations, and specific functionalities as active and functional layers of TENGs. Important biomimetic strategies and related applications of specific biopolymers are also summarized to guide the structural and functional design of TENG. In the future, the study of triboelectric biopolymers may focus on exploring alternative candidates, enhancing charge density, and expanding functionality. Various possible applications of biopolymer&#8208;based TENGs are proposed in this review. By applying biopolymers and related biomimetic methods to TENG devices, the applications of TENG in the fields of healthcare, environmental monitoring, and wearable/implantable electronics can be further promoted.

Abstract
Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a representative biobased and biodegradable aliphatic polyester and a front&#8208;runner among sustainable materials. As a semicrystalline thermoplastic, PLA exhibits excellent mechanical and physical properties, attracting considerable attention in commodity and medical fields. Stereochemistry is a key factor affecting PLA's properties, and to this end, the engineering of PLA's microstructure for tailored material properties has been an active area of research over the decade. This Review first covers the basic structural variety of PLA. A perspective on the current states of stereocontrolled synthesis as well as the relationships between the structures and properties of PLA stereosequences are included, with an emphasis on record regularity and properties. At last, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art examples of high&#8208;performance PLA&#8208;based materials within an array of applications are given, including packaging, fibers, and textiles, healthcare and electronic devices. Among various stereo&#8208;regular sequences of PLA, poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) (PLLA) is the most prominent category and has myriad unique properties and applications. In this regard, cutting&#8208;edge applications of PLLA are mainly overviewed in this review. At the same time, new materials developed based on other PLA stereosequences are highlighted, which holds the potential to a wide variety of PLA&#8208;based sustainable materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a representative biobased and biodegradable aliphatic polyester and a front-runner among sustainable materials. As a semicrystalline thermoplastic, PLA exhibits excellent mechanical and physical properties, attracting considerable attention in commodity and medical fields. Stereochemistry is a key factor affecting PLA's properties, and to this end, the engineering of PLA's microstructure for tailored material properties has been an active area of research over the decade. This Review first covers the basic structural variety of PLA. A perspective on the current states of stereocontrolled synthesis as well as the relationships between the structures and properties of PLA stereosequences are included, with an emphasis on record regularity and properties. At last, state-of-the-art examples of high-performance PLA-based materials within an array of applications are given, including packaging, fibers, and textiles, healthcare and electronic devices. Among various stereo-regular sequences of PLA, poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) is the most prominent category and has myriad unique properties and applications. In this regard, cutting-edge applications of PLLA are mainly overviewed in this review. At the same time, new materials developed based on other PLA stereosequences are highlighted, which holds the potential to a wide variety of PLA-based sustainable materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Balancing high performance and environmental sustainability in advanced material innovation is a challenging task. Addressing the global challenges of sustainable development and carbon neutrality lead to increased&#160;interest in biopolymer research. Nanocellulose materials, derived from biopolymers, demonstrate potential as template candidates for advanced materials, due to their unique properties, including high strength, high surface area, controllable pore structures and high&#8208;water retention.

         <dc:description>
This review systematically examines biopolymers and their protective mechanisms for Li and Zn metal anodes. It covers key biopolymer types, structures, and properties, and explores their applications as artificial SEIs, electrolyte additives, separators, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes. The review highlights how these biopolymers enhance electrochemical performance and discusses current challenges and future research directions in this evolving field.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) and zinc (Zn) metals are emerging as promising anode materials for next&#8208;generation rechargeable metal batteries due to their excellent electronic conductivity and high theoretical capacities. However, issues such as uneven metal ion deposition and uncontrolled dendrite growth result in poor electrochemical stability, limited cycle life, and rapid capacity decay. Biopolymers, recognized for their abundance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, biodegradability, tunable structures, and adjustable properties, offer a compelling solution to these challenges. This review systematically and comprehensively examines biopolymers and their protective mechanisms for Li and Zn metal anodes. It begins with an overview of biopolymers, detailing key types, their structures, and properties. The review then explores recent advancements in the application of biopolymers as artificial solid electrolyte interphases, electrolyte additives, separators, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes, emphasizing how their structural properties enhance protection mechanisms and improve electrochemical performance. Finally, perspectives on current challenges and future research directions in this evolving field are provided.

Cellulose nanofiber (CNF) has unique intrinsic physical properties, showing great potential for constructing sustainable materials. This review introduces emerging CNF&#8208;based structural materials, including challenges in their assembly process and their exceptional mechanical and thermal properties. Based on the structural designability and functionalization characteristics of CNF&#8208;based structural materials, the potential applications and future trends are discussed.








Abstract
Under the guidance of the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, the urgency for green ecological construction and the depletion of nonrenewable resources highlight the importance of the research and development of sustainable new materials. Cellulose nanofiber (CNF) is the most abundant natural nanoscale building block widely existing on Earth. CNF has unique intrinsic physical properties, such as low density, low coefficient of thermal expansion, high strength, and high modulus, which is an ideal candidate with outstanding potential for constructing sustainable materials. In recent years, CNF&#8208;based structural material has emerged as a sustainable lightweight material with properties very different from traditional structural materials. Here, to comprehensively introduce the assembly of structural materials based on CNF, it starts with an overview of different forms of CNF&#8208;based materials, including fibers, films, hydrogels, aerogels, and structural materials. Next, the challenges that need to be overcome in preparing CNF&#8208;based structural materials are discussed, their assembly methods are introduced, and an in&#8208;depth analysis of the advantages of the CNF&#8208;based hydrogel assembly strategy to fabricate structural materials is conducted. Finally, the unique properties of emerging CNF&#8208;based structural materials are summarized and concluded with an outlook on their design and functionalization, potentially paving the way toward new opportunities.

&lt;p&gt;Cellulose nanofiber (CNF) has unique intrinsic physical properties, showing great potential for constructing sustainable materials. This review introduces emerging CNF-based structural materials, including challenges in their assembly process and their exceptional mechanical and thermal properties. Based on the structural designability and functionalization characteristics of CNF-based structural materials, the potential applications and future trends are discussed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the guidance of the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, the urgency for green ecological construction and the depletion of nonrenewable resources highlight the importance of the research and development of sustainable new materials. Cellulose nanofiber (CNF) is the most abundant natural nanoscale building block widely existing on Earth. CNF has unique intrinsic physical properties, such as low density, low coefficient of thermal expansion, high strength, and high modulus, which is an ideal candidate with outstanding potential for constructing sustainable materials. In recent years, CNF-based structural material has emerged as a sustainable lightweight material with properties very different from traditional structural materials. Here, to comprehensively introduce the assembly of structural materials based on CNF, it starts with an overview of different forms of CNF-based materials, including fibers, films, hydrogels, aerogels, and structural materials. Next, the challenges that need to be overcome in preparing CNF-based structural materials are discussed, their assembly methods are introduced, and an in-depth analysis of the advantages of the CNF-based hydrogel assembly strategy to fabricate structural materials is conducted. Finally, the unique properties of emerging CNF-based structural materials are summarized and concluded with an outlook on their design and functionalization, potentially paving the way toward new opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wearable electronics utilizing advanced carbon materials from fossil origins face issues like non&#8208;renewability, high energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions. Biopolymers present a sustainable alternative for carbon&#8208;based wearables. This review highlights the carbonization of key biopolymers&#8212;cellulose, lignin, chitin, and silk fibroin&#8212;discussing mechanisms, techniques, and applications of biopolymer&#8208;derived carbon materials in wearable technology.








Abstract
Advanced carbon materials are widely utilized in wearable electronics. Nevertheless, the production of carbon materials from fossil&#8208;based sources raised concerns regarding their non&#8208;renewability, high energy consumption, and the consequent greenhouse gas emissions. Biopolymers, readily available in nature, offer a promising and eco&#8208;friendly alternative as a carbon source, enabling the sustainable production of carbon materials for wearable electronics. This review aims to discuss the carbonization mechanisms, carbonization techniques, and processes, as well as the diverse applications of biopolymer&#8208;derived carbon materials (BioCMs) in wearable electronics. First, the characteristics of four representative biopolymers, including cellulose, lignin, chitin, and silk fibroin, and their carbonization processes are discussed. Then, typical carbonization techniques, including pyrolysis carbonization, laser&#8208;induced carbonization, Joule heating carbonization, hydrothermal transformation, and salt encapsulation carbonization are discussed. The influence of the processes on the morphology and properties of the resultant BioCMs are summarized. Subsequently, applications of BioCMs in wearable devices, including physical sensors, chemical sensors, energy devices, and display devices are discussed. Finally, the challenges currently facing the field and the future opportunities are discussed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents recent advancements in producing sustainable flame&#8208;retardant materials using biopolymers as additive agents, functional coatings, and structural matrices. The focus is on advanced applications for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, thermal insulation, and fire warning devices. Most of these applications utilize biopolymers derived from non&#8208;food sources such as cellulose, lignin, chitosan, and alginates obtained from plants and marine organisms.








Abstract
Polymeric materials featuring excellent flame retardancy are essential for applications requiring high levels of fire safety, while those based on biopolymers are highly favored due to their eco&#8208;friendly nature, sustainable characteristics, and abundant availability. This review first outlines the pyrolysis behaviors of biopolymers, with particular emphasis on naturally occurring ones derived from non&#8208;food sources such as cellulose, chitin/chitosan, alginate, and lignin. Then, the strategies for chemical modifications of biopolymers for flame&#8208;retardant purposes through covalent, ionic, and coordination bonds are presented and compared. The emphasis is placed on advanced methods for introducing biopolymer&#8208;based flame retardants into polymeric matrices and fabricating biopolymer&#8208;based flame&#8208;retardant materials. Finally, the challenges for sustaining the current momentum in the utilization of biopolymers for flame&#8208;retardant purposes are further discussed.

         <title>Hierarchical Engineering for Biopolymer&#8208;based Hydrogels with Tailored Property and Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, key strategies for designing biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels from the molecular to the macroscopic scale are summarized. Emphasis is placed on how molecular architecture, processing methods, and fabrication technologies converge to yield materials with tunable mechanical properties, dynamic responsiveness, and enhanced transport behaviors for diverse biomedical and technological applications. The unified approach guides future hydrogel developments.









Abstract
Biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels offer versatility in biomedical engineering due to their abundance, biocompatibility, tailorable properties, and environmental responsiveness. Realizing their full potential requires understanding the molecular&#8208;level design principles that govern their macroscopic behavior. This review analyzes recent advances in the molecular engineering of biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels, emphasizing innovative network design strategies and processing methods for precise control over material properties and functions. How molecular design influences hydrogel behavior across multiple length scales are explored, focusing on: 1) network design strategies: approaches like double networks, interpenetrating networks, and supramolecular assemblies to tailor mechanical and responsive properties; 2) processing techniques: methods such as Hofmeister effect&#8208;induced chain aggregating, cononsolvency&#8208;based porous structure controlling, and directional freezing&#8208;induced network alignment to achieve hierarchical and anisotropic structures. How these design principles and processing methods influence critical hydrogel properties like mechanical strength, inner mass transportation, and degradation are discussed. The review also covers advanced fabrication techniques that leverage these molecular engineering approaches to create complex, functional hydrogels. By elucidating the relationships between molecular architecture, processing methods, and resulting material properties, this work aims to provide a framework for designing next&#8208;generation biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels with enhanced performance and functionality across various applications.

         <title>An Implantable and Degradable Silk Sericin Protein Film Energy Harvester for Next&#8208;Generation Cardiovascular Electronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A piezoelectric film is created using structural engineered silk sericin, presenting satisfactory output performance, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. This piezoelectric film&#8208;based energy&#8208;harvester can illuminate LED or operate a portable electronic device through converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. It holds promise as a power source for delivering effective electrical stimulation to restore cardiac activity in asystole or normalize an AV block.








Abstract
Current cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) face a pressing clinical need for the development of battery&#8208;free, biodegradable, and biocompatible devices to mitigate the risk of adverse in vivo responses. To address this demand, it is proposed utilizing a natural biomaterial, silk sericin (SS), which exhibits valuable biological activities and contains abundant asymmetric amino acids with adjustable structures, to create an implantable self&#8208;powered system based on the piezoelectric principle. The functionalized SS&#8208;based (F&#8208;SS&#8208;based) piezoelectric film demonstrates a high longitudinal piezoelectric tensor (d33) of 12&#160;pC&#160;N&#8722;1. An energy&#8208;generating device (EG device) utilizing this piezoelectric film can generate electric energy under mechanical force both in vitro and in vivo. By manually tapping the EG&#8208;device for a few minutes, the accumulated electricity in a commercial capacitor (1.1&#160;&#181;F) could illuminate LEDs or operate a timer. Furthermore, the instantaneous energy power density (218.5&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;2) achieved by manual pressing the EG device is sufficient to deliver effective pacing to restart a non&#8208;beating heart or normalize an atrioventricular block in a preclinical model. Owing to its high biocompatibility and biodegradability in physiological environments, the F&#8208;SS&#8208;based EG device holds significant promise for the advancement of self&#8208;powered power systems for next&#8208;generation CIEDs and other implantable and degradable electronic devices.

         <title>Biopolymeric Ionotronics Based on Biodegradable Wool Keratin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pH&#8208;responsive wool keratin serves as the sole biopolymer matrix for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance ionotronic devices, without the use of toxic chemicals, complex synthesis, or grafting processes. Furthermore, the innate biodegradability of wool keratin makes it an environmentally friendly option, furthering the advancement of sustainable devices based on natural polymers.








Abstract
The advent of ionotronics has revealed significant potential in flexible transistors, energy harvesting, and unconventional circuits. However, most ionotronic devices, often centered around synthetic polymers, involve complex grafting or synthesis that raise legitimate concerns about their environmental sustainability. Herein, a simple yet versatile approach for developing single&#8208;composition ionotronic devices using wool keratin (WK), a biodegradable and pH&#8208;responsive natural polymer is presented. By employing facile pH regulation processes, WK molecules with opposing polarities are successfully modified, which are combined to form an ionic heterojunction through entropically driven depletion. This ionic heterojunction functions as an ionic diode, enabling efficient rectification of alternating current signals (with a rectification ratio of up to 199). Furthermore, the application of this biopolymeric ionotronic device is extended to mechanical energy harvesting, self&#8208;powered sensing, and ionic logic circuit. The biodegradability and renewability of WK offer a viable alternative to synthetic materials, highlighting its potential for sustainable applications.

         <title>Expanded Nanofibrous Cellulose Electrode Binder: Declustering Lithium Polysulfides for Lean&#8208;Electrolyte Li&#8210;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,2,6,6&#8208;Tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl radical (TEMPO)&#8208;oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCN) is presented as a class of expanded nanofibrous electrode binders for lean&#8208;electrolyte lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Owing to the increased active sites for intermolecular interaction with Li polysulfides (LiPS), the TOCN binder promotes the declustering of LiPS, thereby achieving a high cell&#8208;level energy density of 503 Wh kg&#8722;1 at a low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio of 2.0 &#181;L mgsulfur&#8722;1.








Abstract
Despite their potential as an alternative to commercial lithium (Li)&#8210;ion batteries, Li&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries face challenges related to energy density limitations caused by the considerable amount of electrolyte required. Lean electrolytes have proven effective in mitigating this issue. However, they tend to exacerbate Li polysulfides (LiPS) clustering, resulting in incomplete S utilization and sluggish conversion kinetics. Here, 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl radical (TEMPO)&#8208;oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCN) is presented as an expanded nanofibrous electrode binder for lean&#8208;electrolyte Li&#8210;S batteries. Owing to its 1D fibrous structure and expanded inter&#8208;glucose chain distance, the TOCN binder offers more accessible active sites for intermolecular interactions with LiPS. Consequently, LiPS cluster formation is effectively suppressed even at a low TOCN binder content of 1 wt%, while a high S loading of 72 wt% is achieved. The resulting S cathode with the TOCN binder enables Li&#8210;S cells to exhibit a remarkable specific capacity of 1221 mAh gsulfur&#8722;1 under constrained electrolyte conditions (low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio of 2.0&#160;&#181;L mgsulfur&#8722;1 and low density of 0.927&#160;g mL&#8722;1), yielding a high cell&#8208;level energy density of 503&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 that surpasses those of previously reported S cathodes based on conventional synthetic polymer binders.

         <title>The Structure&#8208;Mechanics Relationship of Bamboo&#8208;Epidermis and Inspired Composite Design by Artificial Intelligence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article investigates the micromechanics of bamboo epidermis, focusing on how anisotropic silica particle distributions enhance toughness. By integrating experimental imaging, 3D printing, and generative AI, the study develops bio&#8208;inspired particle&#8208;reinforced composites with mechanical properties akin to bamboo. The findings expand design possibilities for composites, offering innovative solutions for applications demanding high toughness and mechanical reliability.








Abstract
Bamboo culm has been widely used in engineering for its high strength, lightweight, and low cost. Its outermost epidermis is a smooth and dense layer that contains cellulose, silica particles, and stomata and acts as a water and mechanical barrier. Recent experimental studies have shown that the layer has a higher mechanical strength than other inside regions. Still, the mechanism is unclear, especially for how the low silica concentration (&lt;10%) can effectively reinforce the layer and prevent the inner fibers from splitting. Here, theoretical analysis is combined with experimental imaging and 3D printing to investigate the effect of the distribution of silica particles on composite mechanics. The anisotropic partial distribution function of silica particles in bamboo skin yields higher toughness (&gt;10%) than randomly distributed particles. A generative artificial intelligence (AI) model inspired by bamboo epidermis is developed to generate particle&#8208;reinforced composites. Besides the visual similarity, it is found that the samples by the generative model show failure processes and fracture toughness identical to the actual bamboo epidermis. This work reveals the micromechanics of the bamboo epidermis. It illustrates that generative AI can help design bio&#8208;inspired composites of a complex structure that cannot be uniformly represented by a simple building block or optimized around local boundaries. It expands the design space of particle&#8208;reinforced composites for enhanced toughness modulus, offering advantages in industries where mechanical reliability is critical.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;Dependent Vibrational Dynamics and Phonon Transport in Nanocellulose Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uptake of water in cellulose play an important role in modulating the structure and phonon transport. This study reports how moisture&#8208;dependent structural modification relates to the vibrational dynamics and phonon transport and scattering of nanocellulose using inelastic neutron scattering and wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering. Phonon transport is controlled by the moisture&#8208;induced increase of the coherence length and swelling of the foam walls.








Abstract
Superinsulating nanofibrillar cellulose foams have the potential to replace fossil&#8208;based insulating materials, but the development is hampered by the moisture&#8208;dependent heat transport and the lack of direct measurements of phonon transport. Here, inelastic neutron scattering is used together with wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering (WAXS) and small angle neutron scattering to relate the moisture&#8208;dependent structural modifications to the vibrational dynamics and phonon transport and scattering of cellulose nanofibrils from wood and tunicate, and wood cellulose nanocrystals (W&#8208;CNC). The moisture interacted primarily with the disordered regions in nanocellulose, and WAXS showed that the crystallinity and coherence length increased as the moisture content increased. The phonon population derived from directional&#8208;dependent phonon density of states (GDOS) increased along the cellulose chains in W&#8208;CNC between 5 and 8 wt% D2O, while the phonon population perpendicular to the chains remained&#160;relatively unaffected, suggesting that the effect of increased crystallinity and coherence length on phonon transport is compensated by the moisture&#8208;induced swelling of the foam walls. Frequency scaling in the low&#8208;energy GDOS showed that materials based on hygroscopic and semicrystalline nanocellulose falls in between the predicted behavior for solids and liquids. Phonon&#8208;engineering of hygroscopic biopolymer&#8208;based insulation materials is promoted by the insights on the moisture&#8208;dependent phonon&#160;transport.

         <title>Biomimetic Intrafibrillar Mineralization of Hierarchically Structured Amyloid&#8208;Like Fibrils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Hierarchically Structured Amyloid&#8208;like Fibrils (HSAF), prepared through a mechanically directed two&#8208;step transformation of a protein nanofilm, exhibit an ordered, dynamic layered structure with adaptive gaps that facilitate intrafibrillar mineralization. The mineralized HSAF mimics biological hard tissues with ordered protein&#8208;hydroxyapatite organization, and demonstrates exceptional bioactivity in promoting native bone growth and further intrafibrillar mineralization.









Abstract
Intrafibrillar mineralization is essential not only as a fundamental process in forming biological hard tissues but also as a foundation for developing advanced composite fibril&#8208;based materials for innovative applications. Traditionally, only natural collagen fibrils have been shown to enable intrafibrillar mineralization, presenting a challenge in designing ordered hierarchical fibrils from common protein aggregation that exhibit similar high intrafibrillar mineralization activity. In this study, a mechanically directed two&#8208;step transformation method is developed that converts phase&#8208;transitioned protein nanofilms into crystalline, hierarchical amyloid&#8208;like fibrils with multilayer structures, which effectively control the growth and lateral organization of hydroxyapatite within adaptive gaps. The resulting mineralized HSAF achieves a hardness of 0.616 &#177;&#160;0.007&#160;GPa and a modulus of 19.06 &#177;&#160;3.54 GPa&#8212;properties closely resembling native hard tissues&#8212;and exhibits exceptionally high bioactivity in promoting both native bone tissue growth and further intrafibrillar mineralization, achieving 76.9% repair in a mice cranial defect model after 8 weeks and outperforming other regenerative materials. This remarkable performance, stemming from the unique structure and composition of the fibers, positions HSAF as a promising candidate for biomedical and engineering applications. These findings advance the understanding of biomineralization mechanisms and establish a foundation for developing high&#8208;bioactivity materials for hard tissue regeneration.

         <title>Living Fiber Dispersions from Mycelium as a New Sustainable Platform for Advanced Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living fiber dispersions (LFD) from mycelium and their extracellular materials are prepared by a facile three&#8208;roll milling process. These dispersions can be easily converted into a wide array of multifunctional living materials. These living materials display increased emulsion stability, enhanced mechanical properties, superhydrophobicity, and instantaneous proximity sensing as a result of fungal growth.








Abstract
Functional biopolymeric fibers are key building blocks for developing sustainable materials within the growing bioeconomy. However, their flexible use in emerging advanced materials with smart properties typically requires processing methods that may compromise sustainability. Here, a sustainable route to generate living fiber dispersions (LFD) from mycelium that combines the excellent material&#8208;forming properties of biopolymeric fibers, and the highly dynamic properties of living materials is proposed. This is showcased by using industrially available liquid culture and mechanical defibrillation methods to generate well&#8208;dispersed living mycelium fibers. These fibers can form materials where precursors with good dispersibility and network formation properties are paramount and can harness dynamic properties through growth even in the absence of added nutrients. This is demonstrated in unique living emulsions with 3.6x slower phase separation and in living films with 2.5x higher tensile strength upon growth, the latter vastly outperforming the strongest pure mycelium materials to date. Further, humidity can be used to modulate mechanical properties and to trigger the superhydrophobic patterning of substrates, mechanical actuation, and degradation of lignocellulosic consumer goods at their end of life. In the future, combining synthetic biology with this promising platform for smart materials can expand the horizons for sustainable material manufacturing.

A generalizable molecular engineering methodology is developed to transform diverse biomass feedstocks, such as cellulose, starch, and chitosan, into efficient hydrogel sorbents for atmospheric water harvesting (AWH). Outdoor tests reveal a water production rate of up to 14.19&#160;kg kg&#8315;&#185; day&#8315;&#185;, demonstrating significant potential for sustainable water solutions. This approach advances scalable AWH technologies by leveraging abundant, environmentally friendly resources.








Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) offers a promising pathway to alleviate global water scarcity, highlighting the need for environmentally responsible sorbent materials. In this context, this research introduces a universal strategy for transforming natural polysaccharides into effective hydrogel sorbents, demonstrated with cellulose, starch, and chitosan. The methodology unites alkylation to graft thermoresponsive groups, thereby enhancing water processability and enabling energy&#8208;efficient water release at lower temperatures, with the integration of zwitterionic groups to ensure stable and effective water sorption. The molecularly functionalized cellulose hydrogel, exemplifying our approach, shows favorable water uptake of 0.86&#8211;1.32&#160;g g&#8722;1 at 15&#8211;30% relative humidity (RH), along with efficient desorption, releasing 95% of captured water at 60 &#176;C. Outdoor tests highlight the water production rate of up to 14.19&#160;kg kg&#8722;1 day&#8722;1 by electrical heating. The proposed molecular engineering methodology, which expands the range of raw materials by leveraging abundant biomass feedstock, has the potential to advance sorbent production and scalable AWH technologies, contributing to sustainable solutions.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silk fibroin ionic touchscreen platform with high elasticity, high environmental tolerance, and biodegradability, is introduced for sustainable flexible electronics. This study showcases the platform's environmental stability, reusability, and advanced applications in IoT and AI&#8208;enhanced interfaces, such as real&#8208;time touch sensing, handwriting recognition, and virtual reality, paving the way for greener next&#8208;generation devices.








Abstract
The increasing prevalence of electronic devices has led to a significant rise in electronic waste (e&#8208;waste), necessitating the development of sustainable materials for flexible electronics. In this study, silk fibroin ionic touch screen (SFITS) is introduced, a new platform integrating natural silk fibroin (SF) with ionic conductors to create highly elastic, environmentally stable, and multifunctional touch interfaces. Through a humidity&#8208;induced crystallization strategy, the molecular structure of SF is precisely controlled to achieve a balanced combination of mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and biodegradability. The assembly and operational reliability of SFITS are demonstrated under various environmental conditions, along with their reusability through green recycling methods. Additionally, the intelligent design and application of SFITS are explored by incorporating Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. This integration enables real&#8208;time touch sensing, handwriting recognition, and advanced human&#8208;computer interactions. The versatility of SFITS is further exemplified through applications in remote control systems, molecular model generation, and virtual reality interfaces. The findings highlight the potential of sustainable ionic conductors in next&#8208;generation flexible electronics, offering a path toward greener and more intelligent device designs.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Shearing Chemistry Directed Closed&#8208;Pore Regeneration in Biomass&#8208;Derived Hard Carbons for Ultrafast Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an innovative DES cell&#8208;shearing strategy to tailor the closed&#8208;pore structure in bamboo&#8208;derived hard carbons. The optimized structure with appropriate closed&#8208;pore size (&#8764;2nm) and ultra&#8208;thin (1&#8211;3 layers) walls exhibits abundant active sites and delivers rapid ion diffusion kinetics and high reaction reversibility. This work significantly advances the applications of biomass materials for energy storage.








Abstract
The closed&#8208;pore structure of hard carbons holds the key to high plateau capacity and rapid diffusion kinetics when applied as sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) anodes. However, understanding and establishing the structure&#8208;electrochemistry relationship still remains a significant challenge. This work, for the first time, introduces an innovative deep eutectic solvent (DES) cell&#8208;shearing strategy to precisely tailor the cell structure of natural bamboo and consequently the closed&#8208;pore in its derived hard carbons. The DES shearing force effectively modifies the pore architecture by simultaneously shearing and dissolving amorphous components to form closed pore cores with adjustable sizes, as well as disintegrating crystalline cellulose through generation of competing hydrogen bonds to elaborately tune the pore wall thickness and ordering. The optimized closed&#8208;pore structure featuring appropriate pore size (&#8764;2 nm) and ultra&#8208;thin (1&#8211;3 layers) disordered pore walls, exhibits abundant active sites and delivers rapid ion diffusion kinetics and high reaction reversibility. Consequently, a high reversible capacity of 422 mAh g&#8722;1 at 30 mA g&#8722;1 along with an exceptional rate capability (318.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 6 A g&#8722;1) are achieved, outperforming almost all previous reported hard carbons. The new concept of cell&#8208;shearing chemistry for closed&#8208;pore regeneration significantly advances the applications of biomass materials for energy storage.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reinforcing Ionogel Bioadhesive Interface for Robust Integration and Monitoring of Bioelectronic Devices with Hard Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silk&#8208;based self&#8208;reinforcing ionogel shows good adhesion performance on biological hard tissues, common bioelectrode materials, and hard biomaterials. It can be assembled with the gold resonant circuit to form a wireless sensor to monitor the wound&#8208;healing process of biological hard tissues.








Abstract
Integrating bioelectronic devices with hard tissues, such as bones and teeth, is essential for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. However, stable and durable adhesion in dynamic, moist environments remains challenging. Traditional bioadhesives often fail to maintain strong bonds, especially when interfacing with metal electrodes and hard tissues. This study introduces a self&#8208;reinforcing ionogel bioadhesive interface (IGBI) combining silk fibroin and calcium ions, designed to provide robust and conductive integration of bioelectronic devices with hard tissues. The IGBI exhibits strong adhesion (up to 186&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2) and undergoes mechanical self&#8208;reinforcement through a structural transition in silk fibroin under physiological conditions. In vivo experiments demonstrate the IGBI's effectiveness in repairing bone defects and reimplanting teeth, with the added capability of wireless, real&#8208;time monitoring of bone healing. This approach allows for continuous tracking of tissue regeneration without a second invasive surgery for device removal. The IGBI represents a significant advancement in bioelectronic integration, offering a durable and versatile solution for challenging environments. Such unique self&#8208;reinforcing properties make the IGBI a promising material for biomedical applications where traditional adhesives are insufficient.

         <title>Bioinspired Nanochitin&#8208;Based Porous Constructs for Light&#8208;Driven Whole&#8208;Cell Biotransformations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetically cross&#8208;linked nanochitin cryogels are used for immobilization matrix for a solid&#8208;state cell factory. The resulting cryogels with hierarchical porosity manage to overcome the conventional limitations of mass transfer and light transmittance, as demonstrated by a number of light&#8208;driven biotransformation reactions.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state photosynthetic cell factories (SSPCFs) are a new production concept that leverages the innate photosynthetic abilities of microbes to drive the production of valuable chemicals. It addresses practical challenges such as high energy and water demand and improper light distribution associated with suspension&#8208;based culturing; however, these systems often face significant challenges related to mass transfer. The approach focuses on overcoming these limitations by carefully engineering the microstructure of the immobilization matrix through freeze&#8208;induced assembly of nanochitin building blocks. The use of nanochitins with optimized size distribution enabled the formation of macropores with lamellar spatial organization, which significantly improves light transmittance and distribution, crucial for maximizing the efficiency of photosynthetic reactions. The biomimetic crosslinking strategy, leveraging specific interactions between polyphosphate anions and primary amine groups featured on chitin fibers, produced mechanically robust and wet&#8208;resilient cryogels that maintained their functionality under operational conditions. Various model biotransformation reactions leading to value&#8208;added chemicals are performed in chitin&#8208;based matrix. It demonstrates superior or comparable performance to existing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art matrices and suspension&#8208;based systems. The findings suggest that chitin&#8208;based cryogel approach holds significant promise for advancing the development of solid&#8208;state photosynthetic cell factories, offering a scalable solution to improve the efficiency and productivity of light&#8208;driven biotransformation.

         <title>SciAgents: Automating Scientific Discovery Through Bioinspired Multi&#8208;Agent Intelligent Graph Reasoning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SciAgents AI model drives hypothesis generation by harnessing multi&#8208;agent graph reasoning, extracting insights from knowledge graphs constructed from scientific papers. Each agent plays a specific role: the Ontologist defines concepts, the Scientists draft and refine proposals, and the Critic reviews. Together, these agents create data&#8208;driven, innovative research ideas, advancing beyond traditional, human&#8208;led approaches.








Abstract
A key challenge in artificial intelligence (AI) is the creation of systems capable of autonomously advancing scientific understanding by exploring novel domains, identifying complex patterns, and uncovering previously unseen connections in vast scientific data. In this work, SciAgents, an approach that leverages three core concepts is presented: (1) large&#8208;scale ontological knowledge graphs to organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts, (2) a suite of large language models (LLMs) and data retrieval tools, and (3) multi&#8208;agent systems with in&#8208;situ learning capabilities. Applied to biologically inspired materials, SciAgents reveals hidden interdisciplinary relationships that were&#160;previously considered unrelated, achieving a scale, precision, and exploratory power that surpasses human research methods. The framework autonomously generates and refines research hypotheses, elucidating underlying mechanisms, design principles, and unexpected material properties. By integrating these capabilities in a modular fashion, the system yields material discoveries, critiques and improves existing hypotheses, retrieves up&#8208;to&#8208;date data about existing research, and highlights strengths and limitations. This is achieved by harnessing a &#8220;swarm of intelligence&#8221; similar to biological systems, providing new avenues for discovery. How this model accelerates the development of advanced materials by unlocking Nature's design principles, resulting in a new biocomposite with enhanced mechanical properties and improved sustainability through energy&#8208;efficient production is shown.

         <title>Sustainable Smart Packaging from Protein Nanofibrils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart packaging can extend shelf life and improve food quality monitoring. This study introduces a novel smart packaging solution using amyloid fibrils and red radish anthocyanins to monitor seafood spoilage. These findings show that these films effectively indicate shrimp freshness and possess high antibacterial and antioxidant properties, offering a sustainable approach to food packaging.








Abstract
Smart packaging technologies are revolutionizing the food industry by extending shelf life and enhancing quality monitoring through environmental responsiveness. Here, a novel smart packaging concept is presented, based on amyloid fibrils (AM) and red radish anthocyanins (RRA), to effectively monitor food spoilage by color change. A protein nanofibrils biofilm is developed from whey protein, which is functionalized with RRA to endow the resulting films with advanced monitoring capabilities. A comprehensive characterization, including pH responsiveness, water vapor permeability, thermal and mechanical testing, and colorimetric responses, demonstrates the superiority of AM/RRA films compared to control films based on whey monomer building blocks. The findings indicate that the AM/RRA films can effectively monitor, for example, shrimp freshness, showing visible changes within one day at room temperature and significant alterations in color after two days. Furthermore, these films exhibit high antibacterial and antioxidant activities, reinforcing their suitability for efficient food packaging. By integrating bio&#8208;based materials from whey and natural anthocyanins, this research presents a biodegradable, sustainable, and cost&#8208;effective smart packaging solution, contributing to eco&#8208;friendly innovations in food preservation.

         <title>Low&#8208;Cost Hyperelastic Fuller&#8208;Dome&#8208;Structured Nanocellulose Aerogels by Dual Templates for Personal Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost mechanically ultra&#8208;resilient cellulose&#8208;based aerogel with Fuller&#8208;dome&#8208;like structure is developed by a dual&#8208;template strategy. The aerogel shows a desired cost&#8208;performance combination of low density, hypereslaticity, superhydrophobicity, ultralow thermal conductivity, and low cost, making it hold great promise as a thermal retention material for personal thermal management.








Abstract
It is critically important to maintain the body's thermal comfort for human beings in extremely cold environments. Cellulose nanofibers (CNF)&#8208;based aerogels represent a promising sustainable material for body's heat retention because of their renewability and low thermal conductivity. However, CNF&#8208;based aerogels often suffer high production costs due to expensive CNF, poor elasticity and/or unsatisfactory thermal insulation owing to improper microstructure design. Here, a facile dual&#8208;template strategy is reported to prepare a low&#8208;cost, hyperelastic, superhydrophobic Fuller&#8208;dome&#8208;structured CNF aerogel (CNF@PU) with low thermal conductivity. The combination of air template by foaming process and ice template enables the formation of a dome&#8208;like microstructure of CNF@PU aerogel, in which CNF serves as rope bars while inexpensive polyurethane (PU) acts as joints. The aerogel combines ultra&#8208;elasticity, low thermal conductivity (24&#160;mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), and low costs. The as&#8208;prepared CNF@PU aerogel demonstrates much better heat retention than commercial thermal retention fillers (e.g., Flannelette and goose down), promising its great commercial potential for massively producing warming garments. This work provides a facile approach for creating high&#8208;performance aerogels with tailored microstructure for effective personal thermal management.

         <title>Spray&#8208;Assisted Fabrication of Cellulose Photonic Pigments on Superhydrophobic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to directly produce structurally colored microparticles by drying cholesteric cellulose nanocrystal microdroplets on a superhydrophobic surface is reported. This approach has several key advantages that can unlock large&#8208;scale fabrication of sustainable photonic pigments, including exploiting existing industrial techniques (e.g. aerosolization), reduction in chemicals required (e.g. surfactants), rapid production times (&#8776;40 min or less), and size&#8208;independent and robust color.









Abstract
Photonic pigments, especially those based on naturally&#8208;derived building blocks like cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), are emerging as a promising sustainable alternative to absorption&#8208;based colorants. However, the proposed manufacturing methods for CNC pigments, via either grinding films or emulsion&#8208;based production, usually require several processing steps. This limits their commercialization by increasing the costs, timescales, and environmental impacts of production. Toward addressing these challenges, it is reported that photonic pigments can be produced in a single process by drying microdroplets of aqueous CNC suspension on a superhydrophobic surface. Such liquid&#8208;repellent substrate ensures the microdroplets maintain a near&#8208;spherical shape, enabling the radial self&#8208;organization of the cholesteric phase. Upon drying under ambient conditions, the CNC mesophase becomes kinetically arrested, after which the strong capillary forces induced by water evaporation result in extensive buckling of the microparticle. This buckling, coupled with prior tuning of the CNC formulation, enables photonic pigments with adjustable color across the visible spectrum. Importantly, the elimination of an emulsifying oil phase to create microdroplets enables a much faster drying time (&#8776;40 min) and improved color stability (e.g., polar solvents, elevated temperatures), while the reduction in reagents (e.g., oils, surfactants) and post&#8208;processing steps (e.g., solvent, heat) improves the sustainability of the fabrication process.

Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) represent a promising technology for energy harvesting and self&#8208;powered sensing with a wide range of applications. Despite their potential, challenges such as the need for cost&#8208;effective, large&#8208;area electrodes and engineering sustainable triboelectric materials remain, especially given the impending restrictions on single&#8208;use engineering plastics in Europe. To address these challenges, engineering nano&#8208;graphite&#8208;coated paper is presented as a sustainable and high&#8208;performance alternative for triboelectric layers. Moreover, this material, which can be produced on an industrial scale, offers a viable replacement for metal electrodes. The combination of nano&#8208;graphite and paper, with its large contact area and inherent surface roughness, enables ultra&#8208;high power densities exceeding 14 kW&#160;m&#8722;2, driven by electrostatic discharge at the surface. Beyond energy harvesting, smart sensors are developed for floors and walls that detect movements for security purposes and smart sheets that monitor body movements and physiological activities during sleep. The findings highlight the potential of this engineering paper to serve as an eco&#8208;friendly alternative to engineering plastics in TENGs and electrodes, opening new avenues for future applications.

         <title>Environmental Sustainability of Natural Biopolymer&#8208;Based Electrolytes for Lithium Ion Battery Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twenty&#8208;one biopolymer electrolytes including membrane&#8208;liquid electrolytes, gel electrolytes, and solid electrolytes are synthesized to analyze their electrochemical properties and environmental impacts through life cycle assessment. This consistent and comparable study demonstrates the significant functional and environmental benefits of biopolymer electrolytes for batteries, guiding academia and industry in fundamental studies and applied implementation of sustainable bio&#8208;based polymers and biopolymer electrolytes.








Abstract
Biopolymer based electrolytes can overcome current performance limitations of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Biopolymers enable electrolytes with high ionic conductivities and wide electrochemical stability windows. While the biobased character of natural materials is claimed as an inherent advantage in meeting current environmental sustainability challenges, further research is required to quantify and compare their environmental impacts as electrolytes. The challenge is addressed by identifying the most promising biopolymer electrolytes for LIBs, measuring ionic conductivities and electrochemical stability windows, and quantifying environmental impacts using life cycle assessment. The environmental impacts of the cost to isolate cellulose derivatives, nanocelluloses, chitin/nanochitin, chitosan, lignin, agar, and silk are reported for climate change, acidification, freshwater ecotoxicity, marine eutrophication, human toxicity, and water use. Material criticality, circularity index, and material circularity indicator, emerging impact categories are prioritized to help integrate biopolymers into circular and sustainable materials. The electrochemical properties and environmental impacts of natural biopolymer membrane&#8208;liquid electrolyte pairs, gel electrolytes, and solid electrolytes are quantified and benchmarked against conventional fossil&#8208;based electrolytes, providing consistent and comparable electrochemical properties of the most relevant biopolymer electrolytes fabricated so far. This study highlights the significant functional and environmental benefits of biopolymer electrolytes and identifies the most electrochemically competitive biopolymer electrolytes in LIBs.

         <title>Nanocellulose&#8208;Derived Hierarchical Carbon Framework&#8208;Supported P&#8208;Doped MoO2 Nanoparticles for Optimizing Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using nanocellulose as a building block, P&#8208;doped MoO2&#8722;x nanoparticles anchored on N, P co&#8208;doped porous carbon are constructed by in situ polymerization and hydrothermal treatment combined with phosphorylation. When being used for modifying the commercial separator of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, the composite provides abundant catalytic active sites and rapid ion accessibility. The assembled cell achieves an initial specific capacity of 11.3 mAh cm&#8722;2 at a sulfur loading of 8.1 mg cm&#8722;2 under lean electrolyte conditions.








Abstract
The integration of nanocatalysts into the separators of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) boosts the polysulfide conversion efficiency. However, the aggregation of catalyst nanoparticles diminishes the active surface area. Moreover, densely packed catalyst&#8208;modified layers often hinder ion transport rates and impede access to the catalytic sites. To overcome these challenges, a strategy is reported for modifying commercial separators, using wood nanocellulose as a building block to construct hierarchical P&#8208;doped MoO2&#8722;x nanoparticles anchored on N, P co&#8208;doped porous carbon (P&#8208;MoO2&#8722;x/NPC). The web&#8208;like entangled nanocellulose forms a framework for the in situ polymerization of polyaniline, providing abundant anchoring sites for MoO2 nanoparticles. The addition of P atoms optimizes the d&#8208;band center of MoO2 and enhances the catalytic activity of polysulfide conversion. The LSBs assembled using a P&#8208;MoO2&#8722;x/NPC coated polypropylene separator display an initial discharge capacity of 1621 mAh g&#8722;1 and rate performance of 774 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 C. Even with a sulfur loading of 8.1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and lean electrolyte conditions, the cell achieves an initial areal capacity of 11.3 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 0.1 C. This work provides a biopolymer nanofiber solution for constructing LSB separators with advanced electrochemical reactivity.

         <title>A Bio&#8208;Inspired Perspective on Materials Sustainability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective discusses natural materials as inspiration for sustainable engineering designs and the processing of materials. First, circularity, longevity, parsimony, and activity are presented as essential material paradigms. The perspective then uses many examples of natural and technical materials to introduce principles such as oligo&#8208;materiality, multifunctionality, modularity, defect tolerance, remodeling, healing, adaptivity, as well as controlled disintegration.








Abstract
The article explores materials sustainability through a bio&#8208;inspired lens and discusses paradigms that can reshape the understanding of material synthesis, processing, and usage. It addresses various technological fields, from structural engineering to healthcare, and emphasizes natural material cycles as a blueprint for efficient recycling and reuse. The study shows that material functionality depends on both chemical composition and structural modifications, which emphasizes the role of material processing. The article identifies strategies such as mono&#8208;materiality and multifunctionality, and explores how responsivity, adaptivity, modularity, and cellularity can simplify material assembly and disassembly. Bioinspired strategies for reusing materials, defect tolerance, maintenance, remodeling, and healing may extend product lifespans. The principles of circularity, longevity, and parsimony are reconsidered in the context of &#8220;active materiality&#8221;, a dynamic bio&#8208;inspired paradigm. This concept expands the traditional focus of material science from structure&#8208;function relationships to include the development of materials capable of responding or adapting to external stimuli. Concrete examples demonstrate how bio&#8208;inspired strategies are being applied in engineering and technology to enhance the sustainability of materials. The article concludes by emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration as a key factor for developing a sustainable and resilient materials economy in harmony with nature's material cycles.

Wood and cellulose are the most abundant and important sustainable materials on the planet at the disposal to solve major societal challenges. This perspective, written for all materials scientists, highlights how breakthroughs in cellulose nanotechnology combined with functional nanomaterials can revolutionize important areas like construction, electronics, recycling, and intelligent materials at scale, toward a sustainable future.








Abstract
Wood, with its constituent building block cellulose, is by far the most common biomaterial on the planet and has been the most important material used by humans to establish civilization. If there is one single biomaterial that should be studied and used by materials scientists across disciplines to achieve a sustainable future, it is cellulose. This perspective provides insights for the general materials science community about the unique properties of wood and cellulose and how they may be used in advanced sustainable materials to make a substantial societal impact. The focus is on sawn wood or cellulose fibers produced at scale by industry and the more recent cellulosic nanomaterials, highlighting the areas where these cellulose&#8208;based materials can be valorized into higher&#8208;order functions. Numerous articles have comprehensively reviewed different areas where cellulose is currently used in advanced materials science. The objective here is to provide general insight for all material scientists and to provide the opinions about the areas in which cellulose and wood have the largest potential to make a significant societal impact, especially to realize next&#8208;generation sustainable materials for construction, food, water, energy, and information. Discussing key areas where future research is needed to open avenues toward a more sustainable future is ended.
