         <title>Designing Rewritable Dual&#8208;Mode Patterns using a Stretchable Photoresponsive Polymer via Orthogonal Photopatterning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two patterns are observed in one film! Orthogonal photopatterning is developed to fabricate dual&#8208;mode patterns in stretchable azopolymers that exhibit photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transitions. The dual&#8208;mode pattern contains photonic and chromatic polarization patterns, which do not interfere with each other. The dual&#8208;mode patterns are rewritable and reprocessable. They are promising materials for anti&#8208;counterfeiting, information storage, and encryption applications.








Abstract
The fabrication of dual&#8208;mode patterns in the same region of a material is a promising approach for high&#8208;density information storage, new anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies, and highly secure encryption. However, dual&#8208;mode patterns are difficult to achieve because the two patterns in one material may interfere with each other during fabrication and usage. The development of noninterfering dual&#8208;mode patterns requires new materials and patterning techniques. Herein, a novel orthogonal photopatterning technique is reported for the fabrication of noninterfering dual&#8208;mode patterns on an azopolymer P1. P1 is a unique material that exhibits both photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transitions and good stretchability. In the first step of orthogonal photopatterning, patterned photonic structures are fabricated on a P1 film via masked nanoimprinting controlled by photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transitions. In the second step, the P1 film is stretched and irradiated with polarized light through a photomask, which generates a chromatic polarization pattern. In particular, the photonic structures and chromatic polarization in the dual&#8208;mode pattern are noninterfering. Another feature of dual&#8208;mode patterns is that they are rewritable via photo&#8208;, thermal, or solution reprocessing, which are useful for recycling and reprogramming. This study opens an avenue for the development of novel materials and techniques for photopatterning.

         <title>Stable and Bright Electroluminescent Devices utilizing Emissive 0D Perovskite Nanocrystals Incorporated in a 3D CsPbBr3 Matrix</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly luminescent 0D Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals are incorporated into 3D CsPbBr3 films&#160;to form single&#8208;layer perovskite light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells. The 0D Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals improve the maximum luminance to 11&#8239;200&#160;cd m&#8722;2, the power efficiency to 33.0 Lm W&#8722;1, the external quantum efficiency to 8.3%, and the operational stability to 129 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The 0D cesium lead halide perovskite Cs4PbBr6 has drawn remarkable interest due to its highly efficient robust green emission compared to its 3D CsPbBr3 counterpart. However, seizing the advantages of the superior photoluminescence properties for practical light&#8208;emitting devices remains elusive. To date, Cs4PbBr6 has been employed only as a higher&#8208;bandgap nonluminescent matrix to passivate or provide quantum/dielectric confinement to CsPbBr3 in light&#8208;emitting devices and to enhance its photo&#8208;/thermal/environmental stability. To resolve this disparity, a novel solvent engineering method to incorporate highly luminescent 0D Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals (perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs)) into a 3D CsPbBr3 film, forming the active emissive layer in single&#8208;layer perovskite light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (PeLECs) is designed. A dramatic increase of the maximum external quantum efficiency and luminance from 2.7% and 6050&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for a 3D&#8208;only PeLEC to 8.3% and 11&#8239;200&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for a 3D&#8211;0D PNC device with only 7% by weight of 0D PNCs is observed. The majority of this increase is driven by the efficient inherent emission of the 0D PNCs, while the concomitant morphology improvement also contributes to reduced leakage current, reduced hysteresis, and enhanced operational lifetime (half&#8208;life of 129 h), making this one of the best&#8208;performing LECs reported to date.

         <title>Multiple&#8208;Resonance Extension and Spin&#8208;Vibronic Coupling Based Narrowband Blue Organic Fluorescence Emitters with over 30% Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Achieving narrow&#8208;bandwidth emission and high external quantum efficiency (EQE) simultaneously has been a challenge for next&#8208;generation blue&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this study, we developed novel multiple&#8208;resonance thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters by fusing an indolocarbazole unit with two carbazole skeletons using para&#8208;oriented nitrogen atoms. The resulting rigid and planar &#960;&#8208;system without electron&#8208;accepting atoms exhibits pure blue photoluminescence at 470&#160;nm, reaching a 100% quantum yield with a full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 25&#160;nm. Higher&#8208;level quantum chemistry calculations confirmed an multiple&#8208;resonance (MR) effect within the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and an enhanced triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet crossover (104 s&#8722;1) through a reduced energy gap (&#916;EST) coupled with large spin&#8208;vibronic coupling mediated by low&#8208;lying triplet excited states. An OLED fabricated using the MR&#8208;TADF emitter with CIE color coordinates of (0.12, 0.16) exhibits a record high EQE of 30.9% and a small FWHM of 23&#160;nm. With further optimization of the device structure, we achieved a high EQE of 33.8% without additional outcoupling enhancements owing to the near&#8208;perfect horizontal alignment of the emitting dipoles.

         <title>Superior Fast Charging Lithium Ion Batteries Enabled by High Speed Solid State Lithium Transport of Intermetallic Cu6Sn5 Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Superior fast charging is a desirable capability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which can make electric vehicles a strong competition to traditional fuel vehicles. However, the slow transport of solvated lithium ions in liquid electrolytes is a limiting factor. Here, we report a LixCu6Sn5 intermetallic network to address this issue. Based on electrochemical analysis and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy mapping, we demonstrate that the reported intermetallic network can form a high&#8208;speed solid&#8208;state lithium transport matrix throughout the electrode, which largely reduces the polarization effect in the graphite anode. Employing this design, we fabricated superior fast&#8208;charging graphite/lithium cobalt oxide full cells and tested them under strict electrode conditions. At the charging rate of 6 C, the fabricated full cells showed a capacity of 145 mAh g&#8722;1 with an extraordinary capacity retention of 96.6%. In addition, the full cell also exhibits good electrochemical stability at a high charging rate of 2 C over 100 cycles (96.0% of capacity retention) in comparison to traditional graphite anode based cell (86.1% of capacity retention). This work presents a new strategy for fast charging lithium ion batteries on basis of high speed solid state lithium transport in intermetallic alloy hosts.

         <title>Cold&#8208;Starting All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries from Room Temperature by Thermally Modulated Current Collector in Sub&#8208;Minute</title>

Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) show great potential as high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;power energy storage devices but their attainable energy/power density at room temperature is severely reduced because of the sluggish kinetics of lithium&#8208;ion transport. Here we first reported a thermally modulated current collector (TMCC), which can rapidly cold&#8208;start ASSBs from room temperature to operating temperatures (70&#8764;90 &#176;C) in less than one minute, and simultaneously enhance the transient peak power density by 15&#8208;fold compared to one without heating. This TMCC is prepared by integrating a uniform, ultrathin (&#8764;200&#160;nm) nickel layer as a thermal modulator within an ultralight polymer&#8208;based current collector. By isolating the thermal modulator from the ion/electron pathway of ASSBs, it can provide fast, stable heat control yet does not interfere with regular battery operation. Moreover, this ultrathin (13.2&#160;&#956;m) TMCC effectively shortens the heat transfer pathway, minimizes heat losses, and mitigates the formation of local hot spots. The simulated heating energy consumption can be as low as &#8764;3.94% of total battery energy. This TMCC design with good tunability opens new frontiers towards smart energy storage devices in the future from the current collector perspective.

Here we first reported a thermally modulated current collector (TMCC), which can rapidly cold-start ASSBs from room temperature to operating temperatures (70&#8764;90 &#176;C) in less than one minute, and simultaneously enhance the transient peak power density by 15-fold compared to one without heating.

         <title>Intracellular Crowding by Bio&#8208;Orthogonal Hydrogel Formation Induces Reversible Molecular Stasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intracellular crosslinking in living cells using poly(ethylene glycol) macromers is introduced. Increased macromolecular crowding in the cytosol of the cell causes crosslink&#8208;induced quiescence and results in reduced protein translation, cellular motility, and actin dynamics while cell viability remains high. The effects can be reversed through polymer degradation with UV light.








Abstract
To survive extreme conditions, certain animals enter a reversible protective stasis through vitrification of the cytosol by polymeric molecules such as proteins and polysaccharides. In this work, synthetic gelation of the cytosol in living cells is used to induce reversible molecular stasis. Through the sequential lipofectamine&#8208;mediated transfection of complementary poly(ethylene glycol) macromers into mammalian cells, intracellular crosslinking occurs through bio&#8208;orthogonal strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition click reactions. This achieves efficient polymer uptake with minimal cell death (99% viable). Intracellular crosslinking decreases DNA replication and protein synthesis, and increases the quiescent population by 2.5&#8208;fold. Real&#8208;time tracking of single cells containing intracellular crosslinked polymers identifies increases in intermitotic time (15 h&#160;vs 19 h) and decreases in motility (30 &#181;m h&#8722;1&#160;vs 15&#160;&#181;m h&#8722;1). The cytosol viscosity increases threefold after intracellular crosslinking and results in disordered cytoskeletal structure in addition to the disruption of cellular coordination in a scratch assay. By incorporating photodegradable nitrobenzyl moieties into the polymer backbone, the effects of intracellular crosslinking are reversed upon exposure to light, thereby restoring proliferation (80% phospho&#8208;Rb+ cells), protein translation, and migration. Reversible intracellular crosslinking provides a novel method for dynamic manipulation of intracellular mechanics, altering essential processes that determine cellular function.

         <title>3R Electronics: Scalable Fabrication of Resilient, Repairable, and Recyclable Soft&#8208;Matter Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3R&#8208;electronics are introduced here: the next generation of soft&#8208;matter electronics that are Resilient, Repairable and Recyclable. It is proposed that 3R&#8208;electronics should replace current electronics, as they permit sustainable circular economy. 3R&#8208;electronics are implemented through novel liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based composites, unique high&#8208;resolution digital fabrication techniques, and an unprecedented room&#8208;temperature soldering method that permits for the first time, utilization of heat&#8208;sensitive polymers in microchip&#8208;integrated circuits.








Abstract
E&#8208;waste is rapidly turning into another man&#8208;made disaster. It is proposed that a paradigm shift toward a more sustainable future can be made through soft&#8208;matter electronics that are resilient, repairable if damaged, and recyclable (3R), provided that they achieve the same level of maturity as industrial electronics. This includes high&#8208;resolution patterning, multilayer implementation, microchip integration, and automated fabrication. Herein, a novel architecture of materials and methods for microchip&#8208;integrated condensed soft&#8208;matter 3R electronics is demonstrated. The 3R function is enabled by a biphasic liquid metal&#8208;based composite, a block copolymer with nonpermanent physical crosslinks, and an electrochemical technique for material recycling. In addition, an autonomous laser&#8208;patterning method for scalable circuit patterning with an exceptional resolution of &lt;30&#160;&#181;m in seconds is developed. The phase&#8208;shifting property of the BCPs is utilized for vapor&#8208;assisted &#8220;soldering&#8221; circuit repairing and recycling. The process is performed entirely at room temperature, thereby opening the door for a wide range of heat&#8208;sensitive and biodegradable polymers for the next generation of green electronics. The implementation and recycling of sophisticated skin&#8208;mounted patches with embedded sensors, electrodes, antennas, and microchips that build a digital fingerprint of the human electrophysiological signals is demonstrated by collecting mechanical, electrical, optical, and thermal data from the epidermis.

         <title>Observation of Topological Edge States in Thermal Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological phases have been demonstrated in various wave systems, however, they still remain unexplored in a purely diffusive system. This work reveals the topological phase in a&#160;purely diffusive system, that is, a thermal lattice. The experimental results show that the nontrivial topological phase of the thermal lattice can enable thermal edge states that exponentially decay within the gap of bulk decays.








Abstract
Topological band theory predicts that bulk materials with nontrivial topological phases support topological edge states. This phenomenon is universal for various wave systems and is widely observed for electromagnetic and acoustic waves. Here, the notion of band topology is extended from wave to diffusion dynamics. Unlike wave systems that are usually Hermitian, diffusion systems are anti&#8208;Hermitian with purely imaginary eigenvalues corresponding to decay rates. By direct probe of the temperature diffusion, the Hamiltonian of a thermal lattice is experimentally retrieved, and the emergence of topological edge decays is observed within the gap of bulk decays. The results of this work show that such edge states exhibit robust decay rates, which are topologically protected against disorder. This work constitutes a thermal analogue of topological insulators and paves the way to exploring defect&#8208;immune heat dissipation.

         <title>Maneuvering Applications of Covalent Organic Frameworks via Framework&#8208;Morphology Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Translating the performance of Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) from laboratory to macroscopic reality demands specific morphologies. Thus, the advancement in morphological modulation has recently gained some momentum. A clear understanding of nano to macroscopic architecture is critical to determine, optimize and improve performances of this atomically precise porous material. Along with their chemical compositions and molecular frameworks, the prospect of morphology in various applications should be discussed and highlighted. A thorough insight into morphology&#8208; versus application would help produce better&#8208;engineered COFs for practical implications. Two and three&#8208;dimensional frameworks can be transformed into various solids such as nanospheres, thin films, membranes, monoliths, foams, etc., for numerous applications in adsorption, separation photocatalysis, carbon dioxide reduction, supercapacitor, and fuel cell. However, the research on COF&#8208;chemistry mainly focuses on correlating structure to property, structure to morphology, and structure to applications. Here, we have provided critical insights on various morphological evolution and associated applications. In each case, the underlying role of morphology has been unveiled. Towards the end, a correlation between morphology and application has been provided for the future development of COFs.

         <title>Walking Dead Tumor Cells for Targeted Drug Delivery Against Lung Metastasis of Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Lung metastasis is challenging in patients with triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC). Surgery is always not available due to the dissemination of metastatic foci and most of drugs are powerless because of poor retention at metastatic sites. TNBC cells generate inflamed microenvironment and overexpress adhesive molecules to promote the invasion and colonization. Herein, we develop walking dead TNBC cells through conjugating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 (programmed death protein 1 inhibitor) and doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded liposomes onto cell corpses for temporal chemo&#8208;immunotherapy against lung metastasis. The walking dead TNBC cells maintain plenary tumor antigens to conduct vaccination effects. Anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibodies are conjugated to cell corpses via reduction&#8208;activated linker, and DOX&#8208;loaded liposomes are attached by maleimide&#8208;thiol coupling. This anchor strategy enables rapid release of anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 upon reduction conditions while long&#8208;lasting release of DOX at inflamed metastatic sites. The walking dead TNBC cells improve pulmonary accumulation and local retention of drugs, reprogram lung microenvironment through damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and PD&#8208;1 blockade, and prolong overall survival of lung metastatic 4T1 and EMT6&#8208;bearing mice. Taking advantage of the walking dead TNBC cells for pulmonary preferred delivery of chemotherapeutics and checkpoint inhibitors, this study suggests an alternative treatment option of chemo&#8208;immunotherapy to augment the efficacy against lung metastasis.

         <title>Digital Light Processing 3D Printing of Tough Supramolecular Hydrogels with Sophisticated Architectures as Impact&#8208;Absorption Elements</title>

Abstract
Processing tough hydrogels into sophisticated architectures is crucial for their applications as structural elements. However, digital light processing (DLP) printing of tough hydrogels is challenging because of the low&#8208;speed gelation and toughening process. Described here is a simple yet versatile system suitable for DLP printing to form tough hydrogel architectures. The aqueous precursor consists of commercial photo&#8208;initiator, acrylic acid, and zirconium ion (Zr4+), readily forming tough metallosupramolecular hydrogel under digital light because of in situ formation of carboxyl&#8208;Zr4+ coordination complexes. The high stiffness and anti&#8208;swelling property of as&#8208;printed gel enable high&#8208;efficiency printing to form high&#8208;fidelity constructs. Furthermore, swelling&#8208;induced morphing of the gel is also achieved by encoding structure gradients during the printing with grayscale digital light. Mechanical properties of the printed hydrogels are further improved after incubation in water due to the variation of local pH and rearrangement of coordination complex. The swelling&#8208;enhanced stiffness affords the printed hydrogel with shape fixation ability after manual deformations, and thereby provides an additional avenue to form more complex configurations. These printed hydrogels are used to devise impact&#8208;absorption element or high&#8208;sensitivity pressure sensor as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept examples. This work should merit engineering of other tough gels and extend their scope of applications in diverse fields.

Abstract
In the past two decades, organic electronic materials have enabled and accelerated a large and diverse set of technologies, from energy harvesting devices and electro&#8208;mechanical actuators, to flexible and printed (opto)electronic circuitry. Among organic (semi)conductors, mixed ionic&#8208;electron conductors (OMIECs) are now at the center of renewed interest in organic electronics, as they are key drivers of recent developments in the fields of bioelectronics, energy storage, and neuromorphic computing. However, due to the relatively slow switching dynamics of organic electronics, their application in microwave technology, until recently, has been overlooked. Nonetheless, other unique properties of OMIECs, such as their substantial electrochemical tunability, charge modulation range and processability, make this field of use ripe with opportunities. In this work, we demonstrate the use of a series of solution&#8208;processed intrinsic OMIECs to actively tune the properties of metamaterial&#8208;inspired microwave devices, including an untethered bioelectrochemical sensing platform that requires no external power, and a tunable resonating structure with independent amplitude&#8208; and frequency&#8208;modulation. These devices showcase the considerable potential of OMIEC&#8208;based metadevices in autonomous bioelectronics and reconfigurable microwave optics.

         <title>Electrochemical Construction of Edge&#8208;Contacted Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Junctions with Low Contact Barrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile approach is developed for constructing high&#8208;quality metal&#8208;2D semiconductor junctions through the edge&#8208;guided electrodeposition. Cross&#8208;sectional imaging and transport measurements confirm the seamless contact of Pd with each layer of MoS2 greatly reduces the contact barrier to &#8776;20 meV and contact resistance to &#8776;290 &#937;&#160;&#181;m and thus significantly increases the performance of FETs with Pd nanowire edge contacts.








Abstract
2D semiconductors, such as MoS2 have emerged as promising ultrathin channel materials for the further scaling of field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). However, the contact barrier at the metal&#8208;2D semiconductor junctions still significantly limits the device's performance. By extending the application of electrochemical deposition in 2D electronics, a distinct approach is developed for constructing metal&#8208;2D semiconductor junctions in an edge&#8208;contacted configuration through the edge&#8208;guided electrodeposition of varied metals. Both high&#8208;resolution microscopic imaging and electrical transport measurements confirm the successful creation of high&#8208;quality Pd&#8208;2D MoS2 junctions in desired geometry by combining electrodeposition with lithographic patterning. FETs are fabricated on the obtained Pd&#8208;2D MoS2 junctions and it is confirmed that these junctions exhibit a reduced contact barrier of &#8776;20&#160;meV and extremely low contact resistance of 290&#160;&#937;&#160;&#181;m and thus increase the averaged mobility of MoS2 FETs to &#8776;108&#160;cm2 V &#8722;1 s&#8722;1. This approach paves a new way for the construction of metal&#8208;semiconductor junctions and also demonstrates the great potential of the electrochemical deposition technique in 2D electronics.

         <title>The Non&#8208;Classical Crystallization Mechanism of a Composite Biogenic Guanine Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By following crystal formation in embryonic spiders, a long&#8208;sought crystallization mechanism for biogenic guanine is revealed. Guanine nucleates from a disordered precursor phase. The crystals grow by the orientated attachment of partially ordered nanogranules into platelets, which coalesce into single crystals, via gradual relaxation of structural defects. The mature guanine is a composite of crystal lamellae intercalated by macromolecular sheets.








Abstract
Spectacular colors and visual phenomena in animals are produced by light interference from highly reflective guanine crystals. Little is known about how organisms regulate crystal morphology to tune the optics of these systems. By following guanine crystal formation in developing spiders, a crystallization mechanism is elucidated. Guanine crystallization is a &#8220;non&#8208;classical,&#8221; multistep process involving a progressive ordering of states. Crystallization begins with nucleation of partially ordered nanogranules from a disordered precursor phase. Growth proceeds by orientated attachment of the nanogranules into platelets which coalesce into single crystals, via progressive relaxation of structural defects. Despite their prismatic morphology, the platelet texture is retained in the final crystals, which are composites of crystal lamellae and interlamellar sheets. Interactions between the macromolecular sheets and the planar face of guanine appear to direct nucleation, favoring platelet formation. These findings provide insights on how organisms control the morphology and optical properties of molecular crystals.

         <dc:description>
Based on the impedance&#8208;voltage division principle and the voltage&#8208;luminance relationship, simply fabricated asymmetrically enhanced alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven electroluminescent (AECE AC&#8208;EL) devices are designed. The AECE AC&#8208;EL configuration is successfully applied in feasible information encryption and ultrahighly stretchable pattern displays, signifying magnificent application prospects in the elegant wearable electronic systems with intelligent, multifunctional, and full&#8208;color displays.








Abstract
Traditional alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven electroluminescent (AC&#8208;EL) devices adopting a sandwich structure are commonly used in solid&#8208;state lighting and displays, while the emerging coplanar&#8208;electrode alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven light&#8208;emitting variants manifest excellent application prospects in intelligent, multifunctional, and full&#8208;color displays, and sensing purposes. In this work, an asymmetrically&#160;enhanced coplanar&#8208;electrode AC&#8208;EL device with a universal and straightforward architecture is designed based on the impedance adjustment strategy. This newly devised asymmetric structure extends the functionalities of the coplanar&#8208;electrode AC&#8208;EL devices by overcoming the bottlenecks of complicated patterning procedures and high driving voltages of symmetric configuration. The developed device design enables a new type of information encryption and ultrahighly stretchable patterned displays. Notably, the novel encryption appliances demonstrate feasible encryption/decryption features, multiple encryptions, and practical applicability; the biaxially stretchable display devices achieve the highest tensile performance in the field of stretchable electroluminescent pattern displays, and outperform the ultrahighly stretchable sandwich devices in terms of simple patterning process, higher brightness, wider color gamut, and long&#8208;term stability. The proposed configuration opens up new avenues for AC&#8208;EL devices toward a plethora of smart applications in wearable electronics with intelligent displays, dynamic interaction of human&#8208;machine interface, and soft robotics.

         <title>Topological Crystalline Insulator Candidate ErAsS with Hourglass Fermion and Magnetic&#8208;Tuned Topological Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered air&#8208;stable topological crystalline insulator (TCI) candidate, ErAsS, is designed and synthesized, which maps the atomic layers in real space to the band topology in momentum space. The distorted As atomic layer and magnetic order of ErAsS induce both the hourglass fermion surface state and the magnetic&#8208;tuned exotic phases including the possible magnetic TCI.








Abstract
Topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) with hourglass fermion surface state have attracted a lot of attention and are further enriched by crystalline symmetries and magnetic order. Here, the emergence of hourglass fermion surface state and exotic phases in the newly discovered, air&#8208;stable ErAsS single crystals are shown. In the paramagnetic phase, ErAsS is expected to be a TCI with hourglass fermion surface state protected by the nonsymmorphic symmetry. Dirac&#8208;cone&#8208;like bands and nearly linear dispersions in large energy range are experimentally observed, consistent well with theoretical calculations. Below TN&#160;&#8776; 3.27 K, ErAsS enters a collinear antiferromagnetic state, which is a trivial insulator breaking the time&#8208;reversal symmetry. An intermediate incommensurate magnetic state appears in a narrow temperature range (3.27&#8211;3.65 K), exhibiting an abrupt change in magnetic coupling. The results reveal that ErAsS is an experimentally available TCI candidate and provide a unique platform to understand the formation of hourglass fermion surface state and explore magnetic&#8208;tuned topological phase transitions.

         <title>Rashba&#8208;Edelstein Effect in the h&#8208;BN Van Der Waals Interface for Magnetization Switching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) materials are attracting great attention in the field of spintronics due to their novel physical properties.[2] For example, they have been utilized as spin&#8208;current generating materials in spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) devices, which offers an electrical way to control the magnetic state and is promising for future low&#8208;power electronics.[4] However, SOTs have mostly been demonstrated in vdW materials[5&#8211;7] with strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC). Here, we report the observation of the current&#8208;induced SOT in the h&#8208;BN/SrRuO3 bilayer structure, where the vdW material(h&#8208;BN) is an insulator with negligible SOC. Importantly, this SOT is strong enough to induce the switching of the perpendicular magnetization in SrRuO3. Our first&#8208;principles calculations suggest a giant Rashba effect at the interface between vdW material and SrRuO3 (110)pc thin film, which leads to the observed SOT based on a simplified tight&#8208;binding model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the current&#8208;induced magnetization switching can be modulated by the electric field. Our study paves the way for exploring the current&#8208;induced SOT and magnetization switching by integrating vdW materials with ferromagnets.

         <title>Effective Approaches for Designing Stable M&#8211;Nx/C Oxygen&#8211;Reduction Catalysts for Proton&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Fuel Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
The effective approaches for designing stable M&#8211;Nx/C non&#8208;precious&#8208;metal oxygen&#8211;reduction catalysts for proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells are summarized. The thermodynamics and kinetics aspects of the stability of the M&#8211;Nx/C catalysts are introduced. The primary degradation mechanisms of the M&#8211;Nx/C catalysts and the corresponding mitigating strategies are discussed in detail, with future perspectives highlighted.








Abstract
The large&#8208;scale commercialization of proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is extremely limited by their costly platinum&#8208;group metals (PGMs) catalysts, which are used for catalyzing the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics at the cathode. Among the reported PGM&#8208;free catalysts so far, metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (M&#8211;Nx/C) catalysts hold a great potential to replace PGMs catalysts for the ORR due to their excellent initial activity and low cost. However, despite tremendous progress in this field in the past decade, their further applications are restricted by fast degradation under practical conditions. Herein, the theoretical fundamentals of the stability of the M&#8211;Nx/C catalysts are first introduced in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics. The primary degradation mechanisms of M&#8211;Nx/C catalysts and the corresponding mitigating strategies are discussed in detail. Finally, the current challenges and the prospects for designing highly stable M&#8211;Nx/C catalysts are outlined.

         <title>Necklace&#8208;like Nanostructures: from Fabrication, Properties to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of nanocrystals remains a hot research topic in nanotechnology. Particularly, the fabrication of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) structures such as wires, rods, belts, and tubes has been an interesting and important subject within nanoscience in the last few decades. 1D necklace&#8208;like micro/nano&#8208;structures are a sophisticated geometry that has attracted increasing attention due to their anisotropic and periodic structure, intrinsic high surface area, abundant transport channels, exposure of each component to the surface, and multiscale roughness of the surface. These characteristics enable their unique electrical, optical, and catalytic properties. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the advanced research progress on the fabrication strategies, novel properties, and various applications of necklace&#8208;like structures. It begins with the main fabrication methods of necklace&#8208;like structures and subsequently details a variety of their properties and applications. It concludes with the authors&#8217; perspectives on future research and development of the necklace&#8208;like structures.

         <title>Switchable unipolar&#8208;barrier van der Waals heterostructures with natural anisotropy for full linear polarimetry detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polarization&#8208;resolved photodetection in a compact footprint is of great interests for ultra&#8208;miniaturized polarimeter to be used in a wide range of applications. However, states of polarization (SOP) probing in natural anisotropy materials are usually weak, limited by material's natural dichroism or diattenuation. Here, we report a twisted unipolar&#8208;barrier van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH) to construct a bias&#8208;switchable polarization detection for retrieval of full SOP state (from 0 to 180&#176;) for linear polarized incident light. As a demonstration example, we realized the concept in a b&#8208;AsP/WS2/b&#8208;AsP vdWH relying on the natural anisotropy properties of the materials without using additional plasmonic/metasurface nanostructures to realize linear polarimetry in the mid&#8208;infrared range. Polarimetric imaging is further demonstrated with the developed linear polarimetry by directly displaying the Jones vector&#8208;described SOP distribution of certain target object. Our method with the capabilities of detecting full linear SOP is promising for the next&#8208;generation on&#8208;chip miniaturized polarimeter.

         <title>Turbostratic Boron&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Nitrogen and Boron&#8208;Nitride by Flash Joule Heating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Turbostratic layers in 2D materials have an interlayer misalignment. The lack of alignment expands the intrinsic interlayer distances and weakens the optical and electronic interactions between adjacent layers. This introduces properties distinct from those structures with well&#8208;aligned lattices and strong coupling interactions. However, direct, and rapid synthesis of turbostratic materials remains a challenge owing to their thermodynamically metastable properties. Here, we report a flash Joule heating (FJH) method to achieve bulk synthesis of boron&#8208;carbon&#8208;nitrogen ternary compounds with turbostratic structures by a kinetically controlled ultrafast cooling process that takes place within milliseconds (103&#8764;104 K s&#8211;1). Theoretical calculations support the existence of turbostratic structures and provide estimates of the energy barriers with respect to conversion into the corresponding well&#8208;aligned counterparts. When using non&#8208;carbon conductive additives, a direct synthesis of boron nitride is possible. The turbostratic nature facilitates mechanical exfoliation and more stable dispersions. Accordingly, the addition of flash products to a polyvinyl alcohol nanocomposite film coating a copper surface greatly improves the copper's resistance to corrosion in 0.5 M sulfuric acid or 3.5 wt% saline solution. FJH allows the use of bulk materials as reactants and provides a rapid approach to large quantities of the hitherto hard&#8208;to&#8208;access turbostratic materials.

         <title>Superconducting Material Based Maglev Generator Used for Outer&#8208;Space</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solar cells are conventionally used to harvest energy in outer space, but they are ineffective in dark locations. Here, we show that superconducting materials &#8211; which work best in cold environments, such as those found in outer space&#8212;provide a mechanism to harvest energy that does not require light. A superconducting maglev (magnetic levitation) magnetoelectric generator (SMMG) can convert mechanical impacts to electricity at its working temperature &lt;90 K. The SMMG device consists of a permanent magnet, a conductive coil, and a superconducting layer (SL). Owing to the existence of the SL, the permanent magnet levitates over the SL and rapidly returns to an equilibrium height after being displaced by a mechanical impact. The impact changes the gap between the levitated magnet and the coil, resulting in a variation in magnetic flux that induces electrical current in the coil. Thus, the SMMG converts low&#8208;frequency (&lt;3.7&#160;Hz) mechanical energy to electricity. The output maximum peak voltage, peak power, and peak power density of the SMMG are 4.3&#160;V, 35&#160;mW, and 17.8 W/m2, respectively, with a load resistance of 300 ohms. The SMMG can charge a capacitor of 10000 &#956;F to 3.8&#160;V with a continuous impact, which is sufficient to power critical wireless communication. The superconductor works best in cold environments and therefore is well&#8208;suited for providing electricity to sensors and communication devices in outer space, particularly in places where the sun may not reach.

         <title>Promoting Dinuclear&#8208;Type Catalysis in Cu1&#8208;C3N4 Single Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Reducing particle size in supported metal catalyst to single atom level isolates the active metal sites and maximizes the atomic utilization efficiency. However, the large inter&#8208;atom distance, particularly in low&#8208;loading single atom catalyst (SAC), is not favourable for a complex reaction where two (or more) reactants have to be activated. A key question is how to control the inter&#8208;atom distances to promote dinuclear&#8208;type co&#8208;activation at the adjacent metal sites. Here, we report that reducing the average inter&#8208;atom distance of Cu1 SAC supported on C3N4 to 0.74 &#177; 0.13&#160;nm allows these catalysts to exhibit dinuclear&#8208;type catalytic mechanism in nitrile&#8208;azide cycloaddition. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure study reveals a dynamic ligand exchange process between nitrile and azide, followed by their co&#8208;activation on dinuclear Cu SAC sites to form the tetrazole product. This work highlights that reducing the nearest neighbour distance of SAC allows mechanistic pathway to diversify from single site to multi&#8208;site catalysis.

         <title>Surface Oxygen Vacancies Confined by Ferroelectric Polarization for Tunable CO Oxidation Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface oxygen vacancies are well confined near the interface between Pt {111} nanocrystals and the negative polar surface (001) of ferroelectric PbTiO3 nanoplate. The vacancies are stabilized electrostatically by ferroelectric polarization, giving rise to tunable catalytic CO oxidation kinetics from 200&#160;&#176;C to near room temperature. A new pathway of CO oxidation via polarization&#8208;stabilized oxygen vacancies accounts for the tunable reaction activity.








Abstract
Surface oxygen vacancies have been widely discussed to be crucial for tailoring the activity of various chemical reactions from CO, NO, to water oxidation by using oxide&#8208;supported catalysts. However, the real role and potential function of surface oxygen vacancies in the reaction remains unclear because of their very short lifetime. Here, it is reported that surface oxygen vacancies can be well confined electrostatically for a polarization screening near the perimeter interface between Pt {111} nanocrystals and the negative polar surface (001) of ferroelectric PbTiO3. Strikingly, such a catalyst demonstrates a tunable catalytic CO oxidation kinetics from 200&#160;&#176;C to near room temperature by increasing the O2 gas pressure, accompanied by the conversion curve from a hysteresis&#8208;free loop to one with hysteresis. The combination of reaction kinetics, electronic energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, indicates that the oxygen vacancies stabilized by the negative polar surface are the active sites for O2 adsorption as a rate&#8208;determining step, and then dissociated O moves to the surface of the Pt nanocrystals for oxidizing adsorbed CO. The results open a new pathway for tunable catalytic activity of CO oxidation.

Abstract
A major challenge hindering the further development of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) employing polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors is the relatively low fill factor (FF) due to the difficulty in controlling active layer morphology. The issues typically arise from oversized phase separation resulting from the thermodynamically unfavorable mixing between two macromolecular species, and disordered molecular orientation/packing of highly anisotropic polymer chains. Herein, a facile top&#8208;down controlling strategy to engineer the morphology of all&#8208;polymer blends is developed by leveraging the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) deposition. Optimal intermixing of polymer components could be achieved in the two&#8208;step process by tuning the bottom&#8208;layer polymer swelling during top&#8208;layer deposition. As a result, both the molecular orientation/packing of bottom layer and the crystallinity of top layer can be optimized with a suitable processing solvent for the top layer. Consequently, a favorable morphology with gradient vertical composition distribution for efficient charge transport and extraction is realized, affording a high all&#8208;PSC efficiency of 17.0% with a remarkable FF of 76.1%. The derived devices also possess excellent long&#8208;term thermal stability which can retain &gt;90% of their initial efficiencies after being annealed at 65 &#176;C for 1300 h. These results validate that the distinct advantages of employing such LBL processing protocol to fabricate high&#8208;performance all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Cluster&#8208;Glass for Low&#8208;Cost White&#8208;Light Emission</title>

Abstract
The development of efficient and high&#8208;brilliance white&#8208;light sources is an essential contribution to innovative emission technologies. Materials exhibiting strong non&#8208;linear optical properties, in particular second harmonic generation (SHG) or white&#8208;light generation (WLG), have therefore been investigated with great activity in recent times. While many new approaches have been reported until now, the processability of the compounds remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a new class of materials, denoted as &#8220;cluster&#8208;glass&#8221;, which do not only show superior white&#8208;light emission properties upon irradiation by an inexpensive continuous&#8208;wave infrared laser diode, but can be easily accommodated in size and shape by formation of robust glassy solids. The cluster&#8208;glass materials are fabricated by mild heating from crystalline powders of adamantane&#8208;type clusters exhibiting a quaternary, inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid cluster core [(PhSi)(CH2)3(PhSn)E3] (E&#160; = &#160;S, Se, Te). The process is fully reversible and preserves the integrity of the clusters in the glass, as proven by solution spectroscopy and re&#8208;crystallization. Theoretical studies corroborate the importance of the quaternary nature of the cluster cores for the observed structural and optical phenomena. Thanks to these findings, high brilliance white&#8208;light sources can be synthesized in form of stable, robust glass of any shape, which ultimately renders them suitable for everyday's applications.

         <title>Binary Organic Solar Cells Breaking 19% via Manipulating Vertical Component Distribution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The variation of vertical component distribution can significantly influence photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs), mainly due to its impact on the exciton dissociation, and the charge carrier transport and recombination. Herein, the binary devices are fabricated via sequential deposition (SD) of D18 and L8&#8208;BO materials in a two&#8208;step process. Upon independently regulating the spin&#8208;coating speeds of each layer deposition, the optimal SD device shows a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.05% for binary single&#8208;junction OSCs, much higher than that of the corresponding blend casting (BC) device (18.14%). Impressively, this strategy presents excellent universality in boosting photovoltaic performance of SD devices, exemplified by several nonfullerene acceptor systems. The mechanism studies reveal that the SD device with preferred vertical components distribution possesses high crystallinity, efficient exciton split, low energy loss, and balanced charge transport, resulting in all&#8208;around enhancement of photovoltaic performances. This work provides a valuable approach for high efficiency OSCs, shedding light on understanding the relationship between photovoltaic performances and vertical component distribution.

         <title>Formulating High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Cycle Heterostructured Layered Oxide Cathodes by Local Chemistry and Orbital Hybridization Modulation for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
It is still very urgent and challenging to simultaneously develop high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;cycle oxide cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) because of its sluggish kinetics and complex multiphase evolution during cycling. Here, we report the concept of accurately manipulating structural evolution and formulating high&#8208;performance heterostructured biphasic layered oxide cathodes by local chemistry and orbital hybridization modulation. The P2&#8208;structure stoichiometric composition of cathode material shows a layered P2&#8208; and O3&#8208;type heterostructure that is explicitly evidenced by various macroscale and atomic&#8208;scale techniques. Surprisingly, the heterostructured cathode displays excellent rate performance, remarkable cycling stability (capacity retention of 82.16% after 600 cycles at 2C), and outstanding compatibility with hard carbon anode because of the integrated advantages of intergrowth structure and local environment regulation. Meanwhile, the formation process from precursors during calcination and the highly reversible dynamic structural evolution during the Na+ intercalation/deintercalation process are clearly articulated by a series of in situ characterization techniques. Also, the intrinsic structural properties and corresponding electrochemical behavior are further elucidating by the density of states and electron localization function of density functional theory calculations. Overall, this strategy, which finely tunes the local chemistry and orbitals hybridization for high&#8208;performance SIBs, will open up a new field for other materials.

         <title>Spontaneous Construction of Nucleophilic Carbonyl&#8208;Containing Interphase towards Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Multifunctional interfacial engineering on Zn anode to conquer the dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution and sluggish kinetics associated with Zn deposition is highly desirable for boosting the commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a spontaneous construction of carbonyl&#8208;containing layer on Zn anode (Zn@ZCO) is rationally designed as an ion redistributor and functional protective interphase. It has strong zincphilicity and dendrite suppression ability due to the significant interaction of the high&#8208;electronegative and high&#8208;nucleophilic carbonyl oxygen, favoring ion transport and homogenizing Zn deposition effectively. On the other side, the hydrogen bond formed by the proton acceptor of oxygen atom in ZCO regulates Zn&#8208;ion desolvation process at interfaces, thus bounding water activity and then mitigating the water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions. Consequently, the Zn@ZCO anode exhibits an extended cycling lifespan of 5000 h (more than 208 days) with a dendrite&#8208;free surface and negligible by&#8208;products. More encouragingly, the effectiveness is also convincing in NH4V4O10&#8208;based full&#8208;cells with excellent rate performance and cyclic stability. The stabilized Zn anode enabled by spontaneous construction strategy of functional solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase brings forward a facile and instructive approach towards high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Dynamic Surface Evolution of Metal Oxides for Autonomous Adaptation to Catalytic Reaction Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal oxides possessing distinctive physical/chemical properties due to different crystal structures and stoichiometries play a pivotal role in numerous current technologies, especially heterogeneous catalysis for production/conversion of high&#8208;valued chemicals and energy. To date, many researchers have investigated the effect of the structure and composition of these materials on their reactivity to various chemical and electrochemical reactions. However, metal oxide surfaces evolve from their initial form under dynamic reaction conditions due to the autonomous behaviors of the constituent atoms to adapt to the surrounding environment. Such nanoscale surface phenomena complicate reaction mechanisms and material properties, interrupting the clarification of the origin of functionality variations in reaction environments. In this review, we categorize the current findings on the spontaneous surface reorganization of metal oxides during reactions into three types: (1) the appearance of nano&#8208;sized 2nd phase from oxides, (2) the (partial) encapsulation of oxide atoms towards supported metal surfaces, and (3) the oxide surface reconstruction with selective cation leaching in aqueous solution. We then summarize their effects on each reaction in terms of activity and stability, providing novel insight for those who design metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;based catalytic materials.

In this review, we categorize the current findings on the spontaneous surface reorganization of metal oxides during reactions into three types: (1) the appearance of nano-sized 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; phase from oxides, (2) the (partial) encapsulation of oxide atoms towards supported metal surfaces, and (3) the oxide surface reconstruction with selective cation leaching in aqueous solution. We then summarize their effects on each reaction in terms of activity and stability, providing novel insight for those who design metal-oxide-based catalytic materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Brain Codelivery of Temozolomide and Cisplatin for Combinatorial Glioblastoma Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is an intractable malignancy with high recurrence and mortality. Temozolomide (TMZ) and cisplatin (CDDP) based combinational therapy shows promising potential for GBM therapy in clinical trials. However, significant challenges include limited blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier (BBB) penetration, poor targeting of GBM tissue/cells and systemic side effect which hinder its efficacy in GBM therapy. To surmount these challenges, we developed new GBM&#8208;cell membrane camouflaged and pH&#8208;sensitive biomimetic nanoparticles (MNPs) inspired by the fact that cancer cells readily pass the BBB via reducing the tightness of endothelial cells, and localizing with homologous cells. Our results showed that MNPs can efficiently co&#8208;load TMZ and CDDP, transport these across the BBB to specifically target GBM. Incorporation of pH&#8208;sensitive polymer then allows for controlled release of drug cargos at GBM sites for combinational drug therapy. Mice bearing orthotopic U87MG or drug&#8208;resistant U251R GBM tumour and treated with MNPs@TMZ+CDDP showed a potent anti&#8208;GBM effect greatly extending survival time relative to mice receiving single&#8208;drug loaded nanoparticles or equivalent doses of free drugs. No obvious side effects were apparent in histological analyses or blood routine studies. Considering these results, our new nanoparticle formulation overcomes multiple challenges currently limiting the efficacy of combined TMZ and CDDP GBM drug therapy and appears to be a promising strategy for future GBM combinatorial chemotherapy.

Our results showed that MNPs can efficiently co-load TMZ and CDDP, transport these across the BBB to specifically target GBM. Incorporation of pH-sensitive polymer then allows for controlled release of drug cargos at GBM sites for combinational drug therapy.

         <title>New Approaches to Produce Large&#8208;Area Single Crystal Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Wafer&#8208;scale growth of single crystal thin films of metals, semiconductors, and insulators is crucial in manufacturing high&#8208;performance electronic and optical devices, but still challenging from both scientific and industrial perspectives. Recently, unconventional advanced synthetic approaches have been attempted and have made remarkable progress in diversifying the species of producible single crystal thin films. This review introduces several new synthetic approaches to produce large&#8208;area single crystal thin films of various materials according to the concepts and principles. Several novel concepts to produce the isostructured crystals (3D materials including metals, III&#8208;V semiconductors, oxide perovskites, halide perovskites, and organic semiconductors) are reviewed in section 2. The approaches to the anisotropic crystals (2D materials such as graphene, hBN, and metal chalcogenides) are discussed in section 3. The section 4 discusses on the relevant challenging issues in the growth and scaling of the single crystal thin films.

Abstract
The rapid growth of the electronics industry and proliferation of electronic materials and telecommunications technologies has led to the release of a massive amount of untreated electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) into the environment. Consequently, catastrophic environmental damage at the microbiome level and serious human health diseases threaten the natural fate of our planet. Currently, the demand for wearable and flexible electronics for applications in personalized medicine, electronic skins (e&#8208;skin), and health monitoring platforms is substantial and growing. Therefore, &#8220;green&#8221; characteristics such as biodegradability, self&#8208;healing behavior, and biocompatibility ensure the future application of wearable electronics and e&#8208;skins in biomedical engineering and bioanalytical sciences. Leveraging the biodegradability, sustainability, and biocompatibility of natural materials will dramatically influence the fabrication of environmentally friendly e&#8208;skins and wearable electronics. Here, the molecular and structural characteristics of biological skins and artificial e&#8208;skins are discussed. The focus then turns to the biodegradable materials, including natural and synthetic polymer&#8208;based materials, and their most recent applications in the development of biodegradable e&#8208;skin in wearable sensors, robotics, and human&#8211;machine interfaces (HMIs). Finally, the main challenges and outlook regarding the preparation and application of biodegradable e&#8208;skins are critically discussed in a near&#8208;future scenario, which is expected to lead to the next generation of biodegradable e&#8208;skins and electronics.

         <title>Tuning Organic Electrochemical Transistor Threshold Voltage using Chemically Doped Polymer Gates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have shown promise as transducers and amplifiers of minute electronic potentials due to their large transconductances. Tuning OECT threshold voltage is important to achieve low&#8208;powered devices with amplification properties within the desired operational voltage range. However, traditional design approaches have struggled to decouple channel and materials properties from threshold voltage, thereby compromising on several other OECT performance metrics such as electrochemical stability, transconductance, and dynamic range. In this work, we utilize simple solution processing methods to chemically dope polymer gate electrodes, thereby controlling their work function, which in turn tunes the operation voltage range of OECTs without perturbing their channel properties. Chemical doping of initially air&#8208;sensitive polymer electrodes further improves their electrochemical stability in ambient conditions. Thus, we demonstrate, for the first time, OECTs which are simultaneously low&#8208;powered and electrochemically resistant to oxidative side reactions at ambient conditions. This approach shows that threshold voltage, which was once interwoven with other OECT properties, can in fact be an independent design parameter, expanding the design space of OECTs.

         <title>Reprogramming Mitochondrial Metabolism in Synovial Macrophages of Early Osteoarthritis by a Camouflaged Meta&#8208;Defensome</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and osteoarthritis (OA) severity is established and an effective strategy for reprogramming the mitochondrial metabolism is pioneered, through a novel camouflaged dual&#8208;targeting meta&#8208;Defensome, comprising macrophage&#8208;membrane&#8208;cloaked polymeric nanoparticles loaded with double nanoenzymes that scavenge mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and inhibit mitochondrial nitric oxide synthase, efficiently restoring the M1/M2 macrophage imbalance in the synovium and impeding OA progression.








Abstract
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a low&#8208;grade inflammatory and progressive joint disease, and its progression is closely associated with an imbalance in M1/M2 synovial macrophages. Repolarizing pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 macrophages into the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 phenotype is emerging as a strategy to alleviate OA progression but is compromised by unsatisfactory efficiency. In this study, the reprogramming of mitochondrial dysfunction is pioneered with a camouflaged meta&#8208;Defensome, which can transform M1 synovial macrophages into the M2 phenotype with a high efficiency of 82.3%. The meta&#8208;Defensome recognizes activated macrophages via receptor&#8211;ligand interactions and accumulates in the mitochondria through electrostatic attractions. These meta&#8208;Defensomes are macrophage&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated polymeric nanoparticles decorated with dual ligands and co&#8208;loaded with S&#8208;methylisothiourea and MnO2. Meta&#8208;Defensomes are demonstrated to successfully reprogram the mitochondrial metabolism of M1 macrophages by scavenging mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and inhibiting mitochondrial NO synthase, thereby increasing mitochondrial transcription factor A expression and restoring aerobic respiration. Furthermore, meta&#8208;Defensomes are intravenously injected into collagenase&#8208;induced osteoarthritis mice and effectively suppress synovial inflammation and progression of early OA, as evident from the Osteoarthritis Research Society International score. Therefore, reprogramming the mitochondrial metabolism can serve as a novel and practical approach to repolarize M1 synovial macrophages. The camouflaged meta&#8208;Defensomes are a promising therapeutic agent for impeding OA progression in tclinic.

         <title>Elastic Lattice Enabling Reversible Tetrahedral Li Storage Sites in a High&#8208;Capacity Manganese Oxide Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Li&#8208;excess material based purely on manganese displaying ultrahigh capacities over hundreds of cycles is demonstrated. Through a wealth of characterization methods, it is clarified that Mn migration into the Li layer during the initial cycle stabilizes a large number of tetrahedral sites for extra and reversible Li&#8208;ion storage in this layered compound.








Abstract
The key to breaking through the capacity limitation imposed by intercalation chemistry lies in the ability to harness more active sites that can reversibly accommodate more ions (e.g., Li+) and electrons within a finite space. However, excessive Li&#8208;ion insertion into the Li layer of layered cathodes results in fast performance decay due to the huge lattice change and irreversible phase transformation. In this study, an ultrahigh reversible capacity is demonstrated by a layered oxide cathode purely based on manganese. Through a wealth of characterizations, it is clarified that the presence of low&#8208;content Li2MnO3 domains not only reduces the amount of irreversible O loss; but also regulates Mn migration in LiMnO2 domains, enabling elastic lattice with high reversibility for tetrahedral sites Li&#8208;ion storage in Li layers. This work utilizes bulk cation disorder to create stable Li&#8208;ion&#8208;storage tetrahedral sites and an elastic lattice for layered materials, with a reversible capacity of 600&#160;mA h g&#8722;1, demonstrated in th range 0.6&#8211;4.9&#160;V versus Li/Li+ at 10&#160;mA g&#8722;1. Admittedly, discharging to 0.6&#160;V might be too low for practical use, but this exploration is still of great importance as it conceptually demonstrates the limit of Li&#8208;ions insertion into layered oxide materials.

         <title>2D&#8208;Material&#8208;Integrated Micromachines: Competing Propulsion Strategy and Enhanced Bacterial Disinfection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fusion of 2D transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenide materials with micro/nanomachines can substantially accelerate scientific discovery and engineering implementations for micro/nanorobotics. Here, functional molybdenum disulfide is integrated into Janus micromotors that demonstrate unprecedented performance in response to ion addition and application for water disinfection. The unveiled working mechanism points toward a new scheme for making micro/nanomachines with designed performance.








Abstract
2D&#160;transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenide&#160;materials, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) have received immense interest owing to their remarkable structure&#8208;endowed electronic, catalytic, and mechanical properties for applications in optoelectronics, energy storage, and wearable devices. However, 2D materials have been rarely explored in the field of micro/nanomachines, motors, and robots. Here, MoS2&#160;with anatase TiO2&#160;is successfully integrated into an original one&#8208;side&#8208;open hollow micromachine, which demonstrates increased light absorption of TiO2&#8208;based micromachines to the visible region and the first observed motion acceleration in response to ionic media. Both experimentation and theoretical analysis suggest the unique type&#8208;II bandgap alignment of MoS2/TiO2&#160;heterojunction that accounts for the observed unique locomotion owing to a competing propulsion mechanism. Furthermore, by leveraging the chemical properties of MoS2/TiO2, the micromachines achieve sunlight&#8208;powered water disinfection with 99.999%&#160;Escherichia coli&#160;lysed in an&#160;hour. This research suggests abundant opportunities offered by 2D materials in the creation of a new class of micro/nanomachines and robots.

         <title>Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase In Situ Formed on Magnesium&#8208;Metal Anode by using a Perfluorinated Alkoxide&#8208;Based All&#8208;Magnesium Salt Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perfluorinated alkoxide&#8208;based all&#8208;magnesium salt electrolyte is designed and synthesized. The proper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level of the [Mg(pftb)3]&#8722; anions in the electrolyte enables in situ formation of a stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Mg anodes. With the protection of SEI, Mg//Mg cells achieve low overpotentials over ultralong&#8208;cycle lives of 8100, 3000, and 1500 h at current densities of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively.








Abstract
Passivation of the Mg anode surface in conventional electrolytes constitutes a critical issue for practical Mg batteries. In this work, a perfluorinated tert&#8208;butoxide magnesium salt, Mg(pftb)2, is codissolved with MgCl2 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to form an all&#8208;magnesium salt electrolyte. Raman spectroscopy and density function theory calculation confirm that [Mg2Cl3&#183;6THF]+[Mg(pftb)3]&#8722; is the main electrochemically active species of the electrolyte. The proper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level of the [Mg(pftb)3]&#8722; anion enables in situ formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Mg anodes. A detailed analysis of the SEI reveals that its stability originates from a dual&#8208;layered organic/inorganic hybrid structure. Mg//Cu and Mg//Mg cells using the electrolyte achieve a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 3000 cycles, and low overpotentials over ultralong&#8208;cycle lives of 8100, 3000, and 1500 h at current densities of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. The robust SEI layer, once formed on a Mg electrode, is also shown highly effective in suppressing side&#8208;reactions in a TFSI&#8722;&#8208;containing electrolyte. A high Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% over 800 cycles is also demonstrated for a Mg//Mo6S8 full cell, showing great promise of the SEI forming electrolyte in future Mg batteries.

         <title>Fabrication of Arrays of Topological Solitons in Patterned Chiral Liquid Crystals for Real&#8208;Time Observation of Morphogenesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological solitons of chiral liquid crystal (LC) are uniformly generated over a large area with periodic air pockets. Controlled thermal phase transition with air pockets enables real&#8208;time observation of morphogenesis of topological solitons transformed from topological defects. The platform provides insight into topological solitons at the other scales and can be applied to multiple applications requiring controlled LC structures.








Abstract
Topological solitons have knotted continuous field configurations embedded in a uniform background, and occur in cosmology, biology, and electromagnetism. However, real&#8208;time observation of their morphogenesis and dynamics is still challenging because their size and timescale are enormously large or tiny. Liquid crystal (LC) structures are promising candidates for a model&#8208;system to study the morphogenesis of topological solitons, enabling direct visualization due to the proper size and timescale. Here, a new&#160;way is found to rationalize the real&#8208;time observation of the generation and transformation of topological solitons using cholesteric LCs confined in patterned substrates. The experimental demonstration shows the topologically protected structures arise via the transformation of topological defects. Numerical modeling based on minimization of free energy closely reconstructs the experimental findings. The fundamental insights obtained from the direct observations pose new theoretical challenges in understanding the morphogenesis of different types of topological solitons within a broad range of scales.

         <title>Tailoring Materials for Epilepsy Imaging: From Biomarkers to Imaging Probes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Excising epileptic foci (EF) is the most efficient approach for treating drug&#8208;resistant epilepsy (DRE). However, owing to the vast heterogeneity of epilepsies, EF in one&#8208;third of patients cannot be accurately located, even after exhausting all current diagnostic strategies. Therefore, identifying biomarkers that truly represent the status of epilepsy and fabricating probes with high targeting specificity are prerequisites for identifying the &#8220;concealed&#8221; EF. However, no systematic summary of this topic has been published. In this paper, we first summarize the potential biomarkers of EF and classify them into three categories: functional, molecular, and structural aberrances during epileptogenesis, a procedure of non&#8208;epileptic brain biasing toward epileptic tissue. The materials used to fabricate these imaging probes and their performance in defining the EF in preclinical and clinical studies are highlighted. Finally, the perspectives for developing the next generation of probes and their challenges in clinical translation are discussed. In general, this review will be helpful in guiding the development of imaging probes defining EF with improved accuracy and holds promise for increasing the number of DRE patients who are eligible for surgical intervention.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excising epileptic foci (EF) is the most efficient approach for treating drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). However, owing to the vast heterogeneity of epilepsies, EF in one-third of patients cannot be accurately located, even after exhausting all current diagnostic strategies. Therefore, identifying biomarkers that truly represent the status of epilepsy and fabricating probes with high targeting specificity are prerequisites for identifying the &#8220;concealed&#8221; EF. However, no systematic summary of this topic has been published. In this paper, we first summarize the potential biomarkers of EF and classify them into three categories: functional, molecular, and structural aberrances during epileptogenesis, a procedure of non-epileptic brain biasing toward epileptic tissue. The materials used to fabricate these imaging probes and their performance in defining the EF in preclinical and clinical studies are highlighted. Finally, the perspectives for developing the next generation of probes and their challenges in clinical translation are discussed. In general, this review will be helpful in guiding the development of imaging probes defining EF with improved accuracy and holds promise for increasing the number of DRE patients who are eligible for surgical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hexagonal Boron Nitride for Next&#8208;Generation Photonics and Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), an insulating two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered material, has recently attracted tremendous interest motivated by the extraordinary properties it shows across the fields of optoelectronics, quantum optics, and electronics, being exotic material platforms for various applications. At an early stage of h&#8208;BN research, it has been explored as an ideal substrate and insulating layers for other 2D materials due to its atomically flat surface free of dangling bonds and charged impurities, and high thermal conductivity. Recent discoveries of structural and optical properties of h&#8208;BN have expanded potential applications into emerging electronics and photonics fields. h&#8208;BN shows a very efficient deep&#8208;ultraviolet band&#8208;edge emission despite its indirect bandgap nature, as well as stable room temperature single&#8208;photon emission over a wide wavelength range, showing a great potential for next&#8208;generation photonics. In addition, h&#8208;BN is extensively being adopted as active media for low energy electronics, including nonvolatile resistive switching memory, radio&#8208;frequency devices, and low dielectric constant materials for next&#8208;generation electronics.

         <title>Memristors&#8208;based Dendritic Neuron for High&#8208;Efficiency Spatial&#8208;Temporal Information Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Diverse microscopic ionic dynamics help mediate the ability of a biological neural network to handle complex tasks with low energy consumption. Thus, rich internal ionic dynamics in transition metal oxide&#8208;based memristors are expected to provide a unique and useful platform for implementing energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing. To this end, a TiOx&#8208;based interface&#8208;type dynamic memristor and an NbOx&#8208;based Mott memristor are integrated as an artificial dendrite and spike&#8208;firing soma, respectively, to construct a dendritic neuron unit for realizing high&#8208;efficiency spatial&#8208;temporal information processing. Further, a dendritic neural network is hardware implemented for spatial&#8208;temporal information processing to highlight the computational advantages achieved by incorporating dendritic functions in the network. Human motion recognition is demonstrated using the NUT&#8208;RGB dataset as a benchmark spatial&#8208;temporal task; it shows a nearly 20% improvement in accuracy for the memristors&#8208;based hardware incorporating dendrites and a 1000&#215; advantage in power efficiency compared to that of the GPU. The dendritic neuron developed in this study can be considered a critical building block for implementing more bio&#8208;plausible neural networks that can manage complex spatial&#8208;temporal tasks with high efficiency.

         <title>Greenificated Molecularly Imprinted Materials for Advanced Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Molecular imprinting technology (MIT) produces artificial binding sites with precise complementarity to substrates and thereby is capable of exquisite molecular recognition. Over five decades of evolution, it was predicted that the resulting host imprinted materials would overtake natural receptors for research and application purposes, but in practice, this has not yet been realized due to the unsustainability of their life cycles (i.e., precursors, creation, use, recycling, and end&#8208;of&#8208;life). To address this issue, greenificated molecularly imprinted polymers (GMIPs) are a new class of plastic antibodies that have approached sustainability by following one or more of the greenification principles, while also demonstrating more far&#8208;reaching applications compared to their natural counterparts. In this review, we survey the most recent developments in the delicate design and advanced application of GMIPs in six fast&#8208;growing and emerging fields, namely biomedicine/therapy, catalysis, energy harvesting/storage, nanoparticle detection, gas sensing/adsorption, and environmental remediation. In addition, we highlight their distinct features, and discuss the optimal means to utilize these features for attaining incredibly far&#8208;reaching applications. Importantly, the obscure technical challenges of the greenificated MIT are revealed, and conceivable solutions are offered. Lastly, several perspectives on future research directions are proposed.

         <title>Interactions of Metal Nanoclusters with Light: Fundamentals and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 25, June 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal nanoclusters have recently emerged as a promising class of optical materials. How they interact with light is a key consideration in the design of high&#8208;quality optical materials based on nanoclusters. The basic principles of the interactions between light and nanoclusters and highlights their optical applications are discussed.








Abstract
The interactions of materials with light determine their applications in various fields. In the past decade, ultrasmall metal nanoclusters (NCs) have emerged as a promising class of optical materials due to their unique molecular&#8208;like properties. Herein, the basic principles of optical absorption and photoluminescence of metal NCs, their interactions with polarized light, and light&#8208;induced chemical reactions, are discussed, highlighting the roles of the core and protecting ligands/motifs of metal NCs in their interactions with light. The metal core and protecting ligands/motifs determine the electronic structures of metal NCs, which are closely related to their optical properties. In addition, the protecting ligands/motifs of metal NCs contribute to their photoluminescence and chiral origin, further promoting the interactions of metal NCs with light through various pathways. The fundamentals of light&#8211;NC interactions provide guidance for the design of metal NCs in optical applications, which are discussed in the second part. In the last section, some strategies are proposed to further understand light&#8211;NC interactions, highlighting the challenges and opportunities. It is hoped that this work will stimulate more research on the optical properties of metal NCs and their applications in various fields.

         <title>Natural Polymer in Soft Electronics: Opportunities, Challenges, and Future Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 25, June 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Produced and modified by living organisms, natural polymers are credible alternatives to synthetic polymers ascribing to their biodegradability, biocompatibility, and capability in interfacing with cutting&#8208;edge technologies. The adoption of natural polymers in soft electronic devices is discussed, and the key challenges in polymer&#8208;to&#8208;conductor integration, device stability, biodegradation, and their environmental impact are addressed.








Abstract
Pollution caused by nondegradable plastics has been a serious threat to environmental sustainability. Natural polymers, which can degrade in nature, provide opportunities to replace petroleum&#8208;based polymers, meanwhile driving technological advances and sustainable practices. In the research field of soft electronics, regenerated natural polymers are promising building blocks for passive dielectric substrates, active dielectric layers, and matrices in soft conductors. Here, the natural&#8208;polymer polymorphs and their compatibilization with a variety of inorganic/organic conductors through interfacial bonding/intermixing and surface functionalization for applications in various device modalities are delineated. Challenges that impede the broad utilization of natural polymers in soft electronics, including limited durability, compromises between conductivity and deformability, and limited exploration in controllable degradation, etc. are explicitly inspected, while the potential solutions along with future prospects are also proposed. Finally, integrative considerations on material properties, device functionalities, and environmental impact are addressed to warrant natural polymers as credible alternatives to synthetic ones, and provide viable options for sustainable soft electronics.

         <title>Mimicking Neuroplasticity via Ion Migration in van der Waals Layered Copper Indium Thiophosphate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 25, June 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;terminal artificial synaptic device based on layered copper indium thiophosphate is demonstrated by controlling the in&#8208;plane migration of Cu+ ions with an electric field. The device mimicks various neuroplasticity functions, such as short&#8208;term plasticity, long&#8208;term plasticity, and spike&#8208;time&#8208;dependent plasticity. The Pavlovian conditioning and activity&#8208;dependent synaptic plasticity involved neural functions are also successfully emulated.








Abstract
Artificial synaptic devices are the essential components of neuromorphic computing systems, which are capable of parallel information storage and processing with high area and energy efficiencies, showing high promise in future storage systems and in&#8208;memory computing. Analogous to the diffusion of neurotransmitter between neurons, ion&#8208;migration&#8208;based synaptic devices are becoming promising for mimicking synaptic plasticity, though the precise control of ion migration is still challenging. Due to the unique 2D nature and highly anisotropic ionic transport properties, van der Waals layered materials are attractive for synaptic device applications. Here, utilizing the high conductivity from Cu+&#8208;ion migration, a two&#8208;terminal artificial synaptic device based on layered copper indium thiophosphate is studied. By controlling the migration of Cu+ ions with an electric field, the device mimics various neuroplasticity functions, such as short&#8208;term plasticity, long&#8208;term plasticity, and spike&#8208;time&#8208;dependent plasticity. The Pavlovian conditioning and activity&#8208;dependent synaptic plasticity involved neural functions are also successfully emulated. These results show a promising opportunity to modulate ion migration in 2D materials through field&#8208;driven ionic processes, making the demonstrated synaptic device an intriguing candidate for future low&#8208;power neuromorphic applications.

         <title>Molecule Confined Isolated Metal Sites Enable the Electrocatalytic Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 25, June 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminoanthraquinone confined on isolated NiNx sites effectively modulates the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction toward hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. The NiNx sites favor oxygen reduction to OOH*. Confinement effects created by the molecule on NiNx sites promote OOH* desorption to H2O2. The molecularly confined catalyst achieves the high selectivity above 80% for H2O2 with a small overpotential.








Abstract
The direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction is a promising alternative to the industrial anthraquinone oxidation process. Selectivity to H2O2 is however limited by the four&#8208;electron pathway during oxygen reduction. Herein, it is reported that aminoanthraquinone confined isolated metal sites on carbon supports selectively steer oxygen reduction to H2O2 through the two&#8208;electron pathway. Confining isolated NiNx sites under aminoanthraquinone increases the selectivity to H2O2 from below 55% to above 80% over a wide potential range. Spectroscopy characterization and density functional theory calculations indicate that isolated NiNx sites are confined within a nanochannel formed between the molecule and the carbon support. The confinement reduces the thermodynamic barrier for OOH* desorption versus further dissociation, thus increasing the selectivity to H2O2. It is revealed how tailoring noncovalent interactions beyond the binding site can empower electrocatalysts for the direct synthesis of H2O2 through oxygen reduction.

         <title>Antiangiogenic Nanomicelles for the Topical Delivery of Aflibercept to Treat Retinal Neovascular Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 25, June 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
nEPCs + A are aflibercept&#8208;loaded nanomicelles formed by encapsulating aflibercept in an EPC copolymer solution. In this study, the ability of nEPCs + A to deliver clinically significant amounts of aflibercept to the retina for control of choroidal neovascularization in mice is described. Interestingly, nEPCs also demonstrate intrinsic antiangiogenic activity, which synergizes with their drug delivery capability for the treatment of neovascular retinal diseases.








Abstract
The traditional intravitreal injection delivery of antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti&#8208;VEGF) to the posterior segment of the eye for treatment of retinal diseases is invasive and associated with sight&#8208;threatening complications. To avoid such complications, there has been significant interest in developing polymers for topical drug delivery to the retina. This study reports a nanomicelle drug delivery system made of a copolymer EPC (nEPCs), which is capable of delivering aflibercept to the posterior segment topically through corneal&#8211;scleral routes. EPC is composed of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(propylene glycol) (PPG), and polycaprolactone (PCL) segments. In this study, aflibercept&#8208;loaded nEPCs (nEPCs + A) are capable of penetrating the cornea in ex vivo porcine eye models and deliver a clinically significant amount of aflibercept to the retina in laser&#8208;induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) murine models, causing CNV regression. nEPCs + A also demonstrate biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, this study also suggests that nEPCs have intrinsic antiangiogenic properties. The ability to deliver anti&#8208;VEGF drugs and the intrinsic antiangiogenic properties of nEPCs may result in synergistic effects, which can be harnessed for effective therapeutics. nEPCs may be a promising topical anti&#8208;VEGF delivery platform for the treatment of retinal diseases.

         <title>Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation of the Green Mussel Adhesive Protein Pvfp&#8208;5 is Regulated by the Post&#8208;Translated Dopa Amino Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 25, June 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The underwater adhesive prowess of mussels is well&#8208;known to be linked to the post&#8208;translated amino acid l&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa) present in high abundance in mussel adhesive proteins. Dopa is shown to play another important role in green mussel adhesive threads: it regulates liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation of the adhesive protein Pvfp&#8208;5, enabling biofabrication of the adhesive thread under an immersed environment.








Abstract
The underwater adhesive prowess of aquatic mussels has been largely attributed to the abundant post&#8208;translationally modified amino acid l&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa) in mussel foot proteins (MFPs) that make up their adhesive threads. More recently, it has been suggested that during thread fabrication, MFPs form intermediate fluidic phases such as liquid crystals or coacervates regulated by a liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) process. Here, it is shown that Dopa plays another central role during mussel fiber formation, by enabling LLPS of Pvfp&#8208;5&#946;, a main MFP of the green mussel Perna viridis. Using residue&#8208;specific substitution of Tyrosine (Tyr) for Dopa during recombinant expression, Dopa&#8208;substituted Pvfp&#8208;5&#946; is shown to exhibit LLPS under seawater&#8208;like conditions, whereas the Tyr&#8208;only version forms insoluble aggregates. Combining quantum chemistry calculations and solution NMR, a transient H&#8208;bonding network requiring the two hydroxyl groups of Dopa is found to be critical to enable LLPS in Dopa&#8208;mutated Pvfp&#8208;5&#946;. Overall, the study suggests that Dopa plays an important role in regulating LLPS of MFPs, which may be critical to concentrate the adhesive proteins at the plaque/substrate interface and therefore produce a more robust adhesive. The findings also provide molecular&#8208;level lessons to guide biomanufacturing of protein&#8208;based materials such as bioadhesives and load&#8208;bearing fibers.

         <title>Limiting the Uncoordinated N Species in M&#8211;Nx Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts toward Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Broad Voltage Range</title>

Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon may contain miscellaneous structures on the support, leading to misinterpretations of catalytic behavior. Here the Ni&#8211;Nx SACs in which 80% of N dopants are coordinated with Ni atoms are synthesized via joule heating to demonstrate unprecedented activity, selectivity, and stability toward electrocatalytic CO2 reduction in a broad voltage range.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are extensively studied because of their outstanding activity and selectivity toward a wide range of catalytic reactions. Amidst its development, excess dopants (e.g., nitrogen) are always required to ensure the high loading content of SACs on the carbon support. However, the use of excess dopants is accompanied by formation of miscellaneous structures (particularly the uncoordinated N species) on catalysts, leading to adverse effects on their performance. Herein, the synthesis of carbon&#8208;supported Ni SACs with precisely controlled single&#8208;atom structure via joule heating strategy, showing the coordination of 80% of N dopants with metal elements, is reported. The preclusion of the unfavorable N species is confirmed to be the main reason for the superior performance of optimized Ni SACs in electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction, which demonstrates unprecedented activity, selectivity, and stability under an exceptionally broad voltage range (&gt;92% CO selectivity in the range of &#8722;0.7 to &#8722;1.9&#160;V reversible hydrogen electrode). Such a synthetic strategy is further applicable for the design of SACs with various metals. This work demonstrates a facile method for preclusion of unfavorable dopants in the SACs and its importance in catalytic application.

         <title>Ultrathin Covalent Organic Framework Membranes via a Multi&#8208;Interfacial Engineering Strategy for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 25, June 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;interfacial engineering strategy, that is, layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer interfacial growth of two covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with different pore sizes on another relatively large&#8208;pore COF film, is proposed to form narrowed apertures at the COF&#8211;COF interfaces. One prepared ultrathin COF membrane displays H2 permeance of 2163 gas permeation units (GPU) and a H2/CO2 selectivity of 26, transcending the 2008 Robeson upper bound.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising membrane materials due to their high porosity, ordered arrangements, and high stability. However, the relatively large pore size and complicated membrane preparation processes of COFs limit their applications in sieving small gas molecules, even at a lab scale. Herein, a multi&#8208;interfacial engineering strategy is proposed, that is, direct layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer interfacial reaction of two COFs (TpPa&#8208;SO3H and TpTGCl) with different pore sizes to form narrowed apertures at the COF&#8211;COF interfaces atop a relatively large&#8208;pore COF (COF&#8208;LZU1) film. At 423 K, one fabricated 155 nm&#8208;thick ultrathin COF membrane displays H2 permeance as high as 2163 gas permeation units (GPU) and a H2/CO2 selectivity of 26, transcending the 2008 Robeson upper bound. This strategy not only provides high&#8208;performance membrane candidates for H2 separation, but also enlightens the interfacial engineering and pore engineering manipulation for other COFs, porous polymers, and their membranes.

         <title>Haptically Quantifying Young's Modulus of Soft Materials Using a Self&#8208;Locked Stretchable Strain Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 25, June 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new methodology (termed LOCK) for simply and rapidly quantifying Young's modulus of soft materials is developed. The LOCK demonstrates a miniaturized and fully mobile fingertip modulus sensor, enabling Young's modulus measurements through a simple touch, independent of touch forces. The method is universal and adaptable to a broad range of fields for opening up new applications.








Abstract
Simple and rapid Young's modulus measurements of soft materials adaptable to various scenarios are of general significance, and they require miniaturized measurement platforms with easy operation. Despite the advances made in portable and wearable approaches, acquiring and analyzing multiple or complicated signals necessitate tethered bulky components and careful preparation. Here, a new methodology based on a self&#8208;locked stretchable strain sensor to haptically quantify Young's modulus of soft materials (kPa&#8211;MPa) rapidly is reported. The method demonstrates a fingertip measurement platform, which endows a prosthetic finger with human&#8208;comparable haptic behaviors and skills on elasticity sensing without activity constraints. A universal strategy is offered toward ultraconvenient and high&#8208;efficient Young's modulus measurements with wide adaptability to various fields for unprecedented applications.

         <title>Gate&#8208;Defined Quantum Confinement in CVD 2D WS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 25, June 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatically defined quantum confinement in large&#8208;area chemical vapor deposition&#8208;grown 2D WS2 with HfO2 dielectrics grown by atomic layer deposition is reported. This marks a key milestone in scalable approaches toward 2D&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;based quantum devices, which has hitherto only been demonstrated with micrometer&#8208;sized exfoliated flakes. The measurements show that low&#8208;temperature carrier mobility is not charge impurity limited as commonly thought, but is due to another important but commonly overlooked factor: interface roughness.








Abstract
Temperature&#8208;dependent transport measurements are&#160;performed on the same set of chemical vapor deposition (CVD)&#8208;grown WS2 single&#8208; and bilayer devices before and after atomic layer deposition (ALD) of HfO2. This isolates the influence of HfO2 deposition on low&#8208;temperature carrier transport and shows that carrier mobility is not charge impurity limited as commonly thought, but due to another important but commonly overlooked factor: interface roughness. This finding is corroborated by circular dichroic photoluminescence spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoemission spectroscopy, cross&#8208;sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy, carrier&#8208;transport modeling, and density functional modeling. Finally, electrostatic gate&#8208;defined quantum confinement is demonstrated using a scalable approach of large&#8208;area CVD&#8208;grown bilayer WS2 and ALD&#8208;grown HfO2. The high dielectric constant and low leakage current enabled by HfO2 allows an estimated quantum dot size as small as 58 nm. The ability to lithographically define increasingly smaller devices is especially important for transition metal dichalcogenides due to their large effective masses, and should pave the way toward their use in quantum information processing applications.

         <title>Dual Tumor Microenvironment Remodeling by Glucose&#8208;Contained Radical Copolymer for MRI&#8208;Guided Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 25, June 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents new insights on CUDC101 in the reprogramming of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages toward antitumor M1 phenotype by CD47 inhibition with a glucose&#8208;contained magnetic resonance imaging&#8208;capable supramolecular rod&#8208;like micelle, and phototriggered p53 by codelivery of IR780 can achieve the synergistic effect in the transition from cold immunosuppressive to hot immunoresponsive tumor microenvironment.








Abstract
Aberrant glucose metabolism and immune evasion are recognized as two hallmarks of cancer, which contribute to poor treatment efficiency and tumor progression. Herein, a novel material system consisting of a glucose and TEMPO (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl) at the distal ends of PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA block copolymer (glucose&#8208;PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA&#8208;TEMPO), is designed to encapsulate clinical therapeutics CUDC101 and photosensitizer IR780. The specific core&#8211;shell rod structure formed by the designed copolymer renders TEMPO radicals excellent stability against reduction&#8208;induced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) silence. Tumor&#8208;targeting moiety endowed by glucose provides the radical copolymer outstanding multimodal imaging capabilities, including MRI, photoacoustic imaging, and fluorescence imaging. Efficient delivery of CUDC101 and IR780 is achieved to synergize the antitumor immune activation through IR780&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) and CUDC101&#8208;triggered CD47 inhibition, showing M1 phenotype polarization of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs). More intriguingly, this study demonstrates PDT&#8208;stimulated p53 can also re&#8208;educate TAMs, providing a combined strategy of using dual tumor microenvironment remodeling to achieve the synergistic effect in the transition from cold immunosuppressive to hot immunoresponsive tumor microenvironment.

&lt;p&gt;This study presents new insights on CUDC101 in the reprogramming of tumor-associated macrophages toward antitumor M1 phenotype by CD47 inhibition with a glucose-contained magnetic resonance imaging-capable supramolecular rod-like micelle, and phototriggered p53 by codelivery of IR780 can achieve the synergistic effect in the transition from cold immunosuppressive to hot immunoresponsive tumor microenvironment.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aberrant glucose metabolism and immune evasion are recognized as two hallmarks of cancer, which contribute to poor treatment efficiency and tumor progression. Herein, a novel material system consisting of a glucose and TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl) at the distal ends of PEO-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PLLA block copolymer (glucose-PEO-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PLLA-TEMPO), is designed to encapsulate clinical therapeutics CUDC101 and photosensitizer IR780. The specific core&#8211;shell rod structure formed by the designed copolymer renders TEMPO radicals excellent stability against reduction-induced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) silence. Tumor-targeting moiety endowed by glucose provides the radical copolymer outstanding multimodal imaging capabilities, including MRI, photoacoustic imaging, and fluorescence imaging. Efficient delivery of CUDC101 and IR780 is achieved to synergize the antitumor immune activation through IR780-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) and CUDC101-triggered CD47 inhibition, showing M1 phenotype polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). More intriguingly, this study demonstrates PDT-stimulated p53 can also re-educate TAMs, providing a combined strategy of using dual tumor microenvironment remodeling to achieve the synergistic effect in the transition from cold immunosuppressive to hot immunoresponsive tumor microenvironment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multimodal Tuning of Synaptic Plasticity Using Persistent Luminescent Memitters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 25, June 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of memristive materials based on persistent luminescent memitters emulates synaptic plasticity and memory without requiring sophisticated devices. Experimental and theoretical data suggest that electron&#8208;coupled trap nucleation and propagation through clustering in persistent luminescent memitters can explain experience&#8208;dependent plasticity. Multichannel image memorization involving persistent luminescent memitters allows direct visualization of short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term memory.








Abstract
Mimicking memory processes, including encoding, storing, and retrieving information, is critical for neuromorphic computing and artificial intelligence. Synaptic behavior simulations through electronic, magnetic, or photonic devices based on metal oxides, 2D materials, molecular complex and phase change materials, represent important strategies for performing computational tasks with enhanced power efficiency. Here, a special class of memristive materials based on persistent luminescent memitters (termed as a portmanteau of &#8220;memory&#8221; and &#8220;emitter&#8221;) with optical characteristics closely resembling those of biological synapses is reported. The memory process and synaptic plasticity can be successfully emulated using such memitters under precisely controlled excitation frequency, wavelength, pulse number, and power density. The experimental and theoretical data suggest that electron&#8208;coupled trap nucleation and propagation through clustering in persistent luminescent memitters can explain experience&#8208;dependent plasticity. The use of persistent luminescent memitters for multichannel image memorization that allows direct visualization of subtle changes in luminescence intensity and realization of short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term memory is also demonstrated. These findings may promote the discovery of new functional materials as artificial synapses and enhance the understanding of memory mechanisms.

         <title>Wafer&#8208;Scale 2D Hafnium Diselenide Based Memristor Crossbar Array for Energy&#8208;Efficient Neural Network Hardware</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 25, June 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D hafnium diselenide (HfSe2) memristor crossbar array (CBA) is demonstrated via wafer&#8208;scale molecular beam epitaxy growth and metal&#8208;assisted van der Waals transfer techniques. The CBA enables artificial neural network with high recognition accuracy of 93.34%, and achieves hardware convolution image processing using energy&#8208;efficient multiply&#8208;and accumulate operations.








Abstract
Memristor crossbar with programmable conductance could overcome the energy consumption and speed limitations of neural networks when executing core computing tasks in image processing. However, the implementation of crossbar array (CBA) based on ultrathin 2D materials is hindered by challenges associated with large&#8208;scale material synthesis and device integration. Here, a memristor CBA is demonstrated using wafer&#8208;scale (2&#8208;inch) polycrystalline hafnium diselenide (HfSe2) grown by molecular beam epitaxy, and a metal&#8208;assisted van der Waals transfer technique. The memristor exhibits small switching voltage (0.6&#160;V), low switching energy (0.82 pJ), and simultaneously achieves emulation of synaptic weight plasticity. Furthermore, the CBA enables artificial neural network with a high recognition accuracy of 93.34%. Hardware multiply&#8208;and&#8208;accumulate (MAC) operation with a narrow error distribution of 0.29% is also demonstrated, and a high power efficiency of greater than 8&#8208;trillion operations per second per Watt is achieved. Based on the MAC results, hardware convolution image processing can be performed using programmable kernels (i.e., soft, horizontal, and vertical edge enhancement), which constitutes a vital function for neural network hardware.

Electrochemical CO2 Reduction
In article number 2103900, Lei Wang and Jiayi Chen discuss the catalyst dynamic changes observed during catalysis, based on the recent reports of electrochemical CO2 reduction. Dynamic changes can occur for both the electrocatalyst and the surrounding microenvironment, and they play important roles in controlling the catalytic performance. Understanding the origins of the effects from catalyst dynamic changes and the reaction environment will allow better control over the CO2 reduction toward desired products.

Quantum Dots
In article 2103907, Kuan Eng Johnson Goh and co&#8208;workers report electrostatically defined quantum dots in bilayer WS2 grown by chemical vapor deposition and capped by HfO2 dielectric using atomic layer deposition. This marks a key milestone in scalable approaches toward 2D&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;based quantum devices, which had hitherto only been demonstrated with micrometer&#8208;sized exfoliated flakes.

Urban Farming
Urban farming has several advantages over conventional farming: higher productivity, improved sustainability, and the ability to provide fresh food all year round. In article number 2105009, Yeng Ming Lam and co&#8208;workers highlight novel materials that are key to accelerating  the evolution of urban farming, with their ability to facilitate controlled release of nutrients and pesticides, improve seed health, substrates with better water retention capability, more efficient recycling of agricultural waste, and precise plant health monitoring.

Covalent Organic Frameworks
The relatively large pore sizes and complicated membrane preparation processes of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) limit their applications in sieving small gas molecules. In article number 2104946, Dan Zhao and co&#8208;workers report a multi&#8208;interfacial engineering strategy, i.e., a direct layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer interfacial reaction of two COFs with different pore sizes to form narrowed apertures at the COF&#8211;COF interfaces atop another relatively large&#8208;pore COF film gutter layer. The narrowed pore apertures make the hybrid membranes suitable for the separation of H2 from CO2.

Strain Sensors
The Young's modulus of soft tissues can be haptically measured using a single stretchable strain sensor, as reported by Guoying Deng, Chuanlai Xu, Xiaodong Chen, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2104078. The technology will enable a doctor to quantify the softness of swollen tissues simply by touching, independent of the touching force. The new methodology for Young's modulus measurement is simple, rapid, and widely adaptable to various scenarios.

         <title>Novel Materials for Urban Farming</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 25, June 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel materials are key to accelerate the development of technologies to improve the productivity and ensure the sustainability of urban farming. The novel material concepts help in improving seed treatment, alternative substrates, nutrients or pesticide delivery, environmental management, and plant health monitoring. This review highlights the current and potential research directions and challenges in these areas.








Abstract
Scarcity of natural resources, shifting demographics, climate change, and increasing waste are four major challenges in the quest to feed the exploding world population. These challenges serve as the impetus to harness novel technologies to improve agriculture, productivity, and sustainability. Urban farming has several advantages over conventional farming: higher productivity, improved sustainability, and the ability to provide fresh food all year round. Novel materials are key to accelerating the evolution of urban farming &#8211; with their ability to facilitate controlled release of nutrients and pesticides, improved seed health, substrates with better water retention capability, more efficient recycling of agricultural waste, and precise plant health monitoring. Materials science enables environmental sustainability and higher harvest yields in urban farms. Here, Singapore is used as an example of a land&#8208;scarce city where urban farming may be the solution for future food production. Potential research directions and challenges in urban farming are highlighted, and how material optimization and innovation drive the development of urban farming to meet national and global food demands is briefly discussed. This review serves as a guide for researchers and a reference for stakeholders of urban farms, policy makers, and other interested parties.

         <title>Interlayer Excitons in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Semiconductors for 2D Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 25, June 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interlayer excitons in 2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenide heterostructures have attracted great attention recently, and are creating their identities and impacts. A brief overview of the enticing properties of interlayer excitons in strong quantum confinement, broadband and tunable spectrum, ultrafast dynamics, and electrical manipulation is given, illustrating the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments and their grand potential in ultralow&#8208;threshold lasing emission, broadband photodetection, valleytronics, and future excitonic transistors.








Abstract
Optoelectronic materials that allow on&#8208;chip integrated light signal emitting, routing, modulation, and detection are crucial for the development of high&#8208;speed and high&#8208;throughput optical communication and computing technologies. Interlayer excitons in 2D van der Waals heterostructures, where electrons and holes are bounded by Coulomb interaction but spatially localized in different 2D layers, have recently attracted intense attention for their enticing properties and huge potential in device applications. Here, a general view of these 2D&#8208;confined hydrogen&#8208;like bosonic particles and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments with respect to the frontier concepts and prototypes is presented. Staggered type&#8208;II band alignment enables expansion of the interlayer direct bandgap from the intrinsic visible in monolayers up to the near&#8208; or even mid&#8208;infrared spectrum. Owing to large exciton binding energy, together with ultralong lifetime, room&#8208;temperature exciton devices and observation of quantum behaviors are demonstrated. With the rapid advances, it can be anticipated that future studies of interlayer excitons will not only allow the construction of all&#8208;exciton information processing circuits but will also continue to enrich the panoply of ideas on quantum phenomena.

         <title>Evolution from Lead&#8208;Based to Lead&#8208;Free Piezoelectrics: Engineering of Lattices, Domains, Boundaries, and Defects Leading to Giant Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 25, June 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergetic combination of conventional and emergent strategies to enhance piezoelectricity, with a deeper understanding of structure&#8211;property relationship using advanced state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques, can lead to a breakthrough in giant piezoelectricity with the desired characteristics.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials are known to mankind for more than a century, with numerous advancements made in both scientific understandings and practical applications. In the last two decades, in particular, the research on piezoelectrics has largely been driven by the constantly changing technological demand, and the drive toward a sustainable society. Hence, environmental&#8208;friendly &#8220;lead&#8208;free piezoelectrics&#8221; have emerged in the anticipation of replacing lead&#8208;based counterparts with at least comparable performance. However, there are still obstacles to be overcome for realizing this objective, while the efforts in this direction already seem to culminate. Therefore, novel structural strategies need to be designed to address these issues and for further breakthrough in this field. Here, various strategies to enhance piezoelectric properties in lead&#8208;free systems with fundamental and historical context, and from atomic to macroscopic scale, are explored. The main challenges currently faced in the transition from lead&#8208;based to lead&#8208;free piezoelectrics are identified and key milestones for future research in this field are suggested. These include: i) decoding the fundamental mechanisms; ii) large temperature&#8208;stable piezoresponse; and iii) fabrication&#8208;friendly and tailorable composition. Strategic insights and general guidelines for the synergistic design of new piezoelectric materials for obtaining a large piezoelectric response are also provided.

         <title>Halide Perovskite Solar Cells for Building Integrated Photovoltaics: Transforming Building Fa&#231;ades into Power Generators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 25, June 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To increase solar production in city centers, one either needs to increase the power generation per unit area or increase the harvesting area by utilizing the building fa&#231;ade for solar electricity generation. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) appear to be an ideal solution for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs), which transforms windows or fa&#231;ades into electric power generators.








Abstract
The rapid emergence of organic&#8211;inorganic lead halide perovskites for low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaics promises to impact new photovoltaic concepts. Their high power conversion efficiencies, ability to coat perovskite layers on glass via various scalable deposition techniques, excellent optoelectronic properties, and synthetic versatility for modulating transparency and color allow perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to be an ideal solution for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs), which transforms windows or fa&#231;ades into electric power generators. In this review, the unique features and properties of PSCs for BIPV application are accessed. Device engineering and optical management strategies of active layers, interlayers, and electrodes for semitransparent, bifacial, and colorful PSCs are also discussed. The performance of PSCs under conditions that are relevant for BIPV such as different operational temperature, light intensity, and light incident angle are also reviewed. Recent outdoor stability testing of PSCs in different countries and other demonstration of scalability and deployment of PSCs are also spotlighted. Finally, the current challenges and future opportunities for realizing perovskite&#8208;based BIPV are discussed.

         <title>Redox Targeting of Energy Materials for Energy Storage and Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 25, June 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox&#8208;targeting process provides great operation flexibility in circumventing the constraints intrinsically posed by the conventional electrochemical systems. It involves a regenerative close&#8208;loop electrochemical&#8211;chemical cycle between an electrolyte&#8208;borne redox mediator and an energy storage/conversion material when implemented in redox&#8208;flow cells, boosting the energy density, and offering an intriguing research platform applied to a variety of chemistries for different applications.








Abstract
The redox&#8208;targeting (RT) process or redox&#8208;mediated process, which provides great operation flexibility in circumventing the constraints intrinsically posed by the conventional electrochemical systems, is intriguing for various energy storage and conversion applications. Implementation of the RT reactions in redox&#8208;flow cells, which involves a close&#8208;loop electrochemical&#8211;chemical cycle between an electrolyte&#8208;borne redox mediator and an energy storage or conversion material, not only boosts the energy density of flow battery system, but also offers a versatile research platform applied to a wide variety of chemistries for different applications. Here, the recent progress of RT&#8208;based energy storage and conversion systems is summarized and great versatility of RT processes for various energy&#8208;related applications is demonstrated, particularly for large&#8208;scale energy storage, spatially decoupled water electrolysis, electrolytic N2 reduction, thermal&#8208;to&#8208;electrical conversion, spent battery material recycling, and more. The working principle, materials aspects, and factors dictating the operation are highlighted to reveal the critical roles of RT reactions for each application. In addition, the challenges lying ahead for deployment are stated and recommendations for addressing these constraints are provided. It is anticipated that the RT concept of energy materials will provide important implications and eventually offer a credible solution for advanced large&#8208;scale energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Upcycling to Sustainably Reuse Plastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 25, June 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plastics are mixed blessings that are convenient to our&#160;daily lives but have created a major environmental crisis. There are growing calls worldwide to reduce consumption, reuse more, recycle, and upcycle plastics. However, reducing, reusing, and recycling delay, rather than overcome the plastics problem. Here, more sustainable alternative approaches and technologies for plastics upcycling are reviewed.








Abstract
Plastics are now indispensable in daily lives. However, the pollution from plastics is also increasingly becoming a serious environmental issue. Recent years have seen more sustainable approaches and technologies, commonly known as upcycling, to transform plastics into value&#8208;added materials and chemical feedstocks. In this review, the latest research on upcycling is presented, with a greater focus on the use of renewable energy as well as the more selective methods to repurpose synthetic polymers. First, thermal upcycling approaches are briefly introduced, including the redeployment of plastics for construction uses, 3D printing precursors, and lightweight materials. Then, some of the latest novel strategies to deconstruct condensation polymers to monomers for repolymerization or introduce vulnerable linkers to make the plastics more degradable are discussed. Subsequently, the review will explore the breakthroughs in plastics upcycling by heterogeneous and homogeneous photocatalysis, as well as electrocatalysis, which transform plastics into more versatile fine chemicals and materials while simultaneously mitigating global climate change. In addition, some of the biotechnological advances in the discovery and engineering of microbes that can decompose plastics are also presented. Finally, the current challenges and outlook for future plastics upcycling are discussed to stimulate global cooperation in this field.

In this review, the latest research on upcycling is presented, with a greater focus on the use of renewable energy as well as the more selective methods to repurpose synthetic polymers. First, thermal upcycling approaches are briefly introduced, including the redeployment of plastics for construction uses, 3D printing precursors, and lightweight materials. Then, some of the latest novel strategies to deconstruct condensation polymers to monomers for repolymerization or introduce vulnerable linkers to make the plastics more degradable are discussed. Subsequently, the review will explore the breakthroughs in plastics upcycling by heterogeneous and homogeneous photocatalysis, as well as electrocatalysis, which transform plastics into more versatile fine chemicals and materials while simultaneously mitigating global climate change. In addition, some of the biotechnological advances in the discovery and engineering of microbes that can decompose plastics are also presented. Finally, the current challenges and outlook for future plastics upcycling are discussed to stimulate global cooperation in this field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Green Recycling Methods to Treat Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries E&#8208;Waste: A Circular Approach to Sustainability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 25, June 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emerging green recycling processes for spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) are covered here, including bioleaching, waste&#8208;for&#8208;waste, and electrochemical methods that employ environmentally friendly sustainable technologies. It also highlights methods to regenerate recovered elements from spent LIB. The circular economy approach toward closed&#8208;loop LIB recycling is elaborated through approaches to reprocess recovered elements into electrodes and reusing them to fabricate new LIBs.








Abstract
E&#8208;waste generated from end&#8208;of&#8208;life spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is increasing at a rapid rate owing to the increasing consumption of these batteries in portable electronics, electric vehicles, and renewable energy storage worldwide. On the one hand, landfilling and incinerating LIBs e&#8208;waste poses environmental and safety concerns owing to their constituent materials. On the other hand, scarcity of metal resources used in manufacturing LIBs and potential value creation through the recovery of these metal resources from spent LIBs has triggered increased interest in recycling spent LIBs from e&#8208;waste. State of the art recycling of spent LIBs involving pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy processes generates considerable unwanted environmental concerns. Hence, alternative innovative approaches toward the green recycling process of spent LIBs are essential to tackle large volumes of spent LIBs in an environmentally friendly way. Such evolving techniques for spent LIBs recycling based on green approaches, including bioleaching, waste for waste approach, and electrodeposition, are discussed here. Furthermore, the ways to regenerate strategic metals post leaching, efficiently reprocess extracted high&#8208;value materials, and reuse them in applications including electrode materials for new LIBs. The concept of &#8220;circular economy&#8221; is highlighted through closed&#8208;loop recycling of spent LIBs achieved through green&#8208;sustainable approaches.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis: From Simple Reactions to the Synthesis of Complex Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 25, June 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mimicking the homogeneous catalytic process for fine chemical production is the ultimate goal for single&#8208;atom catalysis (SAC) in view of their structural similarity. This review presents the recent progress of SAC on complex liquid&#8208;phase transformations and highlights the importance of chemoselectivity and structural dynamism for building up molecular complexity through late&#8208;stage functionalization, sequential, and multicomponent strategies.








Abstract
To date, the scope of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SAC) in liquid&#8208;phase transformations is rather limited owing to stability issues and the inability to activate complex substances. This calls for a better design of the catalyst support that can provide a dynamic coordination environment needed for catalytic action, and yet retain robustness against leaching or aggregation. In addition, the chemical orthogonality of SAC is useful for designing tandem or multicomponent reactions, in which side reactions common to metal nanoparticles are suppressed. In this review, the intrinsic mechanism will be highlighted that controls reaction efficiency and selectivity in SAC&#8208;catalyzed pathways, as well as the structural dynamism of SAC under complex liquid&#8208;phase conditions. These mechanistic insights are helpful for the development of next&#8208;generation SAC systems for the synthesis of high&#8208;value pharmaceuticals through late&#8208;stage functionalization, sequential and multicomponent strategies.

         <title>Effects of the Catalyst Dynamic Changes and Influence of the Reaction Environment on the Performance of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 25, June 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focus on understanding the origin of the dynamic changes at the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface, and uncovering the interplays between these changes and the CO2 reduction performance, the obtained insights can guide the design of catalysts and reactors for the efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction.








Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) is substantially researched due to its potential for storing intermittent renewable electricity and simultaneously helping mitigating the pressing CO2 emission concerns. The major challenge of electrochemical CO2 reduction lies on having good controls of this reaction due to its complicated reaction networks and its unusual sensitivity to the dynamic changes of the catalyst structure (chemical states, compositions, facets and morphology, etc.), and to the non&#8208;catalyst components at the electrode/electrolyte interface, in another word the reaction environments. To date, a comprehensive analysis on the interplays between the above catalyst&#8208;dynamic&#8208;changes/reaction environments and the CO2 reduction performance is rare, if not none. In this review, the catalyst dynamic changes observed during the catalysis are discussed based on the recent reports of electrochemical CO2 reduction. Then, the above dynamic changes are correlated to their effects on the catalytic performance. The influences of the reaction environments on the performance of CO2 reduction are also discussed. Finally, some perspectives on future investigations are offered with the aim of understanding the origins of the effects from the catalyst dynamic changes and the reaction environments, which will allow one to better control the CO2 reduction toward the desired products.

Successful examples, the challenges of deploying AI in real&#8208;word scenarios, and an integrated framework are analyzed and outlined.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) are vital energy&#8208;storage devices in modern society. However, the performance and cost are still not satisfactory in terms of energy density, power density, cycle life, safety, etc. To further improve the performance of batteries, traditional &#8220;trial&#8208;and&#8208;error&#8221; processes require a vast number of tedious experiments. Computational chemistry and artificial intelligence (AI) can significantly accelerate the research and development of novel battery systems. Herein, a heterogeneous category of AI technology for predicting and discovering battery materials and estimating the state of the battery system is reviewed. Successful examples, the challenges of deploying AI in real&#8208;world scenarios, and an integrated framework are analyzed and outlined. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research about the applications of ML in the property prediction and battery discovery, including electrolyte and electrode materials, are further summarized. Meanwhile, the prediction of battery states is also provided. Finally, various existing challenges and the framework to tackle the challenges on the further development of machine learning for rechargeable LIBs are proposed.

         <title>Lasing Action from Quasi&#8208;propagating Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Band edges at the high symmetry points in reciprocal space of periodic structures hold special interest in materials engineering for their high density of states. In optical metamaterials, standing waves found at these points have facilitated lasing, bound&#8208;states&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;continuum, and Bose&#8208;Einstein condensation. However, because high symmetry points by definition are localized, properties associated with them are limited to specific energies and wavevectors. Conversely, quasi&#8208;propagating modes along high symmetry directions are predicted to enable similar phenomena over a continuum of energies and wavevectors. Here we&#160;show quasi&#8208;propagating modes in 2D nanoparticle lattices can support lasing action over a continuous range of wavelengths and symmetry&#8208;determined directions from a single device. Using lead halide perovskite nanocrystal films as gain materials, we&#160;achieved lasing from waveguide&#8208;surface lattice resonance (W&#8208;SLR) modes that can be decomposed into propagating waves along high symmetry directions and standing waves in the orthogonal direction that provide optical feedback. We&#160;analyzed the characteristics of the lasing beams using an analytical 3D model that describes diffracted light in 2D lattices. Demonstrations of lasing across different wavelengths and lattice designs highlight how quasi&#8208;propagating modes offer possibilities to engineer chromatic multi&#8208;beam emission important in hyperspectral 3D sensing, high bandwidth Li&#8208;Fi communication, and laser projection displays.

However, because high symmetry points by definition are localized, properties associated with them are limited to specific energies and wavevectors. Conversely, quasi-propagating modes along high symmetry directions are predicted to enable similar phenomena over a continuum of energies and wavevectors. Here we&#160;show quasi-propagating modes in 2D nanoparticle lattices can support lasing action over a continuous range of wavelengths and symmetry-determined directions from a single device. Using lead halide perovskite nanocrystal films as gain materials, we&#160;achieved lasing from waveguide-surface lattice resonance (W-SLR) modes that can be decomposed into propagating waves along high symmetry directions and standing waves in the orthogonal direction that provide optical feedback. We&#160;analyzed the characteristics of the lasing beams using an analytical 3D model that describes diffracted light in 2D lattices. Demonstrations of lasing across different wavelengths and lattice designs highlight how quasi-propagating modes offer possibilities to engineer chromatic multi-beam emission important in hyperspectral 3D sensing, high bandwidth Li-Fi communication, and laser projection displays.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Composition Engineering of Amorphous Nickel Boride Nanoarchitectures Enabling Highly Efficient Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>

Abstract
Developing advanced electrocatalysts with exceptional two electron (2e&#8211;) selectivity, activity and stability are crucial for driving oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Herein, a composition engineering strategy has been adapted to flexibly regulate the intrinsic activity of amorphous nickel boride nanoarchitectures for efficient 2e&#8211; ORR by oriented reduction of Ni2+ with different amounts of BH4&#8211;. Among borides, the amorphous NiB2 delivers the 2e&#8211; selectivity close to 99% at 0.4&#160;V and over 93% in a wide potential range, together with a negligible activity decay under prolonged time. Notably, an ultrahigh H2O2 production rate of 4.753&#160;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 has been achieved upon assembling NiB2 in the practical gas diffusion electrode. The combination of X&#8208;ray absorption and in situ Raman spectroscopy, as well as transient photovoltage measurements with density functional theory unequivocally reveal that the atomic ratio between Ni and B induces the local electronic structure diversity, allowing optimization of the adsorption energy of Ni towards *OOH and reducing the interfacial charge transfer kinetics to inhibit the formation of O&#8208;O.

         <title>Diammonium&#8208;Mediated Perovskite Film Formation for High&#8208;Luminescence Red Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;luminance red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are enabled by diammonium&#8208;mediated perovskite formation. The diammonium halide promotes the formation of stable bromide&#8208;rich quasi&#8208;2D phases at the surface of 3D perovskites, leading to efficient defect passivation, suppression of ion migration, and reduced lattice strain. The optimized PeLEDs exhibit a record luminance (&gt;105 cd m&#8722;2) and half&#8208;lifetime (&gt;15 h) among red&#8208;emissive 3D PeLEDs.








Abstract
3D mixed&#8208;halide perovskite&#8208;based red emitters combine excellent charge&#8208;transport characteristics with simple solution processing and good film formation; however, light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on these emitters cannot yet outperform their nanocrystal counterparts. Here the use of diammonium halides in regulating the formation of mixed bromide&#8211;iodide perovskite films is explored. It is found that the diammonium cations preferentially bond to Pb&#8211;Br, rather than Pb&#8211;I, octahedra, promoting the formation of quasi&#8208;2D phases. It is proposed that the perovskite formation is initially dominated by the crystallization of the thermodynamically more favorable 3D phase, but, as the solution gets depleted from the regular A cations, thin shells of amorphous quasi&#8208;2D perovskites form. This leads to crystalline perovskite grains with efficiently passivated surfaces and reduced lattice strain. As a result, the diammonium&#8208;treated perovskite LEDs demonstrate a record luminance (10745&#160;cd m&#8722;2) and half&#8208;lifetime among 3D perovskite&#8208;based red LEDs.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Broadband Strong Electromagnetic Interference Shielding with Ferromagnetic Graphene Quartz Fabric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel broadband, strong electromagnetic intereference (EMI) shielding response fabric based on highly structured ferromagnetic graphene quartz fibers is demonstrated, which combines high conductivity and ferromagnetism to attain a synergistic effect for EMI shielding and electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption, along with the specific woven superstructure of the fabric to introduce the additional multiple reflections and multichannel absorption of EMWs.








Abstract
Flexible electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials with ultrahigh shielding effectiveness (SE) are highly desirable for high&#8208;speed electronic devices to attenuate radiated emissions. For hindering interference of their internal or external EMI fields, however, a metallic enclosure suffers from relatively low SE, band&#8208;limited anti&#8208;EMI responses, poor corrosion resistance, and non&#8208;adaptability to the complex geometry of a given circuit. Here, a broadband, strong EMI shielding response fabric is demonstrated based on a highly structured ferromagnetic graphene quartz fiber (FGQF) via a modulation&#8208;doped chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth process. The precise control of the graphitic N&#8208;doping configuration endows graphene coatings on specifically designable quartz fabric weave with both high conductivity (3906 S&#160;cm&#8722;1) and high magnetic responsiveness (a saturation magnetization of &#8776;0.14 emu&#160;g&#8722;1 under 300 K), thus attaining synergistic effect of EMI shielding and electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption for broadband anti&#8208;EMI technology. The large&#8208;scale durable FGQF exhibits extraordinary EMI SE of &#8776;107&#160;dB over a broadband frequency (1&#8211;18&#160;GHz), by configuring &#8776;20&#160;nm&#8208;thick graphene coatings on a millimeter&#8208;thick quartz fabric. This work enables the potential for development of an industrial&#8208;scale, flexible, lightweight, durable, and ultra&#8208;broadband strong shielding material in advanced applications of flexible anti&#8208;electronic reconnaissance, antiradiation, and stealthy technologies.

         <title>An All&#8208;Organic Self&#8208;Powered Photodetector with Ultraflexible Dual&#8208;Polarity Output for Biosignal Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;organic self&#8208;powered photodetector with ultraflexibility and dual&#8208;polarity output is successfully fabricated by an all&#8208;solution method, which is expected to have great application potential in realizing multifunctional, portable, and wearable electronic devices.








Abstract
Endowing photodetectors with mechanically flexibility and actual functionality are current research issues in developing optoelectronic devices. However, rigid metal&#8208;based or metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;based electrodes remain a block to the realization of ultraflexible electronics. Thus, an ultraflexible all&#8208;organic photodetector (all&#8208;OPD) is designed by innovatively introducing symmetrical organic electrodes PH1000/PH1000 to substitute the widely applied indium&#8208;doped tin oxide (ITO)/Ag electrodes. Specifically, this all&#8208;OPD exhibits a high self&#8208;powered responsivity (R) of over 100&#160;mA W&#8722;1 among 500&#8211;600&#160;nm and the photocurrent remains about 80% of the original performance after being bent 20&#160;000 circles, and can output steady biosignals for photo&#8208;plethysmography (PPG) application. More importantly, this all&#8208;OPD outputs dual&#8208;polarity photocurrent as it is flipped or folded. Benefitting from the ordered phase distribution and designed Schottky barrier heights, the photogenerated holes will be transferred and collected by nearer electrode, while electrons will be trapped in the thick bulk heterojunction (BHJ) as a result of the long channel. This work offers a new avenue toward developing a multifunctional and ultraflexible all&#8208;OPD with a straightforward all&#8208;solution method, and it is expected to be more compatible in complex application scenarios.

All the reported perovskite modules have a combination of different deposition methods for the perovskites and the charge&#8208;transport layers, which limits high&#8208;throughput module production. A combination of any amine molecules and 4&#8208;(2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylbenzenamine (N&#8208;DMBI) added in phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) allows the electrically conductive PCBM layers to conformally cover the perovskites and achieve high&#8208;efficiency&#160;PSCs and modules with all&#8208;bladed perovskite and charge&#8208;transport layers.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising to reduce the cost of photovoltaic system due to their low&#8208;cost raw materials and high&#8208;throughput solution process; however, fabrication of&#160;all the active layers in perovskite modules using a scalable solution process has not yet been demonstrated. Herein, the fabrication of highly efficient PSCs and modules in ambient conditions is reported, with all layers bladed except the metal electrode, by blading a 36&#160;&#177;&#160;9&#160;nm&#8208;thick electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) on perovskite films with a roughness of &#8776;80&#160;nm. A combination of additives in phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) allows the PCBM to conformally cover the perovskites and still have a good electrical conductivity. Amine&#8208;functionalized molecules are added to enhance both the dispersity of PCBM and the affinity to perovskites. A PCBM dopant of 4&#8208;(2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylbenzenamine (N&#8208;DMBI) recovers the conductivity loss induced by the small amine molecules. PSCs (0.08 cm2) fabricated by the all&#8208;blading process reache an average efficiency of 22.4&#160;&#177;&#160;0.5%&#160;and a champion efficiency of 23.1% for perovskites with a bandgap of 1.51&#160;eV, with much better stability compared to evaporated ETL PSCs. The all&#8208;bladed minimodule (25.03 cm2) shows an aperture efficiency of &#8776;19.3%, showing the good uniformity of the bladed ETLs.

         <title>Zwitterion&#8208;functionalized SnO2 Substrate Induced Sequential Deposition of Black Phase FAPbI3 with Rearranged PbI2 Residue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Black phase formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) with narrow band gap and high thermal stability has emerged as the most promising candidate for highly efficient and stable perovskite photovoltaics. In order to overcome the intrinsic difficulty of black phase crystallization and to eliminate the PbI2 residue, most sequential deposition methods of FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskite would introduce external ions like methylammonium (MA+), cesium (Cs+), and bromide (Br&#8211;) ions to the perovskite structure of the light absorbing layer. Here we introduce a zwitterion&#8208;functionalized SnO2 as the electron transport layer (ETL) to induce the crystallization of high quality black phase FAPbI3 on such SnO2 substrate. The SnO2 ETL treated with the zwitterion, formamidine sulfinic acid (FSA), can help rearrange the stack direction, orientation and distribution of residual PbI2 in perovskite layer, which reduces the side effect of the residual PbI2 to the perovskite structure. Besides, the FSA functionalization also modifies SnO2 ETL to suppress the deep&#8208;level defects at the perovskite/SnO2 interface. As a result, the FSA&#8208;FAPbI3 based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit an excellent power conversion efficiency up to 24.1% with 1000 h long&#8208;term operational stability, which is among the highest values for FAPbI3 PSCs fabricated from sequential deposition. Our findings provide a new interface engineering strategy on the sequential fabrication of black phase FAPbI3 PSCs with improved optoelectronic performance.

         <title>Amplifying Molecular Scale Rotary Motion: The Marriage of Overcrowded Alkene Molecular Motor with Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Design and fabrication of macroscopic functional devices by molecular engineering is an emerging and effective strategy in exploration of advanced materials. Photo&#8208;responsive overcrowded alkene&#8208;based molecular motor (OAMM) has been considered as one of the most promising molecular machines due to the unique rotary motion driven by light with high temporal and spatial precision. Amplifying the molecular rotary motions into macroscopic behaviors of photo&#8208;directed systems links the molecular dynamics with macroscopic motions of materials, providing new opportunities to design novel materials and devices with a bottom&#8208;up strategy. In this review, we will summarize recent developments of the light&#8208;responsive liquid crystal system triggered by OAMM. The mechanism of amplification effect of liquid crystal matrix will be introduced firstly. Then progress of the OAMM&#8208;driven liquid crystal materials will be described including light&#8208;controlled photonic crystals, texture&#8208;tunable liquid crystal coating and micro&#8208;spheres, photo&#8208;actuated soft robots and dynamic optical devices. We hope that this review provides inspirations in design and exploration of light&#8208;driven soft matters and novel functional materials from molecular engineering to structural modification.

         <title>Fabrication and Functionality Integration Technologies for Small&#8208;scale Soft Robots</title>

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Small&#8208;scale soft robots have been attracting increasing interest for visible and potential applications owing to their safety and tolerance resulting from their intrinsic soft bodies or compliant structures. However, it is not sufficient that the soft bodies merely provide support or system protection. More importantly, to meet the increasing demands of controllable operation and real&#8208;time feedback in unstructured/complicated scenarios, these robots are required to perform simplex and multimodal functionalities for sensing, communicating and interacting with external environments during large or dynamic deformation with the risk of mismatch or delamination. Challenges are encountered during fabrication and integration, including the selection and fabrication of composite/materials and structures, integration of active/passive functional modules with robust interfaces, particularly with highly deformable soft/stretchable bodies. In this review, methods and strategies of fabricating structural soft bodies and integrating them with functional modules for developing small&#8208;scale soft robots are investigated. Utilizing templating, 3D printing, transfer printing and swelling, small&#8208;scale soft robots can be endowed with several perceptual capabilities corresponding to diverse stimulus, such as light, heat, magnetism and force. The integration of sensing and functionalities effectively enhances the agility, adaptability and universality of soft robots when applied in various fields, including smart manufacturing, medical surgery, biomimetic and other interdisciplinary sciences.

         <title>Stoichiometric Post Modification of Hydrogel Microparticles Dictates Neural Stem Cell Fate in Microporous Annealed Particle Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffolds are generated from assembled hydrogel microparticles (HMPs). We previously demonstrated that MAP scaffolds are porous, biocompatible, and recruit neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to the stroke cavity after injection into the stroke core. Here, our goal is to study NPC fate inside MAP scaffolds in vitro. To create plain HMPs that can later be converted to contain different types of bioactivities, we utilized the inverse electron&#8208;demand Deiels&#8208;Alder reaction between tetrazine and norbornene, which allowed us to post modify plain HMPs stoichiometrically. As a result of adhesive peptide attachment, NPC spreading led to contractile force generation which can be recorded by tracking HMP displacement. Alternatively, non&#8208;adhesive peptide integration results in neurosphere formation that grew within the void subunits of MAP. Although the formed neurospheres did not impose contractile force on the scaffolds, they were seen to continuously transverse the scaffolds. We concluded that MAP hydrogels can be engineered to either promote neurogenesis or enhance stemness depending on the chosen post&#8208;modifications, which can be key in modulating their phenotypes in various applications in vivo.

         <title>Poly(arylene piperidine) quaternary ammonium salts promoting stable long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence in aqueous environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have garnered considerable research attention owing to their excellent luminescence properties and potential application prospects in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, information storage, and optoelectronics. However, several RTP systems are extremely sensitive to humidity, and consequently, the realisation of long&#8208;lived RTP in water remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we present a feasible and effective strategy to achieve long&#8208;lived polymeric RTP systems, even in an aqueous environment, through doping of synthesised polymeric phosphor PBHDB into a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix. Compared to the precursor polymer PBN and organic molecule HDBP, a more rigid polymer microenvironment and electrostatic interactions were formed between the PMMA matrix and polymer PBHDB, which effectively reduced the nonradiative decay rate of triplet excitons and dramatically increased the phosphorescence intensity. Specifically, the phosphorescence lifetime of the PBHDB@PMMA film (1258.62&#160;ms) was much longer than those of PBN@PMMA (674.20&#160;ms) and HDBP@PMMA (1.06&#160;ms). Most importantly, a bright&#8208;green afterglow could be observed after soaking the PBHDB@PMMA film in water for more than a month. Furthermore, comparative experiments combined with various theoretical calculations demonstrated the influence of the strong electrostatic interaction acting between the polymer PBHDB and the PMMA matrix on the performance of the long&#8208;lived polymeric RTP in water. Simultaneously, the transition from triplet to singlet oxygen in PMMA under UV irradiation further prevented the quenching of RTP. The excellent water resistance and reversible photothermal dynamic response properties endow these systems with promising potential for dynamic information encryption, which can provide a new path for exploring the future utilisation of RTP materials in aqueous environments.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;electric&#8208;optical Coupling in Multiferroic BiFeO3&#8208;based Films</title>

Abstract
Manipulating ferroic orders and realizing their coupling in multiferroics at room temperature are promising for designing future multifunctional devices. Single external stimulation has been extensively proved to demonstrate the ability of ferroelastic switching in multiferroic oxides, which is crucial to bridge the ferroelectricity and magnetism. However, it is still challenging to directly realize multi&#8208;field driven magnetoelectric coupling in multiferroic oxides as potential multifunctional electrical devices. Here we show novel magneto&#8208;electric&#8208;optical coupling in multiferroic BiFeO3&#8208;based thin films at room temperature mediated by deterministic ferroelastic switching using piezoresponse/magnetic force microscopy and aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy. Reversible photoinduced ferroelastic switching exhibiting magnetoelectric responses is confirmed in BiFeO3&#8208;based films, which works at flexible strain states. This work directly demonstrates the room temperature magneto&#8208;electric&#8208;optical coupling in multiferroic films, which provides a framework for designing potential multi&#8208;field driven magnetoelectric devices such as energy conservation memories.

         <title>Structural Regulation of Coupled Phthalocyanine&#8211;Porphyrin Covalent Organic Frameworks to Highly Active and Selective Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In coupled phthalocyanine&#8211;porphyrin covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with cobalt(II) phthalocyanine as the electrocatalytic active site, the Type 1:2 COF (CoPc&#8208;2H2Por) with larger pore size and conjugation structure can more effectively boost CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) activity with lower overpotential than the Type 1:1 COF (CoPc&#8208;H2Por) due to the better mass transfer, faster electron transfer, and reaction kinetics, revealing the important role of electrocatalyst microstructure in the CO2RR.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been applied as potential electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) due to their adjustable architecture and porous feature. Herein, tetraanhydrides of 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24&#8208;octacarboxyphthalocyanine cobalt(II) (CoTAPc) are used as nodes to couple with 5,15&#8208;di(4&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;10,20&#8208;diphenylporphyrin (DAPor) or 5,15,10,20&#8208;tetrayl(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin (TAPor) via imidization reaction to fabricate novel coupled phthalocyanine&#8211;porphyrin Type 1:2 (CoPc&#8208;2H2Por) or Type 1:1 (CoPc&#8208;H2Por) COFs. Electrocatalytic CO2RR experiments show that both Type 1:2 and Type 1:1 COFs exhibit the maximum Faraday efficiency over 90% with high stability, while the Type 1:2 COF (CoPc&#8208;2H2Por) delivers lower overpotential, higher current density, and CO selectivity than Type 1:1 COF (CoPc&#8208;H2Por) and CoPc monomer. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that the better CO2RR activity of CoPc&#8208;2H2Por than CoPc&#8208;H2Por can be attributed to its larger pore size and conjugate structure, which then cause more efficient electron transfer, adsorption/activation of CO2, faster mass transfer, and reaction kinetics. This work provides a new idea in the structural design of COF&#8208;based electrocatalyst for efficient CO2RR.

         <title>Highly Curved, Quasi&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystalline Mesoporous Metal Nanoplates Promote C&#63743;C Bond Cleavage in Ethanol Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly curved, 2D, quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystalline mesoporous metal nanoplates are precisely synthesized by a facile solution route. The product features multiple structural and compositional advantages, which synergistically promote&#160;C&#63743;C bond cleavage and enable superior electrocatalytic performance in ethanol electrooxidation.








Abstract
The ability to manipulate metal nanocrystals with well&#8208;defined morphologies and structures is greatly important in material chemistry, catalysis chemistry, nanoscience, and nanotechnology. Although 2D metals serve as interesting platforms, further manipulating them in solution with highly penetrated mesopores and ideal crystallinity remains a huge challenge. Here, an easy yet powerful synthesis strategy for manipulating the mesoporous structure and crystallinity of 2D metals in a controlled manner with cetyltrimethylammonium chloride as the mesopore&#8208;forming surfactant and extra iodine&#8208;ion as the structure/facet&#8208;selective agent is reported. This strategy allows for preparing an unprecedented type of 2D quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystalline mesoporous nanoplates (SMPs) with highly curved morphology and controlled metal composition. The products, for example, PdCu SMPs, feature abundant undercoordinated sites, optimized electronic structures, excellent electron/mass transfers, and confined mesopore environments. Curved PdCu SMPs exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic activity of 6.09&#160;A&#160;mgPd&#8722;1 and stability for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) compared with its counterpart catalysts and commercial Pd/C. More importantly, PdCu SMPs are highly selective for EOR electrocatalysis that dramatically promotes C&#8211;C bond cleavage with a superior C1 pathway selectivity as high as 72.1%.

         <title>Perception&#8208;to&#8208;Cognition Tactile Sensing Based on Artificial&#8208;Intelligence&#8208;Motivated Human Full&#8208;Skin Bionic Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;motivated full&#8208;skin bionic (FSB) e&#8208;skin based on vertically integrated triboelectric e&#8208;skin and supercapacitive iontronic e&#8208;skin is proposed through the mimicry of skin structures including human vellus hair, epidermis&#8211;dermis&#8211;hypodermis. Assisted by the AI&#8208;motivated &#8220;brain,&#8221; the proposed FSB e&#8208;skin can promote the function of tactile perception to advanced intelligent tactile cognition.








Abstract
Traditional electronic skin (e&#8208;skin), due to the lack of human&#8208;brain&#8208;like thinking and judging capability, is powerless to accelerate the pace to the intelligent era. Herein, artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;motivated full&#8208;skin bionic (FSB) e&#8208;skin consisting of the structures of human vellus hair, epidermis&#8211;dermis&#8211;hypodermis, is proposed. Benefiting from the double interlocked layered microcone structure and supercapacitive iontronic effect, the FSB e&#8208;skin exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity of 8053.1 kPa&#8722;1 (&lt;1&#160;kPa), linear sensitivity of 3103.5 kPa&#8722;1 (1&#8211;34&#160;kPa), and fast response/recovery time of &lt;5.6&#160;ms. In addition, it can realize the evolution from tactile perception to advanced intelligent tactile cognition after being equipped with a &#8220;brain&#8221;.

     alt="Perception-to-Cognition Tactile Sensing Based on Artificial-Intelligence-Motivated Human Full-Skin Bionic Electronic Skin"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An artificial intelligence (AI)-motivated full-skin bionic (FSB) e-skin based on vertically integrated triboelectric e-skin and supercapacitive iontronic e-skin is proposed through the mimicry of skin structures including human vellus hair, epidermis&#8211;dermis&#8211;hypodermis. Assisted by the AI-motivated &#8220;brain,&#8221; the proposed FSB e-skin can promote the function of tactile perception to advanced intelligent tactile cognition.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional electronic skin (e-skin), due to the lack of human-brain-like thinking and judging capability, is powerless to accelerate the pace to the intelligent era. Herein, artificial intelligence (AI)-motivated full-skin bionic (FSB) e-skin consisting of the structures of human vellus hair, epidermis&#8211;dermis&#8211;hypodermis, is proposed. Benefiting from the double interlocked layered microcone structure and supercapacitive iontronic effect, the FSB e-skin exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity of 8053.1 kPa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (&amp;lt;1&#160;kPa), linear sensitivity of 3103.5 kPa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (1&#8211;34&#160;kPa), and fast response/recovery time of &amp;lt;5.6&#160;ms. In addition, it can realize the evolution from tactile perception to advanced intelligent tactile cognition after being equipped with a &#8220;brain&#8221;. First, static/dynamic contactless tactile perception is achieved based on the triboelectric effect of the vellus hair bionics. Second, the supercapacitive iontronic effect based structural bionics of the epidermis&#8211;dermis&#8211;hypodermis and a five-layer multilayer perception (MLP) enable the general intelligent tactile cognition of gesture cognition and robot interaction. Most importantly, by making full use of the FSB e-skin with a six-layer MLP neural network, an advanced intelligent material cognition system is developed for real-time cognition of the object material species and locations via one contact, which surpasses the capability of humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomic and Electronic Manipulation of Robust Ferroelectric Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymorphism allows one to design symmetry of the lattice and spatial charge distributions of atomically thin materials. While various polymorphs for superconducting, magnetic, and topological states have been extensively studied, polymorphic control is a challenge for robust ferroelectricity in atomically thin geometries. Here, we report the atomic and electric manipulation of ferroelectric polymorphs in Mo1&#8208;xWxTe2. Atomic manipulation for polymorphic control via chemical pressure (substituting tungsten for molybdenum atoms) and charge density modulation can realize tunable polar lattice structures and robust ferroelectricity up to T = 400 K with a constant coercive field in an atomically thin material. Owing to the effective inversion symmetry breaking, the ferroelectric switching withstands a charge carrier density of up to 1.1&#215;1013 cm&#8211;2, developing an original diagram for ferroelectric switching in atomically&#8208;thin materials.

         <title>Bioinspired Stretchable Transducer for Wearable Continuous Monitoring of Respiratory Patterns in Humans and Animals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We report a bio&#8208;inspired continuous wearable respiration sensor modeled after the lateral line system of fish which is used for detecting mechanical disturbances in the water. Despite the clinical importance of monitoring respiratory activity in humans and animals, continuous measurements of breathing patterns and rates are rarely performed in or outside of clinics. This is largely because conventional sensors are too inconvenient or expensive for wearable sensing for most individuals and animals. The bio&#8208;inspired air&#8208;silicone composite transducer is placed on the chest and measures respiratory activity by continuously measuring the force applied to an air channel embedded inside a silicone&#8208;based elastomeric material. The force applied on the surface of the transducer during breathing changes the air pressure inside the channel, which is measured using a commercial pressure sensor and mixed&#8208;signal wireless electronics. We extensively characterized the transducer produced in this work and tested it with humans, dogs, and laboratory rats. The bio&#8208;inspired air&#8208;silicone composite transducer may enable the early detection of a range of disorders that result in altered patterns of respiration. The technology reported can also be combined with artificial intelligence and cloud computing to algorithmically detect illness in humans and animals remotely, reducing unnecessary visits to clinics.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing and Light&#8208;Soaking in MAPbI3: the effect of H2O</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The future of Halide Perovskites, HaPs, which are of enormous interest for light &#10231; electrical energy conversion, is beclouded by limited scientific understanding of their long&#8208;term stability. While HaPs can be altered by absorbed radiation that induces multiple processes, remarkably, they can also return to their original state by &#8220;self&#8208;healing&#8221;. Here we use 2&#8208;photon absorption to effect light&#8208;induced modifications within single crystals of MAPbI3, the prototypical HaP. We then follow the changes in the photo&#8208;damaged region by measuring the photoluminescence, resulting also from 2&#8208;photon absorption, but with 2.5 orders of magnitude lower intensity than that used for photodamaging the MAPbI3. We find, immediately after photo&#8208;damage, two brightening and one darkening process, all of which recover but on different timescales. The first two are attributed to trap&#8208;filling (the fastest) and to proton&#8208;amine related chemistry (the slowest), while photodamage is attributed to the lead&#8208;iodide sub&#8208;lattice. Surprisingly, while after 2&#8208;photon&#8208;irradiation of crystals that were stored in dry, inert ambient, photo&#8208;brightening (or &#8220;light&#8208;soaking&#8221;) occurs, mostly photodarkening is seen after photodamage in humid ambient, showing for the first time an important connection between the self&#8208;healing of a halide perovskite and the presence of H2O. In either case, though, for long&#8208;term steady&#8208;state illumination practically no difference remains between samples kept in dry or humid environment. This result suggests that photo&#8208;brightening requires a chemical reservoir, that is sensitive to the presence of H2O or, possibly other proton&#8208;related, particularly amine, chemistry, for which we give some conjectures.

         <title>Light&#8208;based Printing of Leachable Salt Molds for Facile Shaping of Complex Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional printing is a powerful manufacturing technology for shaping materials into complex structures. While the palette of printable materials continues to expand, the rheological and chemical requisites for printing are not always easy to fulfill. Here, we report a universal manufacturing platform for shaping materials into intricate geometries without the need for their printability, but instead using light&#8208;based printed salt structures as leachable molds. The salt structures are printed using photocurable resins loaded with NaCl particles. The printing, debinding and sintering steps involved in the process are systematically investigated to identify ink formulations enabling the preparation of crack&#8208;free salt templates. Our experiments reveal that the formation of a load&#8208;bearing network of salt particles is essential to prevent cracking of the mold during the process. By infiltrating the sintered salt molds and leaching the template in water, we create complex&#8208;shaped architectures from diverse compositions such as biomedical silicone, chocolate, light metals, degradable elastomers and fiber composites, thus demonstrating the universal, cost&#8208;effective, and sustainable nature of this new manufacturing platform.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Carrier Mobilities in Ferroelectric Domain Wall Corbino Cones at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recently, electrically conducting heterointerfaces between dissimilar band&#8208;insulators (such as lanthanum aluminate and strontium titanate) have attracted considerable research interest. Charge transport has been thoroughly explored and fundamental aspects of conduction firmly established. Perhaps surprisingly, similar insights into conceptually much simpler conducting homointerfaces, such as the domain walls that separate regions of different orientations of electrical polarisation within the same ferroelectric band&#8208;insulator, are not nearly so well&#8208;developed. Addressing this disparity, we herein report magnetoresistance in approximately conical 180&#176; charged domain walls, which occur in partially switched ferroelectric thin film single crystal lithium niobate. This system is ideal for such measurements: firstly, the conductivity difference between domains and domain walls is extremely and unusually large (a factor of at least 1013) and hence currents driven through the thin film, between planar top and bottom electrodes, are overwhelmingly channelled along the walls; secondly, when electrical contact is made to the top and bottom of the domain walls and a magnetic field is applied along their cone axes (perpendicular to the thin film surface), then the test geometry mirrors that of a Corbino disc, which is a textbook arrangement for geometric magnetoresistance measurement. Our data imply carriers at the domain walls with extremely high room temperature Hall mobilities of up to &#8764; 3,700cm2V&#8211;1s&#8211;1. This is an unparalleled value for oxide interfaces (and for bulk oxides too) and is most comparable to mobilities in other systems typically seen at cryogenic, rather than at room, temperature.

This system is ideal for such measurements: firstly, the conductivity difference between domains and domain walls is extremely and unusually large (a factor of at least 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;) and hence currents driven through the thin film, between planar top and bottom electrodes, are overwhelmingly channelled along the walls; secondly, when electrical contact is made to the top and bottom of the domain walls and a magnetic field is applied along their cone axes (perpendicular to the thin film surface), then the test geometry mirrors that of a Corbino disc, which is a textbook arrangement for geometric magnetoresistance measurement. Our data imply carriers at the domain walls with extremely high room temperature Hall mobilities of up to &#8764; 3,700cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This is an unparalleled value for oxide interfaces (and for bulk oxides too) and is most comparable to mobilities in other systems typically seen at cryogenic, rather than at room, temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An Encapsulation&#8208;based Sodium Storage via Zn&#8208;single&#8208;atom Implanted Carbon Nanotubes</title>

Abstract
The properties of high theoretical capacity, low cost and large potential of metallic sodium (Na) has strongly promoted the development of rechargeable sodium&#8208;based batteries. However, the issues of infinite volume variation, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and dendritic sodium causes a rapid decline in performance and notorious safety hazards. Herein, we achieve a highly reversible encapsulation&#8208;based sodium storage by designing a functional hollow carbon nanotube with Zn single atom sites embedded in the carbon shell (ZnSA&#8208;HCNT). The appropriate tube space can encapsulate bulk sodium inside; the inner enriched ZnSA sites provides abundant sodiophilic sites, which can evidently reduce the nucleation barrier of Na deposition. Moreover, the carbon shell derived from ZIF&#8208;8 provides geometric constraints and excellent ion/electron transport channels for the rapid transfer of Na+ due to its pore&#8208;rich shell, which can be revealed by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As expected, Na@ZnSA&#8208;HCNT anodes present steady long&#8208;term performance in symmetrical battery (&gt; 900 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). Moreover, superior electrochemical performance of Na@ZnSA&#8208;HCNT||PB full cells can be delivered. This work develops a new strategy based on carbon nanotube encapsulation of metallic sodium, which improves the safety and cycling performance of sodium metal anode.

         <title>Emerging Biomaterials Imaging Antitumor Immune Response</title>

Abstract
Immunotherapy is one of the most promising clinical modalities for the treatment of malignant tumors and has shown excellent therapeutic outcomes in clinical settings. However, it continues to face several challenges, including long treatment cycles, high costs, immune&#8208;related adverse events, and low response rates. Thus, it is critical to predict the response rate to immunotherapy by using imaging technology in the preoperative and intraoperative. Here, we comprehensively summarize the latest advances in nanosystem&#8208;based biomaterials used for predicting responses to immunotherapy via the imaging of immune cells and signaling molecules in the immune microenvironment. Several imaging methods, such as fluorescence imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography imaging, ultrasound imaging, and photoacoustic imaging, used in immune predictive imaging, are discussed to show the potential of nanosystems for distinguishing immunotherapy responders from non&#8208;responders. Nanosystem&#8208;based biomaterials aided by various imaging technologies are expected to enable the effective prediction and diagnosis in cases of tumors, inflammation, and other public diseases.

         <title>Pass&#8208;transistor Logic Circuits Based on Wafer&#8208;Scale Two&#8208;Dimensional Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductors, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), have attracted tremendous attention in constructing advanced monolithic integrated circuits (ICs) for future flexible and energy&#8208;efficient electronics. However, the development of large&#8208;scale ICs based on 2D materials is still in its early stage, mainly due to the non&#8208;uniformity of the individual devices and little investigation of device and circuit level optimization. Herein, we successfully synthesized a 4&#8208;inch high&#8208;quality monolayer MoS2 film, which was then used to fabricate top gated (TG) MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) with wafer&#8208;scale uniformity. Some basic circuits such as SRAM and ring oscillators were first examined. A pass&#8208;transistor logic configuration based on pseudo&#8208;NMOS was then employed to design more complex MoS2 logic circuits, which were successfully fabricated with proper logic functions tested. These preliminary integration efforts show the promising potential of wafer&#8208;scale 2D semiconductors for application in complex ICs.

         <title>Fluorinated Perylene&#8208;diimides: Cathode Interlayers Facilitating Carrier Collection for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have experienced rapid progress with the innovation of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;absorbing small&#8208;molecular acceptors (SMAs), while the unique electronic properties of the SMAs raise new challenges in relation to cathode engineering for effective electron collection. To address this issue, we synthesized two fluorinated perylene&#8208;diimides (PDIs), PDINN&#8208;F and PDINN&#8208;2F by a simple fluorination method, for the application as cathode interlayer (CIL) materials. The two bay&#8208;fluorinated PDI based CILs possess lower the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level of ca. &#8722;4.0&#160;eV, which improves the energy level alignment at the NIR&#8208;SMAs (such as BTP&#8208;eC9)/cathode interface for a favorable electron extraction efficiency. The mono&#8208;fluorinated PDINN&#8208;F shows higher electron mobility and better improved interfacial compatibility. The PDINN&#8208;F based OSCs with PM6: BTP&#8208;eC9 as active layer exhibit an enhanced fill factor and larger short&#8208;circuit current density, leading to a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 18%. The devices with PDINN&#8208;F CIL retained more than 80% of its initial PCE after operating at the maximum power point under continuous illumination for 750 hours. This work prescribes a facile, cost&#8208;effective and scalable method for the preparation of stable, high&#8208;performance fluorinated CILs, and instilling promise for the NIR&#8208;SMAs&#8208;based OSCs moving forward.

         <title>Enhanced photoconductivity at dislocations in SrTiO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dislocations are one&#8208;dimensional crystallographic line defects and are usually seen as detrimental to the functional properties of classic semiconductors. It is shown here that this not necessarily accounts for oxide semiconductors in which dislocations are capable of boosting the photoconductivity. Strontium titanate single crystals are controllably deformed to generate a high density of ordered dislocations of two slip systems possessing different mesoscopic arrangements. For both slip systems, nanoscale conductive atomic force microscope investigations reveal a strong enhancement of the photoconductivity around the dislocation cores. Macroscopic in&#8208;plane measurements indicate that the two dislocation systems result in different global photoconductivity behavior despite the similar local enhancement. Depending on the arrangement, the global photoresponse can be increased by orders of magnitude. Additionally, indications for a bulk photovoltaic effect enabled by dislocation&#8208;surrounding strain fields are observed for the first time. This proves that dislocations in oxide semiconductors can be of large interest for tailoring photoelectric functionalities. Direct evidence that electronic transport is confined to the dislocation core points to a new emerging research field.

         <title>High&#8208;stretchability, Ultralow&#8208;hysteresis Conducting Polymer Hydrogel Strain Sensors for Soft Machines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Highly stretchable conducting polymer hydrogel strain sensors are rapidly emerging as a promising candidate towards diverse wearable skins and sensing devices for soft machines. However, due to the intrinsic limitations of low stretchability and large hysteresis, existing strain sensors cannot fully exploit their potential when used in a wearable or robotic system. Here, we present a PEDOT:PSS&#8208;PVA conducting polymer hydrogel strain sensor exhibiting both ultimate strain (300%) and negligible hysteresis (&lt;1.5%). This is achieved through a unique microphase semi&#8208;separated network design by compositing poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) nanofibers with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and facile fabrication by combining 3D printing and successive freeze&#8208;thawing. We systematically characterize the overall superior performances of our strain sensor including stretchability, linearity, cyclic stability, and robustness against mechanical twisting and pressing. We further demonstrate the integration and application of such strain sensor with electronic skins to measure various physiological signals, identify hand gestures, enable a soft gripper for objection recognition, and remote control of an industrial robot. This work may offer both promising conducting polymer hydrogels with enhanced sensing functionalities and technical platforms towards stretchable electronic skins and intelligent robotic systems.

         <title>Development of Pure Green Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Material by Cyano Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Multiple resonance (MR) effect&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials have garnered significant attention because they can achieve both high color purity and high external quantum efficiency (EQE). However, the reported green&#8208;emitting MR&#8208;TADF materials exhibit broader emission compared to those of blue&#8208;emitting ones and suffer from severe efficiency roll&#8208;off due to insufficient rate constants of reverse intersystem crossing process (kRISC). Herein, we report a pure green MR&#8208;TADF material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;CN&#8208;Me) with high kRISC of 105 s&#8211;1. The key to success is introduction of cyano groups into a blue&#8208;emitting MR&#8208;TADF material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA), which causes remarkable bathochromic shift without a loss of color purity. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode employing it as an emitter exhibits green emission at 504&#160;nm with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 23&#160;nm, corresponding to the Commission Internationale d&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.13, 0.65). The device achieves a high maximum EQE of 31.9% and successfully suppresses the efficiency roll&#8208;off at a high luminance.

         <title>Extracellular Vesicle&#8208;Based Drug Delivery Systems for Enhanced Anti&#8208;Tumor Therapies through Modulating Cancer&#8208;Immunity Cycle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Although immunotherapy that harnesses the activity of the immune system against tumors has made great progress, the treatment efficacy remains limited in most cancers. Current anticancer immunotherapy is primarily based on T cell&#8208;mediated cellular immunity, which highly relies on the efficiency of triggering cancer&#8208;immunity cycle, namely tumor antigen release, antigen presentation by antigen presenting cells, T cell activation, recruitment and infiltration of T cells into tumors, and recognition and killing of tumor cells by T cells. Unfortunately, these immunotherapies are restricted by inefficient drug delivery and acting on only a single step of the cancer&#8208;immunity cycle. Due to the high biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, intrinsic cell targeting and easy chemical and genetic manipulation, extracellular vesicle&#8208;based drug delivery systems have been widely used to amplify the anticancer immune responses by serving as an integrated platform for multiple drugs or therapeutic strategies to synergistically activate several steps of cancer&#8208;immunity cycle. This review summarizes the various mechanisms related to affecting the cancer&#8208;immunity cycle disorders. Meanwhile, the preparation and application of extracellular vesicle&#8208;based drug delivery systems in modulating cancer&#8208;immunity cycle are introduced, especially in the improvement of T cell recruitment and infiltration into tumors. Finally, we briefly discuss the opportunities and challenges of extracellular vesicle&#8208;based drug delivery systems in translational clinical applications.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Dipole Interaction Regulation Enables High&#8208;Performance Single Ion Polymer Conductors for Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes with large ionic conductivity, high ionic transference number, and good interfacial compatibility with electrodes are highly desired for solid&#8208;state batteries. However, unwanted polarizations and side reactions occurring in traditional dual ion polymer conductors hinder their practical applications. Here, single ion polymer conductors (SIPCs) with exceptional selectivity for Li&#8208;ion conduction (Li&#8208;ion transference number up to 0.93), high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of about 10&#8211;4 S cm&#8211;1, and a wide electrochemical stability window (&gt; 4.5&#160;V, versus Li/Li+) are prepared by precisely regulating the ion&#8208;dipole interactions between Li+ and carbonyl/cyano groups. The resulting SIPCs show an excellent electrochemical stability with Li metal during long&#8208;term cycling at room temperature and 60&#176;C. LiFePO4&#8208;based solid&#8208;state cells containing the SIPCs exhibit good rate and cycling performance in a wide temperature range from &#8211;20 to 90&#176;C. By the same way of ion&#8208;dipole interaction regulation, sodium and potassium&#8208;based SIPCs with both high ionic conductivity and high cationic transference numbers are also prepared. The findings in this work provide a guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance SIPCs and other metal ion systems beyond Li+.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Healing of Metal Oxides Assisted by Polymer&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Healing of defects in metal oxide (MeO) coatings occurs through rearrangement of Cl&#8208;decorated MeO particles formed by vapor phase infiltration inside a polymer, segregation at the defect interface, and their subsequent hydrolysis in air.








Abstract
Enabling self&#8208;healing of materials is crucially important for saving resources and energy in numerous emerging applications. While strategies for the self&#8208;healing of polymers are advanced, mechanisms for semiconducting inorganic materials are scarce due to the lack of suitable healing agents. Here a concept for the self&#8208;healing of metal oxides is developed. This concept consists of metal oxide nanoparticle growth inside the bulk of halogenated polymers and their subsequent entropy&#8208;driven migration to externally induced defect sites, leading to recovery of the defect. Herein, it is demonstrated that the pool of self&#8208;healing materials is expanded to include semiconductors, thereby increasing the reliability and sustainability of functional materials through the use of metal oxides. It is revealed that electrical properties of tin&#8208;doped indium oxide can be partially restored upon healing. Such properties are of immediate interest for the further development of transparent flexible electrodes.

         <title>Conformation Dynamics of Single Polymer Strands in Solution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conformational changes in macromolecules significantly affect their functions and assembly into high&#8208;level structures. Despite advances in theoretical and experimental studies, investigations into the intrinsic conformational variations and dynamic motions of single macromolecules remain challenging. Here, liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy enables the real&#8208;time tracking of single&#8208;chain polymers. Imaging linear polymers, synthetically dendronized with conjugated aromatic groups, in organic solvent confined within graphene liquid cells, directly exhibits chain&#8208;resolved conformational dynamics of individual semi&#8208;flexible polymers. Our experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the dynamic conformational transitions of the single chain polymer originate from the degree of intra&#8208;chain interactions. In situ observations also show that such dynamics of the single chain polymer are significantly affected by environmental factors, including surfaces and interfaces.

Imaging linear polymers, synthetically dendronized with conjugated aromatic groups, in organic solvent confined within graphene liquid cells, directly exhibits chain-resolved conformational dynamics of individual semi-flexible polymers. Our experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the dynamic conformational transitions of the single chain polymer originate from the degree of intra-chain interactions. In situ observations also show that such dynamics of the single chain polymer are significantly affected by environmental factors, including surfaces and interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Water electrolysis involves two parallel reactions, i.e., oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution (HER), in which sluggish oxygen evolution is a significant limiting step, that results in high energy consumption. Coupling the thermodynamically favorable electrooxidation of organic alternatives to value&#8208;added fine chemicials HER is a promising approach for the simultaneous cost&#8208;effective production of value&#8208;added chemicals and hydrogen. Here, we introduce a new coupling system for the green electrochemical synthesis of organic energetic materials plus hydrogen production using single&#8208;atom catalysts. The catalysts are prepared by the facile galvanostatic deposition of ruthenium single atoms on the molybdenum selenide, and reveal a low HER overpotential of 38.9&#160;mV at &#8211;10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 in an alkaline medium. Importantly, the cell voltage of water electrolysis can be significantly reduced to only 1.35&#160;V at a current of 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, by coupling water splitting with the electrooxidation of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;1H&#8208;tetrazole to synthesize 5,5&#8242;&#8208;azotetrazolate energetic material. These materials are traditionally synthesized under harsh conditions involving a strong oxidizing agent, high&#8208;temperature condition, and difficult separation of by&#8208;products. This study provides a green and efficient method of synthesizing organic energetic materials while simultaneously producing hydrogen.

         <title>Achieving 19% Power Conversion Efficiency in Planar&#8208;Mixed Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells Using a Pseudo&#8208;Symmetric Electron Acceptor</title>

Abstract
A record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 19% has been realized in planar&#8208;mixed heterojunction (PMHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) by adopting the asymmetric selenium substitution strategy in making a pseudo&#8208;symmetric electron acceptor, BS3TSe&#8208;4F. The combined molecular asymmetry with more polarizable selenium substitution increases the dielectric constant of D18/BS3TSe&#8208;4F blend, helping lower the exciton binding energy. On the other hand, they facilitate dimer packing in BS3TSe&#8208;4F to enable free charge generation, helping more efficient exciton dissociation and lowering the radiative recombination loss (&#916;E2) of OSCs. As a result, PMHJ OSCs based on D18/BS3TSe&#8208;4F achieved a PCE of 18.48%. By incorporating another mid&#8208;bandgap acceptor Y6&#8208;O into D18/BS3TSe&#8208;4F to form a ternary PMHJ, a higher open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) could be achieved to realize an impressive PCE of 19.03%. Our findings of using pseudo&#8208;symmetric electron acceptors in enhancing device efficiency provides an effective way to develop highly efficient acceptor materials for OSCs.F

         <title>Thermal Shock Fabrication of Ion&#8208;stabilized Perovskite and Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Here we show a highly crystalline perovskite grain structure with compressed surface lattice realized by a thermal&#8208;shocking fabrication. The strained perovskite grain structure is stabilized by Cl&#8211;&#8208;reinforcing surface lattice and show enhanced bonding energy and ionic activation temperature, which contributes to hysteresis&#8208;free operation of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) at much higher temperature up to 363 K in thermal&#8208;shocking processed MAPbClxI3&#8208;x (T&#8208;MPI). The PSCs can be fabricated by a high&#8208;speed fully&#8208;air&#8208;process without post annealing based on scalable bar&#8208;coating technique. Both high efficiency and stability are achieved in T&#8208;MPI PSC with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 22.99% and long&#8208;term operational stability with T80 lifetime exceeding 4000 hours.

         <title>Sb2Se3 Thin&#8208;Film Solar Cells Exceeding 10% Power Conversion Efficiency Enabled by Injection Vapor Deposition Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injection vapor deposition (IVD) technology is designed and demonstrated. The IVD produces compact antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) films with high orientation preference, fewer deep&#8208;level trap levels, and suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination, achieving a record power conversion efficiency of 10.12% for Sb2Se3 photovoltaics.








Abstract
Binary Sb2Se3 semiconductors are promising as the absorber materials in inorganic chalcogenide compound photovoltaics due to their attractive anisotropic optoelectronic properties. However, Sb2Se3 solar cells suffer from complex and unconventional intrinsic defects due to the low symmetry of the quasi&#8208;1D crystal structure resulting in a considerable voltage deficit, which limits the ultimate power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this work, the creation of compact Sb2Se3 films with strong [00l] orientation, high crystallinity, minimal deep level defect density, fewer trap states, and low non&#8208;radiative recombination loss by injection vapor deposition is reported. This deposition technique enables superior films compared with close&#8208;spaced sublimation and coevaporation technologies. The resulting Sb2Se3 thin&#8208;film solar cells yield a PCE of 10.12%, owing to the suppressed carrier recombination and excellent carrier transport and extraction. This method thus opens a new and effective avenue for the fabrication of high&#8208;quality Sb2Se3 and other high&#8208;quality chalcogenide semiconductors.

         <title>An Intracellular Self&#8208;Assembly&#8208;Driven Uninterrupted ROS Generator Augments 5&#8208;Aminolevulinic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Based Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural biotransformation of 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (ALA) (ALA&#8208;PpIX&#8208;heme), an intracellular self&#8208;assembly&#8208;driven uninterrupted reactive oxygen species (ROS) generator (URG) is developed for amplified tumor therapy. The URG can not only generate 1O2 under laser irradiation, but also converts useless heme into peroxidase mimics via intracellular self&#8208;assembly, which can effectively catalyze H2O2 to &#8226;OH, thus realizing &#8220;1O2&#8722;&#8226;OH&#8221; uninterrupted ROS generation.








Abstract
Free radical therapy based on 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (ALA, a precursor of the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX)) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical tumor treatment. However, PpIX can be quickly converted into photoinactive heme, leading to unexpectedly paused production of free radicals and severely hindering its therapeutic benefits. Here, inspired by the natural biotransformation of ALA (ALA&#8208;PpIX&#8208;heme), an uninterrupted reactive oxygen species generator (URG) that converts useless heme to peroxidase mimics via intracellular self&#8208;assembly is developed. The URG is prepared by enwrapping ALA&#8208;loaded polyamide&#8208;amine dendrimers in red blood cell membrane vesicles with a further surface modification of G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;structured AS1411. The URGs realize &#8220;1O2&#8722;&#8226;OH&#8221; uninterrupted generation through &#8220;recycling waste&#8221; in two steps: i) PpIX generates 1O2 under laser irradiation; and ii) the photoinactive metabolite heme self&#8208;assembled with AS1411 to catalyze H2O2 conversion into &#8226;OH. Interestingly, the specific generation of 1O2 in mitochondria and &#8226;OH in nuclei further augments the free&#8208;radical&#8208;induced damage. It is demonstrated that URG can continuously produce free radicals for 6 h postirradiation, and shows 3.3&#8208;times more than that of the nonassembly group, achieving nearly 80% regression of tumors in vivo.

The URG can not only generate &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under laser irradiation, but also converts useless heme into peroxidase mimics via intracellular self-assembly, which can effectively catalyze H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to &#8226;OH, thus realizing &#8220;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;&#8226;OH&#8221; uninterrupted ROS generation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free radical therapy based on 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA, a precursor of the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX)) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical tumor treatment. However, PpIX can be quickly converted into photoinactive heme, leading to unexpectedly paused production of free radicals and severely hindering its therapeutic benefits. Here, inspired by the natural biotransformation of ALA (ALA-PpIX-heme), an uninterrupted reactive oxygen species generator (URG) that converts useless heme to peroxidase mimics via intracellular self-assembly is developed. The URG is prepared by enwrapping ALA-loaded polyamide-amine dendrimers in red blood cell membrane vesicles with a further surface modification of G-quadruplex-structured AS1411. The URGs realize &#8220;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;&#8226;OH&#8221; uninterrupted generation through &#8220;recycling waste&#8221; in two steps: i) PpIX generates &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under laser irradiation; and ii) the photoinactive metabolite heme self-assembled with AS1411 to catalyze H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion into &#8226;OH. Interestingly, the specific generation of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in mitochondria and &#8226;OH in nuclei further augments the free-radical-induced damage. It is demonstrated that URG can continuously produce free radicals for 6 h postirradiation, and shows 3.3-times more than that of the nonassembly group, achieving nearly 80% regression of tumors in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Systematic Screening and Therapeutic Evaluation of Glyconanoparticles with Differential Cancer Affinities for Targeted Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of 31 types of glyconanoparticles (GlyNPs) with either homogeneous or heterogeneous display of five different sugar moieties (glucose, galactose, mannose, N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine, and N&#8208;acetyl galactosamine) is constructed to identify cancer&#8208;targeting GlyNPs for targeted cancer therapy. GlyNPCD composed of mannose/N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine targets A549 and CT26 tumors, while GlyNPABC composed of glucose/galactose/mannose targets DU145 tumors.








Abstract
Cancer&#8208;targeting ligands used for nanomedicines have been limited mostly to antibodies, peptides, aptamers, and small molecules thus far. Here, a library of glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles as a platform to enable screening and identification of cancer&#8208;targeting nanomedicines is reported. Specifically, a library of 31 artificial glycopolymers composed of either homogeneous or heterogeneous display of five different sugar moieties (&#946;&#8208;glucose, &#946;&#8208;galactose, &#945;&#8208;mannose, &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine, and &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl galactosamine) is converted to a library of glyconanoparticles (GlyNPs). GlyNPs optimal for targeting CT26, DU145, A549, and PC3 tumors are systematically screened and identified. The cypate&#8208;conjugated GlyNP displaying &#945;&#8208;mannose and &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine show selective targeting and potent photothermal therapeutic efficacy against A549 human lung tumors. The docetaxel&#8208;contained GlyNP displaying &#946;&#8208;glucose, &#946;&#8208;galactose, and &#945;&#8208;mannose demonstrate targeted chemotherapy against DU145 human prostate tumors. The results presented herein collectively demonstrate that the GlyNP library is a versatile platform enabling the identification of cancer&#8208;targeting glyconanoparticles and suggest its potential applicability for targeting various diseased cells beyond cancer.

         <title>Not All Aggregates are Made the Same: Distinct Structures of Solution Aggregates Drastically Modulate Assembly Pathways, Morphology and Electronic Properties of Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tuning structures of solution&#8208;state aggregation and aggregation&#8208;mediated assembly pathways of conjugated polymers is crucial for optimizing their solid&#8208;state morphology and charge transport property. However, it remains challenging to unravel and control the exact structures of solution aggregates, let alone to modulate assembly pathways in a controlled fashion. Herein, we largely modulate aggregate structures of an isoindigo&#8208;bithiophene&#8208;based polymer (PII&#8208;2T) by tuning selectivity of the solvent towards the side chain versus the backbone, which leads to three distinct assembly pathways: direct crystallization from side&#8208;chain associated amorphous aggregates, chiral liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;mediated assembly from semicrystalline aggregates with side&#8208;chain and backbone stacking, random agglomeration from backbone&#8208;stacked semicrystalline aggregates. Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time that the amorphous solution aggregates, compared with semicrystalline ones, lead to significantly improved alignment and reduced paracrystalline disorder in solid&#8208;state due to direct crystallization during the meniscus&#8208;guided coating process. Alignment quantified by dichroic ratio obtained from grazing incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction (GIXD) is enhanced by up to fourteen&#8208;fold, and the charge carrier mobility increases by a maximum of twenty&#8208;fold in films printed from amorphous aggregates compared to those from semicrystalline aggregates. This work shows that by tuning the precise structure of solution aggregates, one can drastically tune assembly pathways, and the resulting thin film morphology and device properties.

         <title>Three&#8208;Tier Hierarchical Structures for Extreme Pool Boiling Heat Transfer Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Boiling is an effective energy transfer process with substantial utility in energy applications. Boiling performance is described mainly by the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) and critical heat flux (CHF). Recent efforts for the simultaneous enhancement of HTC and CHF have been limited by an intrinsic trade&#8208;off between them &#8212; HTC enhancement requires high nucleation site density, which can increase bubble coalescence resulting in limited CHF enhancement. In this work, we overcome this trade&#8208;off by designing three&#8208;tier hierarchical structures. We minimize bubble coalescence to enhance CHF by defining nucleation sites with microcavities interspersed within hemi&#8208;wicking structures. Meanwhile, the reduced nucleation site density is compensated for by incorporating nanostructures that promote evaporation for HTC enhancement. Our hierarchical structures demonstrate the simultaneous enhancement of HTC and CHF up to 389% and 138%, respectively, compared to a smooth surface. This extreme boiling performance can lead to significant energy savings in a variety of boiling applications.

         <title>Complex oxides for brain&#8208;inspired computing: A review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The fields of brain&#8208;inspired computing, robotics, and, more broadly, artificial intelligence seek to implement knowledge gleaned from the natural world into human&#8208;designed electronics and machines. Most advances to date have happened in software and algorithms. However, there is growing interest in designing hardware, i.e., new semiconductor materials and devices and their interconnections that can impart intelligence at the device or network level for software co&#8208;design. This requires a paradigm shift in the way one thinks of semiconductors where the intrinsic material or device itself can learn, be re&#8208;programmed, remember or forget information and, when connected, collectively create output signals that are non&#8208;trivial, emergent summation of individual components. In this review, we discuss the opportunities presented by complex oxides, a class of electronic ceramic materials whose properties can be elegantly tuned by doping, electron interactions and a variety of external stimuli near room temperature. Most importantly, oxides can host a vast number of electrically addressable metastable phases by carrier doping and subtle crystal structure distortions essential for adaptive devices. Concurrent changes in optical or magnetic properties create opportunities for multi&#8208;modal readout. Since neuroscience and evolutionary biology disciplines serve as an inspiration and scientific guiding disciplines for neuromorphic computing, we begin with a discussion of natural intelligence at the elementary level in the nervous system, followed by collective intelligence and learning at the animal colony level mediated by social interactions. An important aspect we highlight here is the vast spatial and temporal scales involved in learning and memory. We then focus on phenomena such as metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transitions, ferroelectricity, and related examples to highlight recent demonstrations of artificial neurons, synapses, and circuits and their learning behavior. First&#8208;principles theoretical treatments of the electronic structure; in&#8208;situ synchrotron spectroscopy of operating devices is then discussed. We review the implementation of the experimental characteristics into neural networks and algorithm design. Finally, we highlight outstanding materials challenges that require a microscopic understanding of the physical mechanisms which will be essential for advancing the frontiers of neuromorphic computing.

Cell&#8208;in&#8208;catalytic&#8208;shell biohybrid structures are constructed by in situ supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of Fe3+ and benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxylic acid, with concomitant enzyme embedment. The Fe3+&#8208;BTC nanoshells on individual living cells enhance the catalytic efficiency of multienzymatic cascade reactions by confining the reaction intermediates to the internal voids and impart extrinsic functions to the cells beyond the scope of biological evolution.








Abstract
Cell&#8208;in&#8208;shell biohybrid structures, synthesized by encapsulating individual living cells with exogenous materials, have emerged as exciting functional entities for engineered living materials, with emergent properties outside the scope of biochemical modifications. Artificial exoskeletons have, to date, provided physicochemical shelters to the cells inside in the first stage of technological development, and further advances in the field demand catalytically empowered, cellular hybrid systems that augment the biological functions of cells and even introduce completely new functions to the cells. This work describes a facile and generalizable strategy for empowering living cells with extrinsic catalytic capability through nanoencapsulation of living cells with a supramolecular metal&#8211;organic complex of Fe3+ and benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxylic acid (BTC). A series of enzymes are embedded in situ, without loss of catalytic activity, in the Fe3+&#8208;BTC shells, not to mention the superior characteristics of cytocompatible and rapid shell&#8208;forming processes. The nanoshell enhances the catalytic efficiency of multienzymatic cascade reactions by confining reaction intermediates to its internal voids and the nanoencapsulated cells acquire exogenous biochemical functions, including enzymatic cleavage of lethal octyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucopyranoside into d&#8208;glucose, with autonomous cytoprotection. The system will provide a versatile, nanoarchitectonic tool for interfacing biological cells with functional materials, especially for catalytic bioempowerment of living cells.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven Auto&#8208;Detachable Patterning of Flexible Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;shrinkage&#8208;assisted patterning by evaporation&#8221; (SHAPE) method is reported to fabricate freestanding and flexible electrodes. The multimaterial, multilayer, and shape&#8208;designable properties of the SHAPE method for fabrication of flexible electrodes provide electronics with unconfined stacking, customizable stretchability, and conformable integration on arbitrary surfaces, demonstrating their wide spectrum of applications in wearable and 3D integrated electronics.








Abstract
Flexible electrodes that are multilayer, multimaterial, and conformal are pivotal for multifunctional wearable electronics. Traditional electronic circuits manufacturing requires substrate&#8208;supported transfer printing, which limits their multilayer integrity and device conformability on arbitrary surfaces. Herein, a &#8220;shrinkage&#8208;assisted patterning by evaporation&#8221; (SHAPE) method is reported, by employing evaporation&#8208;induced interfacial strain mismatch, to fabricate auto&#8208;detachable, freestanding, and patternable electrodes. The SHAPE method utilizes vacuum&#8208;filtration of polyaniline/bacterial cellulose (PANI/BC) ink through a masked filtration membrane to print high&#8208;resolution, patterned, and multilayer electrodes. The strong interlayer hydrogen bonding ensures robust multilayer integrity, while the controllable evaporative shrinking property of PANI/BC induces mismatch between the strains of the electrode and filtration membrane at the interface and thus autodetachment of electrodes. Notably, a 500&#8208;layer substrateless micro&#8208;supercapacitor fabricated using the SHAPE method exhibits an energy density of 350 mWh cm&#8722;2 at a power density of 40&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, 100 times higher than reported substrate&#8208;confined counterparts. Moreover, a digital circuit fabricated using the SHAPE method functions stably on a deformed glove, highlighting the broad wearable applications of the SHAPE method.

         <title>Delivering Mechanical Stimulation to Cells: State of the Art in Materials and Devices Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biophysical signals, especially mechanical cues, are crucial in many (patho)physiological processes. An overview of the current state of the art in the design and development of materials and devices that can deliver mechanical stimulation to cells and tissues, with a focus on their design principles, is provided, and challenges and perspectives for future research directions are highlighted.








Abstract
Biochemical signals, such as growth factors, cytokines, and transcription factors are known to play a crucial role in regulating a variety of cellular activities as well as maintaining the normal function of different tissues and organs. If the biochemical signals are assumed to be one side of the coin, the other side comprises biophysical cues. There is growing evidence showing that biophysical signals, and in particular mechanical cues, also play an important role in different stages of human life ranging from morphogenesis during embryonic development to maturation and maintenance of tissue and organ function throughout life. In order to investigate how mechanical signals influence cell and tissue function, tremendous efforts have been devoted to fabricating various materials and devices for delivering mechanical stimuli to cells and tissues. Here, an overview of the current state of the art in the design and development of such materials and devices is provided, with a focus on their design principles, and challenges and perspectives for future research directions are highlighted.

         <title>Phonon Symphony of Stacked Multilayers and Weak Bonds Lowers Lattice Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new chalcogenide, Ga6Cr5Se16, shows intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivity (0.79 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) at 323 K, which is almost four times lower than that of binary Cr3Se4), or twice lower than that of Cr2Se3 and Ga2Se3. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of the phonon propagation in layered chalcogenides, elucidates a direction for the rational design of multilayer stacking in solids with low &#954;lat.








Abstract
Controlling lattice vibrations to obtain intrinsic low thermal conductivity play a critical role in thermal management of electronic and photonic devices, energy converters, and thermal insulation, which necessitates exploring new compounds and a thorough understanding of their chemical structure, bonding, and lattice dynamics. Herein, a new chalcogenide, Ga6Cr5Se16, shows intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivity &#954;lat, which crystallizes in the monoclinic phase (C2/m) with the stacked inverse GaSe4 layers (g'), close&#8208;packed Cr3+Se6 layers (c), GaSe4 layers (g) and loosely&#8208;stacked Cr2+Se6 layers (c') along the c&#8208;axis. In this structure, a wide variety of chemical bonding is arranged in each layer, such as covalent Ga&#8211;Se, covalent Cr3+&#8211;Se, and weaker Cr2+&#8211;Se bonding, which endow it with a large phonon symphony by strong coupling of soft acoustic and low&#8208;lying optical phonons. As a result, Ga6Cr5Se16 realizes an intrinsic low &#954;lat of 0.79 W m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1 at 323 K, which is almost four times, or twice lower than that of Cr3Se4 (2.95 W m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1), or Cr2Se3 (1.56 W m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1), Ga2Se3 (1.36 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) at 323 K, respectively. These insights will offer comprehensive understanding of the phonon propagation in complex layered chalcogenides, and&#160;also shed useful light on future design of low&#8208;&#954;lat solids.

         <title>Gas Separations using Nanoporous Atomically Thin Membranes: Recent Theoretical, Simulation, and Experimental Advances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent development of novel atomically thin 2D materials, including graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides, offers great opportunities for potential breakthroughs in the membrane separation field. Recent research advances, challenges, and potential future directions in the application of nanoporous atomically thin membranes for gas separation are summarized.








Abstract
Porous graphene and other atomically thin 2D materials are regarded as highly promising membrane materials for high&#8208;performance gas separations due to their atomic thickness, large&#8208;scale synthesizability, excellent mechanical strength, and chemical stability. When these atomically thin materials contain a high areal density of gas&#8208;sieving nanoscale pores, they can exhibit both high gas permeances and high selectivities, which is beneficial for reducing the cost of gas&#8208;separation processes. Here, recent modeling and experimental advances in nanoporous atomically thin membranes for gas separations is discussed. The major challenges involved, including controlling pore size distributions, scaling up the membrane area, and matching theory with experimental results, are also highlighted. Finally, important future directions are proposed for real gas&#8208;separation applications of nanoporous atomically thin membranes.

         <title>Carrier&#8208;Transport Mechanism in Organic Antiambipolar Transistors Unveiled by Operando Photoemission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carrier transport in an organic antiambipolar transistor (AAT) is examined using operando photoemission electron microscopy. The approach visualizes the conductive electrons under the actual transistor operations and reveals that a lateral p&#8211;n junction is crucial for the negative differential transconductance in the AAT. These results help in enhancing&#160;the device's performance.








Abstract
Organic antiambipolar transistors (AATs) have partially overlapped p&#8211;n junctions. At room temperature, this p&#8211;n junction induces a negative differential transconductance in an AAT. However, the detailed carrier&#8208;transport mechanism remains unclear. Herein, an operando photoemission electron microscopy is used to tackle this issue owing to the technique's ability to visualize conductive electrons in real time during transistor operation. Notably, it is observed that when the AAT is on, a depletion layer forms at the lateral p&#8211;n junction. The visualized depletion layer shows that both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type channels have pinch&#8208;off states in the gate voltage range when the AAT is in on state. The steep potential gradient at the lateral p&#8211;n interface enhances the electron conduction from n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type semiconductor. Another significant finding is that most electrons are considered to recombine with the accumulated holes in the p&#8208;type semiconductor, affording the reduction of photoemission intensity by &#8776;80%. This technique provides a thorough understanding of carrier transport in AATs, further improving the device performance.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Modulated Resistive Switching in Mo&#8208;Irradiated ReS2 for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile Mo&#8208;irradiation doping is demonstrated for interfacial modulation of resistive switching (RS) in rhenium disulfide (ReS2) memristors, leading to a bipolar non&#8208;volatile switching ratio of nearly two orders of magnitude, programmable multilevel resistance states, and long&#8208;term synaptic plasticity. The device simultaneously achieves a high learning accuracy of 91% in an artificial neural network, demonstrating its potential for neuromorphic computing application.








Abstract
Coupling charge impurity scattering effects and charge&#8208;carrier modulation by doping can offer intriguing opportunities for atomic&#8208;level control of resistive switching (RS). Nonetheless, such effects have remained unexplored for memristive applications based on 2D&#160;materials. Here a facile approach is reported to transform an RS&#8208;inactive rhenium disulfide (ReS2) into an effective switching material through interfacial modulation induced by molybdenum&#8208;irradiation (Mo&#8208;i)&#160;doping. Using ReS2 as a model system, this study unveils a unique RS mechanism based on the formation/dissolution of metallic &#946;&#8208;ReO2 filament across the defective ReS2 interface during the set/reset process. Through simple interfacial modulation, ReS2 of various thicknesses are switchable by modulating the Mo&#8208;irradiation period. Besides, the Mo&#8208;irradiated ReS2 (Mo&#8208;ReS2) memristor further exhibits a bipolar non&#8208;volatile switching ratio of nearly two orders of magnitude, programmable multilevel resistance states, and long&#8208;term synaptic plasticity. Additionally, the fabricated device can achieve a high MNIST learning accuracy of 91% under a non&#8208;identical pulse train. The study's findings demonstrate the potential for modulating RS in RS&#8208;inactive 2D materials via the unique doping&#8208;induced charged impurity scattering property.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Pressure&#8208;Guided Superhydrophobic Surfaces with Adaptive Adhesion and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8208;pressure&#8208;guided superhydrophobic surface (LPGSS) is designed by combining soft caps with hard skeletons. LPGSS automatically adjusts its soft cap to achieve a dynamic balance between stability and adhesion through the guidance of liquid pressure. A series of experiments demonstrate that low surface adhesion at moderate pressure and high stability at elevated pressure can be simultaneously achieved on the surface.








Abstract
The dynamic application environments of superhydrophobic surfaces, such as in the manufacturing, chemical, and garment industries, require the fast adaptiveness of the surfaces to their surroundings. Despite the progress in materials and structural design of superhydrophobic surfaces, simultaneously achieving high superhydrophobic stability and low adhesion by traditional design is still challenging. Here, a liquid&#8208;pressure&#8208;guided superhydrophobic surface with self&#8208;adjustable solid&#8211;liquid stability, and adhesion is demonstrated when reacting to the dynamic environmental requirements. To understand the underlying adaptive processes, the liquid impalement dynamics is imaged in three dimensions by confocal microscopy and the stability and superhydrophobicity are measured in varied systems. It is envisioned that the design strategy of liquid&#8208;pressure&#8208;guided superhydrophobic surfaces with dynamic anti&#8208;infiltration capability can stimulate the development of stable superhydrophobicity under complex wetting conditions.

         <title>Polarity&#8208;Differentiated Dielectric Materials in Monolayer Graphene Charge&#8208;Regulated Field&#8208;Effect Transistors for an Artificial Reflex Arc and Pain&#8208;Modulation System of the Spinal Cord</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge&#8208;regulated field&#8208;effect transistors (CRFETs) with polarity&#8208;differentiated dielectric materials and a monolayer graphene channel are developed to mimic a reflex arc and pain modulation system of the spinal cord. By integrating actuators and memristors with CRFETs, reflex actions and pain sensation under noxious stimuli are realized, offering a new method to emulate the functionalities of the nervous system.








Abstract
The nervous system is a vital part of organisms to survive and it endows them with remarkable abilities, such as perception, recognition, regulation, learning, and decision&#8208;making, by intertwining myriad neurons. To realize such outstanding efficacies and functions, many artificial devices and systems have been investigated to emulate the operating principles of the nervous system. Here, an artificial reflex arc (ARA) and artificial pain modulation system (APMS) are proposed to imitate the unconscious behaviors of the spinal cord. GdxOy&#8208; and AlxOy&#8208;based charge&#8208;regulated field&#8208;effect transistors (CRFETs) with a monolayer graphene channel are fabricated and adopted as inhibitory and excitatory synapses, respectively, under the same pulse signals to mimic the biological reflex arc through a connection with a poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene)&#8208;based actuator. Additionally, a memristor is integrated with a CRFET as the interneuron to regulate the Dirac point by controlling the voltage drop on the graphene channel, analogous to the descending pain&#8208;inhibition system in the spinal cord, to prevent excessive pain perception. The proposed ARA and APMS provide a significant step forward to realizing the functions of the nervous system, giving promising potential for developing future intelligent alarm systems, neuroprosthetics, and neurorobotics.

         <title>Multichannel Superposition of Grafted Perfect Vortex Beams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single metasurface is used to generate various grafted perfect vortex beams and realize the coaxial superpositions of these beams in different channels, without relying on the complicated conventional optical setup. A compact metasurface platform can perform a sophisticated task that is nearly impossible with conventional optics, opening opportunities for emerging application areas, such as singular optics and quantum science.








Abstract
Inspired by plant grafting, grafted vortex beams can be formed through grafting two or more helical phase profiles of optical vortex beams. Recently, grafted perfect vortex beams (GPVBs) have attracted much attention due to their unique optical properties and potential applications. However, the current method to generate and manipulate GPVBs requires a complex and bulky optical system, hindering further investigation and limiting its practical applications. Here, a compact metasurface approach for generating and manipulating GPVBs in multiple channels is proposed and demonstrated, which eliminates the need for such a complex optical setup. A single metasurface is utilized to realize various superpositions of GPVBs with different combinations of topological charges in four channels, leading to asymmetric singularity distributions. The positions of singularities in the superimposed beam can be further modulated by introducing an initial phase difference in the metasurface design. The work demonstrates a compact metasurface platform that performs a sophisticated optical task that is very challenging with conventional optics, opening opportunities for the investigation and applications of GPVBs in a wide range of emerging application areas, such as singular optics and quantum science.

         <title>Short&#8208;Range Diffusion Enables General Synthesis of Medium&#8208;Entropy Alloy Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general short&#8208;range diffusion driving strategy for preparing ultralight 3D porous medium entropy aerogels (MEAAs) is proposed to achieve highly efficient methanol oxidation electrocatalysis. The well&#8208;designed MEAAs can be used for a methanol&#8208;oxidation&#8208;assisted water electrolyzer with a low cell voltage of 1.476&#160;V, not only greatly reducing the overpotential of the traditional alkaline water electrolyzer, but also obtaining value&#8208;added formate products at anode.








Abstract
Medium&#8208;entropy alloy aerogels (MEAAs) with the advantages of both multimetallic alloys and aerogels are promising new materials in catalytic applications. However, limited by the immiscible behavior of different metals, achieving single&#8208;phase MEAAs is still a grand challenge. Herein, a general strategy for preparing ultralight 3D porous MEAAs with the lowest density of 39.3 mg cm&#8722;3 among the metal materials is reported, through combining auto&#8208;combustion and subsequent low&#8208;temperature reduction procedures. The homogenous mixing of precursors at the ionic level makes the short&#8208;range diffusion of metal atoms possible to drive the formation of single&#8208;phase MEAAs. As a proof of concept in catalysis, as&#8208;synthesized Ni50Co15Fe30Cu5 MEAAs exhibit a high mass activity of 1.62 A mg&#8722;1 and specific activity of 132.24 mA cm&#8722;2 toward methanol oxidation reactions, much higher than those of the low&#8208;entropy counterparts. In situ Fourier transform infrared and NMR spectroscopies reveal that MEAAs can enable highly selective conversion of methanol to formate. Most importantly, a methanol&#8208;oxidation&#8208;assisted MEAAs&#8208;based water electrolyzer can achieve a low cell voltage of 1.476 V at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for making value&#8208;added formate at the anode and H2 at the cathode, 173 mV lower than that of traditional alkaline water electrolyzers.

         <title>In Situ Synthesis of MOF&#8208;74 Family for High Areal Energy Density of Aqueous Nickel&#8211;Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) (bi/multimetallic MOF&#8208;74 family) in situ grown on carbon cloth is fabricated in application of aqueous Ni&#8211;Zn batteries. The synthetic strategy based on the coordination effect of metal ions and the concept of binder&#8208;free electrodes provide a new direction for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance materials in the energy&#8208;storage field.








Abstract
Limited by single metal active sites and low electrical conductivity, designing nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials with high capacity and high energy density remains a challenge. Herein, a series of bi/multimetallic MOF&#8208;74 family materials in situ grown on carbon cloth (CC) by doping Mx+ ions in Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 is fabricated: NiM&#8208;MOF@CC (M = Mn2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Al3+, Fe3+), and NiCoM&#8208;MOF@CC (M = Mn2+, Zn2+, Al3+, Fe3+). The type and ratio of doping metal ions can be adjusted while the original topology is preserved. Different metal ions are confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS). Furthermore, these Ni&#8208;based MOF electrodes are directly utilized as cathodes for aqueous nickel&#8211;zinc batteries (NZBs). Among all the as&#8208;prepared electrodes, NiCo&#8208;MOF@CC&#8208;3 (NCM@CC&#8208;3), with an optimized Co/Ni ratio of 1:1, exhibits the best electrical conductivity, which is according to the density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculations. The NCM@CC&#8208;3//Zn@CC battery achieves a high specific capacity of 1.77 mAh cm&#8211;2, a high areal energy density of 2.97 mWh cm&#8211;2, and high cycling stability of 83% capacity retention rate after 6000 cycles. The synthetic strategy based on the coordination effect of metal ions and the concept of binder&#8208;free electrodes provide a new direction for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance materials in the energy&#8208;storage field.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrocatalyst, Pt3Ge, engineered with a desired crystallographic facet (202) accelerates the hydrogen production by water electrolysis and records industrially desired operational stability over a wide range of pH compared to the commercial catalyst platinum on carbon. The driving force behind this stupendous performance is envisaged by mapping the reaction mechanism, active sites, and charge&#8208;transfer kinetics in various in situ and ex situ experiments corroborated by the first principles calculations.








Abstract
The discovery of novel materials for industrial&#8208;standard hydrogen production is the present need considering the global energy infrastructure. A novel electrocatalyst, Pt3Ge, which is engineered with a desired crystallographic facet (202), accelerates hydrogen production by water electrolysis, and records industrially desired operational stability compared to the commercial catalyst platinum is introduced. Pt3Ge&#8208;(202) exhibits low overpotential of 21.7 mV (24.6 mV for Pt/C) and 92 mV for 10 and 200 mA cm&#8722;2 current density, respectively in 0.5 m H2SO4. It also exhibits remarkable stability of 15&#160;000 accelerated degradation tests cycles (5000 for Pt/C) and exceptional durability of 500 h (@10 mA cm&#8722;2) in acidic media. Pt3Ge&#8208;(202) also displays low overpotential of 96 mV for 10 mA cm&#8722;2 current density in the alkaline medium, rationalizing its hydrogen production ability over a wide pH range required commercial operations. Long&#8208;term durability (&gt;75 h in alkaline media) with the industrial level current density (&gt;500 mA cm&#8722;2) has been demonstrated by utilizing the electrochemical flow reactor. The driving force behind this stupendous performance of Pt3Ge&#8208;(202) has been envisaged by mapping the reaction mechanism, active sites, and charge&#8208;transfer kinetics via controlled electrochemical experiments, ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in situ infrared spectroscopy, and in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy further corroborated by first principles calculations.

Abstract
The search for ultra&#8208;fast photonic memory devices is inspired by the ever&#8208;increasing number of cloud computing, supercomputing, and artificial intelligence applications, together with the unique advantages of signal processing in the optical domain such as high speed, large bandwidth, and low energy consumption. By embracing silicon photonics with chalcogenide phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs), non&#8208;volatile integrated photonic memory has been developed with promising potential in photonic integrated circuits and nanophotonic applications. While conventional PCMs suffer from slow crystallization speed, scandium&#8208;doped antimony telluride (SST) has recently been developed for ultrafast phase&#8208;change random&#8208;access memory applications. We demonstrate an ultrafast non&#8208;volatile photonic memory based on an SST thin film with a 2&#8208;ns write/erase speed&#8212;which is the fastest write/erase speed ever reported in integrated phase&#8208;change photonic devices. SST&#8208;based photonic memories exhibit multi&#8208;level capabilities and good stability at room temperature. By mapping the memory level to the biological synapse weight, an artificial neural network based on photonic memory devices is successfully established for image classification. Additionally, we demonstrate a reflective nanodisplay application using SST with optoelectronic modulation capabilities. Both the optical and electrical changes in SST during the phase transition and the fast&#8208;switching speed demonstrate their potential for use in photonic computing, neuromorphic computing, nanophotonics, and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Nonvolatile control of metal&#8208;insulator transition in VO2 by ferroelectric gating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Controlling phase transitions in correlated materials yields emergent functional properties, providing new aspects to future electronics and a fundamental understanding of condensed matter systems. With vanadium dioxide (VO2), a representative correlated material, we develop an approach to control a metal&#8208;insulator transition (MIT) behavior by employing a heteroepitaxial structure with a ferroelectric BiFeO3 (BFO) layer to modulate the interaction of correlated electrons. Owing to the defect&#8208;alleviated interfaces, the enhanced coupling between the correlated electrons and ferroelectric polarization is successfully demonstrated by showing a nonvolatile control of MIT of VO2 at room temperature. The ferroelectrically&#8208;tunable MIT could be realized through the Mott transistor (VO2/BFO/SrRuO3) with a remanent polarization of 80 &#956;Ccm&#8211;2, leading to a nonvolatile MIT behavior through the reversible electrical conductance with a large on/off ratio (&#8764;102), long retention time (&#8764;104 s), and high endurance (&#8764;103 cycles). Furthermore, we corroborate the structural phase transition of VO2 by ferroelectric polarization through in&#8208;situ Raman mapping analysis. Our study provides novel design principles for heteroepitaxial correlated materials and innovative insight to modulate multifunctional properties.

         <title>Stretchable and Biodegradable Batteries with High Energy and Power Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Realizing a sustainable, technologically advanced future will necessitate solving the electronic waste problem. Biodegradable forms of electronics offer a viable path through their environmental benignity. With both the sheer number of devices produced every day as well as their areas of application ever increasing, new concepts of degradable batteries able to sustain the high power demands of modern electronics must be developed. Simultaneously, integration of electronics in close interaction with its user or powering soft robotic devices necessitates high degrees of compliance, rendering stretchable batteries indispensable. Here, a concept for merging intrinsically stretchable materials with engineered stretchability by kirigami&#8208;patterning on a component level is shown to yield high&#8208;power biodegradable batteries with reversible elasticity up to 35% when stretched uniaxially and 20% for biaxial extension. Using a combination of molybdenum metal foils, a molybdenum trioxide paste and magnesium metal foils as electrode materials, a peak power output of 196 &#956;W cm&#8211;2 and an energy density of 1.72 mWh cm&#8211;2 is achieved. The biodegradable batteries are used to power an on&#8208;skin biomedical sensor patch, enabling monitoring of sodium concentration in sweat. This concept provides a versatile route for high&#8208;power biodegradable batteries, enabling untethered soft electronic devices in a sustainable future.

         <title>Construction of N, P Co&#8208;Doped Carbon Frames Anchored with Fe Single Atoms and Fe2P Nanoparticles as a Robust Coupling Catalyst for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel in situ doping&#8211;adsorption&#8211;phosphidation strategy is discovered for the synthesis of well&#8208;defined Fe single atoms&#8211;Fe2P nanoparticles/N, P co&#8208;doped carbon frames catalyst, and a new concept of &#8220;atomically dispersed Fe&#63743;N4/Fe&#63743;P coupled active centers&#8221; for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction is put forward.








Abstract
A coupling catalyst of highly dispersed N, P co&#8208;doped carbon frames (NPCFs) anchored with Fe single atoms (SAs) and Fe2P nanoparticles (NPs) is synthesized by a novel in situ doping&#8211;adsorption&#8211;phosphatization strategy for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The optimized Fe SAs&#8208;Fe2P NPs/NPCFs&#8208;2.5 catalyst shows a superior ORR activity and stability in 0.5 m H2SO4 and 0.1 m KOH, respectively. Theoretical calculations reveal a synergistic effect, in that the existence of Fe2P weakens the adsorption of ORR intermediates on active sites and lowers the reaction free energy. The doped P atoms with a strong electron&#8208;donating ability elevate the energy level of Fe&#8208;3d orbitals and facilitate the adsorption of O2. The active Fe atoms exist in a low oxidation state and are less positively charged, and they serve as an electron reservoir capable of donating and releasing electrons, thus improving the ORR activity. Operando and in situ characterization results indicate that the atomically dispersed Fe&#63743;N4/Fe&#63743;P coupled active centers in the Fe SAs&#8208;Fe2P NPs/NPCFs&#8208;2.5 catalyst are characteristic of the different catalytic mechanisms in acidic and alkaline media. This work proposes a novel idea for constructing coupling catalysts with atomic&#8208;level precision and provides a strong reference for the development of high&#8208;efficiency ORR electrocatalysts for practical application.

         <title>Dangling Octahedra Enable Edge States in 2D Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;energy and long&#8208;lived edge states of 2D lead halide perovskites arise from the rotational symmetry elevation at the crystal layer edges, which are enabled by dangling PbBr6 octahedra at the lattice terminals. These dangling octahedra with enhanced atomic vibrations can give rise to localized electronic states that enable an effective electron transport from the interior to layer edges.








Abstract
The structural reconstruction at the crystal layer edges of 2D lead halide perovskites (LHPs) leads to unique edge states (ES), which are manifested by prolonged carrier lifetime and reduced emission energy. These special ES&#160;can effectively enhance the optoelectronic performance of devices, but their intrinsic origin and working mechanism remain elusive. Here it is demonstrated that the ES of a family of 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper LHPs [BA2CsPb2Br7, BA2MAPb2Br7, and BA2MA2Pb3Br10 (BA = butylammonium; MA = methylammonium)] arise from the rotational symmetry elevation of the PbBr6 octahedra dangling at the crystal layer edges. These dangling octahedra give rise to localized electronic states that enable an effective transport of electrons from the interior to layer edges, and the population of electrons in both the interior states and the ES can be manipulated via controlling the external fields. Moreover, the abundant phonons, activated by the dangling octahedra, can interact with electrons to facilitate radiative recombination, counterintuitive to the suppressive role commonly observed in conventional semiconductors. This work unveils the intrinsic atomistic and electronic origins of ES in 2D LHPs, which can stimulate the exploration of ES&#8208;based exotic optoelectronic properties and the corresponding design of high&#8208;performance devices for these emergent low&#8208;dimensional semiconductors.

         <title>Structural Dynamics and Tunability for Colloidal Tin Halide Perovskite Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of stable, tunable, and monodisperse colloidal CsSnI3 nanocrystals or a mixture of 3D CsSnI3 nanocrystals and 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (R&#8208;NH3+)2Csn&#8722;1SnnI3n+1 perovskite nanosheets is reported. The key factor in this chemical design is the nucleation and growth of the CsSnI3 nanocrystals from (R&#8208;NH3+)2SnI4.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals are highly attractive for next&#8208;generation optoelectronics because they are easy to synthesize and offer great compositional and morphological tunability. However, the replacement of lead by tin for sustainability reasons is hampered by the unstable nature of Sn2+ oxidation state and by an insufficient understanding of the chemical processes involved in the synthesis. Here, an optimized synthetic route is demonstrated to obtain stable, tunable, and monodisperse CsSnI3 nanocrystals, exhibiting well&#8208;defined excitonic peaks. Similar to lead halide perovskites, these nanocrystals are prepared by combining a precursor mixture of SnI2, oleylamine, and oleic acid, with a Cs&#8208;oleate precursor. Among the products, nanocrystals with 10&#160;nm lateral size in the &#947;&#8208;orthorhombic phase prove to be the most stable. To achieve such stability, an excess of precursor SnI2 as well as substoichiometric Sn:ligand ratios are key. Structural, compositional, and optical investigations complemented by first&#8208;principle density functional theory calculations confirm that nanocrystal nucleation and growth follow the formation of (R&#8208;NH3+)2SnI4 nanosheets, with R = C18H35. Under specific synthetic conditions, stable mixtures of 3D nanocrystals CsSnI3 and 2D nanosheets (Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (R&#8208;NH3+)2Csn&#8722;1SnnI3n+1 with n&#160;&gt; 1) are obtained. These results set a path to exploiting the high potential of Sn halide perovskite nanocrystals for opto&#8208;electronic applications.

         <title>Raman Scattering Measurement of Suspended Graphene under Extreme Strain Induced by Nanoindentation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High strains are applied to single&#8208;layer graphene by an atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip and the Raman signals are obtained simultaneously using a Raman&#8211;AFM system. Graphene is stretched up to 6.1% and the G and 2D bands of Raman signal are shifted by 277 and 660 cm&#8722;1 respectively, which are unprecedented values.








Abstract
Graphene is known as a superstiff and extremely strong material. Hence, applying strains greater than 1% to graphene and simultaneously measuring changes in its physical properties has been challenging because of the limited methodologies for measuring both high strain and other physical properties. Here, Raman scattering measurement of suspended graphene under extremely high biaxial strain as large as 6.1% using an atomic force microscopy (AFM)&#8211;Raman spectroscopy measurement tool is reported. Nanoindentation is performed using AFM tips machined to have a flat top and a hole shape, resulting in a strained graphene area sufficiently large to enable the acquisition of a Raman signal. At the same time, the laser light is focused on the strained flat area of the graphene membrane. The Raman signals of the G and 2D bands of graphene are redshifted by 282 and 684 cm&#8722;1, respectively, which is unprecedented for graphene. This measurement technique provides an effective methodology to measure variations in the physical properties of atomically thin materials under superhigh strain.

         <title>Brushed Metals for Rechargeable Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Battery designs are swiftly changing from metal&#8208;ion to rechargeable metal batteries. Theoretically, metals can deliver maximum anode capacity and enable cells with improved energy density. In practice, these advantages are only possible if the parasitic surface reactions associated with metal anodes are controlled. These undesirable surface reactions are responsible for many troublesome issues, like dendrite formation and accelerated consumption of active materials, which leads to anodes with low cycle life or even battery runaway. Here, we report a facile and solvent&#8208;free brushing method to convert powders into films atop Li and Na metal foils. Benefiting from the reactivity of Li metal with these powder films, surface energy can be effectively tuned, thereby preventing parasitic reaction. In&#8208;operando study of P2S5&#8208;Li anodes in liquid electrolyte cells reveals a smoother electrode contour and more uniform Li metal electrodeposition and dissolution behavior during cycling. The P2S5&#8208;Li anodes sustain ultralow polarization in symmetric cell for &gt;4000 h, &#8764;8&#215; longer than bare Li anodes. The capacity retention is &#8764;70% higher when P2S5&#8208;Li anodes are paired with a practical LiFePO4 cathode (&#8764;3.2 mAh cm&#8211;2) after 340 cycles. Brush coating opens a promising avenue to fabricate large&#8208;scale artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase directly on metals without the need for organic solvent.

Physical shadow growth is a vacuum deposition technique that permits a wide variety of 3D&#8208;shaped nanoparticles and structures to be fabricated from a large library of materials. Recent advances in the control of the shadow effect at the nanoscale expand the scope of nanomaterials from spherical nanoparticles to complex 3D shaped hybrid nanoparticles and structures. In particular, plasmonically active nanomaterials can be engineered in their shape and material composition so that they exhibit unique physical and chemical properties. Here, the recent progress in the development of shadow growth techniques to realize hybrid plasmonic nanomaterials is discussed. The review describes how fabrication permits the material response to be engineered and highlights novel functions. Potential fields of application with a focus on photonic devices, biomedical, and chiral spectroscopic applications are discussed.

         <title>Biaxially Compressive Strain in Ni/Ru Core/Shell Nanoplates Boosts Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biaxially compressive strained nickel/ruthenium core/shell hexagonal nanoplates are developed as advanced catalysts to boost the performance of lithium&#8211;carbon dioxide batteries. It is demonstrated that strain effect can tune the electronic structure of ruthenium, which makes the strained ruthenium shell energetically beneficial for the nucleation and decomposition of lithium carbonate crystals.








Abstract
Regulating surface strain of nanomaterials is an effective strategy to manipulate the activity of catalysts, yet not well recognized in rechargeable Li&#8211;CO2 batteries. Herein, biaxially compressive strained nickel/ruthenium core/shell hexagonal nanoplates (Ni/Ru HNPs) with lattice compression of &#8776;5.1% and &#8776;3.2% in the Ru {10&#8722;10} and (0002) facets are developed as advanced catalysts for Li&#8211;CO2 batteries. It is demonstrated that tuning the electronic structure of Ru shell through biaxially compressive strain engineering can boost the kinetically sluggish CO2 reduction and evolution reactions, thus achieving a high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;CO2 battery with low charge platform/overpotential (3.75&#160;V/0.88&#160;V) and ultralong cycling life (120 cycles at 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1 with a fixed capacity of 1000 mAh g&#8722;1). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the biaxially compressive strain can downshift the d&#8208;band center of surface Ru atoms and thus weaken the binding of CO2 molecules, which is energetically beneficial for the nucleation and decomposition of Li2CO3 crystals during the discharge and charge processes. This study confirms that strain engineering, though constructing a well&#8208;defined core/shell structure, is a promising strategy to improve the inherent catalytic activity of Ru&#8208;based materials in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Direct Light Orbital Angular Momentum Detection in Mid&#8208;Infrared Based on the Type&#8208;II Weyl Semimetal TaIrTe4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photodetector based on the type&#8208;II Weyl semimetal tantalum iridium telluride is designed with peculiar electrode geometries to directly detect the orbital angular momentum (OAM) order of the vertex beam in the mid&#8208;infrared wavelength. The helical phase gradient of light can be distinguished by a current winding around the optical beam axis, with a magnitude proportional to its quantized OAM mode number.








Abstract
The direct photocurrent detection capability of light orbital angular momentum (OAM) has recently been realized with topological Weyl semimetals, but it is limited to the near&#8208;infrared wavelength range. The extension of the direct OAM detection capability to the mid&#8208;infrared band, which is a wave band that plays an important role in a vast range of applications, has not yet been realized. This is because the photocurrent responses of most photodetectors are neither sensitive to the phase information nor efficient in the mid&#8208;infrared region. In this study, a photodetector based on the type&#8208;II Weyl semimetal tantalum iridium telluride (TaIrTe4) is designed with peculiar electrode geometries to directly detect the topological charge of the OAM using the orbital photogalvanic effect (OPGE). The results indicate that the helical phase gradient of light can be distinguished by a current winding around the optical beam axis, with a magnitude proportional to its quantized OAM mode number. The topologically enhanced responses in the mid&#8208;infrared region of TaIrTe4 further help overcome the low responsivity issues and finally render direct OAM detection capability. This study enables on&#8208;chip&#8208;integrated OAM detection, and thus OAM&#8208;sensitive focal plane arrays in the mid&#8208;infrared region.

         <title>Highly Potassiophilic Graphdiyne Skeletons Decorated with Cu Quantum Dots Enable Dendrite&#8208;Free Potassium&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Al current collector modified by hierarchical N&#8208;doped carbon and graphdiyne composites is beneficial to reducing the local current density and increasing the potassiophilic sites, accordingly enabling excellent electrochemical performance for dendrite&#8208;free K&#8208;metal anode.








Abstract
Employing an Al foil current collector at the potassium anode side is an ideal choice to entail low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;energy potassium&#8208;metal batteries (PMBs). Nevertheless, the poor affinity between the potassium and the planar Al can cause uneven K plating/stripping and, hence, an undermined anode performance, which remains a significant challenge to be addressed. Herein, a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon@graphdiyne (NC@GDY)&#8208;modified Al current collector affording potassiophilic properties is proposed, which simultaneously suppresses the dendrite growth and prolongs the lifespan of K anodes. The thin and light modification layer (7&#160;&#181;m thick, with a mass loading of 500&#160;&#181;g cm&#8722;2) is fabricated by directly growing GDY nanosheets interspersed with Cu quantum dots on NC polyhedron templates. As a result, symmetric cell tests reveal that the K@NC@GDY&#8208;Al electrode exhibits an unprecedented cycle life of over 2400 h at a 40% depth of discharge. Even at an 80% depth of discharge, the cell can still sustain for 850 h. When paired with a potassium Prussian blue cathode, the thus&#8208;assembled full cell demonstrates comparable capacity and rate performance with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PMBs.

         <title>Multiphoton Lithography of Organic Semiconductor Devices for 3D Printing of Flexible Electronic Circuits, Biosensors, and Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D printing of flexible microelectronics has gained significant attention. In this work, a photosensitive resin doped with organic semiconductor material is developed for direct laser writing based on multiphoton lithography. Fabrication of microelectronic devices, hybrid microelectrodes, cell&#8208;adhesive substrates, and high&#8208;performance glucose biosensors are successfully demonstrated. These soft and conductive microstructures have potential in flexible electronics, organic bioelectronics, and biosensors.








Abstract
In recent years, 3D printing of electronics have received growing attention due to their potential applications in emerging fields such as nanoelectronics and nanophotonics. Multiphoton lithography (MPL) is considered the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art amongst the microfabrication techniques with true 3D fabrication capability owing to its excellent level of spatial and temporal control. Here, a homogenous and transparent photosensitive resin doped with an organic semiconductor material (OS), which is compatible with MPL process, is introduced to fabricate a variety of 3D OS composite microstructures (OSCMs) and microelectronic devices. Inclusion of 0.5 wt% OS in the resin enhances the electrical conductivity of the composite polymer about 10 orders of magnitude and compared to other MPL&#8208;based methods, the resultant OSCMs offer high specific electrical conductivity. As a model protein, laminin is incorporated into these OSCMs without a significant loss of activity. The OSCMs are biocompatible and support cell adhesion and growth. Glucose&#8208;oxidase&#8208;encapsulated OSCMs offer a highly sensitive glucose sensing platform with nearly tenfold higher sensitivity compared to previous glucose biosensors. In addition, this biosensor exhibits excellent specificity and high reproducibility. Overall, these results demonstrate the great potential of these novel MPL&#8208;fabricated OSCM devices for a wide range of applications from flexible bioelectronics/biosensors, to nanoelectronics and organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip devices.

         <title>A Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode Enabled by Designed Ultrathin MgF2 Nanosheets Encapsulated Inside Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Graphene&#8208;Like Hollow Nanospheres</title>

         <dc:description>
Ultrathin MgF2 nanosheets encapsulated inside N&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;like hollow nanospheres are prepared by the perfect combination of atomic layer deposition and chemical vapor deposition. In situ optical microscopy, in situ transmission electron microscopy, and theoretical calculations are used to investigate the deposition behavior and mechanism in detail. The Li&#8208;metal batteries based on the designed composite anode demonstrate superior electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Uncontrolled lithium dendrite growth and dramatic volume change during cycling have long been severely impeding the practical applications of Li metal as the ultimate anode. In this work, ultrathin MgF2 nanosheets encapsulated inside nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;like hollow nanospheres (MgF2 NSs@NGHSs) are ingeniously fabricated to address these problems by a perfect combination of atomic layer deposition and chemical vapor deposition. The uniform and continuous Li&#8211;Mg solid&#8208;solution inner layer formed by the MgF2 nanosheets can reduce the nucleation overpotential and induce selective deposition of Li into the cavities of the NGHSs. Furthermore, the Li deposition behavior and mechanism of the hybrid host are comprehensively explored by in situ optical microscopy at the macroscopic level, in situ transmission electron microscopy at the microscopic level, and theoretical calculations at the atomic level, respectively. Benefiting from a synergistic modulation strategy of nanosheet seed&#8208;induced nucleation and Li&#8208;confined growth, the designed composite demonstrates an endurance of 590 cycles for asymmetric cells and a lifespan over 1330 h for corresponding symmetric cells. When applied in LiFePO4 full cells, it provides a reversible capacity of 90.6 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 1 C.

         <title>Unconventional Spin Pumping and Magnetic Damping in an Insulating Compensated Ferrimagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional spin pumping (SP) together with the divergent nonlocal magnetic damping is unambiguously reported in compensated ferrimagnetic Gd3Fe5O12&#8208;based heterostructures. The coherent and incoherent spin currents undergo a distinct direction change with the variation of temperature. The underlying physical mechanisms are self&#8208;consistently clarified by the ferrimagnetic counterpart of SP and the handedness&#8208;related spin&#8208;wave spectra.








Abstract
Recently, the interest in spin pumping (SP) has escalated from ferromagnets into antiferromagnetic systems, potentially enabling fundamental physics and magnonic applications. Compensated ferrimagnets are considered alternative platforms for bridging ferro&#8208; and antiferromagnets, but their SP and the associated magnetic damping have been largely overlooked so far despite their seminal importance for magnonics. Herein, an unconventional SP together with magnetic damping in an insulating compensated ferrimagnet Gd3Fe5O12 (GdIG) is reported. Remarkably, the divergence of the nonlocal effective magnetic damping induced by SP close to the compensation temperature in GdIG/Cu/Pt heterostructures is identified unambiguously. Furthermore, the coherent and incoherent spin currents, generated by SP and the spin Seebeck effect, respectively, undergo a distinct direction change with the variation of temperature. The physical mechanisms underlying these observations are self&#8208;consistently clarified by the ferrimagnetic counterpart of SP and the handedness&#8208;related spin&#8208;wave spectra. The findings broaden the conventional paradigm of the ferromagnetic SP model and open new opportunities for exploring the ferrimagnetic magnonic devices.

         <title>An Artificial Tactile Neuron Enabling Spiking Representation of Stiffness and Disease Diagnosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial tactile neuron that encodes the stiffness of pressed materials into spike frequency evolution patterns is developed using an ovonic threshold switch and a piezoresistive sensor. The spiking&#8208;represented stiffness of soft materials with varying stiffness in a combination of spiking neural network&#8208;based learning enables the classification of malignancy status of breast tumors with a recognition accuracy up to 95.8%.








Abstract
Mechanical properties of biological systems provide useful information about the biochemical status of cells and tissues. Here, an artificial tactile neuron enabling spiking representation of stiffness and spiking neural network (SNN)&#8208;based learning for disease diagnosis is reported. An artificial spiking tactile neuron based on an ovonic threshold switch serving as an artificial soma and a piezoresistive sensor as an artificial mechanoreceptor is developed and shown to encode the elastic stiffness of pressed materials into spike frequency evolution patterns. SNN&#8208;based learning of ultrasound elastography images abstracted by spike frequency evolution rate enables the classification of malignancy status of breast tumors with a recognition accuracy up to 95.8%. The stiffness&#8208;encoding artificial tactile neuron and learning of spiking&#8208;represented stiffness patterns hold a great promise for the identification and classification of tumors for disease diagnosis and robot&#8208;assisted surgery with low power consumption, low latency, and yet high accuracy.

         <title>Deterministic Assembly of Colloidal Quantum Dots for Multifunctional Integrated Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deterministic patterning of colloidal quantum dots into high&#8208;quality micro&#8208;/nanostructures is developed for the construction of multifunctional integrated photonic devices. Mode&#8208;tunable microlasers and waveguides are coupled to direct on&#8208;chip generation and propagation of coherent light, which permits a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of integrated photonic circuits for encoding photonic outputs into information bits.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising for photonic applications toward lasers, waveguides, and photodetectors. However, integration of high&#8208;quality photonic elements into multifunctional devices is still restricted by optical losses stemming from the accumulation of defects and disorder in the solution process. Herein, a platform with a directional Laplace pressure is created for eliminating undesired pinning of liquid fronts in the solution process and boosting ordered assembly of CQDs into designable micro&#8208;/nanostructures. The versatility and robustness of this method are demonstrated by deterministic patterning of CQDs with different components and photoluminescence spectra onto various substrates. On the basis of this platform, microring lasers with tunable emission modes, low&#8208;loss waveguides, and their coupled structures have been reached for direct on&#8208;chip generation and propagation of coherent light. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of integrated circuits is also conducted by combining microcavity lasers with waveguides for encoding photonic outputs into information bits.

         <title>Combinatorial Polyacrylamide Hydrogels for Preventing Biofouling on Implantable Biosensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel formulations that prevent protein and platelet adhesion in assays where &#8220;gold&#8208;standard&#8221; polymers exhibit significant platelet adhesion are identified. By using machine&#8208;learning techniques to analyze molecular features of the polyacrylamide&#8208;based copolymers, features giving rise to this anti&#8208;biofouling performance are identified. Coating electrochemical devices with these top&#8208;performing polyacrylamide&#8208;based hydrogels extend lifetime when implanted intravenously and enable in vivo real&#8208;time monitoring of analytes.








Abstract
Biofouling on the surface of implanted medical devices and biosensors severely hinders device functionality and drastically shortens device lifetime. Poly(ethylene glycol) and zwitterionic polymers are currently considered &#8220;gold&#8208;standard&#8221; device coatings to reduce biofouling. To discover novel anti&#8208;biofouling materials, a combinatorial library of polyacrylamide&#8208;based copolymer hydrogels is created, and their ability is screened to prevent fouling from serum and platelet&#8208;rich plasma in a high&#8208;throughput parallel assay. It is found that certain nonintuitive copolymer compositions exhibit superior anti&#8208;biofouling&#160;properties over current gold&#8208;standard materials, and machine learning is used to identify key molecular features underpinning their performance. For validation, the surfaces of electrochemical biosensors are coated with hydrogels and their anti&#8208;biofouling performance in vitro and in vivo in rodent models is evaluated. The copolymer hydrogels preserve device function and enable continuous measurements of a small&#8208;molecule drug in vivo better than gold&#8208;standard coatings. The novel methodology described enables the discovery of anti&#8208;biofouling materials that can extend the lifetime of real&#8208;time in vivo sensing devices.

To discover novel anti-biofouling materials, a combinatorial library of polyacrylamide-based copolymer hydrogels is created, and their ability is screened to prevent fouling from serum and platelet-rich plasma in a high-throughput parallel assay. It is found that certain nonintuitive copolymer compositions exhibit superior anti-biofouling&#160;properties over current gold-standard materials, and machine learning is used to identify key molecular features underpinning their performance. For validation, the surfaces of electrochemical biosensors are coated with hydrogels and their anti-biofouling performance in vitro and in vivo in rodent models is evaluated. The copolymer hydrogels preserve device function and enable continuous measurements of a small-molecule drug in vivo better than gold-standard coatings. The novel methodology described enables the discovery of anti-biofouling materials that can extend the lifetime of real-time in vivo sensing devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical On&#8208;Site Switching of the Directional Liquid Transport on a Conical Fiber</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;site switchable directional liquid transport on a conical fiber (DLT&#8208;CF) is realized by a facile electrochemical strategy. The droplet dynamic on a conical fiber can be switched between moving and pinning by applying and removing an electric potential. Taking advantages, various controllable DLT&#8208;CFs are demonstrated, including those with tunable transport distance, array manipulation, and assembly&#8208;line processing.








Abstract
Directional liquid transport (DLT), especially that proceeding on a conical fiber (DLT&#8208;CF), is an important mass&#8208;transfer process widely used both by natural organisms and in practical applications. However, on&#8208;site switching of the DLT&#8208;CF remains a challenge due to the nontunable driving force imparted by the structural gradient, which greatly limits its application. Here, unprecedently, a facile electrochemical strategy is developed for reaching the on&#8208;site switchable DLT&#8208;CF, featuring in situ control and fast response. Depending on the poised electric potential, the droplet can either move directionally or be pinned at any position for a tunable duration time, exhibiting completely different moving characteristics from the traditional DLT&#8208;CF with no control. It is proposed that the surface hysteresis resistance, closely related to both the surface hydrogen&#8208;bonding network and the droplet topology on the fiber, can be largely altered electrochemically. The tunable hysteresis resistance works synergistically with the conical&#8208;structure&#8208;induced Laplace pressure to on&#8208;site tune the forces acting on the droplet, leading to various controllable DLTs&#8208;CF, including those with tunable distance and direction, array manipulation, and assembly line processing of droplets. The strategy is applicable for versatile liquids, offering a general approach for controllable liquid transport in fibrous systems.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 Membranes with Robust Ferroelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabrication of centimeter&#8208;scale, crack&#8208;free, freestanding Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanomembranes is reported, and their robust ferroelectricity is confirmed. By transferring freestanding Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 membranes to transmission electron microscopy grids, the phases, orientations, grain&#8208;size distributions, and grain boundaries are atomically characterized from plan&#8208;view. This work opens a new paradigm for exploring the complex structures and unconventional ferroelectricity in polymorphic Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 using plan&#8208;view imaging.








Abstract
Hafnia&#8208;based compounds have considerable potential for use in nanoelectronics due to their compatibility with complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor devices and robust ferroelectricity at nanoscale sizes. However, the unexpected ferroelectricity in this class of compounds often remains elusive due to the polymorphic nature of hafnia, as well as the lack of suitable methods for the characterization of the mixed/complex phases in hafnia thin films. Herein, the preparation of centimeter&#8208;scale, crack&#8208;free, freestanding Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) nanomembranes that are well suited for investigating the local crystallographic phases, orientations, and grain boundaries at both the microscopic and mesoscopic scales is reported. Atomic&#8208;level imaging of the plan&#8208;view crystallographic patterns shows that more than 80% of the grains are the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase, and that the mean equivalent diameter of these grains is about 12.1&#160;nm, with values ranging from 4 to 50&#160;nm. Moreover, the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase is stable in substrate&#8208;free HZO membranes, indicating that strain from the substrate is not responsible for maintaining the polar phase. It is also demonstrated that HZO capacitors prepared on flexible substrates are highly uniform, stable, and robust. These freestanding membranes provide a viable platform for the exploration of HZO polymorphic films with complex structures and pave the way to flexible nanoelectronics.

         <title>An Optical/Ferroelectric Multiplexing Multidimensional Nonvolatile Memory from Ferroelectric Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using atomic force microscopy (AFM)&#8208;based infrared spectroscopy as a nano&#8208;optical writing/readout tool, a novel optical/ferroelectric multiplexing poly(vinylidene fluoride) memory with independent four&#8208;level optical and bilevel ferroelectric signals is demonstrated. The different temperature tolerance of phase change and polarization switching enables an integration of optical read&#8208;only memory and ferroelectric random access. This work opens up new opportunities for high density and security data storage.








Abstract
Multiplexing physical dimensions to realize multidimensional storage in a single material has been a goal to increase storage density and data security. Multidimensional storage is only achieved in optical storage material (OSM) by far. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), a semicrystalline polymer, is widely studied as a candidate for ferroelectric random access (FeRAM). Herein, the atomic force microscopy (AFM)&#8208;based infrared spectroscopy techniqueis used to induce multilevel phase transformations in PVDF ultrathin film on nanometric scales and for writing/readout of IR signals. An optical/ferroelectric multiplexing PVDF memory, where information can be coded with independent four&#8208;level optical IR and bilevel ferroelectric signals, is demonstrated. High data security and a storage density up to 180 GBit in.&#8722;2 are achieved simultaneously. Owing to the different critical temperature for phase transformation (optical data, &lt;167&#160;&#176;C) and polarization switching (ferroelectric data, &lt;100&#160;&#176;C), the multiplexing memory can function both as optical read&#8208;only memory and FeRAM. This work expands material supporting physical dimensions multiplexing beyond OSM for the first time, opening up new opportunities for future high&#8208;capacity, multifunctional nano&#8208;memory. The strategy proposed here enables on&#8208;demand and tunable programming on IR waves, offering prospects for fabrication of active nano&#8208;optical devices.

         <title>A Real&#8208;Time Self&#8208;Adaptive Thermal Metasurface</title>

         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;adaptive metasurface platform for real&#8208;time thermal regulation is presented. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept platform experimentally demonstrates arbitrary switching between elaborate thermal patterns consolidated into an active thermoelectric element matrix. The thermal pixel matrix and feedback control system are integrated into a universal system. This work may pave the way for real&#8208;time thermal management in programming formations.








Abstract
Emerging metamaterials have served as an efficient strategy for the realization of unconventional heat control and management using structural thermal properties, and many functional thermal metadevices have been investigated. However, thermal functions are usually fixed or limited in the switching range. Thus far, real&#8208;time thermal regulation is elusive for thermal metamaterials because of deterministic artificial metastructures and uncontrollable phase transitions, coupled with the absence of dynamic adaptability. Here, a self&#8208;adaptive metasurface platform to implement programmable thermal functions via the automatic evolution of thermoelectric heat sources and real&#8208;time control of the driven voltage is reported. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept smart platform experimentally demonstrates arbitrary switching between elaborate thermal patterns consolidated into an active thermoelectric element matrix. Further, thermal pixels and feedback control systems are integrated into printed circuit boards, resulting in self&#8208;adaptability to any thermal requirements. This study sets up a new paradigm for arbitrary transitions between exquisite thermal patterns and is expected to pave the way for real&#8208;time thermal management in a programming formation.

         <title>A Heterogeneously Integrated Spiking Neuron Array for Multimode&#8208;Fused Perception and Object Classification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial multimodal sensory system based on a multimode&#8208;fused spiking neuron (MFSN) is reported. The MFSN is capable of multimodal sensing, data fusion, and spiking conversion through heterogeneous integration of pressure sensors and memristors. The application feasibility of the system is demonstrated through enhanced pattern recognition and object classification. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept MFSNs contribute to the development of highly intelligent robotics.








Abstract
Multimode&#8208;fused sensing in the somatosensory system helps people obtain comprehensive object properties and make accurate judgments. However, building such multisensory systems with conventional metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor technology presents serious device integration and circuit complexity challenges. Here, a multimode&#8208;fused spiking neuron (MFSN) with a compact structure to achieve human&#8208;like multisensory perception is reported. The MFSN heterogeneously integrates a pressure sensor to process pressure and a NbOx&#8208;based memristor to sense temperature. Using this MFSN, multisensory analog information can be fused into one spike train, showing excellent data compression and conversion capabilities. Moreover, both pressure and temperature information are distinguished from fused spikes by decoupling the output frequencies and amplitudes, supporting multimodal tactile perception. Then, a 3 &#215; 3 MFSN array is fabricated, and the fused frequency patterns are fed into a spiking neural network for enhanced tactile pattern recognition. Finally, a larger MFSN array is simulated for classifying objects with different shapes, temperatures, and weights, validating the feasibility of the MFSNs for practical applications. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept MFSNs enable the building of multimodal sensory systems and contribute to the development of highly intelligent robotics.

         <title>Nanocube Epitaxy for the Realization of Printable Monocrystalline Nanophotonic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new paradigm to fabricate printable monocrystalline gold nanostructures with an arbitrary geometry is demonstrated using nanocubes as building blocks. A careful balance of oxidation and reduction processes at their surface allows liquid&#8208;phase epitaxy with extensive morphology control at near&#8208;ambient temperature. An extended monocrystalline nanophotonics array of the highest quality can be printed from poly(dimethylsiloxane) to any receiving substrate.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanoparticles of the highest quality can be obtained via colloidal synthesis at low&#8208;cost. Despite the strong potential for integration in nanophotonic devices, the geometry of colloidal plasmonic nanoparticles is mostly limited to that of platonic solids. This is in stark contrast to nanostructures obtained by top&#8208;down methods that offer unlimited capability for plasmon resonance engineering, but present poor material quality and have doubtful perspectives for scalability. Here, an approach that combines the best of the two worlds by transforming assemblies of single&#8208;crystal gold nanocube building blocks into continuous monocrystalline plasmonic nanostructures with an arbitrary shape, via epitaxy in solution at near ambient temperature, is introduced. Nanocube dimers are used as a nanoreactor model system to investigate the mechanism in operando, revealing competitive redox processes of oxidative etching at the nanocube corners and simultaneous heterogeneous nucleation at their surface, that ensure filling of the sub&#8208;nanometer gap in a self&#8208;limited manner. Applying this procedure to nanocube arrays assembled in a patterned poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) substrate, it is able to obtain printable monocrystalline nanoantenna arrays that can be swiftly integrated in devices. This may lead to the implementation of low&#8208;cost nanophotonic surfaces of the highest quality in industrial&#160;products.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Artificial Nanocilia Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable self&#8208;assembly strategy is presented that can direct magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) into a highly ordered responsive artificial nanocilia actuator with exquisite nanometer 3D structural arrangements. The assembled nanocilia can exhibit field&#8208;responsive actuation motions in a reversible and repeatable manner via rolling and sliding between assembled NPs with the aid of oleic acid bearings tethered to each NP.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of nanoparticles (NPs) is a powerful route to constructing higher&#8208;order structures. However, the programmed self&#8208;assembly of NPs into non&#8208;close&#8208;packed, 3D, shape&#8208;morphing nanocilia arrays remains elusive, whereas dynamically actuated nanometer cilia are universal in living systems. Here, a programmable self&#8208;assembly strategy is presented that can direct magnetic NPs into a highly ordered responsive artificial nanocilia actuator with exquisite nanometer 3D structural arrangements. The self&#8208;assembled artificial NP cilia can maintain their structural integrity through the interplay of interparticle interactions. Interestingly, the nanocilia can exhibit a field&#8208;responsive actuation motion through &#8220;rolling and sliding&#8221; between assembled NPs rather than bending the entire ciliary beam. It is demonstrated that oleic acid coated over the NPs acts as a lubricating bearing and enables the rolling/sliding&#8208;based actuation of the cilia.

         <title>Ultrafast Thermalization Pathways of Excited Bulk and Surface States in the Ferroelectric Rashba Semiconductor GeTe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A time&#8208;, spin&#8208;, and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission study of the ferroelectric Rashba semiconductor &#945;&#8208;GeTe is performed following ultrafast optical excitation. The thermalization pathways exhibit an unconventional temperature dependence, which is understood in terms of the underpinning microscopic scattering channels. The Rashba effect is found to inhibit electron&#8211;electron scatterings, enabling control of the overall dynamics with lattice temperature on subpicosecond timescales.








Abstract
A large Rashba effect is essential for future applications in spintronics. Particularly attractive is understanding and controlling nonequilibrium properties of ferroelectric Rashba semiconductors. Here, time&#8208; and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission is utilized to access the ultrafast dynamics of bulk and surface transient Rashba states after femtosecond optical excitation of GeTe. A complex thermalization pathway is observed, wherein three different timescales can be clearly distinguished: intraband thermalization, interband equilibration, and electronic cooling. These dynamics exhibit an unconventional temperature dependence: while the cooling phase speeds up with increasing sample temperature, the opposite happens for interband thermalization. It is demonstrated how, due to the Rashba effect, an interdependence of these timescales on the relative strength of both electron&#8211;electron and electron&#8211;phonon interactions is responsible for the counterintuitive temperature dependence, with spin&#8208;selection constrained interband electron&#8211;electron scatterings found both to dominate dynamics away from the Fermi level, and to weaken with increasing temperature. These findings are supported by theoretical calculations within the Boltzmann approach explicitly showing the opposite behavior of all relevant electron&#8211;electron and electron&#8211;phonon scattering channels with temperature, thus confirming the microscopic mechanism of the experimental findings. The present results are important for future applications of ferroelectric Rashba semiconductors and their excitations in ultrafast spintronics.

         <title>A Renally Clearable Activatable Polymeric Nanoprobe for Early Detection of Hepatic Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable polymeric nanoprobe that possesses superoxide&#8208;anion&#8208;triggered renal clearance and near&#8208;infrared fluorescence response is developed. The nanoprobe efficiently accumulates in the liver, and sensitively reacts with upregulated superoxide anions to undergo in situ depolymerization, and effectively releases a fluorescent artificial urinary biomarker for real&#8208;time imaging and urinalysis of hepatic ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury at the early stage.








Abstract
Although hepatic ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (IRI) represents a major complication in many clinical settings, it remains a diagnostic dilemma due to its reliance on insensitive assays or invasive biopsy. The development of an activatable polymeric nanoprobe (APNSO) for real&#8208;time in vivo near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging and urinalysis of hepatic IRI is reported here. APNSO has a backbone comprising renally clearable fluorophore fragments and self&#8208;immolative structural units. In the presence of an oxidative stress biomarker (superoxide anion, O2&#8226;&#8722;) during hepatic IRI, APNSO can be fluorescently activated for in vivo NIRF imaging and depolymerized to release renally clearable fluorophores for urinalysis. By virtue of its high hepatic accumulation, sensitive response toward O2&#8226;&#8722;, and effective release of renally clearable fluorophores, APNSO&#8208;based imaging and urinalysis detect hepatic IRI at least 7 h earlier than typical clinical assays in a mouse model. This study not only provides new opportunities for noninvasive diagnosis of hepatic IRI, but also reveals guidelines for the development of optical nanosensors for early urinalysis.

This study not only provides new opportunities for noninvasive diagnosis of hepatic IRI, but also reveals guidelines for the development of optical nanosensors for early urinalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Long&#8208;Cycling Sulfide&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries Enabled by Electrochemo&#8208;Mechanically Stable Electrodes</title>

Aiming at fabricating high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASLBs), this work reports a silicon composite anode that demonstrates high capacity and better electrochemo&#8208;mechanical stability than Li&#8208;metal anodes. Meanwhile, interface&#8208;stabilized single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 is utilized as the cathode. The ASLB delivers a cell&#8208;level energy density of 285 mAh g&#8722;1 and long cycling life of 1000 cycles.








Abstract
The anode plays a critical role relating to the energy density in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASLBs). Silicon (Si) and lithium (Li) metal are two of the most attractive anodes because of their ultrahigh theoretical capacities. However, most investigations focus on Li metal, leaving the great potential of Si underrated. This work investigates the stability, processability, and cost of Si anodes in ASLBs and compares them with Li metal. Moreover, single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 is stabilized with lithium silicate (Li2SiOx) through a scalable sol&#8211;gel method. ASLBs with a cell&#8208;level energy density of 285&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 are obtained by sandwiching the Si anode, the thin sulfide solid&#8208;state electrolyte membrane, and the interface stabilized LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2. The full cell delivers a high capacity of 145 mAh g&#8722;1 at C/3 and maintains stability for 1000&#160;cycles. This work inspires commercialization of ASLBs on a large scale with exciting manufacturing lines for large&#8208;scale, safe, and economical energy storage.

         <title>SEEDING to Enable Sensitive Electrochemical Detection of Biomarkers in Undiluted Biological Samples</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanostructured surface with nanoporous substrate provides high sensitivity and a low detection limit with antifouling capabilities. This material enables the fabrication of electrochemical biosensors for the detection of biomarkers in undiluted complex biological samples without suffering passivation. Direct analysis of clinical plasma samples reveal that it is sensitive enough to discriminate between a prostate cancer cohort and healthy donors.








Abstract
Electrochemical biosensors have shown great potential for simple, fast, and cost&#8208;effective point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostic tools. However, direct analysis of complex biological fluids such as plasma has been limited by the loss of sensitivity caused by biofouling. By increasing the surface area, the nanostructured electrode can improve detection sensitivity. However, like a double&#8208;edged sword, a large surface area increases the nonspecific adsorption of contaminating proteins. The use of nanoporous structures may prevent fouling proteins. However, there is no straightforward approach for creating nanostructured and nanoporous surfaces compatible with microfabricated thin&#8208;film electrodes. Herein, the preferential etching of chloride and surfactant&#8208;assisted anisotropic gold reduction to create homogeneous, nanostructured, and nanoporous gold electrodes is demonstrated, yielding a 190&#160;&#177;&#160;20&#160;times larger surface area within a minute without using templates. This process, &#8220;surfactant&#8208;based electrochemical etch&#8208;deposit interplay for nanostructure/nanopore growth&#8221; (SEEDING), on electrodes enhances the sensitivity and antibiofouling capabilities of amperometric biosensors, enabling direct analysis of tumor&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (tEVs) in complex biofluids with a limit of detection of 300&#160;tEVs&#160;&#181;L&#8722;1&#160;from undiluted plasma and good discrimination between patients with prostate cancer from healthy ones with an area under the curve of 0.91&#160;in urine and 0.90&#160;in plasma samples.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;1D van der Waals Antiferromagnetic CrZr4Te14 with Large In&#8208;Plane Anisotropic Negative Magnetoresistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered CrZr4Te14 is constructed of [CrTe2] and [ZrTe3] chains along the b&#8208;axis. The intrachain magnetic coupling of the [CrTe2] chain is ferromagnetic, while the opposite magnetic ordering between the chains makes CrZr4Te14 an antiferromagnet. Moreover, CrZr4Te14 shows large intrinsic negative magnetoresistence of &#8722;56%, and the in&#8208;plane anisotropic factor reaches 8.2 owing to the ferromagnetic [CrTe2] chains.








Abstract
The discovery of 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials is of great significance to explore intriguing 2D magnetic physics and develop innovative spintronic devices. In this work, a new quasi&#8208;1D vdW layered compound CrZr4Te14 is successfully synthesized. Owing to the existence of 1D [CrTe2] and [ZrTe3] chains along the b&#8208;axis, CrZr4Te14 crystals show strong anisotropy of phonon vibrations, electrical transport, and magnetism. Density functional theory calculations reveal the ferromagnetic (FM) coupling within the [CrTe2] chain, while the interchain and interlayer couplings are both weakly antiferromagnetic (AF). Notably, a large intrinsic negative magnetoresistance (nMR) of &#8722;56% is achieved at 2 K under 9 T, and the in&#8208;plane anisotropic factor of nMR can reach up to 8.2 in the CrZr4Te14 device. The 1D FM chains and anisotropic nMR effect make CrZr4Te14 an interesting platform for exploring novel polarization&#8208;sensitive spintronics.

         <title>Tunable Domain Switching Features of Incommensurate Antiferroelectric Ceramics Realizing Excellent Energy Storage Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cd2+ substitution modulates the incommensurate period of the La3+&#8208;modified antiferroelectric matrix in next&#8208;generation dielectric ceramics and thereby adjusts the depolarization response of the induced relaxor ferroelectric phase. The energy storage properties (&#8776;19.3 J cm&#8722;3, &#8776;91%) are both competitive enough as compared to other dielectric ceramics. The actual discharge process releases a giant energy density of &#8776;15.4 J cm&#8722;3.








Abstract
An incommensurate modulated antiferroelectric phase is a key part of ideal candidate materials for the next generation of dielectric ceramics with excellent energy storage properties. However, there is less research carried out when considering its relatively low polarization response. Here, the incommensurate phase is modulated by stabilizing the antiferroelectric phase and the energy storage performance of the incommensurate phase under ultrahigh electric field is studied. The tape&#8208;casting method is applied to construct dense and thin ceramics. La3+ doping induces a room&#8208;temperature incommensurate antiferroelectric orthorhombic matrix. With little Cd2+, the extremely superior energy storage performances arose as follows: when 0.03, the recoverable energy storage density reaches &#8776;19.3 J cm&#8208;3, accompanying an ultrahigh energy storage efficiency of &#8776;91% (870&#160;kV cm&#8208;1); also, a giant discharge energy density of &#8776;15.4 J cm&#8208;3 emerges during actual operation. In situ observations demonstrate that these superior energy storage properties originate from the phase transition from the incommensurate antiferroelectric orthorhombic phase to the induced rhombohedral relaxor ferroelectric one. The adjustable incommensurate period affects the depolarization response. The revealed phase&#8208;transition mechanism enriches the existing antiferroelectric&#8211;ferroelectric transition. Attention to the incommensurate phase can provide a reference for the selection of the next generation of high&#8208;performance antiferroelectric materials.

&lt;p&gt;An incommensurate modulated antiferroelectric phase is a key part of ideal candidate materials for the next generation of dielectric ceramics with excellent energy storage properties. However, there is less research carried out when considering its relatively low polarization response. Here, the incommensurate phase is modulated by stabilizing the antiferroelectric phase and the energy storage performance of the incommensurate phase under ultrahigh electric field is studied. The tape-casting method is applied to construct dense and thin ceramics. La&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; doping induces a room-temperature incommensurate antiferroelectric orthorhombic matrix. With little Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, the extremely superior energy storage performances arose as follows: when 0.03, the recoverable energy storage density reaches &#8776;19.3 J cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;, accompanying an ultrahigh energy storage efficiency of &#8776;91% (870&#160;kV cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;); also, a giant discharge energy density of &#8776;15.4 J cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; emerges during actual operation. In situ observations demonstrate that these superior energy storage properties originate from the phase transition from the incommensurate antiferroelectric orthorhombic phase to the induced rhombohedral relaxor ferroelectric one. The adjustable incommensurate period affects the depolarization response. The revealed phase-transition mechanism enriches the existing antiferroelectric&#8211;ferroelectric transition. Attention to the incommensurate phase can provide a reference for the selection of the next generation of high-performance antiferroelectric materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Gapped Phase in Semimetallic Td&#8208;WTe2 Induced by Lithium Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gapped phase in Weyl semimetal Td&#8208;WTe2 induced by lithium intercalation is reported. The new phase features an increasing resistivity with decreasing temperature from in situ transport measurements and is identified as a charge density wave (CDW) state with a bandgap of 0.14 eV by theoretical calculations. The findings thus provide the first experimental evidence of CDW in Td&#8208;WTe2.








Abstract
The Weyl semimetal WTe2 has shown several correlated electronic behaviors, such as the quantum spin Hall effect, superconductivity, ferroelectricity, and a possible exciton insulator state, all of which can be tuned by various physical and chemical approaches. Here, a new electronic phase in WTe2 induced by lithium intercalation is discovered. The new phase exhibits an increasing resistivity with decreasing temperature and its carrier density is almost two orders of magnitude lower than the carrier density of the semimetallic Td phase, probed by in situ Hall measurements as a function of lithium intercalation. The theoretical calculations predict the new lithiated phase to be a potential charge density wave (CDW) phase with a bandgap of &#8776;0.14&#160;eV, in good agreement with the in situ transport data. The new phase is structurally distinct from the initial Td phase, characterized by polarization&#8208;angle&#8208;dependent Raman spectroscopy, and large lattice distortions close to 6% are predicted in the new phase. This finding of a new gapped phase in a 2D semimetal demonstrates electrochemical intercalation as a powerful tuning knob for modulating electron density and phase stability in 2D materials.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Learning&#8208;Assisted Stratification of Amyloid Beta Mutants Using Drying Droplet Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted stratification of amyloid beta mutants using drying droplet patterns is reported. A process as simple and scalable as allowing a peptide droplet to dry onto a surface can disclose critical structural mismatches of amyloid beta peptides. When analyzed with pretrained neuronal networks, the peptide deposits predict single amino acid mismatches and conformational misfolding with 99% accuracy.








Abstract
The development of simple and accurate methods to predict mutations in proteins remains an unsolved challenge in modern biochemistry. It is discovered that critical information about primary and secondary peptide structures can be inferred from the stains left behind by their drying droplets. To analyze the complex stain patterns, deep&#8208;learning neuronal networks are challenged with polarized light microscopy images derived from the drying droplet deposits of a range of amyloid beta (1&#8211;42) (A&#946;42) peptides. These peptides differ in a single amino acid residue and represent hereditary mutants of Alzheimer's disease. Stain patterns are not only reproducible but also result in comprehensive stratification of eight amyloid beta (A&#946;) variants with predictive accuracies above 99%. Similarly, peptide stains of a range of distinct A&#946;42 peptide conformations are identified with accuracies above 99%. The results suggest that a method as simple as drying a droplet of a peptide solution onto a solid surface may serve as an indicator of minute, yet structurally meaningful differences in peptides&#8217; primary and secondary structures. Scalable and accurate detection schemes for stratification of conformational and structural protein alterations are critically needed to unravel pathological signatures in many human diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.

         <title>Optimal Physicochemical Properties of Antibody&#8211;Nanoparticle Conjugates for Improved Tumor Targeting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor&#8208;targeted nanoparticles represent an innovative strategy for improving the local delivery of small molecules. This meta&#8208;analysis describes the biodistribution and pharmacokinetic profiles of antibody&#8208;/fragment&#8208;targeted nanoparticles. The impact of the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles and the optimal conjugation strategy to optimize the tumor targeting efficiencies is discussed.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;targeted antibody (mAb)/fragment&#8208;conjugated nanoparticles (NPs) represent an innovative strategy for improving the local delivery of small molecules. However, the physicochemical properties of full mAb&#8211;NPs and fragment&#8211;NPs&#8212;that is, NP material, size, charge, as well as the targeting antibody moiety, and the linker conjugation strategies&#8212;remain to be optimized to achieve an efficient tumor targeting. A meta&#8208;analysis of 161 peer&#8208;reviewed studies is presented, which describes the use of tumor&#8208;targeted mAb&#8211;NPs and fragment&#8722;NPs from 2009 to 2021. The use of these targeted NPs is confirmed to result in significantly greater tumor uptake of NPs than that of naked NPs (7.9 &#177; 1.9% ID g&#8722;1 versus 3.2 &#177; 0.6% ID g&#8722;1, respectively). The study further demonstrates that for lipidic NPs, fragment&#8211;NPs provide a significantly higher tumor uptake than full mAb&#8211;NPs. In parallel, for both polymeric and organic/inorganic NPs, full mAb&#8211;NPs yield a significant higher tumor uptake than fragment&#8211;NPs. In addition, for both lipidic and polymeric NPs, the tumor uptake is improved with the smallest sizes of the conjugates. Finally, the pharmacokinetics of the conjugates are demonstrated to be driven by the NPs and not by the antibody moieties, independently of using full mAb&#8211;NPs or fragment&#8211;NPs, confirming the importance of optimizing the NP design to improve the tumor uptake.

         <title>Chemical Potential Switching of the Anomalous Hall Effect in an Ultrathin Noncollinear Antiferromagnetic Metal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noncollinear antiferromagnetic metals are hot spots in the magnetic community. The chemical potential is found to effectively switch on/off the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) of such metals, which opens a new path to tuning the AHE and experimentally validates the essential role of chemical potential in theoretical calculations for determining the anomalous Hall conductivity.








Abstract
The discovery of the anomalous Hall effect in noncollinear antiferromagnetic metals represents one of the most important breakthroughs for the emergent antiferromagnetic spintronics. The tuning of chemical potential has been an important theoretical approach to varying the anomalous Hall conductivity, but the direct experimental demonstration has been challenging owing to the large carrier density of metals. In this work, an ultrathin noncollinear antiferromagnetic Mn3Ge film is fabricated and its carrier density is modulated by ionic liquid gating. Via a small voltage of &#8776;3&#160;V, its carrier density is altered by &#8776;90% and, accordingly, the anomalous Hall effect is completely switched off. This work thus creates an attractive new way to steering the anomalous Hall effect in noncollinear antiferromagnets.

         <title>Origin of the 2D Electron Gas at the SrTiO3 Surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D electron gas at the surface of SrTiO3 (001) can be turned on and off by depositing either SrO or TiO2, which is observed by a combination of oxide molecular beam epitaxy with in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray scattering and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Either way, the surface remains TiO2&#8208;terminated.








Abstract
Bulk SrTiO3 is a well&#8208;known band insulator and the most common substrate used in the field of complex oxide heterostructures. Its surface and interface with other oxides, however, have demonstrated a variety of remarkable behaviors distinct from those expected. In this work, using a suite of in situ techniques to monitor both the atomic and electronic structures of the SrTiO3 (001) surface prior to and during growth, the disappearance and re&#8208;appearance of a 2D electron gas (2DEG) is observed after the completion of each SrO and TiO2 monolayer, respectively. The 2DEG is identified with the TiO2 double layer present at the initial SrTiO3 surface, which gives rise to a surface potential and mobile electrons due to vacancies within the TiO2&#8722;x adlayer. Much like the electronic reconstruction discovered in other systems, two atomic planes are required, here supplied by the double layer. The combined in situ scattering/spectroscopy findings resolve a number of longstanding issues associated with complex oxide interfaces, facilitating the employment of atomic&#8208;scale defect engineering in oxide&#160;electronics.

         <title>A Ceramic&#8208;Electrolyte Glucose Fuel Cell for Implantable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ceramic&#8208;electrolyte glucose fuel cell as a power source for implantable biomedical devices is introduced and demonstrated. The highly miniaturized device with a thickness below 400&#160;nm exhibits a peak power density of 43 &#181;W cm&#8722;2, is fully integrated into silicon, and consists of only ceramic and noble&#8208;metal materials for easy sterilization.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation implantable devices such as sensors, drug&#8208;delivery systems, and electroceuticals require efficient, reliable, and highly miniaturized power sources. Existing power sources such as the Li&#8211;I2 pacemaker battery exhibit limited scale&#8208;down potential without sacrificing capacity, and therefore, alternatives are needed to power miniaturized implants. This work shows that ceramic electrolytes can be used in potentially implantable glucose fuel cells with unprecedented miniaturization. Specifically, a ceramic glucose fuel cell&#8212;based on the proton&#8208;conducting electrolyte ceria&#8212;that is composed of a freestanding membrane of thickness below 400&#160;nm and fully integrated into silicon for easy integration into bioelectronics is demonstrated. In contrast to polymeric membranes, all materials used are highly temperature stable, making thermal sterilization for implantation trivial. A peak power density of 43 &#181;W cm&#8722;2, and an unusually high statistical verification of successful fabrication and electrochemical function across 150 devices for open&#8208;circuit voltage and 12 devices for power density, enabled by a specifically designed testing apparatus and protocol, is demonstrated. The findings demonstrate that ceramic&#8208;based micro&#8208;glucose&#8208;fuel&#8208;cells constitute the smallest potentially implantable power sources to date and are viable options to power the next generation of highly miniaturized implantable medical devices.

         <title>Rigidity&#8208;Tuned Full&#8208;Color Emission: Uncommon Luminescence Change from Polymer Free&#8208;Volume Variations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In sharp contrast to conventional rigidochromic probes, a new type of anti&#8208;rigidochromic probe that redshifts its emission upon polymer matrix rigidification is developed. This rigidity&#8208;tuned full&#8208;color emission enables noninvasively detect polymerization kinetics, in situ optically reporting of polymer degradations, and an unprecedented polymer free&#8208;volume&#8208;based data&#8208;encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting method with a high security level.








Abstract
Probing the rigidity change of microenvironments via tracking embedded molecular fluorophore emissions represents a robust approach to monitor various polymer microstructural evolutions and biomolecular events with a high spatiotemporal resolution. However, reported fluorophores exclusively blueshift their emissions (termed as &#8220;rigidochromism&#8221;) or merely alter intensities upon rigidification, suffering from inferior sensitivities, low&#8208;contrast outputs, and attenuated biocompatibilities. Here, phenanthridine&#8208;fused triazatruxene fluorophores (PTFs) with pronounced bathochromic emission (up to 135&#160;nm) toward rigidifying media at a low loading of 5&#160;ppm without sacrificing the quantum yields and lifetime are developed. PTFs effectively interact with polymeric matrixes through polar&#8211;&#960; interactions and form charge&#8208;transfer complexes, resulting to a remarkable fluorescent color change from blue to red&#8208;orange over matrix rigidifying. Such a unique anti&#8208;rigidochromism enables a highly sensitive rigidity detection (i.e., a subtle polymer molecular&#8208;weight change (as low as 1000&#160;Da vs up to 10&#160;kDa for conventional probes) can result to obvious emission color changes). PTFs are able to noninvasively detect polymerization kinetics and in situ optically report polymer degradations. The broadly (nearly full&#8208;spectrum) tunable emission and the efficient coupling between anti&#8208;rigidochromism and polymer hierarchical structures/topologies render fluorescence with controlled wavelength and chirality, leading to an unprecedented free&#8208;volume&#8208;based data encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology with a superhigh security level.

         <title>Photoenergy Harvesting by Photoacid Solution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new way of harvesting solar energy is demonstrated by using a photoacid solution that generates a Nernst potential and capacitive current upon asymmetric light exposure. Such transparent liquid&#8208;state devices enable form&#8208;factor&#8208;free design and vertical stacking that maximizes spatial and light&#8208;use efficiencies.








Abstract
Solar energy has seen 180&#160;years of development since the discovery of the photovoltaic effect, having achieved the most successful commercialization in the energy&#8208;harvesting fields. Despite its long history, even the most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photovoltaics remain confined to solid&#8208;state devices, limiting spatial and light utilization efficiencies. Herein, a liquid&#8208;state photoenergy harvester based on a photoacid (PA), a chemical that releases protons upon light irradiation and recombines with them in the dark through a fully reversible reaction, is demonstrated. Asymmetric light exposure on a PA solution contained in a transparent tube generates a pH gradient (&#916;pH&#160;=&#160;2) along the exposed and dark regions, which charges the Nernst potential up to 0.7&#160;V across the two electrodes embedded at each end, as if a capacitor. Owing to the reversibility of PAs, a PA&#8208;driven liquid&#8208;state photoenergy harvester (PLPH) generates capacitive currents up to 0.72&#160;mA&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;on an irradiation. Notably, the transparent nature of the PLPH enables vertical stacking up to 25&#160;units, which multiplies the light&#8208;harvesting efficiencies by over 1000%. This unique approach provides a new route to harness solar energy with a form&#8208;factor&#8208;free design that maximizes spatial and light&#8208;use efficiencies.

         <title>A Polyvalent Peptide CD40 Nanoagonist for Targeted Modulation of Dendritic Cells and Amplified Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superstructural nanoagonist (PVA&#8208;CD40) with preorganized interfacial topological structure is constructed through click reaction directed in vivo self&#8208;assembly. PVA&#8208;CD40 is able to drain and retain in lymph node to induce sustained dendritic cells maturation through CD40 signaling and further leads to durable CD8+ T cell output for tumor regression and rejunction of tumor metastasis.








Abstract
Targeted immunomodulation through biomolecule&#8208;based nanostructures, especially to dendritic cells (DCs), holds great promise for effective cancer therapy. However, construction of high&#8208;performance agonist by mimicking natural ligand to activate immune cell signaling is a great challenge so far. Here, a peptide&#8208;based nanoagonist toward CD40 (PVA&#8208;CD40) with preorganized interfacial topological structure that activates lymph node DCs efficiently and persistently, achieving amplified immune therapeutic efficacy is described. The on&#8208;site fabrication of PVA&#8208;CD40 is realized through the click conjugation of two functional peptides including the &#8220;CD40 anchoring arm&#8221; and the &#8220;assembly&#8208;driving motor.&#8221; The resultant polyvalent interface rapidly triggers the receptor oligomerization and downstream signaling. Strikingly, one shot administration of PVA&#8208;CD40 elicits maturation period of DCs up to 2.3&#8208;fold comparing to that of CD40 antibody.

&lt;p&gt;Superstructural nanoagonist (PVA-CD40) with preorganized interfacial topological structure is constructed through click reaction directed in vivo self-assembly. PVA-CD40 is able to drain and retain in lymph node to induce sustained dendritic cells maturation through CD40 signaling and further leads to durable CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell output for tumor regression and rejunction of tumor metastasis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted immunomodulation through biomolecule-based nanostructures, especially to dendritic cells (DCs), holds great promise for effective cancer therapy. However, construction of high-performance agonist by mimicking natural ligand to activate immune cell signaling is a great challenge so far. Here, a peptide-based nanoagonist toward CD40 (PVA-CD40) with preorganized interfacial topological structure that activates lymph node DCs efficiently and persistently, achieving amplified immune therapeutic efficacy is described. The on-site fabrication of PVA-CD40 is realized through the click conjugation of two functional peptides including the &#8220;CD40 anchoring arm&#8221; and the &#8220;assembly-driving motor.&#8221; The resultant polyvalent interface rapidly triggers the receptor oligomerization and downstream signaling. Strikingly, one shot administration of PVA-CD40 elicits maturation period of DCs up to 2.3-fold comparing to that of CD40 antibody. Finally, combining the PVA-CD40 with anti-PD-1 antibody results in subsequent inhibition of tumor growth in both B16F10 and 4T1 mice tumor models with survival rate up to 37%, while none of the mice survives in the clinically relevant CD40 mAb and anti-PD-1 combination-treated group. It is envisioned that the fabrication of antibody-like superstructures in vivo provides an efficient platform for modulating the duration of immune response to achieve optimal therapeutic efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hidden Local Symmetry Breaking in Silver Diamondoid Compounds is Root Cause of Ultralow Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Weak sd3 orbital hybridization of tetrahedral Ag atoms leads to the local symmetry breaking in Ag&#8208;based diamondoid compounds. This emphanitic local geometric distortion of Ag causes a global distortion of the crystal structure and results in the ultralow thermal conductivity. Based on this, the heat conductivity of the diamondoid structure can be directly evaluated by the crystallographic distortion parameter.








Abstract
Typically, conventional structure transitions occur from a low symmetry state to a higher symmetry state upon warming. In this work, an unexpected local symmetry breaking in the tetragonal diamondoid compound AgGaTe2 is reported, which, upon warming, evolves continuously from an undistorted ground state to a locally distorted state while retaining average crystallographic symmetry. This is a rare phenomenon previously referred to as emphanisis. This distorted state, caused by the weak sd3 orbital hybridization of tetrahedral Ag atoms, causes their displacement off the tetrahedron center and promotes a global distortion of the crystal structure resulting in strong acoustic&#8211;optical phonon scattering and an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity of 0.26 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 850 K in AgGaTe2. The findings explain the underlying reason for the unexpectedly low thermal conductivities of silver&#8208;based compounds compared to copper&#8208;based analogs and provide a guideline to suppressing heat transport in diamondoid and other materials.

         <title>Cyano&#8208;Functionalized n&#8208;Type Polymer with High Electron Mobility for High&#8208;Performance Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>

Cyano functionalization of thienylene&#8211;vinylene&#8211;thienylene donor unit in n&#8208;type polymer f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTCN leads to simultaneously enhanced ion&#8208;uptake ability, film structural order, and charge&#8208;transport property compared to its non&#8208;cyanated analogue, subsequently enabling a record&#8208;high &#956;e,OECT of 0.24 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and &#181;C* of 41.3 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in n&#8208;type OECTs.








Abstract
n&#8208;Type organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors (OMIECs) with high electron mobility are scarce and highly challenging to develop. As a result, the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (&#181;C*) of n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) lags far behind the p&#8208;type analogs, restraining the development of OECT&#8208;based low&#8208;power complementary circuits and biosensors. Here, two n&#8208;type donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) polymers based on fused bithiophene imide dimer f&#8208;BTI2 as the acceptor unit and thienylene&#8211;vinylene&#8211;thienylene (TVT) as the donor co&#8208;unit are reported. The cyanation of TVT enables polymer f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTCN with simultaneously enhanced ion&#8208;uptake ability, film structural order, and charge&#8208;transport property. As a result, it is able to obtain a high volumetric capacitance (C*) of 170&#160;&#177;&#160;22&#160;F cm&#8722;3 and a record OECT electron mobility (&#956;e,OECT) of 0.24 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTCN, subsequently achieving a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art &#181;C* of 41.3 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and geometry&#8208;normalized transconductance (gm,norm) of 12.8 S cm&#8722;1 in n&#8208;type accumulation&#8208;mode OECTs. In contrast, only a moderate &#181;C* of 1.50 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 is measured for the non&#8208;cyanated polymer f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVT. These remarkable results demonstrate the great power of cyano functionalization of polymer semiconductors in developing n&#8208;type OMIECs with substantial electron mobility in aqueous environment for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type OECTs.

         <title>MOF&#8211;COF &#8220;Alloy&#8221; Membranes for Efficient Propylene/Propane Separation</title>

         <dc:description>
A metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8211;covalent organic framework (COF) &#8220;alloy&#8221; membrane (AM) is fabricated, which exhibits a record&#8208;high propylene/propane separation performance with a selectivity of more than 200 and a propylene permeance of 168 GPU, owing to the fine&#8208;tuned lattice rigidity of the MOF lattice, enabled by a facile, generic alloying strategy.








Abstract
Molecular&#8208;sieving membranes from metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for separating olefin/paraffin mixtures, a critical demand in sustainable chemical processes and a grand challenge in molecular separation. Currently, the inherent lattice flexibility of MOFs severely compromises their precise sieving ability. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of &#8220;alloy&#8221; membranes (AMs), which are fabricated by incorporating quaternary ammonium (QA)&#8208;functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) into a zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) matrix is demonstrated. The Coulomb force between the COFs and the ZIF&#8208;8 restricts the linker rotation of the ZIF&#8208;8, generating a distinct alloying effect, by which the lattice rigidity of ZIF&#8208;8 can be conveniently tuned through varying the content of the COFs, similar to the flexible&#8208;to&#8208;rigid transition in aluminum alloy manufacturing. Such an alloying effect confers the AM's superior propylene/propane separation performance, with a propylene/propane separation factor surpassing 200 and a propylene permeance of 168 GPU. Hopefully, the AMs concept and the concomitant alloying effect can update the connotation of mixed matrix membranes and stimulate the re&#8208;envisioning about the design paradigm and development of advanced membranes for energy&#8208;efficient separations.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Plasmonic Trienzyme&#8208;Integrated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with High&#8208;Efficiency Enzyme Cascades for Synergistic Trimodal Oncotherapy</title>

A novel plasmonic trienzyme&#8208;integrated metal&#8211;organic framework (plasEnMOF) nanoplatform that integrates starvation, chemodynamic, and near&#8208;infrared II plasmonic photothermal trimodal therapy for anticancer treatment is reported. The photothermal&#8208;effect&#8208;enhanced catalytic activity and excellent protective capacity of the natural enzyme activities are demonstrated in the present plasEnMOFs against extreme environments such as external chemical agents and high temperature.








Abstract
Natural enzyme&#8208;based catalytic cascades hold great promise for cancer therapy, but their clinical utility is greatly hindered by the loss of their functions during in vivo delivery. Herein, a plasmonic trienzyme&#8208;integrated metal&#8211;organic framework (plasEnMOF) nanoplatform with high&#8208;efficiency enzyme cascades is reported for synergistic starvation, chemodynamic, and plasmonic hyperthermia trimodal therapy of hypoxic tumors. These plasEnMOFs are created with encapsulation of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) plasmonic Au nanorods and natural enzymes&#8212;catalase (CAT), glucose oxidase (GOx), and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) within zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) MOFs. As a trienzyme cascade system, the plasEnMOFs effectively deplete intratumoral glucose and generate toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) for starvation therapy and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) combined with the plasmonic hyperthermia therapy (PHT). The enhanced glucose consumption and ROS generation by the NIR&#8208;II plasmonic photothermal effect are also demonstrated. The improved chemo&#8208; and thermotolerance of the encapsulated natural enzymes within the protective ZIF&#8208;8 MOFs are evidenced. With the integrated enzyme cascades and NIR&#8208;II photothermal effects, these plasEnMOFs are demonstrated with exceptional therapeutic effects on 4T1 xenograft tumors through the combined starvation/CDT/PHT therapy. This work highlights the superiority of natural enzyme cascade systems integrated in plasmonic MOFs for high&#8208;efficiency enzymatic cancer therapy.

         <title>Record&#8208;Efficiency Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by Multifunctional Organic Ions Interface Passivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>

Herein, a novel histamine diiodate (HADI) is synthesized and incorporated into the SnO2/perovskite interface to modulate its electronic properties. Experimental results and theoretical calculations demonstrate a bridge function of HADI. The HADI&#8208;SnO2&#8208;based rigid/flexible perovskite solar cells (PSCs) achieve efficiencies of 24.79% and 22.44%, respectively, the highest reported values for rigid MA&#8208;free PSCs and flexible PSCs so far.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) have attracted great attention because of their unique advantages in lightweight and portable electronics applications. However, their efficiencies are far inferior to those of their rigid counterparts. Herein, a novel histamine diiodate (HADI) is designed based on theoretical study to modify the SnO2/perovskite interface. Systematic experimental results reveal that the HADI serves effectively as a multifunctional agent mainly in three aspects: 1) surface modification to realign the SnO2 conduction band upward to improve interfacial charge extraction; 2) passivating the buried perovskite surface, and 3) bridging between the SnO2 and perovskite layers for effective charge transfer. Consequently, the rigid MA&#8208;free PSCs based on the HADI&#8208;SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) display not only a high champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.79% and open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.20&#160;V but also outstanding stability as demonstrated by the PSCs preserving 91% of their initial efficiencies after being exposed to ambient atmosphere for 1200 h without any encapsulation. Furthermore, the solution&#8208;processed HADI&#8208;SnO2 ETL formed at low temperature (100&#160;&#176;C) is utilized in f&#8208;PSCs that achieve a PCE as high as 22.44%, the highest reported PCE for f&#8208;PSCs to date.

Rayleigh&#8208;instability&#8208;induced spindle&#8208;knot fibers are knitted for the fabrication of permeable and moisture&#8208;proof textile triboelectric sensors. With the assistance of deep learning, the on&#8208;mask sensor network can realize the respiration pattern recognition with a classification accuracy up to 100%. A customized cellphone application is developed to enable real&#8208;time, user&#8208;friendly, and personalized respiration management.








Abstract
Wearable respiratory monitoring is a fast, non&#8208;invasive, and convenient approach to provide early recognition of human health abnormalities like restrictive and obstructive lung diseases. Here, a computational fluid dynamics assisted on&#8208;mask sensor network is reported, which can overcome different user facial contours and environmental interferences to collect highly accurate respiratory signals. Inspired by cribellate silk, Rayleigh&#8208;instability&#8208;induced spindle&#8208;knot fibers are knitted for the fabrication of permeable and moisture&#8208;proof textile triboelectric sensors that hold a decent signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of 51.2&#160;dB, a response time of 0.28 s, and a sensitivity of 0.46&#160;V kPa&#8722;1. With the assistance of deep learning, the on&#8208;mask sensor network can realize the respiration pattern recognition with a classification accuracy up to 100%, showing great improvement over a single respiratory sensor. Additionally, a customized user&#8208;friendly cellphone application is developed to connect the processed respiratory signals for real&#8208;time data&#8208;driven diagnosis and one&#8208;click health data sharing with the clinicians. The deep&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted on&#8208;mask sensor network opens a new avenue for personalized respiration management in the era of the Internet of Things.

Nanocilia
In article number 2200185, Hoon Eui Jeong and co&#8208;workers develop a programmable self&#8208;assembly strategy that can direct magnetic nanoparticles into a highly ordered, field&#8208;responsive, artificial nanocilia array. The self&#8208;assembled nanocilia can maintain their structural integrity through the interplay of interparticle interactions. Interestingly, the nanocilia can exhibit a responsive actuation motion through &#8220;rolling and sliding&#8221; between assembled nanoparticles.

Asymmetric light exposure on the PLPH generates electric energy by the light&#8208;induced pH gradient (&#916;pH = 2) along the two electrodes This unique approach offers a new way to harness solar energy in a form&#8208;factor&#8208;free design that maximizes space and light&#8208;use efficiency.

Artificial Neurons
An artificial tactile neuron based on an ovonic threshold switch and a piezoresistive sensor reported by Suyoun Lee, Hyunjung Yi, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2201608 can encode the elastic stiffness of pressed materials into spike&#8208;frequency evolution patterns. The spiking representation of stiffness in combination with spiking&#8208;neural&#8208;network&#8208;based learning can be used to classify the malignant status of breast tumors with low energy consumption, low latency, and yet high accuracy.

Drying Droplets
Critical information about primary and secondary peptide structures can be inferred from the stains left behind by their drying droplets. In article number 2110404, J&#246;rg Lahann and Azam Jeihanipour establish a simple and scalable platform to analyze the deposition patterns obtained from drying droplets (here: amyloid beta peptides), which are information&#8208;rich, complex, and characteristic; just as fingerprint patterns are unique identifiers for humans. The cover image shows an artistic rendering of a polarized light microscopy image, depicting the drying pattern of an amyloid beta peptide.

Electrochemical Pollination
In article number 2200981, Yoon&#8208;Kyoung Cho and co&#8208;workers discuss electrochemical roughening, a method based on the etching and redeposition of material from a flat surface, to create homogeneous, nanostructured, and nanoporous gold electrodes. The process is not efficient, as most of the etched material typically diffuses away. However, the addition of surfactant generates micelles that can electrostatically capture the freshly etched material and, in a process that evokes pollination from bumblebees, increase redeposition efficiency.

         <title>Recent Progress on Self&#8208;Healable Conducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;healing electronic materials based on conducting polymers are reviewed. Tunable electrical conductivity and mechanical properties, high stability in air and aqueous media, low cost, lightweight, flexibility, and, in some cases, biocompatibility make these materials attractive for numerous applications, such as energy harvesting devices, wearable and stretchable electronics, electronic skin, and implantable devices.








Abstract
Materials able to regenerate after damage have been the object of investigation since the ancient times. For instance, self&#8208;healing concretes, able to resist earthquakes, aging, weather, and seawater have been known since the times of ancient Rome and are still the object of research. During the last decade, there has been an increasing interest in self&#8208;healing electronic materials, for applications in electronic skin (E&#8208;skin) for health monitoring, wearable and stretchable sensors, actuators, transistors, energy harvesting, and storage devices. Self&#8208;healing materials based on conducting polymers are particularly attractive due to their tunable high conductivity, good stability, intrinsic flexibility, excellent processability and biocompatibility. Here recent developments are reviewed in the field of self&#8208;healing electronic materials based on conducting polymers, such as poly 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT), polypyrrole (PPy), and polyaniline (PANI). The different types of healing, the strategies adopted to optimize electrical and mechanical properties, and the various possible healing mechanisms are introduced. Finally, the main challenges and perspectives in the field are discussed.

         <title>Recent Progress and Future Advances on Aqueous Monovalent&#8208;Ion Batteries towards Safe and High&#8208;Power Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aqueous monovalent&#8208;ion batteries have gained tremendous attention from the scientific community due to their fast charging capability, resulting from the outstanding ionic conductivity of aqueous electrolytes (twice as high as for organic electrolytes), and the smaller hydrated ionic radius and lower hydration free energy of monovalent ions compared with those of multivalent ions.








Abstract
Aqueous monovalent&#8208;ion batteries have been rapidly developed recently as promising energy storage devices in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems owing to their fast charging capability and high power densities. In recent years, Prussian blue analogues, polyanion&#8208;type compounds, and layered oxides have been widely developed as cathodes for aqueous monovalent&#8208;ion batteries because of their low cost and high theoretical capacity. Furthermore, many design strategies have been proposed to expand their electrochemical stability window by reducing the amount of free water molecules and introducing an electrolyte addictive. This review highlights the advantages and drawbacks of cathode and anode materials, and summarizes the correlations between the various strategies and the electrochemical performance in terms of structural engineering, morphology control, elemental compositions, and interfacial design. Finally, this review can offer rational principles and potential future directions in the design of aqueous monovalent&#8208;ion batteries.

Smart Contact lens (SCL) platforms have emerged as a promising interface between the eye and electronic devices for personalized healthcare applications. This review summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in material synthesis, device manufacturing, and system integrations of SCLs and provides recent progress and future opportunities of SCL as an effective diagnostic and therapeutic tool.








Abstract
The eye is one of the most complex organs in the human body, containing rich and critical physiological information (e.g., intraocular pressure, corneal temperature, and pH) as well as a library of metabolite biomarkers (e.g., glucose, proteins, and specific ions). Smart contact lenses (SCLs) can serve as a wearable intelligent ocular prosthetic device capable of noninvasive and continuous monitoring of various essential physical/biochemical parameters and drug loading/delivery for the treatment of ocular diseases. Advances in SCL technologies and the growing public interest in personalized health are accelerating SCL research more than ever before. Here, the current status and potential of SCL development through a comprehensive review from fabrication to applications to commercialization are discussed. First, the material, fabrication, and platform designs of the SCLs for the diagnostic and therapeutic applications are discussed. Then, the latest advances in diagnostic and therapeutic SCLs for clinical translation are reviewed. Later, the established techniques for wearable power transfer and wireless data transmission applied to current SCL devices are summarized. An outlook, future opportunities, and challenges for developing next&#8208;generation SCL&#160;devices are also provided. With the rise in interest of SCL development, this comprehensive and essential review can serve as a new paradigm for the SCL&#160;devices.

         <title>Antibody&#8208;Incorporated Nanomedicines for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review on the advancements of antibody&#8208;incorporated nanomedicines for cancer therapy is offered. Diverse functionalization strategies, antibody formats, and cancer&#8208;associated antigens are introduced and discussed, with an emphasis on their latest applications in antibody&#8208;incorporated nanotherapeutics. The current limitations and future research directions on antibody&#8208;containing nanomedicines are also proposed.








Abstract
Antibody&#8208;based cancer therapy, one of the most significant therapeutic strategies, has achieved considerable success and progress over the past decades. Nevertheless, obstacles including limited tumor penetration, short circulation half&#8208;lives, undesired immunogenicity, and off&#8208;target side effects remain to be overcome for the antibody&#8208;based cancer treatment. Owing to the rapid development of nanotechnology, antibody&#8208;containing nanomedicines that have been extensively explored to overcome these obstacles have already demonstrated enhanced anticancer efficacy and clinical translation potential. This review intends to offer an overview of the advancements of antibody&#8208;incorporated nanoparticulate systems in cancer treatment, together with the nontrivial challenges faced by these next&#8208;generation nanomedicines. Diverse strategies of antibody immobilization, formats of antibodies, types of cancer&#8208;associated antigens, and anticancer mechanisms of antibody&#8208;containing nanomedicines are provided and discussed in this review, with an emphasis on the latest applications. The current limitations and future research directions on antibody&#8208;containing nanomedicines are also discussed from different perspectives to provide new insights into the construction of anticancer nanomedicines.

         <title>Monolithic Perovskite&#8208;Silicon Tandem Solar Cells: From the Lab to Fab?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reviews the recent developments in the field of perovskite&#8208;silicon tandems, explores the feasibility to elevate efficiency to &gt;32%, analyzes the upscaling technology being compatible with the current silicon technology, and discusses the pathways to prolong its stability.








Abstract
This review focuses on monolithic 2&#8208;terminal perovskite&#8208;silicon tandem solar cells and discusses key scientific and technological challenges to address in view of an industrial implementation of this technology. The authors start by examining the different crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) technologies suitable for pairing with perovskites, followed by reviewing recent developments in the field of monolithic 2&#8208;terminal perovskite&#8208;silicon tandems. Factors limiting the power conversion efficiency of these tandem devices are then evaluated, before discussing pathways to achieve an efficiency of &gt;32%, a value that small&#8208;scale devices will likely need to achieve to make tandems competitive. Aspects related to the upscaling of these device active areas to industry&#8208;relevant ones are reviewed, followed by a short discussion on module integration aspects. The review then focuses on stability issues, likely the most challenging task that will eventually determine the economic viability of this technology. The final part of this review discusses alternative monolithic perovskite&#8208;silicon tandem designs. Finally, key areas of research that should be addressed to bring this technology from the lab to the fab are highlighted.

         <title>A Bionic Interface to Suppress the Coffee&#8208;Ring Effect for Reliable and Flexible Perovskite Modules with a Near&#8208;90% Yield Rate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of a superhydrophilic bionic interface layer (Bio&#8208;IL) significantly suppresses the coffee&#8208;ring effect during printing of large&#8208;area perovskite films via regulating the nucleation rate (&#965;N) and radial transport rate (&#965;RT) of the perovskite precursor, which induces a homogeneous large&#8208;area flexible perovskite film and high&#8208;performance inverted flexible perovskite solar cells with an efficiency of 21.08%.








Abstract
The inhomogeneity, poor interfacial contact, and pinholes caused by the coffee&#8208;ring effect severely affect the printing reliability of flexible perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, inspired by the bio&#8208;glue of barnacles, a bionic interface layer (Bio&#8208;IL) of NiOx/levodopa is introduced to suppress the coffee&#8208;ring effect during printing perovskite modules. The coordination effect of the sticky functional groups in Bio&#8208;IL can pin the three&#8208;phase contact line and restrain the transport of perovskite colloidal particles during the printing and evaporation process. Moreover, the sedimentation rate of perovskite precursor is accelerated due to the electrostatic attraction and rapid volatilization from an extraordinary wettability. The superhydrophilic Bio&#8208;IL affords an even spread over a large&#8208;area substrate, which boosts a complete and uniform liquid film for heterogeneous nucleation as well as crystallization. Perovskite films on different large&#8208;area substrates with negligible coffee&#8208;ring effect are printed. Consequently, inverted flexible PSCs and perovskite solar modules achieve a high efficiency of 21.08% and 16.87%, respectively. This strategy ensures a highly reliable reproducibility of printing PSCs with a near 90% yield rate.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Active Sensing Based on Triboelectric Generators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;powered triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)&#8208;based active sensors are vital for digital transformation and can be designed into wearable and flexible form factors. The evolution of TENG&#8208;based active sensors is outlined with primary focus on chemical and biosensors. Comprehensive discussion on the device mechanism, applications, sensing parameters is provided and the challenges in the field detailed.








Abstract
The demand for portable and wearable chemical or biosensors and their expeditious development in recent years has created a scientific challenge in terms of their continuous powering. As a result, mechanical energy harvesters such as piezoelectric and triboelectric generators (TEGs) have been explored recently either as sensors or harvesters to store charge in small, but long&#8208;life, energy&#8208;storage devices to power the sensors. The use of energy harvesters as sensors is particularly interesting, as with such multifunctional operations it is possible to reduce the number devices needed in a system, which also helps overcome the integration complexities. In this regard, TEGs are promising, particularly for energy autonomous chemical and biological sensors, as they can be developed with a wide variety of materials, and their mechanical energy to electricity conversion can be modulated by various analytes. This review focuses on this interesting dimension of TEGs and presents various self&#8208;powered active chemical and biological sensors. A brief discussion about the development of TEG&#8208;based physical, magnetic, and optical sensors is also included. The influence of environmental factors, various figures of merit, and the significance of TEG design are explained in context with the active sensing. Finally, the key applications, challenges, and future perspective of chemical and biological detection via TEGs are discussed with a view to drive further advances in the field of self&#8208;powered sensors.

         <title>An Anode&#8208;Free Potassium&#8208;Metal Battery Enabled by a Directly Grown Graphene&#8208;Modulated Aluminum Current Collector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from a plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition setup integrated with a roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll configuration, a commercial Al foil is elaborately decorated with a graphene layer with strong adhesion and high surface energy, which enables a smooth and highly reversible K plating/stripping process. An anode&#8208;free K&#8208;metal full&#8208;cell using the as&#8208;synthesized substrate as the anode current collector displays improved performance.








Abstract
Potassium (K)&#8208;metal batteries have emerged as a promising energy&#8208;storage device owing to abundant K resources. An anode&#8208;free architecture that bypasses the need for anode host materials can deliver an elevated energy density. However, the poor efficiency of K plating/stripping on potassiophobic anode current collectors results in rapid K inventory loss and a short cycle life. Herein, commercial Al foils are decorated with an ultrathin graphene&#8208;modified layer (Al@G) through roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition. By harnessing strong adhesion (10.52 N m&#8722;1) and a high surface energy (66.6 mJ m&#8722;2), the designed Al@G structure ensures a highly smooth and ordered K plating/stripping process. Consequently, during K&#8208;metal plating/stripping, Al@G can operate at a current density of up to 4.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and cyclic capacity of up to 4.0 mAh cm&#8722;2, with an ultralong lifespan of up to 1000 h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and stable cycling of up to 750 h under periodic current fluctuations of 0.1&#8211;2.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In addition, a novel anode&#8208;free K&#8208;metal full&#8208;cell prototype enabled by Al@G anode current collectors is constructed, demonstrating ameliorative cyclic stability.

         <title>Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Based Hollow Mesoporous Nanoparticles: Synthesis Strategies and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in the synthesis and catalysis&#8208;related applications of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based hollow mesoporous nanoparticles (HMNs) is summarized in detail. This Review will help the readers to understand the challenges and more importantly provide insights into designing novel multifunctional HMN&#8208;based nanomaterials.








Abstract
As second&#8208;generation mesoporous materials, mesoporous noble metals (NMs) are of significant interest for their wide applications in catalysis, sensing, bioimaging, and biotherapy owing to their structural and metallic features. The introduction of interior hollow cavity into NM&#8208;based mesoporous nanoparticles (MNs), which subtly integrate hierarchical hollow and mesoporous structure into one nanoparticle, produces a new type of hollow MNs (HMNs). Benefiting from their higher active surface, better electron/mass transfer, optimum electronic structure, and nanoconfinement space, NM&#8208;based HMNs exhibit their high efficiency in enhancing catalytic activity and stability and tuning catalytic selectivity. In this review, recent progress in the design, synthesis, and catalytic applications of NM&#8208;based HMNs is summarized, including the findings of the groups. Five main strategies for synthesizing NM&#8208;based HMNs, namely silica&#8208;assisted surfactant&#8208;templated nucleation, surfactant&#8208;templated sequential nucleation, soft &#8220;dual&#8221;&#8208;template, Kirkendall effect in synergistic template, and galvanic&#8208;replacement&#8208;assisted surfactant template, are described in detail. In addition, the applications in ethanol oxidation electrocatalysis and hydrogenation reactions are discussed to highlight the high activity, enhanced stability, and optimal selectivity of NM&#8208;based HMNs in (electro)catalysis. Finally, the further outlook that may lead the directions of synthesis and applications of NM&#8208;based HMNs is prospected.

         <title>Isolated&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy Hardening in Lead&#8208;Free Piezoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is developed for the hardening of piezoelectrics via the mediation of dopant&#8208;exclusive oxygen vacancies to overcome the long&#8208;term issue: the dilemma between the mechanical quality factor and piezoelectricity coefficient. The approach also makes the high&#8208;power performance superior to many state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art counterparts, offering a possible route to various piezoelectrics for high&#8208;end applications.








Abstract
Defect engineering is a well&#8208;established approach to customize the functionalities of perovskite oxides. In demanding high&#8208;power applications of piezoelectric materials, acceptor doping serves as the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hardening approach, but inevitably deteriorates the electromechanical properties. Here, a new hardening effect associated with isolated oxygen vacancies for achieving well&#8208;balanced performances is proposed. Guided by theoretical design, a well&#8208;balanced performance of mechanical quality factor (Qm) and piezoelectric coefficient (d33) is achieved in lead&#8208;free potassium sodium niobate ceramics, where Qm increases by over 60% while d33 remains almost unchanged. By atomic&#8208;scale Z&#8208;contrast imaging, hysteresis measurement, and quantitative piezoresponse force microscopy analysis, it is revealed that the improved Qm results from the inhibition of both extrinsic and intrinsic losses while the unchanged d33 is associated with the polarization contributions being retained. More encouragingly, the hardening effect shows exceptional stability with increasing vibration velocity, offering potential in material design for practical high&#8208;power applications such as pharmaceutical extraction and ultrasonic osteotomes.

         <title>Asymmetric Substitution of End&#8208;Groups Triggers 16.34% Efficiency for All&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric substitution of terminal groups is first applied in small&#8208;molecule donors. A record efficiency of 16.34% is achieved for binary all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells. A unique phenomenon of merits integration is reported rather than the balance between Voc and Jsc, which is generally observed in asymmetric substitution of nonfullerene acceptors.








Abstract
Asymmetric substitution of end&#8208;groups is first applied in molecular donors. Three commonly used end&#8208;groups of 2&#8208;ethylhexyl cyanoacetate (CA), 2&#8208;ethylhexyl rhodanine (Reh), and 1H&#8208;indene&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;dione (ID) are combined to construct a series of symmetric and asymmetric donors. Correspondingly, the asymmetric donors SM&#8208;CA&#8208;Reh and SM&#8208;CA&#8208;ID show largely increased dipole moments (2.14 and 3.39 D, respectively) and enhanced aggregation propensity, as compared to those of symmetric donors of SM&#8208;CA, SM&#8208;Reh, and SM&#8208;ID. Using N3 as acceptor, interestingly, SM&#8208;CA&#8208;Reh integrates the photovoltaic characteristics of high fill factor (FF) for SM&#8208;CA and high short&#8208;circuit current density for SM&#8208;Reh, and delivers a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.34% with a high FF of 77.5%, which is much higher than 15.41% for SM&#8208;CA and 14.76% for SM&#8208;Reh. However, SM&#8208;CA&#8208;ID and SM&#8208;ID give the lower PCE of 8.20% and 2.76%. Characterization results suggest that the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction mainly dictates the packing morphology of blend films instead of dipole effect or crystallinity. Mono&#8208;substitution of Reh facilitates the molecular demixing appropriately but keeps the characteristic of the fine bicontinuous network of SM&#8208;CA:N3. SM&#8208;CA&#8208;Reh:N3 shows more efficient exciton extraction, higher hole transport, and better miscibility. These results well explain the merits integration and improved photovoltaic performance.

     alt="Asymmetric Substitution of End-Groups Triggers 16.34% Efficiency for All-Small-Molecule Organic Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asymmetric substitution of terminal groups is first applied in small-molecule donors. A record efficiency of 16.34% is achieved for binary all-small-molecule organic solar cells. A unique phenomenon of merits integration is reported rather than the balance between &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt;, which is generally observed in asymmetric substitution of nonfullerene acceptors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asymmetric substitution of end-groups is first applied in molecular donors. Three commonly used end-groups of 2-ethylhexyl cyanoacetate (CA), 2-ethylhexyl rhodanine (Reh), and 1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione (ID) are combined to construct a series of symmetric and asymmetric donors. Correspondingly, the asymmetric donors SM-CA-Reh and SM-CA-ID show largely increased dipole moments (2.14 and 3.39 D, respectively) and enhanced aggregation propensity, as compared to those of symmetric donors of SM-CA, SM-Reh, and SM-ID. Using N3 as acceptor, interestingly, SM-CA-Reh integrates the photovoltaic characteristics of high fill factor (FF) for SM-CA and high short-circuit current density for SM-Reh, and delivers a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.34% with a high FF of 77.5%, which is much higher than 15.41% for SM-CA and 14.76% for SM-Reh. However, SM-CA-ID and SM-ID give the lower PCE of 8.20% and 2.76%. Characterization results suggest that the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction mainly dictates the packing morphology of blend films instead of dipole effect or crystallinity.

         <title>2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenide with Increased Entropy for Piezoelectric Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D transition metal dichalcogenide alloy, Mo1&#8722;xWxS2, is synthesized to investigate the influence of configurational entropy on the piezoelectrical property. Mo0.46W0.54S2, in which two cations have similar concentrations and the maximum configurational entropy is attained, exhibits the best piezoelectric properties. Combined with excellent mechanical durability, a mechanical sensor based on the Mo0.46W0.54S2 alloy is demonstrated for real&#8208;time health monitoring.








Abstract
Piezoelectricity in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has attracted considerable interest because of their excellent flexibility and high piezoelectric coefficient compared to conventional piezoelectric bulk materials. However, the ability to regulate the piezoelectric properties is limited because the entropy is constant for certain binary TMDs other than multielement ones. Herein, in order to increase the entropy, a ternary TMDs alloy, Mo1&#8722;xWxS2, with different W concentrations, is synthesized. The W concentration in the Mo1&#8722;xWxS2 alloy can be controlled precisely in the low&#8208;supersaturation synthesis and the entropy can be tuned accordingly. The Mo0.46W0.54S2 alloy (x&#160;= 0.54) has the highest configurational entropy and best piezoelectric properties, such as a piezoelectric coefficient of 4.22 pm V&#8722;1 and a piezoelectric output current of 150 pA at 0.24% strain. More importantly, it can be combined into a larger package to increase the output current to 600 pA to cater to self&#8208;powered applications. Combining with excellent mechanical durability, a mechanical sensor based on the Mo0.46W0.54S2 alloy is demonstrated for real&#8208;time health monitoring.

         <title>Immunoregulation in Diabetic Wound Repair with a Photoenhanced Glycyrrhizic Acid Hydrogel Scaffold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a glycyrrhizic acid (GA) hybrid hydrogel is developed as an immunoregulatory scaffold for diabetic wound repair. This hybrid hydrogel consists of inorganic Zn2+&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembled GA as a first network and photoenhanced methyl acrylylated silk fibroin as a second network, realizing both excellent injectability and mechanical strength. Notably, this hybrid hydrogel could regulate macrophage responses without exogenous addition.








Abstract
M1 macrophage accumulation and excessive inflammation are commonly encountered issues in diabetic wounds and can fail in the healing process. Hence, hydrogel dressings with immunoregulatory capacity have great promise in the clinical practice of diabetic wound healing. However, current immunoregulatory hydrogels are always needed for complex interventions and high&#8208;cost treatments, such as cytokines and cell therapies. In this study, a novel glycyrrhizic acid (GA)&#8208;based hybrid hydrogel dressing with intrinsic immunoregulatory properties is developed to promote rapid diabetic wound healing. This hybrid hydrogel consists of interpenetrating polymer networks composed of inorganic Zn2+&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembled GA and photo&#8208;crosslinked methyl acrylated silk fibroin (SF), realizing both excellent injectability and mechanical strength. Notably, the SF/GA/Zn hybrid hydrogel can regulate macrophage responses in the inflammatory microenvironment, circumventing the use of any additives. The immunomodulatory properties of the hydrogel can be harnessed for safe and efficient therapeutics that accelerate the three phases of wound repair and serve as a promising dressing for the management of diabetic wounds.

         <title>A Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Green OLED with 4500 h Lifetime and 20% External Quantum Efficiency by Optimizing the Emission Zone using a Single&#8208;Emission Spectrum Technique</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An accessible, fast procedure is shown to measure light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) emission zones with current density, different device structures, and ageing. The emission zone in an organic LED is shown to be controlled by emitter doping and to have a strong relationship with device degradation and lifetime. Using the resulting insights, record stability for a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) organic LED is shown.








Abstract
Device optimization of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) targets the most efficient conversion of electrically injected charges into emitted light. The emission zone in an LED is where charges recombine and light is emitted from. It is believed that the emission zone is strongly linked to device efficiency and lifetime. However, the emission zone size is below the optical diffraction limit, so it is difficult to measure. An accessible method based on a single emission spectrum that enables emission zone measurements with sub&#8208;second time resolution is shown. A procedure is introduced to study and control the emission zone of an LED system and correlate it with device performance. A thermally activated delayed fluorescence organic LED emission zone is experimentally measured over all luminescing current densities, while varying the device structure and while ageing. The emission zone is shown to be finely controlled by emitter doping because electron transport via the emitter is the charge&#8208;transport bottleneck of the system. Suspected quenching/degradation mechanisms are linked with the emission zone changes, device structure variation, and ageing. Using these findings, a device with an ultralong 4500 h T95 lifetime at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 with 20% external quantum efficiency is shown.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Level Methylcellulose/MXene Hybrids with Greatly Enhanced Electrochemical Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylcellulose chains are introduced between MXene sheets to obtain molecular&#8208;level hybrid films with simultaneously enhanced ambient stability and wet strength. The hybrid films also show significantly enhanced actuation strain due to the enlarged layer distance and possible in&#8208;plane sliding of MXene. A hybrid&#8208;based soft actuator shows an unprecedentedly high modulus and a strain difference up to 0.541% under&#160;1&#160;V.








Abstract
Ti3C2Tx MXene film is promising for electrochemical actuators due to its high electrical conductivity and volumetric capacitance. However, its actuation performance is limited by the slow ion diffusion through the film and poor mechanical property in aqueous electrolytes. Here, molecular&#8208;level methylcellulose (MC)/MXene hybrid films are assembled with obviously enlarged layer distance, improved wet strength, and ambient stability. The hybrid films show significantly higher in&#8208;plane actuation strain in a liquid electrolyte. Based on direct strain measurements, in&#160;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and ex&#160;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses, the actuation enhancement can be ascribed to the enlarged layer distance allowing more water and ions to be intercalated/de&#8208;intercalated and MC&#8208;induced sliding of MXene sheets. The assembled soft actuator has a high Young's modulus of 1.93&#160;GPa and can be operated in air, generating a peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak strain difference up to 0.541% under a triangular wave voltage of &#177;1&#160;V&#160;and a blocking force of 4.7&#160;times its own weight.

     alt="Molecular-Level Methylcellulose/MXene Hybrids with Greatly Enhanced Electrochemical Actuation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methylcellulose chains are introduced between MXene sheets to obtain molecular-level hybrid films with simultaneously enhanced ambient stability and wet strength. The hybrid films also show significantly enhanced actuation strain due to the enlarged layer distance and possible in-plane sliding of MXene. A hybrid-based soft actuator shows an unprecedentedly high modulus and a strain difference up to 0.541% under&#160;1&#160;V.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; MXene film is promising for electrochemical actuators due to its high electrical conductivity and volumetric capacitance. However, its actuation performance is limited by the slow ion diffusion through the film and poor mechanical property in aqueous electrolytes. Here, molecular-level methylcellulose (MC)/MXene hybrid films are assembled with obviously enlarged layer distance, improved wet strength, and ambient stability. The hybrid films show significantly higher in-plane actuation strain in a liquid electrolyte. Based on direct strain measurements, in&#160;situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and ex&#160;situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses, the actuation enhancement can be ascribed to the enlarged layer distance allowing more water and ions to be intercalated/de-intercalated and MC-induced sliding of MXene sheets. The assembled soft actuator has a high Young's modulus of 1.93&#160;GPa and can be operated in air, generating a peak-to-peak strain difference up to 0.541% under a triangular wave voltage of &#177;1&#160;V&#160;and a blocking force of 4.7&#160;times its own weight.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatial Distribution Control of Antimicrobial Peptides through a Novel Polymeric Carrier for Safe and Efficient Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymeric antimicrobial peptides (AMP) carrier that can enhance anticancer efficacy and minimize the potential side effects of AMPs by finely controlling their spatial distribution is reported. By integrating multiple responsive structures at the molecular level, the carrier finely controls the spatial distribution of AMPs in different biological microenvironments, thereby effectively modulating their membranolytic ability.








Abstract
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) hold great potential for use in tumor treatment. However, developing AMP&#8208;based antitumor therapies is challenging due to circulatory instability, hemolytic toxicity, low selectivity, and poor cell permeability of AMPs. In this study, a polymeric carrier for AMPs (denoted as PAMPm&#8208;co&#8208;PPBEn/PCA) is presented that effectively enhances their anticancer efficacy while minimizing their potential side effects. By integrating multiple responsive structures at the molecular level, the carrier finely controls the spatial distribution of AMPs in different biological microenvironments, thereby effectively modulating their membranolytic ability. Upon employing KLA as the model AMP, the polymeric carrier's hemolytic toxicity during blood circulation is suppressed, its cellular internalization when reaching tumor tissues facilitated, and its membranolytic toxicity toward the mitochondria upon entering cancer cells restored and further enhanced. Animal studies indicate that this approach significantly improves the antitumor efficacy of KLA and reduces its toxicity. Considering that the loading method for most AMPs is identical to that of KLA, the polymeric carrier reported in this study may provide a feasible approach for the development of AMP&#8208;based cancer treatments.

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Photovoltaics with Optimized Light Utilization for Printable Solar Windows</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction strategy is an efficient strategy to improving average visible transmittance (AVT) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of semitransparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs) simultaneously due to the reduction of the optical loss, and the semitransparent devices afford a highest efficiency of 14.62% with a considerable AVT of 20.42%.








Abstract
The existing conformation of the active layer is defective for employment of semitransparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs) in solar windows. Herein, scalable solar windows are successfully printed by introducing a pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction (PPHJ) structure. The PPHJ structure can effectively improve the average visible transmittance (AVT) value while boosting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of semitransparent devices due to the reduced optical loss. The universality of the PPHJ structure in the preparation of ST&#8208;OSCs is proved. Furthermore, an inset of a superhydrophobic patterned soft insertion layer (PSIL) in the encapsulated window improves the waterproof performance without losing transparency. Accordingly, the semitransparent devices based on the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;((2Z,2&#8242;Z)&#8208;((12,13&#8208;bis(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;3,9&#8208;diundecyl&#8208;12,13&#8208;dihydro&#8208;[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;e]thieno[2&#8243;,3&#8243;:4&#8242;,5&#8242;]thieno[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;g]thieno[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:4,5]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]indole&#8208;2,10&#8208;diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;indene&#8208;2,1&#8208;diylidene))dimalononitrile (Y6) system afford a maximal efficiency of 14.62%, with a considerable AVT of 20.42%, and the resultant solar windows achieve a stabilized efficiency of 13.34% with excellent waterproof performance. Moreover, the PCE of the unilateral broken solar windows retains 70.6% of the initial efficiency after being placed under simulated rainfall conditions for 1200 h at room temperature.

         <title>An On&#8208;Chip Liquid Metal Plug Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An on&#8208;chip liquid metal plug generator is demonstrated. Reproducible liquid metal plugs of a given size are generated based on Laplace pressure tuning in constricted channels whereas plugs of varying sizes and interspacing are generated for modulated voltages in straight channels prefilled with 1 m NaOH. This device can be used to generate liquid metal plugs on demand directly on&#8208;chip.








Abstract
Gallium&#8208;based liquid metal nonspherical droplets (plugs) have seen increasing demand recently mainly because their high aspect ratios make them beneficial for a wide range of applications, including microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microfluidics, sensor technology, radio&#8208;frequency devices, actuators, and switches. However, reproducibility of the generation of such plugs, as well as precise control over their size, is yet challenging. In this work, a simple on&#8208;chip liquid metal plug generator using a commercially available 3D microprinter is presented and the plug generator in poly(dimethylsiloxane) is replicated via soft lithography. Liquid metal plugs are generated via a combination of electrochemical oxidation, design of well&#8208;defined constrictions based on Laplace pressure, and the application of modulated voltage control signals. It is shown that plugs of various aspect ratios can be generated reproducibly for channel widths of 0.5, 0.8, and 1.5&#160;mm with constriction widths of 0.1&#160;mm at 6&#160;V. Laplace&#8208;pressure&#8208;controlled plugs in constricted channels are compared to modulated&#8208;voltage&#8208;generated plugs in straight channels showing that this technique provides significantly enhanced reproducibility and control over the size and spacing between the plugs. This work paves the way to sub&#8208;millimeter liquid metal plugs generated directly on&#8208;chip for on&#8208;demand MEMS and microfluidic applications.

         <title>Automated Laser&#8208;Transfer Synthesis of High&#8208;Density Microarrays for Infectious Disease Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An automated laser&#8208;based synthesis machine is presented, combining laser&#8208;induced forward transfer and robotics to perform parallel chemistry in the microarray format with up to 10&#8201;000 individual reactions cm&#8722;2. By developing an optimization pipeline, peptide microarrays with thousands of different sequences can be synthesized in high yield to study the antibody responses in infectious disease patients.








Abstract
Laser&#8208;induced forward transfer (LIFT) is a rapid laser&#8208;patterning technique for high&#8208;throughput combinatorial synthesis directly on glass slides. A lack of automation and precision limits LIFT applications to simple proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept syntheses of fewer than 100 compounds. Here, an automated synthesis instrument is reported that combines laser transfer and robotics for parallel synthesis in a microarray format with up to 10&#8201;000 individual reactions cm&#8722;2. An optimized pipeline for amide bond formation is the basis for preparing complex peptide microarrays with thousands of different sequences in high yield with high reproducibility. The resulting peptide arrays are of higher quality than commercial peptide arrays. More than 4800 15&#8208;residue peptides resembling the entire Ebola virus proteome on a microarray are synthesized to study the antibody response of an Ebola virus infection survivor. Known and unknown epitopes that serve now as a basis for Ebola diagnostic development are identified. The versatility and precision of the synthesizer is demonstrated by in situ synthesis of fluorescent molecules via Schiff base reaction and multi&#8208;step patterning of precisely definable amounts of fluorophores. This automated laser transfer synthesis approach opens new avenues for high&#8208;throughput chemical synthesis and biological screening.

More than 4800 15-residue peptides resembling the entire Ebola virus proteome on a microarray are synthesized to study the antibody response of an Ebola virus infection survivor. Known and unknown epitopes that serve now as a basis for Ebola diagnostic development are identified. The versatility and precision of the synthesizer is demonstrated by in situ synthesis of fluorescent molecules via Schiff base reaction and multi-step patterning of precisely definable amounts of fluorophores. This automated laser transfer synthesis approach opens new avenues for high-throughput chemical synthesis and biological screening.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crowning Lithium Ions in Hole&#8208;Transport Layer toward Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalyzed LiTFSI doping in Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD is developed to address the negative impacts of doping&#8208;induced hygroscopicity and ion diffusion. Crowning Li+ ions in the hole&#8208;transporting layer enables perovskite solar cells with enhanced power conversion efficiency and significantly improves stability under humid and thermal conditions.








Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit comparable power conversion efficiency (PCE) to that of silicon photovoltaic devices. However, the device stability remains a major obstacle that restricts widespread application. Doping&#8208;induced hygroscopicity, ion diffusion, and use of polar solvents in the hole&#8208;transport layer are detrimental factors for performance degradation of PSCs. Here, phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalyzed LiTFSI doping in Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD is developed to address these negative impacts. 12&#8208;Crown&#8208;4&#160;as an efficient phase&#8208;transfer catalyst promotes the dissolution of LiTFSI without requiring acetonitrile. A combined experimental and theoretical study demonstrates the host&#8211;guest interaction between Li+ ions and 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4. Crowning Li+ ions by forming more stable and less diffusive crown&#8208;ether&#8211;Li+ complexes retards the generation of hygroscopic lithium oxides and mitigates Li+&#8208;ion migration. Optimized PSCs deliver enhanced PCE and significantly improved stability under humid and thermal conditions compared with a control device. This method can also be applied to dope &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer. The findings provide a facile avenue to improve the long&#8208;term stability of PSCs.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer with Integrated Soft Thermoelectrics for Shape Memory Actuation and Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) thermoelectric device is reported, which combining active Peltier heating and cooling of LCE, along with environmental and regenerative Seebeck energy harvesting in a 3D printed material architecture. A new method of actuating LCEs, along with a new, more efficient approach to soft robotics, is introduced.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) have attracted tremendous interest as actuators for soft robotics due to their mechanical and shape memory properties. However, LCE actuators typically respond to thermal stimulation through active Joule heating and passive cooling, which make them difficult to control. In this work, LCEs are combined with soft, stretchable thermoelectrics to create transducers capable of electrically controlled actuation, active cooling, and thermal&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion. The thermoelectric layers are composed of semiconductors embedded within a 3D printed elastomer matrix and wired together with eutectic gallium&#8211;indium (EGaIn) liquid metal interconnects. This layer is covered on both sides with LCE, which alternately heats and cools to achieve cyclical bending actuation in response to voltage&#8208;controlled Peltier activation. Moreover, the thermoelectric layer can harvest energy from thermal gradients between the two LCE layers through the Seebeck effect, allowing for regenerative energy harvesting. As demonstrations, first, closed&#8208;loop control of the transducer is performed to rapidly track a changing actuator position. Second, a soft robotic walker that is capable of walking toward a heat source and harvesting energy is introduced. Lastly, phototropic&#8208;inspired autonomous deflection of the limbs toward a heat source is shown, demonstrating an additional method to increase energy recuperation efficiency for soft systems.

         <title>Giant Spin Hall Effect and Spin&#8211;Orbit Torques in 5d Transition Metal&#8211;Aluminum Alloys from Extrinsic Scattering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral domain walls are moved with current pulses highly efficiently along synthetic antiferromagnetic racetracks formed on thin underlayers of several 5d&#8208;Al alloys. These alloys exhibit very large spin Hall angles of up to &#8776;1.0 and, moreover, template [001] oriented Co&#8211;Ni multilayers with high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, making them highly useful for racetrack memories compatible with complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor technologies.








Abstract
The generation of spin currents from charge currents via the spin Hall effect (SHE) is of fundamental and technological interest. Here, some of the largest SHEs yet observed via extrinsic scattering are found in a large class of binary compounds formed from a 5d element and aluminum, with a giant spin Hall angle (SHA) of &#8776;1 in the compound Os22Al78. A critical composition of the 5d element is found at which there is a structural phase boundary between poorly and highly textured crystalline material, where the SHA exhibits its largest value. Furthermore, a systematic increase is found in the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) and SHA at this critical composition as the atomic number of the 5d element is systematically increased. This clearly shows that the SHE and SHC are derived from extrinsic scattering mechanisms related to the potential mismatch between the 5d element and Al. These studies show the importance of extrinsic mechanisms derived from potential mismatch as a route to obtaining large spin Hall angles with high technological impact. Indeed, it is demonstrated that a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art racetrack device has a several&#8208;fold increased current&#8208;induced domain wall efficiency using these materials as compared to prior&#8208;art materials.

Long&#8208;chain n&#8208;heptylamine is introduced via antisolvent engineering into a formamidine (FA)&#8208;based perovskite film, which promotes the formation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 at room temperature in humid air via intermolecular exchange behavior. The champion device delivers a power conversion efficiency of 23.7% (certificated 22.76%) with negligible hysteresis and superior stability.








Abstract
Preparation of high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells without strict environmental control is an inevitable trend of commercialization. Humidity is considered the main factor hindering perovskite performance. Formamidine (FA)&#8208;based perovskites suffer from the instability of photoactive black &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, especially in humid air, and numerous defects in the surface and bulk of perovskite films limit their performance. In this work, long&#8208;chain n&#8208;heptylamine (nHA) is introduced via antisolvent engineering into an FA&#8208;based perovskite film. nHA removes the negative intermediate adduct and promotes the formation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 at room temperature in humid air via intermolecular exchange behavior. Moreover, the existence of nHA in the final perovskite film also reduces the defects and suppresses ion migration. The champion device delivers a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.7% (certificated 22.76%) with negligible hysteresis, and the fabricated devices exhibit superior reproductivity. The device stability is also enhanced, maintaining 95% of its initial PCE after 1500 h in ambient air. Moreover, the PCE has no attenuation at the maximum power point under continuous 1&#8208;sun light soaking for 500 h. The universality of this method is also demonstrated by other perovskite compositions, including methylamine lead iodine (MAPbI3) and FAxMA1&#8722;xPbI3 in humid air.

         <title>Acid&#8208;in&#8208;Clay Electrolyte for Wide&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Range and Long&#8208;Cycle Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;in&#8208;clay electrolyte is prepared by integrating fast proton carriers in a natural phyllosilicate clay network, ranking top among the solid proton conductors in terms of high proton conductivities, enlarged electrochemical stability window, and reduced chemical reactivity. Benefitting from the above advantages, the acid&#8208;in&#8208;clay electrolyte can solve two main challenges in proton batteries: gassing and poor cycling performance.








Abstract
Proton conduction underlies many important electrochemical technologies. A family of new proton electrolytes is reported: acid&#8208;in&#8208;clay electrolyte (AiCE) prepared by integrating fast proton carriers in a natural phyllosilicate clay network, which can be made into thin&#8208;film (tens of micrometers) fluid&#8208;impervious membranes. The chosen example systems (sepiolite&#8211;phosphoric acid) rank top among the solid proton conductors in terms of proton conductivities (15 mS cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C, 0.023 mS cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;82&#160;&#176;C), electrochemical stability window (3.35&#160;V), and reduced chemical reactivity. A proton battery is assembled using AiCE as the solid electrolyte membrane. Benefitting from the wider electrochemical stability window, reduced corrosivity, and excellent ionic selectivity of AiCE, the two main problems (gassing and cyclability) of proton batteries are successfully solved. This work draws attention to the element cross&#8208;over problem in proton batteries and the generic &#8220;acid&#8208;in&#8208;clay&#8221; solid electrolyte approach with superfast proton transport, outstanding selectivity, and improved stability for room&#8208; to cryogenic&#8208;temperature protonic applications.

         <title>Photoexcitation Dynamics and Long&#8208;Lived Excitons in Strain&#8208;Engineered Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transient absorption in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides grown on fused silica by the laser&#8208;assisted synthesis technique exhibits very unusual decay dynamics that feature long&#8208;lived components progressively increasing with the excitation fluence. The experimental observations are interpreted as resulting from the strain&#8208;induced modification of the electronic bands and concomitant interplay of the intervalley and intravalley excitons&#8217; populations.








Abstract
Strain&#8208;engineering in 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors has garnered intense research interest in tailoring the optical properties via strain&#8208;induced modifications of the electronic bands in TMDs, while its impact on the exciton dynamics remains less understood. To address this, an extensive study of transient optical absorption (TA) of both W&#8208; and Mo&#8208;based single&#8208;crystalline monolayer TMDs grown by a recently developed laser&#8208;assisted evaporation method is performed. All spectral features of the monolayers as grown on fused silica substrates exhibit appreciable redshifts relating to the existence of strain due to growth conditions. Moreover, these systems exhibit a dramatic slowing down of exciton dynamics (100s of picoseconds to few nanoseconds) with an increase in carrier densities, which strongly contrasts with the monolayers in their freestanding form as well as in comparison with more traditionally grown TMDs. The observations are related to the modifications of the electronic bands as expected from the strain and associated population of the intervalley dark excitons that can now interplay with intravalley excitations. These findings are consistent across both the Mo&#8208; and W&#8208;based TMD families, providing key information about the influence of the growth conditions on the nature of optical excitations and fostering emerging optoelectronic applications of monolayer TMDs.

         <title>Stretchable Redox&#8208;Active Semiconducting Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance redox&#8208;active semiconducting polymer with stretchability up to 200% strain and 5000 repeated cycles is reported. The strain&#8208;induced electrical performance and structural evolution are systematically studied. An intrinsically stretchable organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) is fabricated to give the a normalized Gm of 233 S cm&#8722;1 and biaxial stretchability up to 100% strain. Real&#8208;time on&#8208;skin electrocardiogram signal recording is realized.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) represent an emerging device platform for next&#8208;generation bioelectronics owing to the uniquely high amplification and sensitivity to biological signals. For achieving seamless tissue&#8211;electronics interfaces for accurate signal acquisition, skin&#8208;like softness and stretchability are essential requirements, but they have not yet been imparted onto high&#8208;performance OECTs, largely due to the lack of stretchable redox&#8208;active semiconducting polymers. Here, a stretchable semiconductor is reported for OECT devices, namely poly(2&#8208;(3,3&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;(2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)&#8208;[2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophen]&#8208;5)yl thiophene) (p(g2T&#8208;T)), which gives exceptional stretchability over 200% strain and 5000 repeated stretching cycles, together with OECT performance on par with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. Validated by systematic characterizations and comparisons of different polymers, the key design features of this polymer that enable the combination of high stretchability and high OECT performance are a nonlinear backbone architecture, a moderate side&#8208;chain density, and a sufficiently high molecular weight. Using this highly stretchable polymer semiconductor, an intrinsically stretchable OECT is fabricated with high normalized transconductance (&#8776;223 S cm&#8722;1) and biaxial stretchability up to 100% strain. Furthermore, on&#8208;skin electrocardiogram (ECG) recording is demonstrated, which combines built&#8208;in amplification and unprecedented skin conformability.

         <title>Adaptive Self&#8208;Organization of Nanomaterials Enables Strain&#8208;Insensitive Resistance of Stretchable Metallic Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material strategy to fabricate a stretchable metallic nanocomposite with strain&#8208;insensitive resistance is proposed. When the surface of silver nanomaterials is treated with 1&#8208;decanethiol, the nanomaterials self&#8208;organize in response to external strain. Adopting the optimum composition of 0D/1D/2D silver nanomaterials enables preservation of the percolation networks, resulting in strain&#8208;insensitive resistance of the nanocompsite.








Abstract
Highly conductive and stretchable nanocomposites are promising material candidates for skin electronics. However, the resistance of stretchable metallic nanocomposites highly depends on external strains, often deteriorating the performance of fabricated electronic devices. Here, a material strategy for the highly conductive and stretchable nanocomposites comprising metal nanomaterials of various dimensions and a viscoelastic block&#8208;copolymer matrix is presented. The resistance of the nanocomposites can be well retained under skin deformations (&lt;50% strain). It is demonstrated that silver nanomaterials can self&#8208;organize inside the viscoelastic media in response to external strain when their surface is conjugated with 1&#8208;decanethiol. Distinct self&#8208;organization behaviors associated with nanomaterial dimensions and strain conditions are found. Adopting the optimum composition of 0D/1D/2D silver nanomaterials can render the resistance of the nanocomposites insensitive to uniaxial or biaxial strains. As a result, the resistance can be maintained with a variance of &lt;&#160;1% during 1000 stretching cycles under uniaxial and biaxial strains of &lt;50% while a high conductivity of &#8776;31&#160;000 S cm&#8722;1 is achieved.

When the surface of silver nanomaterials is treated with 1-decanethiol, the nanomaterials self-organize in response to external strain. Adopting the optimum composition of 0D/1D/2D silver nanomaterials enables preservation of the percolation networks, resulting in strain-insensitive resistance of the nanocompsite.

         <title>A Better Choice to Achieve High Volumetric Energy Density: Anode&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The density of Li metal is low, so the abuse of Li foil in Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) can easily lead to the loss of their advantage in volumetric energy density over Li&#8208;ion batteries. In addition, Li plating on a Li substrate is not as dense as that on a Cu substrate. Therefore, anode&#8208;free LMBs are more worthy of recommendation.








Abstract
Volumetric energy density is a critical but easily neglected index of lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). Compared with gravimetric energy density, the volumetric energy density (VED) of LMBs is much more sensitive to the anode/cathode (A/C) ratio due to the low density of lithium (Li) metal and the volume expansion of the Li&#8208;metal anode owing to its pulverization during cycles. Anode&#8208;free LMBs (AF&#8208;LMBs) have high theoretical VED due to the absence of an anode and high retention with relatively low cell expansion. Because Li plating highly depends on the mother substrate, Li plating on copper (Cu) substrates is more reversible and denser than that on Li substrates during cycling, which is beneficial for maintaining high volumetric capacity and efficient Li utilization. Therefore, considering that excess Li must be strictly limited to achieve competitive energy density, AF&#8208;LMBs (with bare Cu foil as the anode current collector) for high&#8208;volumetric&#8208;density batteries are recommended.

         <title>Facile, Energy&#8208;Efficient Microscale Fibrillation of Polyacrylamides under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insight into fiber formation can provide rationale for the design of fibers with programmed mechanical properties. An energy&#8208;efficient route to formation of fibers with properties comparable to natural fibers such as wool and coir is reported. This strategy offers a molecular&#8208;level understanding of fiber formation under ambient conditions which reduces current required processing energy by two&#8208;to&#8208;three orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Insight into fiber formation can provide new rationale for the design and preparation of fibers with programmed mechanical properties. While synthetic bioinspired fibers have shown impressive tensile properties, the fiber formation process remains poorly understood. Moreover, these systems are highly complex and their formation is environmentally and economically costly. Controlled fiber formation under ambient conditions from polyacrylamide solutions with properties comparable to natural fibers such as wool and coir is demonstrated. Photopolymerization and subsequent microscale fibrillation of different acrylamides in water/ethanol mixtures yield a simple and energy&#8208;efficient route to fiber formation. This strategy reduces required processing energy by two&#8208;to&#8208;three orders of magnitude. Through extensive experimental elucidation, insight into precise fiber forming conditions of polymeric solutions is achieved. Ethanol is utilized as a chain transfer agent to control the molecular weight of the polyacrylamides, and the entanglement regimes of the solutions are determined through rheological characterization showing fiber formation above the entanglement concentration. Unique from previously reported hydrogel microfibers, it is shown that fibers with good mechanical properties can be obtained without the need for composites or crosslinkers. The reported approach offers a platform for fiber formation under ambient conditions with molecular&#8208;level understanding of their&#160;assembly.

         <title>Spanning Network Gels from Nanoparticles and Graph Theoretical Analysis of Their Structure and Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogels of lead telluride nanoparticles are structurally characterized using graph theory. The morphology of the gels is quantified, identifying the effect of various salt concentrations and compositions on the connectivity of the network structures. Significant influence by divalent cations on gel structure is observed. Relationships between the structural descriptors and viscoelastic and charge transport properties are evaluated.








Abstract
Gels self&#8208;assembled from colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) translate the size&#8208;dependent properties of nanostructures to materials with macroscale volumes. Large spanning networks of NP chains provide high interconnectivity within the material necessary for a wide range of properties from conductivity to viscoelasticity. However, a great challenge for nanoscale engineering of such gels lies in being able to accurately and quantitatively describe their complex non&#8208;crystalline structure that combines order and disorder. The quantitative relationships between the mesoscale structural and material properties of nanostructured gels are currently unknown. Here, it is shown that lead telluride NPs spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into a spanning network hydrogel. By applying graph theory (GT), a method for quantifying the complex structure of the NP gels is established using a topological descriptor of average nodal connectivity that is found to correlate with the gel's mechanical and charge transport properties. GT descriptions make possible the design of non&#8208;crystalline porous materials from a variety of nanoscale components for photonics, catalysis, adsorption, and thermoelectrics.

         <title>Foldable Solid&#8208;State Batteries Enabled by Electrolyte Mediation in Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolyte by engineering of the molecular channels in lithiated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is presented. In situ electrolyte mediation in the COF increases charge&#8208;carrier concentration, eliminates interfacial defects, and activates the motion of Li+ ions in a directional manner. The COF&#8208;based electrolyte demonstrates reliable electrochemical cyclability in pouch cells.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes with high Li+ conductivity, flexibility, durability, and stability offer an attractive solution to enhance safety and energy density. However, meeting these stringent requirements poses challenges to the existing solid polymeric or ceramic electrolytes. Here, an electrolyte&#8208;mediated single&#8208;Li+&#8208;conductive covalent organic framework (COF) is presented, which represents a new category of quality solid&#8208;state Li+ conductors. In situ solidification of a tailored liquid electrolyte boosts the charge&#8208;carrier concentration in the COF channels, decouples Li+ cations from both COF walls and molecular chains, and eliminates defects by crystal soldering. Such an altered microenvironment activates the motion of Li+ ions in a directional manner, which leads to an increase in Li+ conductivity by 100 times with a transference number of 0.85 achieved at room temperature. Moreover, the electrolyte conversion cements the ultrathin COF membrane with fortified mechanical toughness. With the COF membrane, foldable solid&#8208;state pouch cells are demonstrated.

         <title>Quantum Sensing and Imaging of Spin&#8211;Orbit&#8208;Torque&#8208;Driven Spin Dynamics in the Non&#8208;Collinear Antiferromagnet Mn3Sn</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum imaging of spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque&#8208;driven magnetic switching and chiral spin rotation in noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn films is achieved using nitrogen&#8208;vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Off&#8208;resonance dipole&#8211;dipole coupling between Mn3Sn and proximate NV centers is also established, highlighting the significant potential of NV centers in diagnosing the local magnetic properties of emergent quantum materials with vanishingly small magnetic moments.








Abstract
Novel non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnets with spontaneous time&#8208;reversal symmetry breaking, non&#8208;trivial band topology, and unconventional transport properties have received immense research interest over the past decade due to their rich physics and enormous promise in technological applications. One of the central focuses in this emerging field is exploring the relationship between the microscopic magnetic structure and exotic material properties. Here, nanoscale imaging of both spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque&#8208;induced deterministic magnetic switching and chiral spin rotation in non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn films using nitrogen&#8208;vacancy (NV) centers are reported. Direct evidence of the off&#8208;resonance dipole&#8211;dipole coupling between the spin dynamics in Mn3Sn and proximate NV centers is also demonstrated by NV relaxometry measurements. These results demonstrate the unique capabilities of NV centers in accessing the local information of the magnetic order and dynamics in these emergent quantum materials and suggest new opportunities for investigating the interplay between topology and magnetism in a broad range of topological magnets.

         <title>Cascade Downregulation of the HER Family by a Dual&#8208;Targeted Recombinant Protein&#8211;Drug Conjugate to Inhibit Tumor Growth and Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)&#160;and integrin &#945;v&#946;3&#160;dual&#8208;targeted recombinant protein drug conjugate can downregulate the expressions of the HER family including EGFR (HER1), HER2, HER3, and HER4, inhibit the downstream signaling pathways, and improve the drug accumulation and distribution in tumors, leading to reduction of tumor size and significant inhibition of tumor metastasis.








Abstract
Human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)&#8208;targeted therapy can significantly improve the outcome of patients with HER2&#160;positive cancer. However, relapse after this treatment remains a great challenge in the clinic due to tumor resistance, in which the HER network induces constitutive signal transduction. In addition, integrin receptors in the tumor extracellular matrix can mitigate the therapeutic effect of inhibitors to the growth factors receptors and tyrosine kinases. Here, the development of a recombinant protein (RP&#8208;HI) and its drug conjugates (RPDC&#8208;HI) to target both HER2&#160;and integrin is reported. When simultaneously blocking HER2&#160;and integrin by RP&#8208;HI, functions of the HER family and their interactions with the integrin are disrupted by downregulated expressions of HER family members, leading to inhibition of several downstream signal pathways. In combination with targeted delivery of the anticancer agent, doxorubicin (DOX), RPDC&#8208;HI significantly improves the tumor inhibition efficacy to 97.5% in treating HER2&#8208;positive breast cancer, comparing to 34.3% for free DOX. RPDC&#8208;HI shows even better antitumor efficiency than a monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab, when treating larger tumors. The developed dual&#8208;targeted RPDC platform offers a new and promising strategy for treating HER2&#8208;positive patients with synergistic therapeutic effects against tumor resistance to the conventional HER2&#8208;targeted treatment.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Dendrimers that Underpin High&#8208;Efficiency Host&#8208;Free Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational design of a donor&#8211;acceptor dendrimer emitter that shows remarkable photophysical properties, including efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and high photoluminescence quantum yield, is reported. Its use is demonstrated in a host&#8208;free solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) that shows record&#8208;high external quantum efficiencies.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) remains a challenge. An effective solution, highlighted in this work, is to use highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) dendrimers as emitters. Here, the design, synthesis, density functional theory (DFT) modeling, and photophysics of three triazine&#8208;based dendrimers, tBuCz2pTRZ, tBuCz2mTRZ, and tBuCz2m2pTRZ, is reported, which resolve the conflicting requirements of achieving simultaneously a small &#916;EST and a large oscillator strength by incorporating both meta&#8208; and para&#8208;connected donor dendrons about a central triazine acceptor. The solution&#8208;processed OLED containing a host&#8208;free emitting layer exhibits an excellent maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 28.7%, a current efficiency of 98.8&#160;cd A&#8722;1, and a power efficiency of 91.3&#160;lm W&#8722;1. The device emits with an electroluminescence maximum, &#955;EL, of 540&#160;nm and Commission International de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) color coordinates of (0.37, 0.57). This represents the most efficient host&#8208;free solution&#8208;processed OLED reported to date. Further optimization directed at improving the charge balance within the device results in an emissive layer containing 30 wt% OXD&#8208;7, which leads to an OLED with the similar EQEmax of 28.4% but showing a significantly improved efficiency rolloff where the EQE remains high at 22.7% at a luminance of 500&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>A Robust Memristor Based on Epitaxial Vertically Aligned Nanostructured BaTiO3&#8722;CeO2 Films on Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite films system consisting of ferroelectric material and dielectric film is proposed as a memristor medium to improve the comprehensive performances of the resistive&#8208;switching behavior, and epitaxial BaTiO3&#8722;CeO2 ferroelectric films on silicon are obtained successfully. The durability of the device is more than 109 cycles, and the speed can be lower than 10 ns.








Abstract
With the exploration of ferroelectric materials, researchers have a strong desire to explore the next generation of non&#8208;volatile ferroelectric memory with silicon&#8208;based epitaxy, high&#8208;density storage, and algebraic operations. Herein, a silicon&#8208;based memristor with an epitaxial vertically aligned nanostructures BaTiO3&#8211;CeO2 film based on La0.67Sr0.33MnO3/SrTiO3/Si substrate is reported. The ferroelectric polarization reversal is optimized through the continuous exploring of growth temperature, and the epitaxial structure is obtained, thus it improves the resistance characteristic, the multi&#8208;value storage function of five states is achieved, and the robust endurance characteristic can reach 109 cycles. In the synapse plasticity modulated by pulse voltage process, the function of the spiking&#8208;time&#8208;dependent plasticity and paired&#8208;pulse facilitation is simulated successfully. More importantly, the algebraic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are realized by using fast speed pulse of the width &#8776;50&#160;ns. Subsequently, a convolutional neural network is constructed for identifying the CIFAR&#8208;10 dataset, to simulate the performance of the device; the online and offline learning recognition rate reach 90.03% and 92.55%, respectively. Overall, this study paves the way for memristors with silicon&#8208;based epitaxial ferroelectric films to realize multi&#8208;value storage, algebraic operations, and neural computing chip applications.

         <title>2D MBenes: A Novel Member in the Flatland</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D MBenes, early transition metal borides, have recently gained tremendous attention due to their unique properties. This Perspective sheds light on the material&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationship of MBenes and elucidates the most prospective applications in various fields, thus opening a promising paradigm for designing new functional systems and high&#8208;performance devices with multipurpose functionalities.








Abstract
2D MBenes, early transition metal borides, are a very recent derivative of ternary or quaternary transition metal boride (MAB) phases and represent a new member in the flatland. Although holding great potential toward various applications, mainly theoretical knowledge about their potential properties is available. Theoretical calculations and preliminary experimental attempts demonstrate their rich chemistry, excellent reactivity, mechanical strength/stability, electrical conductivity, transition properties, and energy harvesting possibility. Compared to MXenes, MBenes&#8217; structure appears to be more complex due to multiple crystallographic arrangements, polymorphism, and structural transformations. This makes their synthesis and subsequent delamination into single flakes challenging. Overcoming this bottleneck will enable a rational control over MBenes&#8217; material&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationship. Innovations in MBenes&#8217; postprocessing approaches will allow for the design of new functional systems and devices with multipurpose functionalities thus opening a promising paradigm for the conscious design of high&#8208;performance 2D materials.

         <title>Porous Polymers as Universal Reversal Agents for Heparin Anticoagulants through an Inclusion&#8211;Sequestration Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inclusion&#8211;sequestration strategy is developed by making use of multicationic supramolecular organic frameworks and porous organic polymers as porous antidotes to neutralize heparins. In vitro and in vivo experiments and biocompatibility evaluations confirm that the porous polymers can realize rapid, safe, and universal reversal of heparin&#8208;based anticoagulants, superior to that of clinically used protamine.








Abstract
Heparins are widely used anticoagulants for surgical procedures and extracorporeal therapies. However, all of them have bleeding risks. Protamine sulfate, the only clinically approved antidote for unfractionated heparin (UFH), has adverse effects. Moreover, protamine can only partially neutralize low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight heparins (LMWHs) and is not effective for fondaparinux. Here, an inclusion&#8211;sequestration strategy for efficient neutralization of heparin anticoagulants by cationic porous supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) and porous organic polymers (POPs) is reported. Isothermal titration calorimetric and fluorescence experiments show strong binding affinities of these porous polymers toward heparins, whereas dynamic light scattering and zeta potential analysis confirm that the heparin sequences are adsorbed into the interior of the porous hosts. Activated partial thromboplastin time, anti&#8208;FXa, and thromboelastography assays indicate that their neutralization efficacies are higher than or as high as that of protamine for UFH and generally superior to protamine for LMWHs and fondaparinux, which is further confirmed by tail&#8208;transection model in mice and ex vivo aPTT or anti&#8208;FXa analysis in rats. Acute toxicity evaluations reveal that one of the SOFs displays outstanding biocompatibility. This work suggests that porous polymers can supply safe and rapid reversal of clinically used heparins, as protamine surrogates, providing an improved approach for their neutralization.

         <title>Polyiodide Confinement by Starch Enables Shuttle&#8208;Free Zn&#8211;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the significant chromogenic reaction between starch and iodine, the shuttle effect of Zn&#8211;I2 batteries is effectively addressed by using starch, which strongly anchors polyiodide anions due to its unique double&#8208;helix structure. Benefiting from this structure confinement, a Coulombic efficiency of almost 100% and an ultralong life of 50&#160;000 cycles are realized in Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries have been regarded as a promising energy&#8208;storage system owing to their high energy/power density, safety, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the polyiodide shuttling results in serious active mass loss and Zn corrosion, which limits the cycling life of Zn&#8211;I2 batteries. Inspired by the chromogenic reaction between starch and iodine, a structure confinement strategy is proposed to suppress polyiodide shuttling in Zn&#8211;I2 batteries by hiring starch, due to its unique double&#8208;helix structure. In situ Raman spectroscopy demonstrates an I5&#8722;&#8208;dominated I&#8722;/I2 conversion mechanism when using starch. The I5&#8722; presents a much stronger bonding with starch than I3&#8722;, inhibiting the polyiodide shuttling in Zn&#8211;I2 batteries, which is confirmed by in situ ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectra. Consequently, a highly reversible Zn&#8211;I2 battery with high Coulombic efficiency (&#8776;100% at 0.2 A g&#8722;1) and ultralong cycling stability (&gt;50&#160;000 cycles) is realized. Simultaneously, the Zn corrosion triggered by polyiodide is effectively inhibited owing to the desirable shuttling&#8208;suppression by the starch, as evidenced by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. This work provides a new understanding of the failure mechanism of Zn&#8211;I2 batteries and proposes a cheap but effective strategy to realize high&#8208;cyclability Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.

         <title>Platelet Pharmacytes for the Hierarchical Amplification of Antitumor Immunity in Response to Self&#8208;Generated Immune Signals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;adaptive platelet pharmacytes, consisting of encapsulated Rab27a siRNA nanocomplexes and backpacked anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 nanogels, are engineered to hierarchically amplify antitumor immunity. The platelet pharmacytes efficiently silence Rab27a in tumor cells to inhibit secretion of tumor&#8208;derived exosomes, which relieves the immunosuppression and cascadingly releases anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 to sensitize anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;mediated immune checkpoint blockade.








Abstract
Systemic immunosuppression mediated by tumor&#8208;derived exosomes is an important cause for the resistance of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Herein, self&#8208;adaptive platelet (PLT) pharmacytes are engineered to mediate cascaded delivery of exosome&#8208;inhibiting siRNA and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 (aPDL1) toward synergized antitumor immunity. In the pharmacytes, polycationic nanocomplexes (NCs) assembled from Rab27 siRNA (siRab) and a membrane&#8208;penetrating polypeptide are encapsulated inside the open canalicular system of PLTs, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)&#8208;responsive aPDL1 nanogels (NGs) are covalently backpacked on the PLT surface. Upon systemic administration, the pharmacytes enable prolonged blood circulation and active accumulation to tumors, wherein PLTs are activated to liberate siRab NCs, which efficiently transfect tumor cells, silence Rab27a, and inhibit exosome secretion. The immunosuppression is thus relieved, leading to the activation, proliferation, and tumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, which trigger latent aPDL1 release. As such, the competitive aPDL1 exhaustion by PD&#8208;L1&#8208;expressing exosomes is minimized to sensitize ICB. Synergistically, siRab and aPDL1 induce strong antitumor immunological response and memory against syngeneic murine melanoma. This study reports a bioinspired mechanism to resolve the blood circulation/cell internalization contradiction of polycationic siRNA delivery systems, and renders an enlightened approach for the spatiotemporal enhancement of antitumor immunity.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Polymer Nanoparticles for Efficient Delivery of Cas9 Ribonucleoprotein With or Without Donor DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 may offer new therapeutics for genetic diseases through gene disruption via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or gene correction via homology&#8208;directed repair (HDR). In this work, facilely fabricated pH&#8208;responsive polymer nanoparticles, capable of safely and efficiently delivering Cas9 ribonucleoprotein alone (NHEJ&#8208;NP) or together with donor DNA (HDR&#8208;NP), are developed for gene editing in mouse liver, lung, or skeletal muscle.








Abstract
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)&#8208;associated protein 9 (Cas9) may offer new therapeutics for genetic diseases through gene disruption via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or gene correction via homology&#8208;directed repair (HDR). However, clinical translation of CRISPR technology is limited by the lack of safe and efficient delivery systems. Here, facilely fabricated pH&#8208;responsive polymer nanoparticles capable of safely and efficiently delivering Cas9 ribonucleoprotein alone (termed NHEJ&#8208;NP, diameter = 29.4&#160;nm), or together with donor DNA (termed HDR&#8208;NP, diameter = 33.3&#160;nm) are reported. Moreover, intravenously, intratracheally, and intramuscularly injected NHEJ&#8208;NP induces efficient gene editing in mouse liver, lung, and skeletal muscle, respectively. Intramuscularly injected HDR&#8208;NP also leads to muscle strength recovery in a Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse model. NHEJ&#8208;NP and HDR&#8208;NP possess many desirable properties including high payload loading content, small and uniform sizes, high editing efficiency, good biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and ease of production, storage, and transport, making them great interest for various genome editing applications with clinical potentials.

         <title>Negative Phototransistors with Ultrahigh Sensitivity and Weak&#8208;Light Detection Based on 1D/2D Molecular Crystal p&#8211;n Heterojunctions and their Application in Light Encoders</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasensitive negative phototransistors are developed based on 1D/2D molecular crystal (1D/2DMC) p&#8211;n heterojunctions. This unique structure utilizes photogenerated holes of p&#8208;type 1DMCs to dope electron carriers in n&#8208;type 2DMC channels under UV illumination, achieving complete depletion of the channel current. The negative phototransistor exhibits superior performance parameters, accurately controllable threshold voltage by light, and ultrasensitive detection of weak light.








Abstract
Anomalous negative phototransistors in which the channel current decreases under light illumination hold potential to generate novel and multifunctional optoelectronic applications. Although a variety of design strategies have been developed to construct such devices, NPTs still suffer from far lower device performance compared to well&#8208;developed positive phototransistors (PPTs). In this work, a novel 1D/2D molecular crystal p&#8211;n heterojunction, in which p&#8208;type 1D molecular crystal (1DMC) arrays are embedded into n&#8208;type 2D molecular crystals (2DMCs), is developed to produce ultrasensitive NPTs. The p&#8208;type 1DMC arrays act as light&#8208;absorbing layers to induce p&#8208;doping of n&#8208;type 2DMCs through charge transfer under illumination, resulting in ineffective gate control and significant negative photoresponses. As a result, the NPTs show remarkable performances in photoresponsivity (P) (1.9&#160;&#215;&#160;108) and detectivity (D*) (1.7&#160;&#215;&#160;1017 Jones), greatly outperforming previously reported NPTs, which are one of the highest values among all organic phototransistors. Moreover, the device exhibits intriguing characteristics undiscovered in PPTs, including precise control of the threshold voltage by controlling light signals and ultrasensitive detection of weak light. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the NTPs are demonstrated as light encoders that can encrypt electrical signals by light. These findings represent a milestone for negative phototransistors, and pave the way for the development of future novel optoelectronic applications.

         <title>An Ultrafast, Durable, and High&#8208;Loading Polymer Anode for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries and Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable, cheap, fast (100 A g&#8722;1), stable (1&#160;000&#160;000 cycles), and high&#8208;loading (&#8776;50&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) polymer anode is developed for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries and capacitors by engineering both the electrode and electrolyte, surpassing the Zn&#8208;metal anode.








Abstract
Zn metal has shown promise as an anode material for grid&#8208;level energy storage, yet is challenged by dendritic growth and low Coulombic efficiency. Herein, an ultrafast, stable, and high&#8208;loading polymer anode for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries and capacitors (ZIBs and ZICs) is developed by engineering both the electrode and electrolyte. The anode polymer is rationally prepared to have a suitable electronic structure and a large &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, whereas the electrolyte is manufactured based on the superiority of triflate anions over sulfate anions, as analyzed and confirmed via experiments and simulations. This dual engineering results in an optimal polymer anode with a low discharge potential, near&#8208;theoretical capacity, ultrahigh&#8208;loading capability (&#8776;50&#160;mg cm&#8722;2), ultrafast rate (100 A g&#8722;1), and ultralong lifespan (one million cycles). Its mechanism involves reversible Zn2+/proton co&#8208;storage at the carbonyl site. When the polymer anode is coupled with cathodes for both ZIB and ZIC applications, the devices demonstrate ultrahigh power densities and ultralong lifespans, far surpassing those of corresponding Zn&#8208;metal&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Organic Electrochemical Transistors Based on Self&#8208;Doped Conjugated Polyelectrolytes for Reconfigurable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With PCPDTBT&#8208;SO3K (CPE&#8208;K) as the active material, dual&#8208;mode organic electrochemical transistors that operate in both depletion mode and enhancement mode are demonstrated. Mode switching is done via changing the polarity of the applied voltages, enabled by the dual&#8208;mode absorption capabilities of CPE&#8208;K. These transistors are used to create reconfigurable logic gates, paving the way for the use of organic electrochemical transistors in emerging reconfigurable electronics.








Abstract
Reconfigurable organic logic devices are promising candidates for next generations of efficient computing systems and adaptive electronics. Ideally, such devices would be of simple structure and design, be power efficient, and compatible with high&#8208;throughput microfabrication techniques. This work reports an organic reconfigurable logic gate based on novel dual&#8208;mode organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), which employ a self&#8208;doped conjugated polyelectrolyte as the active material, which then allows the transistors to operate in both depletion mode and enhancement mode. Furthermore, mode switching is accomplished by simply altering the polarity of the applied gate and drain voltages, which can be done on the fly. In contrast, achieving similar mode&#8208;switching functionality with other organic transistors typically requires complex molecular design or multi&#8208;device engineering. It in shown that dual&#8208;mode functionality is enabled by the concurrent existence of anion doping and cation dedoping of the films. A device physics model that accurately describes the behavior of these transistors is developed. Finally, the utility of these dual&#8208;mode transistors for implementing reconfigurable logic by fabricating a logic gate that may be switched between logic gates AND to NOR, and OR to NAND on the fly is demonstrated.

         <title>Ultrathin Van der Waals Antiferromagnet CrTe3 for Fabrication of In&#8208;Plane CrTe3/CrTe2 Monolayer Magnetic Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin CrTe3 films are successfully synthesized. Monolayer (ML) CrTe3 represents a unique van der Waals (vdW) magnet with intralayer antiferromagnetism, which is identified by scanning probe microscopy. A facile method is developed to fabricate CrTe3/CrTe2 magnetic heterostructures from ML CrTe3 with an atomically sharp and seamless interface, which is significant for the development of miniaturized spintronic devices based on vdW magnets.








Abstract
Ultrathin van der Waals (vdW) magnets are heavily pursued for potential applications in developing high&#8208;density miniaturized electronic/spintronic devices as well as for topological physics in low&#8208;dimensional structures. Despite the rapid advances in ultrathin ferromagnetic vdW magnets, the antiferromagnetic counterparts, as well as the antiferromagnetic junctions, are much less studied owing to the difficulties in both material fabrication and magnetism characterization. Ultrathin CrTe3 layers have been theoretically proposed to be a vdW antiferromagnetic semiconductor with intrinsic intralayer antiferromagnetism. Herein, the epitaxial growth of monolayer (ML) and bilayer CrTe3 on graphite surface is demonstrated. The structure, electronic and magnetic properties of the ML CrTe3 are characterized by combining scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy and confirmed by density functional theory calculations. The CrTe3 MLs can be further utilized for the fabrication of a lateral heterojunction consisting of ML CrTe2 and ML CrTe3 with an atomically sharp and seamless interface. Since ML CrTe2 is a metallic vdW magnet, such a heterostructure presents the first in&#8208;plane magnetic metal&#8211;semiconductor heterojunction made of two vdW materials. The successful fabrication of ultrathin antiferromagnetic CrTe3, as well as the magnetic heterojunction, will stimulate the development of miniaturized antiferromagnetic spintronic devices based on vdW materials.

Abstract
Surface discharge mechanism induced cathode passivation is a critical challenge that blocks the full liberation of the ultrahigh theoretical energy density in aprotic Li&#8211;O2 batteries. Herein, a facile and universal concept of hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted solvation is proposed to trigger the solution discharge process for averting the shortcomings associated with surface discharge. 2,5&#8208;Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylhydroquinone (DBHQ), an antioxidant with hydroxyl groups, is introduced as an exemplary soluble catalyst to promote solution discharge by hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted solvation of O2&#8722; and Li2O2 (O&#63743;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O). Thus, a Li&#8211;O2 battery with 50&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m DBHQ delivers an extraordinary discharge capacity of 18&#160;945 mAh g&#8722;1 (i.e., 9.47 mAh cm&#8722;2), even surpassing the capacity endowed by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reduction mediator of 2,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone. Besides, an ultrahigh Li2O2 yield of 97.1% is also achieved due to the depressed reactivity of the reduced oxygen&#8208;containing species (O2&#8722;, LiO2, and Li2O2) by the solvating and antioxidative abilities of DBHQ. Consequently, the Li&#8211;O2 battery with DBHQ exhibits excellent cycling lifetime and rate capability. Furthermore, the generalizability of this approach of hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted solution discharge is verified by other soluble catalysts that contain &#63743;OH or &#63743;NH groups, with implications that could bring Li&#8211;O2 batteries one step closer to being a viable technology.

High&#8208;quality gallium nitride (GaN)&#8208;based heterostructures are epitaxially grown on a 4&#176; off&#8208;axis 4H&#8208;silicon carbide (SiC) substrate, based on which, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art high&#8208;electron&#8208;mobility transistors are fabricated, suggesting a practical approach to realizing GaN/SiC hybrid field&#8208;effect transistors (HyFETs). The distinct two&#8208;step biaxial strain relaxation in the III&#8211;nitride epilayer is revealed, offering a design guideline of such an unconventional vicinal epitaxy technique.








Abstract
A hybrid field&#8208;effect transistor (HyFET), superior for power electronic applications, can be created by harnessing the merits of two representative wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductors, gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC). Yet, the incompactness in the epitaxy techniques hinders the development of the HyFET&#8212;GaN is usually grown on on&#8208;axis foreign substrates including SiC, whereas SiC homoepitaxy prefers off&#8208;axis substrates. This work presents a GaN&#8208;based heterostructure epitaxially grown on a conventional 4&#176; off&#8208;axis 4H&#8208;SiC substrate, which manifests its high quality and suitability for constructing GaN&#8208;based high&#8208;electron&#8208;mobility transistors, thereby suggesting a practical approach to realizing HyFETs. In the meanwhile, a distinct two&#8208;step biaxial strain&#8208;relaxation process is proposed and studied with comprehensive characterizations.

         <title>In Situ Fabrication of Porous CoxP Hierarchical Nanostructures on Carbon Fiber Cloth with Exceptional Performance for Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mixed&#8208;valence strategy and construction of an &#8220;all in one&#8221; electrode is employed to prepare flexible carbon fiber cloth supported porous CoxP hierarchical structures comprising nanoneedles and nanosheets. The as&#8208;prepared CoxP@CFC electrode exhibits enhanced sodium&#8208;storage performance with a high reversible capacity (814&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1), remarkable rate performance (279&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), and record ultralong cycling life (almost 100%&#160;capacity retention after 9000&#160;cycles).








Abstract
Superior high&#8208;rate performance and ultralong cycling life have been constantly pursued for rechargeable sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). In this work, a facile strategy is employed to successfully synthesize porous CoxP hierarchical nanostructures supported on a flexible carbon fiber cloth (CoxP@CFC), constructing a robust architecture of ordered nanoarrays. Via such a unique design, porous and bare structures can thoroughly expose the electroactive surfaces to the electrolyte, which is favorable for ultrafast sodium&#8208;ion storage. In addition, the CFC provides an interconnected 3D conductive network to ensure firm electrical connection of the electrode materials. Besides the inherent flexibility of the CFC, the integration of the hierarchical structures of CoxP with the CFC, as well as the strong synergistic effect between them, effectively help to buffer the mechanical stress caused by repeated sodiation/desodiation, thereby guaranteeing the structural integrity of the overall electrode. Consequently, CoxP@CFC as an anode shows a record&#8208;high capacity of 279&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 with almost no capacity attenuation after 9000 cycles.

         <title>Tunable Planar Focusing Based on Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A planar polariton focusing device based on the natural in&#8208;plane hyperbolic van der Waals material &#945;&#8208;MoO3 is developed, which achieves ultrahigh field compression and wide&#8208;range tunable performance. Moreover, a graphene/&#945;&#8208;MoO3 heterostructure is constructed, which supports hybrid modes consisting of &#945;&#8208;MoO3 phonon polaritons and graphene plasmons to achieve in situ dynamical control of the focal length.








Abstract
Manipulation of the propagation and energy&#8208;transport characteristics of subwavelength infrared (IR) light fields is critical for the application of nanophotonic devices in photocatalysis, biosensing, and thermal management. In this context, metamaterials are useful composite materials, although traditional metal&#8208;based structures are constrained by their weak mid&#8208;IR response, while their associated capabilities for optical propagation and focusing are limited by the size of attainable artificial optical structures and the poor performance of the available active means of control. Herein, a tunable planar focusing device operating in the mid&#8208;IR region is reported by exploiting highly oriented in&#8208;plane hyperbolic phonon polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3. Specifically, an unprecedented change of effective focal length of polariton waves from 0.7 to 7.4 &#956;m is demonstrated by the following three different means of control: the dimension of the device, the employed light frequency, and engineering of phonon&#8211;plasmon hybridization. The high confinement characteristics of phonon polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 permit the focal length and focal spot size to be reduced to 1/15 and 1/33 of the incident wavelength, respectively. In particular, the anisotropic phonon polaritons supported in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 are combined with tunable surface&#8208;plasmon polaritons in graphene to realize in situ and dynamical control of the focusing performance, thus paving the way for phonon&#8208;polariton&#8208;based planar nanophotonic applications.

Lead Telluride Nanoparticles
Lead telluride nanoparticles spontaneously assemble into a spanning nanofiber network as reported by Nicholas A. Kotov and co&#8208;workers in article number 2201313. The resulting transparent nanoparticle hydrogels have potential application as UV or X&#8208;ray sensors. The network morphology can be modified through variations in the composition and concentration of added electrolyte. Evaluation of the network morphology with graph theory is used to derive correlations to the gels' mechanical and electrical properties.

Organic Electrochemical Transistors
A dual ionic transport property of self&#8208;doped conjugated polyelectrolytes is reported by Thuc&#8208;Quyen Nguyen and co&#8208;workers in article number 2200274: they can be both doped and dedoped upon the interaction with anions (blue) and cations (red) in an electrolyte, respectively. This discovery enables dual&#8208;mode organic electrochemical transistors, paving the way for the use of organic devices in emerging reconfigurable electronics.

Dendrimer Emitters
In article number 2110344, Dianming Sun, Xiaohong Zhang, Anna K&#246;hler, Eli Zysman&#8208;Colman, and co&#8208;workers report the rational design of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) dendrimer emitters that show remarkable photophysical properties, resolving the conflicting requirements of achieving simultaneously a small activation energy and a large oscillator strength. Their use in a host&#8208;free solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED), which shows record&#8208;high external quantum efficiencies, is demonstrated. The dendrimer design strategy provides a route to high&#8208;performance solution&#8208;processed TADF OLEDs and evidences the full potential of dendrimers as emissive materials.

The next robotics frontier will be led by biohybrids, robots that incorporate living biological cells and tissue, which are addressed by Miriam Filippi, Robert K. Katzschmann, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2108427. Microfluidics substantially contributes to the development of biological tissue in vitro, as microfluidic flow control enables fluid regulation at the microscale and fine tissue structuring during biofabrication. Microfluidics will advance the co&#8208;assembly, scale&#8208;up, and integration of biohybrid robots, and make these robots performant and functional for real&#8208;world use.

         <title>Surface Modification of 2D Photocatalysts for Solar Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although the research of 2D photocatalysts has made great progress in the past decades, there are still many challenges in understanding the deep relationship between the surface state and the reaction mechanism. The surface modification strategies and reaction mechanisms of 2D photocatalysts are reviewed, and some useful views are put forward for future research in this field.








Abstract
2D materials show many particular properties, such as high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, high anisotropic degree, and adjustable chemical functionality. These unique properties in 2D materials have sparked immense interest due to their applications in photocatalytic systems, resulting in significantly enhanced light capture, charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, and surface reaction. Herein, the research progress in 2D photocatalysts based on varied compositions and functions, followed by specific surface modification strategies, is introduced. Fundamental principles focusing on light harvesting, charge separation, and molecular adsorption/activation in the 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based photocatalytic system are systemically explored. The examples described here detail the use of 2D materials in various photocatalytic energy&#8208;conversion systems, including water splitting, carbon dioxide reduction, nitrogen fixation, hydrogen peroxide production, and organic synthesis. Finally, by elaborating the challenges and possible solutions for developing these 2D&#160;materials, the review is expected to provide some inspiration for the future research of 2D materials used on efficient photocatalytic energy conversions.

         <title>Microfluidic Tissue Engineering and Bio&#8208;Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidics enables the engineering of biological tissues through micro&#8208;precision control over the cell microenvironment, fabrication of cell&#8208;laden matrices, and distribution of fluids to perfuse 3D tissue constructs. In particular, microfluidically&#8208;advanced functional muscle tissues can be used as performant actuators in the next generation of bio&#8208;hybrid robots.








Abstract
Bio&#8208;hybrid technologies aim to replicate the unique capabilities of biological systems that could surpass advanced artificial technologies. Soft bio&#8208;hybrid robots consist of synthetic and living materials and have the potential to self&#8208;assemble, regenerate, work autonomously, and interact safely with other species and the environment. Cells require a sufficient exchange of nutrients and gases, which is guaranteed by convection and diffusive transport through liquid media. The functional development and long&#8208;term survival of biological tissues in vitro can be improved by dynamic flow culture, but only microfluidic flow control can develop tissue with fine structuring and regulation at the microscale. Full control of tissue growth at the microscale will eventually lead to functional macroscale constructs, which are needed as the biological component of soft bio&#8208;hybrid technologies. This review summarizes recent progress in microfluidic techniques to engineer biological tissues, focusing on the use of muscle cells for robotic bio&#8208;actuation. Moreover, the instances in which bio&#8208;actuation technologies greatly benefit from fusion with microfluidics are highlighted, which include: the microfabrication of matrices, biomimicry of cell microenvironments, tissue maturation, perfusion, and vascularization.

         <title>Tuning Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen&#8208;Reduction Pathways for H2O2 Electrosynthesis via Engineering Atomically Dispersed Single Metal Site Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering atomically dispersed single metal site catalysts in surface functionalization, coordination environments, and local carbon structures can effectively tune two&#8208;electron oxygen&#8208;reduction pathways for efficient hydrogen peroxide production. The review summarizes recent progress on catalyst development and electrode design to electrolyzer fabrication for clean and sustainable hydrogen peroxide electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation via the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under ambient conditions is emerging as an alternative and green strategy to the traditional energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process and unsafe direct synthesis using H2 and O2. It enables on&#8208;site and decentralized H2O2 production using air and renewable electricity for various applications. Currently, atomically dispersed single metal site catalysts have emerged as the most promising platinum group metal (PGM)&#8208;free electrocatalysts for the ORR. Further tuning their central metal sites, coordination environments, and local structures can be highly active and selective for H2O2 production via the 2e&#8722; ORR. Herein, recent methodologies and achievements on developing single metal site catalysts for selective O2 to H2O2 reduction are summarized. Combined with theoretical computation and advanced characterization, a structure&#8211;property correlation to guide rational catalyst design with a favorable 2e&#8722; ORR process is aimed to provide. Due to the oxidative nature of H2O2 and the derived free radicals, catalyst stability and effective solutions to improve catalyst tolerance to H2O2 are emphasized. Transferring intrinsic catalyst properties to electrode performance for viable applications always remains a grand challenge. The key performance metrics and knowledge during the electrolyzer development are, therefore, highlighted.

Further tuning their central metal sites, coordination environments, and local structures can be highly active and selective for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production via the 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR. Herein, recent methodologies and achievements on developing single metal site catalysts for selective O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction are summarized. Combined with theoretical computation and advanced characterization, a structure&#8211;property correlation to guide rational catalyst design with a favorable 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR process is aimed to provide. Due to the oxidative nature of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the derived free radicals, catalyst stability and effective solutions to improve catalyst tolerance to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are emphasized. Transferring intrinsic catalyst properties to electrode performance for viable applications always remains a grand challenge. The key performance metrics and knowledge during the electrolyzer development are, therefore, highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (ZIBs), including zinc&#8208;iodine redox flow batteries and static ZIBs, are promising candidates for future grid&#8208;scale electrochemical energy storage. They are safe with great theoretical capacity, high energy, and power density. Nevertheless, to make aqueous rechargeable ZIBs practically feasible, there are quite a few hurdles that need to be overcome, including self&#8208;discharge, sluggish kinetics, low energy density, and instability of Zn metal anodes. This article first reviews the electrochemistry in aqueous rechargeable ZIBs, including the flow and static battery configurations and their electrode reactions. Then the authors discuss the fundamental questions of ZIBs and highlight the key strategies and recent accomplishments in tackling the challenges. Last, they share their thoughts on the future research development in aqueous rechargeable ZIBs.

         <title>Insights into Redox Processes and Correlated Performance of Organic Carbonyl Electrode Materials in Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic carbonyl compounds have been considered as promising electrode materials for high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries. However, their redox processes and performance need to be fully understood. An in&#8208;depth understanding on redox processes and the correlated electrochemical performance of organic carbonyl electrode materials is provided, with the aim of promoting their practical applications in the foreseeable future.








Abstract
Organic carbonyl electrode materials have shown great prospects for rechargeable batteries in view of their high capacity, flexible designability, and sustainable production. However, organic carbonyl electrode materials still suffer from unsatisfactory electrochemical performance, which is highly relevant to their redox processes. Herein, an in&#8208;depth understanding on redox processes and the correlated electrochemical performance of organic carbonyl electrode materials is provided. The redox processes discussed mainly involve molecular structure evolution (intermediates), crystal structure evolution (phase transition), and charge storage mechanisms. The properties of intermediates can affect voltage, cycling stability, reversible capacity, and rate performance of batteries. Moreover, the reversible capacity/cycling stability and rate performance would be also influenced by phase transition and charge storage mechanisms (diffusion&#8208; or surface&#8208;controlled), respectively. To accelerate the practical applications of organic carbonyl electrode materials, future work should focus on developing more in situ or operando characterization techniques and further understanding the intrinsic relationships between redox processes and performance. It is hoped that the work discussed herein will stimulate more attention to the detailed redox processes and their correlations with the performance of organic carbonyl electrode materials in rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Conjugated Polyelectrolytes: Underexplored Materials for Pseudocapacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polyelectrolytes are characterized by an electronically delocalized backbone bearing ionic functionalities. These features lead to properties relevant for use in energy&#8208;storing pseudocapacitor devices, including ionic conductivity, water processability, gel formation, and formation of polaronic species stabilized by electrostatic interactions. Moreover, that conjugated polyelectrolytes are miscible in aqueous media enables living materials that can switch from energy production to energy storage.








Abstract
Conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) are characterized by an electronically delocalized backbone bearing ionic functionalities. These features lead to properties relevant for use in energy&#8208;storing pseudocapacitor devices, including ionic conductivity, water processability, gel&#8208;formation, and formation of polaronic species stabilized by electrostatic interactions. In this Perspective, the basis for evaluating the figures of merit for pseudocapacitors is provided, together with the techniques used for their evaluation. The general utility and challenges encountered with neutral conjugated polymers are then discussed. Finally, recent advances on the use of CPEs in pseudocapacitor devices are reviewed. The article is concluded by discussing how their miscibility in aqueous media permits the incorporation of CPEs in living materials that are capable of switching function from extraction of energy from bacterial metabolic pathways to pseudocapacitor energy storage.

         <title>Assessing the Photovoltaic Quality of Vacuum&#8208;Thermal Evaporated Organic Semiconductor Blends</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art vacuum thermal&#8208;evaporated organic solar cells (VTE OSCs) in their photovoltaic material quality is assessed. The comprehensive optoelectronic characterization yields four key metrics governing OSC performance&#8212;a new methodology that equally applies to solution&#8208;processed OSCs. The five studied material blends give a representative overview of today's VTE OSCs and needs for improvement are identified for this industrially leading OSC technology.








Abstract
Vacuum&#8208;thermal evaporation (VTE) is a highly relevant fabrication route for organic solar cells (OSCs), especially on an industrial scale as proven by the commercialization of organic light emitting diode&#8208;based displays. While OSC performance is reported for a range of VTE&#8208;deposited molecules, a comprehensive assessment of donor:acceptor blend properties with respect to their photovoltaic performance is scarce. Here, the organic thin films and solar cells of three select systems are fabricated and ellipsometry, external quantum efficiency with high dynamic range, as well as OTRACE are measured to quantify absorption, voltage losses, and charge carrier mobility. These parameters are key to explain OSC performance and will help to rationalize the performance of other material systems reported in literature as the authors&#8217; methodology is applicable beyond VTE systems. Furthermore, it can help to judge the prospects of new molecules in general. The authors find large differences in the measured values and find that today's VTE OSCs can reach high extinction coefficients, but only moderate mobility and voltage loss compared to their solution&#8208;processed counterparts. What needs to be improved for VTE OSCs is outlined to again catch up with their solution&#8208;processed counterparts in terms of power conversion efficiency.

         <title>Tuning Conjugated Polymer Chain Packing for Stretchable Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulky additive molecules residing between amorphous chain networks can disrupt the crystalline ordering of polymer semiconductors. The long&#8208;range crystalline domains are suppressed while short&#8208;range aggregations of conjugated polymers are promoted, leading to an improved thin&#8208;film stretchability without affecting charge transport under an external strain up to 100%.








Abstract
In order to apply polymer semiconductors to stretchable electronics, they need to be easily deformed under strain without being damaged. A small number of conjugated polymers, typically with semicrystalline packing structures, have been reported to exhibit mechanical stretchability. Herein, a method is reported to modify polymer semiconductor packing&#8208;structure using a molecular additive, dioctyl phthalate (DOP), which is found to act as a molecular spacer, to be inserted between the amorphous chain networks and disrupt the crystalline packing. As a result, large&#8208;crystal growth is suppressed while short&#8208;range aggregations of conjugated polymers are promoted, which leads to an improved mechanical stretchability without affecting charge&#8208;carrier transport. Due to the reduced conjugated polymer intermolecular interactions, strain&#8208;induced chain alignment and crystallization are observed. By adding DOP to a well&#8208;known conjugated polymer, poly[2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;decyltetradecyl)pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;1,4&#8208;(2H,5H)&#8208;dione&#8208;(E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;di(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophen&#8208;5&#8208;yl)ethene] (DPPTVT), stretchable transistors are obtained with anisotropic charge&#8208;carrier mobilities under strain, and stable current output under strain up to 100%.

The long-range crystalline domains are suppressed while short-range aggregations of conjugated polymers are promoted, leading to an improved thin-film stretchability without affecting charge transport under an external strain up to 100%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to apply polymer semiconductors to stretchable electronics, they need to be easily deformed under strain without being damaged. A small number of conjugated polymers, typically with semicrystalline packing structures, have been reported to exhibit mechanical stretchability. Herein, a method is reported to modify polymer semiconductor packing-structure using a molecular additive, dioctyl phthalate (DOP), which is found to act as a molecular spacer, to be inserted between the amorphous chain networks and disrupt the crystalline packing. As a result, large-crystal growth is suppressed while short-range aggregations of conjugated polymers are promoted, which leads to an improved mechanical stretchability without affecting charge-carrier transport. Due to the reduced conjugated polymer intermolecular interactions, strain-induced chain alignment and crystallization are observed. By adding DOP to a well-known conjugated polymer, poly[2,5-bis(4-decyltetradecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-(2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;,5&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-dione-(E)-1,2-di(2,2&#8242;-bithiophen-5-yl)ethene] (DPPTVT), stretchable transistors are obtained with anisotropic charge-carrier mobilities under strain, and stable current output under strain up to 100%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlled n&#8208;Doping of Naphthalene&#8208;Diimide&#8208;Based 2D Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bulk conductivity of naphthalene&#8208;diimide&#8208;based 2D polymers is increased by controlled stoichiometric n&#8208;doping with cobaltocene. Following single&#8208;electron reduction, these 2DPs retain their periodic structure and become paramagnetic. Substoichiometric doping leads to the highest bulk electronic conductivities, which is found to proceed through a hopping&#8208;mechanism.








Abstract
2D polymers (2DPs) are promising as structurally well&#8208;defined, permanently porous, organic semiconductors. However, 2DPs are nearly always isolated as closed shell organic species with limited charge carriers, which leads to low bulk conductivities. Here, the bulk conductivity of two naphthalene diimide (NDI)&#8208;containing 2DP semiconductors is enhanced by controllably n&#8208;doping the NDI units using cobaltocene (CoCp2). Optical and transient microwave spectroscopy reveal that both as&#8208;prepared NDI&#8208;containing 2DPs are semiconducting with sub&#8208;2&#160;eV optical bandgaps and photoexcited charge&#8208;carrier lifetimes of tens of nanoseconds. Following reduction with CoCp2, both 2DPs largely retain their periodic structures and exhibit optical and electron&#8208;spin resonance spectroscopic features consistent with the presence of NDI&#8208;radical anions. While the native NDI&#8208;based 2DPs are electronically insulating, maximum bulk conductivities of &gt;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 are achieved by substoichiometric levels of n&#8208;doping. Density functional theory calculations show that the strongest electronic couplings in these 2DPs exist in the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (&#960;&#8208;stacking) crystallographic directions, which indicates that cross&#8208;plane electronic transport through NDI stacks is primarily responsible for the observed electronic conductivity. Taken together, the controlled molecular doping is a useful approach to access structurally well&#8208;defined, paramagnetic, 2DP n&#8208;type semiconductors with measurable bulk electronic conductivities of interest for electronic or spintronic devices.

         <title>Developing the Nondevelopable: Creating Curved&#8208;Surface Electronics from Nonstretchable Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Curved&#8208;surface electronics promise to bring new levels of interactivity, sensitivity, and energy efficiency to our&#160;everyday lives. These curved shapes, however, pose a challenge to established fabrication methods for high&#8208;performance electronics. In this work, ultrathin, nonstretchable planar electronics are attached to nondevelopable surfaces by introducing a shrinkage&#8208;based wrinkling paradigm that can enable future curved devices to leverage developments in flexible electronics.








Abstract
The incorporation of electronics onto curved surfaces promises to bring new levels of intelligence to the ergonomic, aesthetic, aerodynamic, and optical surfaces that are ever&#8208;present in our&#160;lives. However, since many of these surfaces have 2D (i.e., nondevelopable) curvature, they cannot be formed from the deformation of a flat, nonstretchable sheet. This means that curved electronics cannot capitalize on the rapid technological advances taking place in the field of ultrathin electronics, since ultrathin devices, though ultraflexible, are not stretchable. In this work, a shrink&#8208;based paradigm is presented to apply such thin&#8208;film electronics to nondevelopable surfaces, expanding the capabilities of current nondevelopable electronics, and linking future developments in thin&#8208;film technology to similar developments in curved devices. The wrinkling of parylene&#8208;based devices and the effects of shrinkage on common electrical components are examined, culminating in shrinkable touch sensors and organic photovoltaics, laminated to various nondevelopable surfaces without loss of performance.

         <title>De Novo Synthesis of Free&#8208;Standing Flexible 2D Intercalated Nanofilm Uniform over Tens of cm2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The de novo synthesis of a 3&#8208;nm&#8208;thick nanofilm intercalating a hydrogen&#8208;bonded water network between two layers of fullerene molecules is reported. The film can be laminated into a multiply film either in situ or by sequential lamination. The film is uniform over an area of 30 cm2, and shows electron&#8208;dose&#8208;dependent reversible bending and proton conductivity up to 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Of a variety of intercalated materials, 2D intercalated systems have attracted much attention both as materials per se, and as a platform to study atoms and molecules confined among nanometric layers. High&#8208;precision fabrication of such structures has, however, been a difficult task using the conventional top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up approaches. The de novo synthesis of a 3&#8208;nm&#8208;thick nanofilm intercalating a hydrogen&#8208;bonded network between two layers of fullerene molecules is reported here. The two&#8208;layered film can be further laminated into a multiply film either in situ or by sequential lamination. The 3 nm film forms uniformly over an area of several tens of cm2 at an air/water interface and can be transferred to either flat or perforated substrates. A free&#8208;standing film in air prepared by transfer to a gold comb electrode shows proton conductivity up to 1.4&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1. Electron&#8208;dose&#8208;dependent reversible bending of a free&#8208;standing 6&#8208;nm&#8208;thick nanofilm hung in a vacuum is observed under electron beam irradiation.

         <title>14&#160;GHz Schottky Diodes Using a p&#8208;Doped Organic Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining asymmetric co&#8208;planar nanogap electrodes with a p&#8208;doped organic polymer semiconductor yields Schottky diodes that are capable of operating at 14&#160;GHz, making them the fastest organic electronic devices reported to date.








Abstract
The low carrier mobility of organic semiconductors and the high parasitic resistance and capacitance often encountered in conventional organic Schottky diodes hinder their deployment in emerging radio frequency (RF) electronics. Here, these limitations are overcome by combining self&#8208;aligned asymmetric nanogap electrodes (&#8776;25&#160;nm) produced by adhesion lithography, with a high mobility organic semiconductor, and RF Schottky diodes able to operate in the 5G frequency spectrum are demonstrated. C16IDT&#8208;BT is used, as the high hole mobility polymer, and the impact of p&#8208;doping on the diode performance is studied. Pristine C16IDT&#8208;BT&#8208;based diodes exhibit maximum intrinsic and extrinsic cutoff frequencies (fC) of &gt;100&#160;and 6&#160;GHz, respectively. This extraordinary performance is attributed to the planar nature of the nanogap channel and the diode's small junction capacitance (&lt;2&#160;pF). Doping of C16IDT&#8208;BT with the molecular p&#8208;dopant C60F48 improves the diode's performance further by reducing the series resistance resulting to intrinsic and extrinsic fC of &gt;100&#160;and &#8776;14&#160;GHz respectively, while the DC output voltage of an RF rectifier circuit increases by a tenfold. Our&#160;work highlights the importance of the planar nanogap architecture and paves the way for the use of organic Schottky diodes in large&#8208;area RF electronics of the future.

&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; of &amp;gt;100&#160;and &#8776;14&#160;GHz respectively, while the DC output voltage of an RF rectifier circuit increases by a tenfold. Our&#160;work highlights the importance of the planar nanogap architecture and paves the way for the use of organic Schottky diodes in large-area RF electronics of the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Combining interface assembly of 2D organic semiconductor crystal (2DOSCs) with a poly(dimethylsiloxane)&#8208;mold&#8208;assisted selective contact evaporation printing technique, large&#8208;area, high&#8208;resolution (1271 dpi), and layer&#8208;controlled 2DOSC arrays are fabricated. OFETs based on the 2DOSC arrays show high electrical performance and a small relative variation of 12.5% in mobility. This method will promote the research and application of 2DOSCs.








Abstract
2D organic semiconductor crystals (2DOSCs) have extraordinary charge transport capability, adjustable photoelectric properties, and superior flexibility, and have stimulated continuous research interest for next&#8208;generation electronic and optoelectronic applications. The prerequisite for achieving large&#8208;area and high&#8208;throughput optoelectronic device integration is to fabricate high&#8208;resolution 2DOSC arrays. Patterned substrate&#8208; and template&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly is an effective strategy to fabricate OSC arrays. However, the film thickness is difficult to control due to the complicated crystallization process during solvent evaporation. Therefore, the manufacturing of 2DOSC arrays with high&#8208;resolution and controllable molecular&#8208;layer numbers through solution&#8208;based patterning methods remains a challenge. Herein, a two&#8208;step strategy to produce high&#8208;resolution layer&#8208;controlled 2DOSC arrays is reported. First, large&#8208;scale 2DOSCs with well&#8208;defined layer numbers are obtained by a solution&#8208;processed organic semiconductor crystal engineering method. Next, the high&#8208;resolution layer&#8208;controlled 2DOSC arrays are fabricated by a polydimethylsiloxane mold&#8208;assisted selective contact evaporation printing technique. The organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) based on 2DOSC arrays have high electrical performance and excellent uniformity. The 2,6&#8208;bis(4&#8208;hexylphenyl)anthracene 2DOSC arrays&#8208;based OFETs have a small variation of 12.5% in mobility. This strategy can be applied to various organic semiconductors and pattern arrays. These demonstrations will offer more opportunities for 2DOSCs for integrated optoelectronic devices.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Ion&#8208;Exchange Doping of Conducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extremely efficient ion&#8208;exchange doping process for conjugated polymers which enables conductivities exceeding 1000 S cm&#8722;1 is demonstrated. Factors which affect ion exchange, such as electrolyte concentration, doping solvent, and film crystallinity are discussed. When exchange is efficient there is a direct correspondence between ion exchange electrochemical doping, which is used to reveal the detrimental impact of off&#8208;target oxidation reactions.








Abstract
Molecular doping&#8212;the use of redox&#8208;active small molecules as dopants for organic semiconductors&#8212;has seen a surge in research interest driven by emerging applications in sensing, bioelectronics, and thermoelectrics. However, molecular doping carries with it several intrinsic problems stemming directly from the redox&#8208;active character of these materials. A recent breakthrough was&#160;a doping technique based on ion&#8208;exchange, which separates the redox and charge compensation steps of the doping process. Here, the equilibrium and kinetics of ion exchange doping in a model system, poly(2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;alkylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno(3,2&#8208;b)thiophene) (PBTTT) doped with FeCl3 and an ionic liquid, is studied, reaching conductivities in excess of 1000 S cm&#8722;1 and ion exchange efficiencies above 99%. Several factors that enable such high performance, including the choice of acetonitrile as the doping solvent, which largely eliminates electrolyte association effects and dramatically increases the doping strength of FeCl3, are demonstrated. In this high ion exchange efficiency regime, a simple connection between electrochemical doping and ion exchange is illustrated, and it is shown that the performance and stability of highly doped PBTTT is ultimately limited by intrinsically poor stability at high redox potential.

         <title>Short Excited&#8208;State Lifetimes Mediate Charge&#8208;Recombination Losses in Organic Solar Cell Blends with Low Charge&#8208;Transfer Driving Force</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic solar cells that employ donor:acceptor blends with near&#8208;zero driving force for charge transfer are becoming prevalent because of their superior performance. In this work, the factors affecting charge transfer and subsequent dissociation of the charge&#8208;transfer state are experimentally and theoretically analyzed. Short excited&#8208;state lifetime and hybridization open up new recombination channels with detrimental effects on free&#8208;charge generation.








Abstract
A blend of a low&#8208;optical&#8208;gap diketopyrrolopyrrole polymer and a fullerene derivative, with near&#8208;zero driving force for electron transfer, is investigated. Using femtosecond transient absorption and electroabsorption spectroscopy, the charge transfer (CT) and recombination dynamics as well as the early&#8208;time transport are quantified. Electron transfer is ultrafast, consistent with a Marcus&#8211;Levich&#8211;Jortner description. However, significant charge recombination and unusually short excited (S1) and CT state lifetimes (&#8776;14&#160;ps) are observed. At low S1&#8211;CT offset, a short S1 lifetime mediates charge recombination because: i) back&#8208;transfer from the CT to the S1 state followed by S1 recombination occurs and ii) additional S1&#8211;CT hybridization decreases the CT lifetime. Both effects are confirmed by density functional theory calculations. In addition, relatively slow (tens of picoseconds) dissociation of charges from the CT state is observed, due to low local charge mobility. Simulations using a four&#8208;state kinetic model entailing the effects of energetic disorder reveal that the free charge yield can be increased from the observed 12% to 60% by increasing the S1 and CT lifetimes to 150&#160;ps. Alternatively, decreasing the interfacial CT state disorder while increasing bulk disorder of free charges enhances the yield to 65% in spite of the short lifetimes.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Triggered Supramolecular Assembly of Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A temperature&#8208;triggered supramolecular assembly process is reported for fabricating highly ordered organic semiconductor arrays. The central concept of the molecule design&#8212;named the "Tetris strategy"&#8212;is to increase the rotational freedom of the molecules through thermal perturbation, thereby inducing conformation locking of adjacent molecules through cooperative [&#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;] interactions.

Abstract
Supramolecular assembly is a promising bottom&#8208;up approach for producing materials that behave as charge transporting components in electronic devices. Although extensive advances have been made during the past two decades, formidable challenges exist in controlling the local randomness present in supramolecular assemblies. Here, a temperature&#8208;triggered supramolecular assembly strategy using heat to heal defects and disorders is reported. The central concept of the molecular design&#8212;named the "Tetris strategy" in this research&#8212;is to: i) increase the rotational freedom of the molecules through thermal perturbation, ii) induce conformation&#8208;fitting of adjacent molecules through two different kinds of intermolecular [&#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;] interactions, and finally iii) lock the nearby molecules in inactive co&#8208;conformations. Experimentally, upon heating to 57&#160;&#176;C, amorphous solid&#8208;state films undergo spontaneous assembly, leading to the growth of uniform and highly ordered microwire arrays. Temperature&#8208;triggered supramolecular assembly provides an approach closer to the precision control of assembled structures and presents with a broad canvas to work on in approaching a new generation of supramolecular electronics.

         <title>Oligoethylene Glycol Side Chains Increase Charge Generation in Organic Semiconductor Nanoparticles for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing conjugated polymers functionalized with (oligo)ethylene glycol side chains in nanoparticle photocatalysts can greatly enhance their H2&#8208;evolution efficiency. Glycolation facilitates charge generation and suppresses both geminate and nongeminate charge recombination in donor/acceptor nanoparticles. This results in a high yield of photogenerated charges with lifetimes long enough to efficiently drive ascorbic acid oxidation and H2 evolution.








Abstract
Organic semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) composed of an electron donor/acceptor (D/A) semiconductor blend have recently emerged as an efficient class of hydrogen&#8208;evolution photocatalysts. It is demonstrated that using conjugated polymers functionalized with (oligo)ethylene glycol side chains in NP photocatalysts can greatly enhance their H2&#8208;evolution efficiency compared to their nonglycolated analogues. The strategy is broadly applicable to a range of structurally diverse conjugated polymers. Transient spectroscopic studies show that glycolation facilitates charge generation even in the absence of a D/A heterojunction, and further suppresses both geminate and nongeminate charge recombination in D/A NPs. This results in a high yield of photogenerated charges with lifetimes long enough to efficiently drive ascorbic acid oxidation, which is correlated with greatly enhanced H2&#8208;evolution rates in the glycolated NPs. Glycolation increases the relative permittivity of the semiconductors and facilitates water uptake. Together, these effects may increase the high&#8208;frequency relative permittivity inside the NPs sufficiently, to cause the observed suppression of exciton and charge recombination responsible for the high photocatalytic activities of the glycolated NPs.

         <title>Emissive Charge&#8208;Transfer States at Hybrid Inorganic/Organic Heterojunctions Enable Low Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination and High&#8208;Performance Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient charge generation mediated by an emissive charge&#8208;transfer state is observed in hybrid heterojunctions comprising the inorganic semiconductor copper thiocyanate and common organic semiconductors. This enables the fabrication of solar cells with very low voltage losses and highly sensitive photodetectors that can detect sub&#8208;picowatt near&#8208;infrared light.








Abstract
Hybrid devices based on a heterojunction between inorganic and organic semiconductors have offered a means to combine the advantages of both classes of materials in optoelectronic devices, but, in practice, the performance of such devices has often been disappointing. Here, it is demonstrated that charge generation in hybrid inorganic&#8211;organic heterojunctions consisting of copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) and a variety of molecular acceptors (ITIC, IT&#8208;4F, Y6, PC70BM, C70, C60) proceeds via emissive charge&#8208;transfer (CT) states analogous to those found at all&#8208;organic heterojunctions. Importantly, contrary to what has been observed at previous organic&#8211;inorganic heterojunctions, the dissociation of the CT&#8208;exciton and subsequent charge separation is efficient, allowing the fabrication of planar photovoltaic devices with very low non&#8208;radiative voltage losses (0.21&#160;&#177; &#8197;0.02&#160;V). It is shown that such low non&#8208;radiative recombination enables the fabrication of simple and cost&#8208;effective near&#8208;IR (NIR) detectors with extremely low dark current (4 pA cm&#8722;2) and noise spectral density (3 fA Hz&#8722;1/2) at no external bias, leading to specific detectivities at NIR wavelengths of just under 1013 Jones, close to the performance of commercial silicon photodetectors. It is believed that this work demonstrates the possibility for hybrid heterojunctions to exploit the unique properties of both inorganic and organic semiconductors for high&#8208;performance opto&#8208;electronic devices.

         <title>Intrinsic Linear Dichroism of Organic Single Crystals toward High&#8208;Performance Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superior organic semiconductor, 2,6&#8208;diphenyl anthracene (DPA), is selected to develop polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors. High&#8208;quality DPA crystals exhibit strong anisotropic nature. Their photodetectors show remarkable polarization sensitivity with a dichroic ratio up to &#8776;1.9. It is revealed that intrinsic linear dichroism is responsible for the observed polarization sensitivity. This work demonstrates the potential of developing efficient polarization&#8208;sensitive organic photodetectors for diverse applications.








Abstract
The ability to detect light in photodetectors is central to practical optoelectronic applications, which has been demonstrated in inorganic semiconductor devices. However, so far, the study of polarization&#8208;sensitive organic photodetectors, which have unique applications in flexible and wearable electronics, has not received much attention. Herein, the construction of polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors based on the single crystals of a superior optoelectronic organic semiconductor, 2,6&#8208;diphenyl anthracene (DPA), is demonstrated. The systematic characterization of two&#8208;dimensionally grown DPA crystals with various techniques definitely show their strong anisotropy in molecular vibration, optical reflectance and optical absorption. In terms of polarization sensitivity, DPA&#8208;crystal based photodetectors exhibit a linear dichroic ratio up to &#8776;1.9. Theoretical calculations confirm that intrinsic linear dichroism, originated from the anisotropic in&#8208;plane crystal structure, is responsible for the polarization sensitivity of DPA crystals. This work opens up a new door for exploiting organic semiconductors for developing highly compact polarization photodetectors and providing new functionalities in novel flexible optical and optoelectronic applications.

Color&#8208;tunable white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with hole&#8208;trapping thermally activated delayed&#8208;fluorescence&#8208;sensitized emissions realize significant Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinates and correlated&#160;color&#160;temperature shifts from (0.40, 0.47) and 4088 K at 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2 to (0.27, 0.33) and 9269 K at 5000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, with a reported maximum external quantum efficiency of 30.7% and long lifetime of over 20&#160;000 h at 80% of the initial luminance.








Abstract
White organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (WOLEDs) with high efficiencies and tunable colors attracts considerable interest from the industry and academia. Thermally activated delayed&#8208;fluorescence (TADF) emitters can revolutionize such WOLED devices; however, they still suffer from poor performances. In this study, an advanced double&#8208;emissive&#8208;layer device architecture capable of hole&#8208;trapping TADF&#8208;sensitized emissions is proposed to not only achieve a recombination zone shift for the tunable colors but also accelerate exciton emission dynamics for high efficiency and alleviated roll&#8208;off. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept WOLEDs exhibit significant shifts in their Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates and correlated color temperatures from (0.40, 0.47) and 4088 K at 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2 to (0.27, 0.33) and 9269 K at 5000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. Additionally, the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) reaches 30.7% and remains &gt;25%&#160;over a wide luminance range of 500&#8211;5000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, along with an extended LT80 of over 20&#160;000 h at an initial luminance of 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2. This is the first time that all&#8208;fluorescent WOLEDs have been used to realize an EQE exceeding 30%, thereby establishing a new benchmark in this field.

         <title>Molecular Oligothiophene&#8211;Fullerene Dyad Reaching Over 5% Efficiency in Single&#8208;Material Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel structurally defined and covalently linked donor&#8211;acceptor dyad 4 is implemented into single&#8208;material organic solar cells as the essential ambipolar and photoactive layer. The combination of an oligothiophene donor and PC71BM fullerene as acceptor not only leads to enhanced 5.34% power conversion efficiency, but also to impressive long&#8208;term stability after 750 hours (one month) of continuous illumination.








Abstract
A novel donor&#8211;acceptor dyad, 4, in which the conjugated oligothiophene donor is covalently connected to fullerene PC71BM by a flexible alkyl ester linker, is synthesized and applied as photoactive layer in solution&#8208;processed single&#8208;material organic solar cells (SMOSCs). Excellent photovoltaic performance, including a high short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) of 13.56&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, is achieved, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 5.34% in an inverted cell architecture, which is substantially increased compared to other molecular single materials. Furthermore, dyad 4&#8208;based SMOSCs display excellent stability maintaining 96% of the initial performance after 750 h (one month) of continuous illumination and operation under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation. These results will strengthen the rational molecular design to further develop SMOSCs for potential industrial application.

Conformal Films
In article number 2106683, Kenjiro Fukuda, Takao Someya, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate how a variety of ultrathin, ultraflexible organic photovoltaics that differ in layout, active area, and active material can be laminated to glass spheres of different sizes using a thermally activated shrink film. The wrinkling pattern that occurs in these ultrathin sheets allows even nonstretchable devices to conform to surfaces with a 3D curvature.

         <title>Controlled Growth and Self&#8208;Assembly of Multiscale Organic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiscale organic semiconductors (OSs) are widely used as active components in practical devices. The intrinsic properties of OSs can be regulated through chemical structure design and self&#8208;assembly process control.








Abstract
Currently, organic semiconductors (OSs) are widely used as active components in practical devices related to energy storage and conversion, optoelectronics, catalysis, and biological sensors, etc. To satisfy the actual requirements of different types of devices, chemical structure design and self&#8208;assembly process control have been synergistically performed. The morphology and other basic properties of multiscale OS components are governed on a broad scale from nanometers to macroscopic micrometers. Herein, the up&#8208;to&#8208;date design strategies for fabricating multiscale OSs are comprehensively reviewed. Related representative works are introduced, applications in practical devices are discussed, and future research directions are presented. Design strategies combining the advances in organic synthetic chemistry and supramolecular assembly technology perform an integral role in the development of a new generation of multiscale OSs.

         <title>Color&#8208;Tunable Supramolecular Luminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular chemistry has provided a platform for the rational design of smart optical materials. Noncovalent bonding interactions, not only afford convenient and efficient approaches to fabricate emissive materials, but also endow them with dynamic reversibility and stimuli responsiveness. This review highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art noncovalent strategies available for the construction of color&#8208;tunable luminescent materials.








Abstract
Constructing multicolor photoluminescent materials with tunable properties is an attractive research objective on account of their abundant applications in materials science and biomedical engineering. By comparison with covalent synthesis, supramolecular chemistry has provided a more competitive and promising strategy for the production of organic materials and the regulation of their photophysical properties. By taking advantage of dynamic and reversible noncovalent bonding interactions, supramolecular strategies can, not only simplify the design and fabrication of organic materials, but can also endow them with dynamic reversibility and stimuli responsiveness, making it much easier to adjust the superstructures and properties of the materials. Occasionally, it is possible to introduce emergent properties into these materials, which are absent in their precursor compounds, broadening their potential applications. In an attempt to highlight the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art noncovalent strategies available for the construction of smart luminescent materials, an overview of color&#8208;tunable materials is presented in this Review, with the emphasis being placed on the examples drawn from host&#8211;guest complexes, supramolecular assemblies and crystalline materials. The noncovalent synthesis of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent materials and the modulation of their luminescent properties are also described. Finally, future directions and scientific challenges in the emergent field of color&#8208;tunable supramolecular emissive materials are discussed.

         <title>Slip&#8208;Stacked J&#8208;Aggregate Materials for Organic Solar Cells and Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregates constitute archetype functional materials due to unique properties originating from exciton coupling. Here, a broader perspective on the origin of red&#8208;shifted absorption bands including intermolecular charge transfer&#8208;mediated J&#8208;coupling is provided. Further, important classes of dye aggregates with regard to the prevailing intermolecular couplings and their relevance for organic solar cells and photodetectors are analyzed.








Abstract
Dye&#8211;dye interactions affect the optical and electronic properties in organic semiconductor films of light harvesting and detecting optoelectronic applications. This review elaborates how to tailor these properties of organic semiconductors for organic solar cells (OSCs) and organic photodiodes (OPDs). While these devices rely on similar materials, the demands for their optical properties are rather different, the former requiring a broad absorption spectrum spanning from the UV over visible up to the near&#8208;infrared region and the latter an ultra&#8208;narrow absorption spectrum at a specific, targeted wavelength. In order to design organic semiconductors satisfying these demands, fundamental insights on the relationship of optical properties are provided depending on molecular packing arrangement and the resultant electronic coupling thereof. Based on recent advancements in the theoretical understanding of intermolecular interactions between slip&#8208;stacked dyes, distinguishing classical J&#8208;aggregates with predominant long&#8208;range Coulomb coupling from charge transfer (CT)&#8208;mediated or &#8208;coupled J&#8208;aggregates, whose red&#8208;shifts are primarily governed by short&#8208;range orbital interactions, is suggested. Within this framework, the relationship between aggregate structure and functional properties of representative classes of dye aggregates is analyzed for the most advanced OSCs and wavelength&#8208;selective OPDs, providing important insights into the rational design of thin&#8208;film optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Structures and Materials in Stretchable Electroluminescent Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the challenges in fabricating stretchable electroluminescent (EL) devices, with focus on providing a basic understanding of the materials meeting both the mechanical and electronic requirements and introducing important techniques to fabricate the devices. The developments of stretchable transparent electrodes and EL materials relevant to intrinsically stretchable EL devices are described in detail.








Abstract
Stretchable electroluminescent (EL) devices are obtained by partitioning a large emission area into areas specifically for stretching and light&#8208;emission (island&#8211;bridge structure). Buckled and textile structures are also shown effective to combine the conventional light emitting diode fabrication with elastic substrates for structure&#8208;enabled stretchable EL devices. Meanwhile, intrinsically stretchable EL devices which are characterized with uniform stretchability down to microscopic scale are relatively less developed but promise simpler device structure and higher impact resistance. The challenges in fabricating intrinsically stretchable EL devices with high and robust performance are in many facets, including stretchable conductors, emissive materials, and compatible processes. For the stretchable transparent electrode, ionically conductive gel, conductive polymer coating, and conductor network in surface of elastomer are all proven useful. The stretchable EL materials are currently limited to conjugated polymers, conjugated polymers with surfactants and ionic conductors added to boost stretchability, and phosphor particles embedded in elastomer matrices. These emissive materials operate under different mechanisms, require different electrode materials and fabrication processes, and the corresponding EL devices face distinctive challenges. This review aims to provide a basic understanding of the materials meeting both the mechanical and electronic requirements and important techniques to fabricate the stretchable EL devices.

         <title>Acceptor Modulation Strategies for Improving the Electron Transport in High&#8208;Performance Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review illustrates the significance of improving electron transport of semiconducting polymers. To improve the electron mobilities, acceptor modulation strategies are summarized and discussed. The introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups into polymers is also involved. High&#8208;performance organic field&#8208;effect transistors are reviewed. The relationship between device performance and chemical structure, energy levels, molecular packing orientation, and processing condition is comprehensively discussed.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance ambipolar and electronic type semiconducting polymers are essential for fabricating various organic optoelectronic devices and complementary circuits. This review summarizes the strategies of improving the electron transport of semiconducting polymers via acceptor modulation strategies, which include the use of single, dual, triple, multiple, and all acceptors as well as the fusion of multiple identical acceptors to obtain new heterocyclic acceptors. To further improve the electron transport of semiconducting polymers, the introduction of strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups can enhance the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of donors and acceptors, thereby facilitating electron injection and suppressing hole accumulation. In addition, the relationships between the molecular structure, frontier molecular orbital energy levels, thin film morphology, microstructure, processing conditions, and device performances are also comprehensively discussed. Finally, the challenges encountered in this research area are proposed and the future outlook is presented.

         <title>Recent Progress in External&#8208;Stimulus&#8208;Responsive 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the recent process of stimulus&#8208;responsive 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is summarized. The responsive behaviors and design strategies of these smart 2D COFs under physical or chemical stimuli are well described. Moreover, their applications in chemical sensors and photoelectronic devices are also discussed.








Abstract
Recently, smart 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs), combining the advantages of both inherent structure features and functional building blocks, have been demonstrated to show reversible changes in conformation, color, and luminescence in response to external stimuli. This review provides a summary on the recent progress of 2D COFs that are responsive to external stimuli such as metal ions, gas molecules, pH values, temperature, electricity, light, etc. Moreover, the responsive mechanisms and design strategies, along with the applications of these stimulus&#8208;responsive 2D COFs in chemical sensors and photoelectronic devices are also discussed. It is believed that this review would provide some guidelines for designing novel single&#8208;/multistimulus&#8208;responsive 2D COFs with controllable responsive behaviors for advanced photoelectronic applications.

         <title>Quinoxaline&#8208;Based D&#8211;A Copolymers for the Applications as Polymer Donor and Hole Transport Material in Polymer/Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>

Recent developments of the quinoxaline&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers for the applications as polymer donor in polymer solar cells and as hole transport material in perovskite solar cells are reviewed.








Abstract
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have achieved great progress recently, benefiting from the rapid development of narrow bandgap small molecule acceptors and wide bandgap conjugated polymer donors. Among the polymer donors, the D&#8211;A copolymers with quinoxaline (Qx) as A&#8208;unit have received increasing attention since the report of the low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance D&#8211;A copolymer donor based on thiophene D&#8208;unit and difluoro&#8208;quinoxalline A&#8208;unit in 2018. In addition, the weak electron&#8208;deficient characteristic and the multiple substitution positions of the Qx unit make it an ideal A&#8208;unit in constructing the wide bandgap polymer donors with different functional substitutions. In this review article, recent developments of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymer donors, including synthetic method of the Qx unit, backbone modulation, side chain optimization, and functional substitution of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers, are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, the application of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers as hole transport material in perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) is also introduced. The focus mainly on the molecular design strategies and structure&#8211;properties relationship of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers, aiming to provide a guideline for developing high&#8208;performance Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers for the applications as donor in PSCs and as hole transport material in pero&#8208;SCs.

         <title>Research Progress of Intramolecular &#960;&#8208;Stacked Small Molecules for Device Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike traditional covalent bond&#8208;connected conjugated molecules, &#960;&#8208;stacked small molecules have special advantages in organic semiconductors. This review mainly focuses on the research development of &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular systems and introduces the new characteristics brought by the special molecular configuration and its application in organic semiconductors.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors can be designed and constructed in &#960;&#8208;stacked structures instead of the conventional &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures. Through&#8208;space interaction (TSI) occurs in &#960;&#8208;stacked optoelectronic materials. Thus, unlike electronic coupling along the conjugated chain, the functional groups can stack closely to facilitate spatial electron communication. Using &#960;&#8208;stacked motifs, chemists and materials scientists can find new ways for constructing materials with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), as well as enhanced molecular conductance. Organic optoelectronic devices based on &#960;&#8208;stacked molecules have exhibited very promising performance, with some of them exceeding &#960;&#8208;conjugated analogues. Recently, reports on various organic &#960;&#8208;stacked structures have grown rapidly, prompting this review. Representative molecular scaffolds and newly developed &#960;&#8208;stacked systems could stimulate more attention on through&#8208;space charge transfer the well&#8208;known through&#8208;bond charge transfer. Finally, the opportunities and challenges for utilizing and improving particular materials are discussed. The previous achievements and upcoming prospects may provide new insights into the theory, materials, and devices in the field of organic semiconductors.
