      <title>Simultaneous Piezoelectrocatalytic Hydrogen&#8208;Evolution and Degradation of Water Pollutants by Quartz Microrods@Few&#8208;Layered MoS2 Hierarchical Heterostructures</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel piezoelectrocatalysis system is developed, which involves quartz microrods abundantly decorated with active&#8208;edge&#8208;site MoS2 nanosheets to form a quartz microrods@few&#8208;layered MoS2 hierarchical heterostructure (QMSH). The quartz microrods in QMSH present an internal bias to the MoS2 nanosheets, thus yielding a piezoelectrocatalysis system. An efficient piezoelectrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction and decomposition of wastewater can be achieved simultaneously without light irradiation.








Abstract
Intense light attenuation in water/wastewater results in photocatalysts exhibiting a low quantum efficiency. This study develops a novel piezoelectrocatalysis system, which involves quartz microrods (MRs) abundantly decorated with active&#8208;edge&#8208;site MoS2 nanosheets to form a quartz microrods@few&#8208;layered MoS2 hierarchical heterostructure (QMSH). Through theoretical calculations, it is found that the quartz MRs serve as a parallel&#8208;plate capacitor, which is self&#8208;powered to provide an internal electric field to the few&#8208;layered MoS2 nanosheets surrounding the quartz MR surfaces, and the piezoelectric potential (piezopotential) effectively facilitates redox reactions with the free carriers in MoS2. The self&#8208;powered quartz MRs in the QMSH present an internal bias to the MoS2 nanosheets, thus yielding a piezoelectrocatalysis system. An efficient piezoelectrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction and decomposition of wastewater without light irradiation can be achieved simultaneously. The second&#8208;order rate constant of the QMSH is &#8776;0.631 L mg&#8722;1 min&#8722;1, which is 650&#8208;fold that of quartz MRs, indicating that the piezoelectric heterostructural catalysts display exceptionally high efficiency on piezoelectrocatalytic redox reactions rather than in the piezocatalytic process. The H2&#8208;production rate of QMSH catalysts approaches &#8776;6456 &#181;mo1 g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and peaks at &#8776;16.8 mmol g&#8722;1 in 8 h. The piezoelectrocatalytic process may be a promising method for treating industrial wastewater and producing clean energy.

      <title>An All&#8208;Round Athlete on the Track of Phototheranostics: Subtly Regulating the Balance between Radiative and Nonradiative Decays for Multimodal Imaging&#8208;Guided Synergistic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
An all&#8208;round phototheranostic agent based on a single aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active fluorophore allowing fluorescence imaging (FLI), photoacoustic imaging (PAI), photothermal imaging (PTI), photothermal therapy (PTT), and photodynamic therapy (PDT) is constructed by subtly regulating the balance between radiative and nonradiative excited&#8208;state energy dissipations, which thus actualizes unprecedented performance on near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) FLI&#8208;PAI&#8208;PTI trimodal imaging&#8208;guided PDT&#8211;PTT synergistic therapy.








Abstract
Aiming to achieve versatile phototheranostics with the integrated functionalities of multiple diagnostic imaging and synergistic therapy, the optimum use of dissipated energy through both radiative and nonradiative pathways is definitely appealing, yet a significantly challenging task. To the best of the knowledge, there have been no previous reports on a single molecular species effective at affording all phototheranostic modalities including fluorescence imaging (FLI), photoacoustic imaging (PAI), photothermal imaging (PTI), photodynamic therapy (PDT), and photothermal therapy (PTT). Herein, a simple and highly powerful one&#8208;for&#8208;all phototheranostics based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active fluorophores is tactfully designed and constructed. Thanks to its strong electron donor&#8211;acceptor interaction and finely modulated intramolecular motion, the AIE fluorophore&#8208;based nanoparticles simultaneously exhibit bright near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence emission, efficient reactive oxygen species generation, and high photothermal conversion efficiency upon NIR irradiation, indicating the actualization of a balance between radiative and nonradiative energy dissipations. Furthermore, the unprecedented performance on NIR&#8208;II FLI&#8208;PAI&#8208;PTI trimodal&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided PDT&#8211;PTT synergistic therapy is demonstrated by the precise tumor diagnosis and complete tumor elimination outcomes. This study thus brings a new insight into the development of superior versatile phototheranostics for practical cancer theranostics.

      <title>Steering Hollow Multishelled Structures in Photocatalysis: Optimizing Surface and Mass Transport</title>
      <dc:description>
Following the principal line of energy/mass transfer processes in photocatalysis, the structural and compositional parameters affecting photocatalytic performance of hollow multishell structures (HoMSs) are discussed. Aiming at effective utilizations based on HoMSs in photocatalytic reactions, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategic methods are overviewed, along with a useful guidance for the future research directions of HoMSs photocatalysts.








Abstract
Hollow multishelled structures (HoMSs) provide a promising platform for fabricating photocatalysts, because the unique structure optimizes the effective surface and mass transport, showing enhanced light absorption, optimized mass transport and highly effective active sites exposed. Subsequently, the rational design on HoMS photocatalytsts is elaborated to boost the photocatalytic activity with efforts in all dimensions, from nanoscale to microscale. Breakthroughs in synthetic methodology of HoMSs have greatly evoked the prosperous photocatalytic researches for HoMSs since the developing of sequential templating approach in 2009. The dawn of HoMS photocatalyst is coming after revealing the temporal&#8208;spatial ordering property, which is also discussed in this paper with pioneer works demonstrating the greatly enhanced energy/mass transfer processes. Some insights into the key challenges and perspectives of HoMSs photocatalysts are also discussed. With the reviewed fate and future of HoMSs photocatalysts, hopefully new concepts and innovative works can be inspired to flourish this sun&#8208;rise field.

      <title>Organic Bioelectronics: From Functional Materials to Next&#8208;Generation Devices and Power Sources</title>
      <dc:description>
Conjugated polymers possess a unique set of features ideal for biointerfacing and setting them apart from other materials. This progress report highlights the identifying characteristics of these polymers put to use in bioelectronics and describes how each of these features enable device architectures with unique operation principles and a performance that is beyond the reach of their inorganic counterparts.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) possess a unique set of features setting them apart from other materials. These properties make them ideal when interfacing the biological world electronically.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conjugated polymers (CPs) possess a unique set of features setting them apart from other materials. These properties make them ideal when interfacing the biological world electronically. Their mixed electronic and ionic conductivity can be used to detect weak biological signals, deliver charged bioactive molecules, and mechanically or electrically stimulate tissues. CPs can be functionalized with various (bio)chemical moieties and blend with other functional materials, with the aim of modulating biological responses or endow specificity toward analytes of interest. They can absorb photons and generate electronic charges that are then used to stimulate cells or produce fuels. These polymers also have catalytic properties allowing them to harvest ambient energy and, along with their high capacitances, are promising materials for next&#8208;generation power sources integrated with bioelectronic devices. In this perspective, an overview of the key properties of CPs and examination of operational mechanism of electronic devices that leverage these properties for specific applications in bioelectronics is provided. In addition to discussing the chemical structure&#8211;functionality relationships of CPs applied at the biological interface, the development of new chemistries and form factors that would bring forth next&#8208;generation sensors, actuators, and their power sources, and, hence, advances in the field of organic bioelectronics is described.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>
In article number 1908176, Joshua D. Caldwell, Alexey Y. Nikitin, Pablo Alonso&#8208;Gonz&#225;lez, and co&#8208;workers extract the IR permittivity of the biaxial crystal &#945;&#8208;MoO3 by correlative far&#8208; and near&#8208;field measurements, using FTIR reflectance spectroscopy and s&#8208;SNOM polariton interferometry, thus providing both an accurate permittivity model and a novel approach to extracting dielectric functions of nanomaterials. Moreover, through density functional theory, insights into the vibrational states dictating such permittivity are revealed.

      <title>Cancer Therapy: Selectively Suppressing Tumor Angiogenesis for Targeted Breast Cancer Therapy by Genetically Engineered Phage (Adv. Mater. 29/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Nontoxic phage virus nanofibers are genetically engineered by Mingying Yang, Chuanbin Mao, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2001260 to first home to tumors through the blood circulation and then capture proteins that can promote blood vessel formation in the tumors. The phages are thus able to suppress tumor growth due to the inhibition of the tumor angiogenesis.

      <title>Switchable Cavitation: Switchable Cavitation in Silicone Coatings for Energy&#8208;Saving Cooling and Heating (Adv. Mater. 29/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
A switchable coating is developed by Jiaxi Cui and co&#8208;workers in article number 2000870 for controlling indoor temperature. In the transparent solid state, the coating allows sunlight permeation to induce solar heating to raise the ambient temperature in winter. After being alternated into the porous state, the coating can achieve efficient solar reflection and long&#8208;wave infrared emission to induce a sub&#8208;ambient temperature drop in summer.

      <title>Photodynamic Therapy: A Flexi&#8208;PEGDA Upconversion Implant for Wireless Brain Photodynamic Therapy (Adv. Mater. 29/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
An upconversion biocompatible implant is the first step of translating decades&#8208;old near&#8208;infrared nanotransducer research into wireless phototherapeutic devices that can be implanted underneath the skin. The use of a hydrogel and cladding results in an upconversion optical fiber that is able to upconvert in a flexible manner and even transmit NIR at maximal bending is described by Kah&#8208;Leong Lim, Yong Zhang, Brian K. Kennedy, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2001459. This concept is applicable to various needs of wireless phototherapeutics. With better designs in the future, upconversion implants will be able to be translated from the bench to the bedside.

      <title>Observation of Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect and Exchange Interaction in Topological Insulator/Antiferromagnet Heterostructure</title>
      <dc:description>
Quantum anomalous Hall effect is observed in a magnetic topological insulator/antiferromagnetic chromium oxide heterostructure. In the same material system, magnetic coupling is confirmed between the two thin films based on the observation of exchange bias effect and polarized neutron reflectometry result.








Abstract
Integration of a quantum anomalous Hall insulator with a magnetically ordered material provides an additional degree of freedom through which the resulting exotic quantum states can be controlled. Here, an experimental observation is reported of the quantum anomalous Hall effect in a magnetically&#8208;doped topological insulator grown on the antiferromagnetic insulator Cr2O3. The exchange coupling between the two materials is investigated using field&#8208;cooling&#8208;dependent magnetometry and polarized neutron reflectometry. Both techniques reveal strong interfacial interaction between the antiferromagnetic order of the Cr2O3 and the magnetic topological insulator, manifested as an exchange bias when the sample is field&#8208;cooled under an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetic field, and an exchange spring&#8208;like magnetic depth profile when the system is magnetized within the film plane. These results identify antiferromagnetic insulators as suitable candidates for the manipulation of magnetic and topological order in topological insulator films.

      <title>Recent Developments in Cellulose Nanomaterial Composites</title>
      <dc:description>
Cellulose nanomaterial (CNM) composites are sustainable and can compete on strength and stiffness with traditional materials. Unfortunately, research has tended to be more basic&#8208;science oriented rather than commercially applicable, so there are few CNM&#8208;enabled products on the market today. Efforts are presented for preparing and forming cellulose nanomaterial nanocomposites in manners practical to commercialization.








Abstract
Cellulose nanomaterials (CNMs) are a class of materials that have recently garnered attention in fields as varied as structural materials, biomaterials, rheology modifiers, construction, paper enhancement, and others. As the principal structural reinforcement of biomass giving wood its mechanical properties, CNM is strong and stiff, but also nontoxic, biodegradable, and sustainable with a very large (Gton yr&#8722;1) source. Unfortunately, due to the relatively young nature of the field and inherent incompatibility of CNM with most man&#8208;made materials in use today, research has tended to be more basic&#8208;science oriented rather than commercially applicable, so there are few CNM&#8208;enabled products on the market today. Herein, efforts are presented for preparing and forming cellulose nanomaterial nanocomposites. The focus is on recent efforts attempting to mitigate common impediments to practical commercialization but is also placed in context with traditional efforts. The work is presented in terms of the progress made, and still to be made, on solving the most pressing challenges&#8212;getting properties that are competitive with currently used materials, removing organic solvent, solving the inherent incompatibility between CNM and polymers of interest, and incorporation into commonly used industrial processing techniques.

      <title>Wafer&#8208;Scale High&#8208;Quality Microtubular Devices Fabricated via Dry&#8208;Etching for Optical and Microelectronic Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Microdevices based on rolled&#8208;up nanomembranes are obtained at high yield and reproducibility utilizing a dry&#8208;release scheme based on SF6 plasma release. The high quality of the obtained electrical and optical devices is demonstrated by the simultaneous formation of high&#8208;performance rolled&#8208;up capacitors at wafer scale as well as by record&#8208;breaking rolled&#8208;up optical whispering gallery mode resonators.








Abstract
Mechanical strain formed at the interfaces of thin films has been widely applied to self&#8208;assemble 3D microarchitectures. Among them, rolled&#8208;up microtubes possess a unique 3D geometry beneficial for working as photonic, electromagnetic, energy storage, and sensing devices. However, the yield and quality of microtubular architectures are often limited by the wet&#8208;release of lithographically patterned stacks of thin&#8208;film structures. To address the drawbacks of conventionally used wet&#8208;etching methods in self&#8208;assembly techniques, here a dry&#8208;release approach is developed to roll&#8208;up both metallic and dielectric, as well as metallic/dielectric hybrid thin films for the fabrication of electronic and optical devices. A silicon thin film sacrificial layer on insulator is etched by dry fluorine chemistry, triggering self&#8208;assembly of prestrained nanomembranes in a well&#8208;controlled wafer scale fashion. More than 6000 integrated microcapacitors as well as hundreds of active microtubular optical cavities are obtained in a simultaneous self&#8208;assembly process. The fabrication of wafer&#8208;scale self&#8208;assembled microdevices results in high yield, reproducibility, uniformity, and performance, which promise broad applications in microelectronics, photonics, and opto&#8208;electronics.

      <title>Coupling a Sponge Metal Fibers Skeleton with In Situ Surface Engineering to Achieve Advanced Electrodes for Flexible Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A flexible 3D sponge nickel fibers skeleton plus in situ surface engineering strategy is developed to inhibit dendrite formation and polysulfide shuttling synergistically. The as&#8208;obtained electrodes exhibit exceptional electrochemical performance, confirmed by electric field simulations and theory calculations. Moreover, boosted cell performance is demonstrated in an assembled flexible lithium&#8211;sulfur battery device.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are regarded as promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems, however, the uncontrollable dendrite formation and serious polysulfide shuttling severely hinder their commercial success. Herein, a powerful 3D sponge nickel (SN) skeleton plus in situ surface engineering strategy, to address these issues synergistically, is reported, and a high&#8208;performance flexible LSB device is constructed. Specifically, the rationally designed spray&#8208;quenched lithium metal on the SN matrix (solid electrolyte interface (SEI)@Li/SN), as dendrite inhibitor, combines the merits of the 3D lithiophilic SN skeleton and the in situ formed SEI layer derived from the spray&#8208;quenching process, and thereby exhibits a steady overpotential within 75 mV for 1500 h at 5 mA cm&#8722;2/10 mA h cm&#8722;2. Meanwhile, in situ surface sulfurization of the SN skeleton hybridizing with the carbon/sulfur composite (SC@Ni3S2/SN) serves as efficient lithium polysulfide adsorbent to catalyze the overall reaction kinetics. COMSOL Multiphysics simulations and density functional theory calculations are further conducted to explore the underlying mechanisms. As a proof of concept, the well&#8208;designed SEI@Li/SN||SC@Ni3S2/SN full cell shows excellent electrochemical performance with a negative/positive ratio in capacity of &#8776;2 and capacity retention of 99.82% at 1 C under mechanical deformation. The novel design principles of these materials and electrodes successfully shed new light on the development of flexible LSBs.

      <title>A Transparent, Skin&#8208;Inspired Composite Film with Outstanding Tear Resistance Based on Flat Silk Cocoon</title>
      <dc:description>
A transparent, skin&#8208;inspired composite film is fabricated based on a flat silk cocoon and epoxy resin. The as&#8208;prepared fiber&#8208;reinforced film shows outstanding tear resistance because the silk fiber network successfully reduces stress concentration at the crack tip and suppresses crack propagation. Such composite films can also be used as mechanically robust supporting substrates for flexible electronics.








Abstract
Flexible and transparent substrates play a fundamental role as a mechanical support in advanced electronic devices. However, commonly used polymer films, such as polydimethylsiloxane, show low tear resistance because of their crack sensitivity. Herein, inspired by the excellent mechanical robustness of the skin and its fibrous structure, an epoxy&#8208;resin&#8208;based composite with a flat silk cocoon as a reinforcing fiber network is fabricated. With only 1 wt% of silk fiber, the tensile strength and modulus of the as&#8208;prepared composite film are considerably increased by 300% and 612% compared to those of pure resin, while still maintaining flexibility and transparency. More importantly, the composite shows remarkable tear resistance: without fracture after &#8776;30 000 tensile cycles. The potential application of such transparent composite films as mechanically robust substrates for flexible electronics is also demonstrated. In addition, this study represents a bioinspired strategy to construct high&#8208;performance functional composite materials.

     alt="A Transparent, Skin&#8208;Inspired Composite Film with Outstanding Tear Resistance Based on Flat Silk Cocoon"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A transparent, skin&#8208;inspired composite film is fabricated based on a flat silk cocoon and epoxy resin. The as&#8208;prepared fiber&#8208;reinforced film shows outstanding tear resistance because the silk fiber network successfully reduces stress concentration at the crack tip and suppresses crack propagation. Such composite films can also be used as mechanically robust supporting substrates for flexible electronics.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexible and transparent substrates play a fundamental role as a mechanical support in advanced electronic devices. However, commonly used polymer films, such as polydimethylsiloxane, show low tear resistance because of their crack sensitivity. Herein, inspired by the excellent mechanical robustness of the skin and its fibrous structure, an epoxy&#8208;resin&#8208;based composite with a flat silk cocoon as a reinforcing fiber network is fabricated. With only 1 wt% of silk fiber, the tensile strength and modulus of the as&#8208;prepared composite film are considerably increased by 300% and 612% compared to those of pure resin, while still maintaining flexibility and transparency. More importantly, the composite shows remarkable tear resistance: without fracture after &#8776;30 000 tensile cycles. The potential application of such transparent composite films as mechanically robust substrates for flexible electronics is also demonstrated. In addition, this study represents a bioinspired strategy to construct high&#8208;performance functional composite materials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quantum Dots of [Na4Cs6PbBr4]8+, Water Stable in Zeolite X, Luminesce Sharply in the Green</title>
      <dc:description>
Partially Cs+&#8208;exchanged zeolite X treated with PbBr2 is a water&#8208;stable green&#8208;emitting phosphor. Quantum dots of formula [Na4Cs6PbBr4]8+ occupy its supercages. The FWHM of its emission is ultra&#8208;narrow, only about 17.6 nm. This is narrower than those of any of the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals and any of the &#8220;CsPbBr3 QDs&#8221; that have been introduced into various porous materials.








Abstract
Nanocrystals (NCs) of CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, or I, have excellent photoluminescent properties: high quantum yield, tunable emission wavelengths (410&#8722;700 nm), and narrow emission band widths. CsPbBr3 NCs show high promise as a green&#8208;emitting material for use in wide color gamut displays. CsPbBr3 NCs have, however, not been commercialized because they are sensitive to moisture and heat. To avoid these problems, this work attempts to introduce CsPbBr3 into five zeolites. The zeolite X product, Pb,Br,H,Cs,Na&#8722;X, shows superior stability toward moisture, maintaining its initial luminescence properties after being under water for more than a month. Its structure, determined using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, shows that quantum dots (QDs) of [Na4Cs6PbBr4]8+ (not of CsPbBr3) have formed. They are tetrahedral PbBr42&#8722; ions (Pb&#8722;Br = 3.091(11) &#197;) surrounded by Na+ and Cs+ ions. Each fills the zeolite's supercage with its Pb2+ ion precisely at the center, a position of high symmetry. The peaks in the emission spectra of Pb,Br,H,Cs,Na&#8722;X and the CsPbBr3 NCs are both at about 520 nm. The FWHM of Pb,Br,H,Cs,Na&#8722;X, however, is narrower than any previously reported for any of the CsPbBr3 NCs, and for zeolite Y and the various mesoporous materials treated with CsPbBr3.

      <title>Ultralow&#8208;Transition&#8208;Energy Organic Complex on Graphene for High&#8208;Performance Shortwave Infrared Photodetection</title>
      <dc:description>
Addressing the challenge of room&#8208;temperature high&#8208;sensitivity photodetection in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) region, a novel SWIR absorbing organic charge transfer complex on a graphene transistor device with the photogating effect at the tetrathiafulvalene&#8211;chloranil/graphene interface is reported. It exhibits a tunable, high&#8208;speed, broadband vis&#8211;SWIR photoresponse and high specific detectivity (up to &#8776;1013 Jones) at a wavelength of 2 &#181;m.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;sensitivity, and broadband photodetection up to the shortwave infrared (SWIR) region is extremely significant for a wide variety of optoelectronic applications, including contamination identification, thermal imaging, night vision, agricultural inspection, and atmospheric remote sensing. Small&#8208;bandgap semiconductor&#8208;based SWIR photodetectors generally require deep cooling to suppress thermally generated charge carriers to achieve increased sensitivity. Meanwhile, the photogating effect can provide an alternative way to achieve superior photosensitivity without the need for cooling. The optical photogating effect originates from charge trapping of photoinduced carriers at defects or interfaces, resulting in an extremely high photogain (106 or higher). Here, a highly sensitive SWIR hybrid photodetector, fabricated by integrating an organic charge transfer complex on a graphene transistor, is reported. The organic charge transfer complex (tetrathiafulvalene&#8211;chloranil) has an exceptional low&#8208;energy intermolecular electronic transition down to 0.5 eV, with the aim of achieving efficient SWIR absorption for wavelengths greater than 2 &#181;m. The photogating effect at the organic complex and graphene interface enables an extremely high photogain and a high detectivity of &#8776;1013 Jones, along with a response time of 8 ms, at room temperature for a wavelength of 2 &#181;m.

      <title>Engineering the Phases and Heterostructures of Ultrathin Hybrid Perovskite Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>
Ultrathin hybrid perovskite nanosheets are synthesized&#160;based on lead iodide templates. Multiple phases, such as PbI2, MAPbI3 and FAPbI3, are flexibly designed and transformed as a single nanosheet through efficient cation exchange.

Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional perovskites have gained increasing attention recently, and engineering their material phases, structural patterning and interfacial properties is crucial for future perovskite&#8208;based applications. Here a phase and heterostructure engineering on ultrathin perovskites, through the reversible cation exchange of hybrid perovskites and efficient surface functionalization of low&#8208;dimensional materials, is demonstrated. Using PbI2 as precursor and template, perovskite nanosheets of varying thickness and hexagonal shape on diverse substrates is obtained. Multiple phases, such as PbI2, MAPbI3 and FAPbI3, can be flexibly designed and transformed as a single nanosheet. A perovskite nanosheet can be patterned using masks made of 2D materials, fabricating lateral heterostructures of perovskite and PbI2. Perovskite&#8208;based vertical heterostructures show strong interfacial coupling with 2D materials. As a demonstration, monolayer MoS2/MAPbI3 stacks give a type&#8208;II heterojunction. The ability to combine the optically efficient perovskites with versatile 2D materials creates possibilities for new designs and functionalities.

      <title>Emerging Nanocellulose Technologies: Recent Developments</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanocelluloses have unique morphologies, characteristics, and surface nanostructures, and are prepared from abundant and renewable plant biomass resources. Nanocelluloses can be categorized into cellulose nanonetworks, cellulose nanofibrils, and cellulose nanocrystals, depending on their morphologies. Cellulose nanofibrils have significant amounts of charged groups on their surfaces. These surface&#8208;charged groups can be stoichiometrically counterion&#8208;exchanged to diverse metal and alkylammonium ions.








Abstract
Nanocelluloses have unique morphologies, characteristics, and surface nanostructures, and are prepared from abundant and renewable plant biomass resources. Therefore, expansion of the use of CO2&#8208;accumulating nanocelluloses is expected to partly contribute to the establishment of a sustainable society and help overcome current global environmental issues. Nanocelluloses can be categorized into cellulose nanonetworks, cellulose nanofibrils, and cellulose nanocrystals, depending on their morphologies. All of these materials are first obtained as aqueous dispersions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanocelluloses have unique morphologies, characteristics, and surface nanostructures, and are prepared from abundant and renewable plant biomass resources. Therefore, expansion of the use of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;accumulating nanocelluloses is expected to partly contribute to the establishment of a sustainable society and help overcome current global environmental issues. Nanocelluloses can be categorized into cellulose nanonetworks, cellulose nanofibrils, and cellulose nanocrystals, depending on their morphologies. All of these materials are first obtained as aqueous dispersions. In particular, cellulose nanofibrils have homogeneous &#8776;3 nm widths and average lengths of &amp;gt;500 nm, and significant amounts of charged groups are present on their surfaces. Such charged groups are formed by carboxymethylation, C6&#8208;carboxylation, phosphorylation, phosphite esterification, xanthation, sulfate esterification, and C2/C3 dicarboxylation during the pretreatment of plant cellulose fibers before their conversion into cellulose nanofibrils via mechanical disintegration in water. These surface&#8208;charged groups in nanocelluloses can be stoichiometrically counterion&#8208;exchanged into diverse metal and alkylammonium ions, resulting in surface&#8208;modified nanocelluloses with various new functions including hydrophobic, water&#8208;resistant, catalytic, superdeodorant, and gas&#8208;separation properties.

      <title>On&#8208;Demand Bacterial Reactivation by Restraining within a Triggerable Nanocoating</title>
      <dc:description>
Bacteria being tailored to perform therapeutic effects precisely in the right place at the right time to avoid potential side effects is important but has proven to be challenging. Here, a strategy of on&#8208;demand bacterial reactivation is described by restraining within a triggerable nanocoating. Upon reaching at a location of interest, the bacteria can be liberated to reactivate as needed.








Abstract
Bacteria have been widely exploited as bioagents for applications in diagnosis and treatment, benefitting from their living characteristics including colonization, rapid proliferation, and facile genetic manipulation. As such, bacteria being tailored to perform precisely in the right place at the right time to avoid potential side effects would be of great importance but has proven to be difficult. Here, a strategy of on&#8208;demand bacterial reactivation is described by individually restraining within a triggerable nanocoating. Upon reaching at a location of interest, nanocoatings can be triggered to dissolution in situ and subsequently decoat the bacteria which are able to recover their bioactivities as needed. It is demonstrated that gut microbiota coated with an enteric nanocoating can respond to gastrointestinal environments and reactivate in the intestine by a pH&#8208;triggered decoating. In virtue of this unique, coated bacteria remain inactive following oral administration to exempt acidic insults, while revive to restore therapeutic effects after gastric emptying. Consequently, improved oral availability and treatment efficacy are achieved in two mouse models of intestinal infection. Bacteria restrained by a triggerable nanocoating represent a smart therapeutic that can take effect when necessary. On&#8208;demand bacterial reactivation suggests a robust platform for the development of precision bacterial&#8208;mediated bioagents.

      <title>Crystal&#8211;Glass High&#8208;Entropy Nanocomposites with Near Theoretical Compressive Strength and Large Deformability</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel crystal&#8211;glass high&#8208;entropy nanocomposite with near theoretical yield strength and large deformability is achieved by controlling both the stacking fault energy in the high&#8208;entropy nanotwinned crystalline phase and the glass&#8208;forming&#8208;ability in the metallic glass phase. The mutually compatible flow behavior of the glass phase and the dislocation flux in the crystals enable homogeneous plastic co&#8208;deformation of the two regions.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) and metallic glasses (MGs) are two material classes based on the massive mixing of multiple&#8208;principal elements. HEAs are single or multiphase crystalline solid solutions with high ductility. MGs with amorphous structure have superior strength but usually poor ductility. Here, the stacking fault energy in the high&#8208;entropy nanotwinned crystalline phase and the glass&#8208;forming&#8208;ability in the MG phase of the same material are controlled, realizing a novel nanocomposite with near theoretical yield strength (G/24, where G is the shear modulus of a material) and homogeneous plastic strain above 45% in compression. The mutually compatible flow behavior of the MG phase and the dislocation flux in the crystals enable homogeneous plastic co&#8208;deformation of the two regions. This crystal&#8211;glass high&#8208;entropy nanocomposite design concept provides a new approach to developing advanced materials with an outstanding combination of strength and ductility.

      <title>Enhanced and Balanced Charge Transport Boosting Ternary Solar Cells Over 17% Efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>
A highly efficient organic solar cell with a ternary architecture is successfully demonstrated by enhancing and balancing charge transport as well as matching integer charge transfer energy in bulk heterojunction blend. As a result, a power conversion efficiency of 17.13% is obtained with the significantly improved fill factor of 0.813.








Abstract
Ternary architecture is one of the most effective strategies to boost the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, an OSC with a ternary architecture featuring a highly crystalline molecular donor DRTB&#8208;T&#8208;C4 as a third component to the host binary system consisting of a polymer donor PM6 and a nonfullerene acceptor Y6 is reported. The third component is used to achieve enhanced and balanced charge transport, contributing to an improved fill factor (FF) of 0.813 and yielding an impressive PCE of 17.13%. The heterojunctions are designed using so&#8208;called pinning energies to promote exciton separation and reduce recombination loss. In addition, the preferential location of DRTB&#8208;T&#8208;C4 at the interface between PM6 and Y6 plays an important role in optimizing the morphology of the active layer.

      <title>Cellular Structured CNTs@SiO2 Nanofibrous Aerogels with Vertically Aligned Vessels for Salt&#8208;Resistant Solar Desalination</title>
      <dc:description>
Salt&#8208;resistant carbon nanotubes@SiO2 nanofibrous aerogels with vertically aligned vessels and porous vessel walls are fabricated for solar desalination. Because of this structure, aerogels have excellent salt&#8208;resistance without salt crystal on the surface even in 20% brine and 6&#8208;sun irradiation. Moreover, this material exhibits a light absorbance of 98% and an evaporation rate of 1.50 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under 1&#8208;sun irradiation.








Abstract
The emerging solar desalination technology is considered as one of the most promising strategies to ensure water security. However, with the proceeding of solar desalination, salt crystallization on the surface of solar evaporators caused by increasing salinity of seawater will result in a decrease in the evaporation rate. Thus, it is still challenging to fabricate solar evaporators with superior salt resistance. In this work, elastic ceramic&#8208;based nanofibrous aerogels with a cellular architecture are fabricated by the combination of electrospinning and fiber freeze&#8208;shaping technologies, which are composed of vertically aligned vessels and porous vessel walls. Under the action of convection and diffusion promoted by this unique cellular architecture, the aerogels exhibit a superior salt&#8208;resistance without any salt crystals on the surface of aerogels even in 20% brine and under 6&#8208;sun irradiation. Moreover, by virtue of the synergistic effect of the promising structure and light absorbance of carbon nanotubes, aerogels possess a high light absorbance of up to 98% and excellent evaporation performance achieving 1.50 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under 1&#8208;sun irradiation. This work may provide a fascinating avenue for the desalination of seawater in a salt&#8208;resistance and efficient manner.

      <dc:description>
A facile and general PCP strategy is developed to synthesize SAS catalysts. This PCP strategy can be expended to synthesize a series of SAS catalysts including SAS&#8208;Fe, SAS&#8208;Ni, SAS&#8208;Cu, SAS&#8208;Zn, SAS&#8208;Ru, SAS&#8208;Rh, SAS&#8208;Pd, SAS&#8208;Pt, and SAS&#8208;Ir.

Abstract
Single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site (SAS) catalysts, a new frontier of catalysts, always show extremely high atom efficiency and unexpected catalytic properties. Herein, a pyrolyzing coordinated polymer (PCP) strategy is developed, which is facile and widely applicable in the synthesis of a series of SAS catalysts including SAS&#8208;Fe, SAS&#8208;Ni, SAS&#8208;Cu, SAS&#8208;Zn, SAS&#8208;Ru, SAS&#8208;Rh, SAS&#8208;Pd, SAS&#8208;Pt, and SAS&#8208;Ir. The as&#8208;obtained SAS catalysts can be easily synthesized at gram scale and the metal loading of SAS&#8208;Fe catalysts achieves a record value of 30 wt%, which meets the requirement of practical applications. Moreover, it is discovered that SAS&#8208;Fe catalysts show unprecedented catalytic performance for epoxidation of styrene using O2 as the only oxidant (yield: 64%; selectivity: 89%), while Fe nanoparticles and ironporphyrin are inactive. This discovery is believed to pave the way for exploiting the unparalleled properties of SAS catalysts and promoting their industrial applications.

&lt;p&gt;Single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site (SAS) catalysts, a new frontier of catalysts, always show extremely high atom efficiency and unexpected catalytic properties. Herein, a pyrolyzing coordinated polymer (PCP) strategy is developed, which is facile and widely applicable in the synthesis of a series of SAS catalysts including SAS&#8208;Fe, SAS&#8208;Ni, SAS&#8208;Cu, SAS&#8208;Zn, SAS&#8208;Ru, SAS&#8208;Rh, SAS&#8208;Pd, SAS&#8208;Pt, and SAS&#8208;Ir. The as&#8208;obtained SAS catalysts can be easily synthesized at gram scale and the metal loading of SAS&#8208;Fe catalysts achieves a record value of 30 wt%, which meets the requirement of practical applications. Moreover, it is discovered that SAS&#8208;Fe catalysts show unprecedented catalytic performance for epoxidation of styrene using O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the only oxidant (yield: 64%; selectivity: 89%), while Fe nanoparticles and ironporphyrin are inactive. This discovery is believed to pave the way for exploiting the unparalleled properties of SAS catalysts and promoting their industrial applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recent Progress in High&#8208;Strength and Robust Regenerated Cellulose Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Rengenerated cellulose materials with the forms of films/membranes, fibers, hydrogels, aerogels, beads/microspheres can be designed via chemical crosslinking, chemically dual&#8208;crosslinking, physical crosslinking, chemically and physically double crosslinking for achieving the high strength and bidegradability.

Abstract
High&#8208;strength petroleum&#8208;based materials like plastics have been widely used in various fields, but their nonbiodegradability has caused serious pollution problems. Cellulose, as the most abundant sustainable polymer, has a great chance to act as the ideal substitute for plastics due to its low cost, wide availability, biodegradability, etc. Herein, the recent achievements for developing cellulose &#8220;green&#8221; solvents and regenerated cellulose materials with high strength via the &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; route are presented. Cellulose can be regenerated to produce films/membranes, hydrogels/aerogels, filaments/fibers, microspheres/beads, bioplastics, etc., which show potential applications in textiles, biomedicine, energy storage, packaging, etc. Importantly, these cellulose&#8208;based materials can be biodegraded in soil and oceans, reducing environmental pollution. The cellulose solvents, dissolving mechanism, and strategies for constructing the regenerated cellulose functional materials with high strength and performances, together with the current achievements and urgent challenges are summarized, and some perspectives are also proposed. The near future will be an exciting era for high&#8208;strength biodegradable and renewable materials. The hope is that many environmentally friendly materials with good properties and low cost will be produced for commercial use, which will be beneficial for sustainable development in the world.

      <title>Perovskite&#8208;Type Solid Solution Nano&#8208;Electrocatalysts Enable Simultaneously Enhanced Activity and Stability for Oxygen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
The importance of synergistic optimization of bulk and surface properties for breaking inverse relation of catalytic activity and structural stability of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst, with SrIrO3 as a model material, is demonstrated. An alloying strategy is presented to achieve this goal and results in a high&#8208;performance SrZrO3&#8211;SrIrO3 solid&#8208;solution electrocatalyst for the acidic OER.








Abstract
A trade&#8208;off between catalytic activity and structural stability generally exists in oxygen evolution electrocatalysis, especially in acidic environment. This dilemma limits the development of higher&#8208;performance electrocatalysts that are required by next&#8208;generation electrochemical technologies. Here it is demonstrated that the inverse catalytic activity&#8211;structural stability relation can be broken by alloying catalytically inert strontium zirconate with the other catalytically active perovskite, strontium iridate. This strategy results in an alloyed perovskite electrocatalyst with simultaneously improved iridium mass activity and structural stability, by about five times, for the oxygen evolution reaction under acidic conditions. The experimental and theoretical results suggest that the alloying strategy generates multiple positive effects, mainly including the reduction of catalyst size, the decrease of catalyst covalency, and the weakening of surface oxygen&#8208;binding ability. The synergistic optimization of bulk and surface properties, as a result, enhances the intrinsic activity and availability of surface iridium sites, whilst significantly inhibiting the surface cation corrosion during electrocatalysis.

      <title>The True Amphipathic Nature of Graphene Flakes: A Versatile 2D Stabilizer</title>
      <dc:description>
Pristine graphene flakes are 2D amphiphiles with well&#8208;defined hydrophilic edges and hydrophobic basal plane surfaces, the interplay of which allows small flakes to be utilized as stabilizers. The interactions between flakes can be controlled by varying the flake size and the oil&#8208;to&#8208;water ratio. Pristine graphene flakes can stabilize water/oil emulsions even under high pressure, high temperature, and in saline solutions.








Abstract
The fundamental colloidal properties of pristine graphene flakes remain incompletely understood, with conflicting reports about their chemical character, hindering potential applications that could exploit the extraordinary electronic, thermal, and mechanical properties of graphene. Here, the true amphipathic nature of pristine graphene flakes is demonstrated through wet&#8208;chemistry testing, optical microscopy, electron microscopy, and density functional theory, molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo calculations, and it is shown how this fact paves the way for the formation of ultrastable water/oil emulsions. In contrast to commonly used graphene oxide flakes, pristine graphene flakes possess well&#8208;defined hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions: the basal plane and edges, respectively, the interplay of which allows small flakes to be utilized as stabilizers with an amphipathic strength that depends on the edge&#8208;to&#8208;surface ratio. The interactions between flakes can be also controlled by varying the oil&#8208;to&#8208;water ratio. In addition, it is predicted that graphene flakes can be efficiently used as a new&#8208;generation stabilizer that is active under high pressure, high temperature, and in saline solutions, greatly enhancing the efficiency and functionality of applications based on this&#160;material.

Abstract
Asymmetric catalysis is one of the most attractive strategies to obtain important enantiomerically pure chemicals with high quality and production. In addition, thanks to the abundant and sustainable advantages of solar energy, photocatalysis possesses great potential in environmentally benign reactions. Undoubtedly, asymmetric photocatalysis meets the strict demand of modern chemistry: environmentally friendly and energy&#8208;sustainable alternatives. Compared with homogeneous asymmetric photocatalysis, heterogeneous catalysis has features of easy separation, recovery, and reuse merits, thus being cost&#8208; and time&#8208;effective. Herein, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress in asymmetric photocatalysis by heterogeneous nanomaterials is addressed. The discussion comprises two sections based on the type of nanomaterials: typical inorganic semiconductors like TiO2 and quantum dots and emerging porous materials including metal&#8211;organic frameworks, porous organic polymers, and organic cages. Finally, the challenges and future developments of heterogeneous asymmetric photocatalysis are proposed.

      <dc:description>
Here, the application of microfine design in metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) structures and their influence on properties are summarized in five aspects including size effect, counterions, functional groups, metal diversities, and defects. The differences and connections between each regulation methods are discussed. Finally, current challenges and perspectives in microfine design are also presented. 








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as an important and unique class of functional crystalline hybrid porous materials in the past two decades. Due to their modular structures and adjustable pore system, such distinctive materials have exhibited remarkable prospects in key applications pertaining to adsorption such as gas storage, gas and liquid separations, and trace impurity removal. Evidently, gaining a better understanding of the structure&#8211;property relationship offers great potential for the enhancement of a given associated MOF property either by structural adjustments via isoreticular chemistry or by the design and construction of new MOF structures via the practice of reticular chemistry. Correspondingly, the application of isoreticular chemistry paves the way for the microfine design and structure regulation of presented MOFs. Explicitly, the microfine tuning is mainly based on known MOF platforms, focusing on the modification and/or functionalization of a precise part of the MOF structure or pore system, thus providing an effective approach to produce richer pore systems with enhanced performances from a limited number of MOF platforms. Here, the latest progress in this field is highlighted by emphasizing the differences and connections between various methods. Finally, the challenges together with prospects are also discussed.

      <title>Advanced Electrocatalysis for Energy and Environmental Sustainability via Water and Nitrogen Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Electrocatalysis associated with sustainable water (oxygen evolution and reduction reactions) and nitrogen (nitrogen reduction and ammonia oxidation reactions) cycles for energy conversion applications, which is important but challenging, is highlighted. Advanced catalysts, along with optimal electrolytes and electrode fabrication, are crucial for these corresponding clean energy technologies, including water PEM electrolyzers, hydrogen fuel cells, ammonia electrosynthesis, and direct ammonia fuel cells.








Abstract
Clean and efficient energy storage and conversion via sustainable water and nitrogen reactions have attracted substantial attention to address the energy and environmental issues due to the overwhelming use of fossil fuels. These electrochemical reactions are crucial for desirable clean energy technologies, including advanced water electrolyzers, hydrogen fuel cells, and ammonia electrosynthesis and utilization. Their sluggish reaction kinetics lead to inefficient energy conversion. Innovative electrocatalysis, i.e., catalysis at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte to facilitate charge transfer and mass transport, plays a vital role in boosting energy conversion efficiency and providing sufficient performance and durability for these energy technologies. Herein, a comprehensive review on recent progress, achievements, and remaining challenges for these electrocatalysis processes related to water (i.e., oxygen evolution reaction, OER, and oxygen reduction reaction, ORR) and nitrogen (i.e., nitrogen reduction reaction, NRR, for ammonia synthesis and ammonia oxidation reaction, AOR, for energy utilization) is provided. Catalysts, electrolytes, and interfaces between the two within electrodes for these electrocatalysis processes are discussed. The primary emphasis is device performance of OER&#8208;related proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, ORR&#8208;related PEM fuel cells, NRR&#8208;driven ammonia electrosynthesis from water and nitrogen, and AOR&#8208;related direct ammonia fuel cells.

      <title>A Bifunctional Photo&#8208;Assisted Li&#8211;O2 Battery Based on a Hierarchical Heterostructured Cathode</title>
      <dc:description>
A bifunctional photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8211;O2 system is established by employing a hierarchical TiO2&#8211;Fe2O3 heterojunction cathode. Photoexcited electrons participate in the oxygen reduction reaction process, and the morphology of the discharge products can be tuned for facile oxygen evolution reaction kinetics. Thus, an ultralow overpotential of 0.19 V between discharge and charge plateau with excellent cyclic stability is achieved.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;assisted charging is considered an effective approach to reducing the overpotential in lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries. However, the utilization of photoenergy during the discharge process in a Li&#8211;O2 system has been rarely reported, and the functional mechanism of such a process remains unclear. Herein, a novel bifunctional photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8211;O2 system is established by employing a hierarchical TiO2&#8211;Fe2O3 heterojunction, in which the photo&#8208;generated electrons and holes play key roles in reducing the overpotential in the discharging and charging processes, respectively. Moreover, the morphology of the discharge product (Li2O2) can be modified via the dense surface electrons of the cathode under illumination, resulting in promoted decomposition kinetics of Li2O2 during the charging progress. Accordingly, the output and input energies of the battery can be tuned by illumination, giving an ultralow overpotential of 0.19 V between the charge and discharge plateaus with excellent cyclic stability (retaining a round&#8208;trip efficiency of &#8776;86% after 100 cycles). The investigation of the bifunctional photo&#8208;assisted process presented here provides significant insight into the mechanism of the photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8211;O2 battery and addresses the overpotential bottleneck in this system.

      <title>Photoactivatable Protherapeutic Nanomedicine for Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>
The recent progress of photoactivatable protherapeutic nanoagents in cancer therapy is reviewed. Protherapeutic nanoagents are defined to have the ability to respond to light, reactive oxygen species, or heat modulated by nanotransducers upon light irradiation, and subsequently activate the pharmaceutical actions. Such an in situ activation mechanism holds the potential to enhance therapeutic efficacy while reducing systemic toxicity of nanomedicines.








Abstract
Therapeutic systems with site&#8208;specific pharmaceutical activation hold great promise to enhance therapeutic efficacy while reducing systemic toxicity in cancer therapy. With operational flexibility, noninvasiveness, and high spatiotemporal resolution, photoactivatable nanomedicines have drawn growing attention. Distinct from traditional controlled release systems relying on the difference of biomarker concentrations between disease and healthy tissues, photoactivatable nanomedicines capitalize on the interaction between nanotransducers and light to either trigger photochemical reactions or generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) or heat effect to remotely induce pharmaceutical actions in living subjects. Herein, the recent advances in the development of photoactivatable protherapeutic nanoagents for oncology are summarized. The design strategies and therapeutic applications of these nanoagents are described. Representative examples of each type are discussed in terms of structure, photoactivation mechanism, and preclinical models. Last, potential challenges and perspectives to further develop photoactivatable protherapeutic nanoagents in cancer nanomedicine are discussed.

      <dc:description>
Cobalt has become a critical constraint on the supply chain of the Li&#8208;ion battery industry due to the dependency of current Li&#8208;ion batteries on the ever&#8208;fluctuating cobalt prices.

Abstract
In recent years, cobalt has become a critical constraint on the supply chain of the Li&#8208;ion battery industry. With the ever&#8208;increasing projections for electric vehicles, the dependency of current Li&#8208;ion batteries on the ever&#8208;fluctuating cobalt prices poses serious environmental and sustainability issues. To address these challenges, a new class of cobalt&#8208;free materials with general formula of LiNixFeyAlzO2 (x + y + z = 1), termed as the lithium iron aluminum nickelate (NFA) class of cathodes, is introduced. These cobalt&#8208;free materials are synthesized using the sol&#8211;gel process to explore their compositional landscape by varying aluminum and iron. These NFA variants are characterized using electron microscopy, neutron and X&#8208;ray diffraction, and M&#246;ssbauer and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy to investigate their morphological, physical, and crystal&#8208;structure properties. Operando experiments by X&#8208;ray diffraction, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, and galvanostatic intermittent titration have been also used to study the crystallographic transitions, electrochemical activity, and Li&#8208;ion diffusivity upon lithium removal and uptake in the NFA cathodes. NFA compositions yield specific capacities of &#8776;200 mAh g&#8722;1, demonstrating reasonable rate capability and cycling stability with &#8776;80% capacity retention after 100 charge/discharge cycles. While this is an early stage of research, the potential that these cathodes could have as viable candidates in next&#8208;generation cobalt&#8208;free lithium&#8208;ion batteries is highlighted here.

Practical, ultrathin metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membranes have the potential to achieve otherwise difficult separations, but current fabrication methods still face challenges in the simultaneous improvement of both selectivity and permeance. Here, ultrathin, low&#8208;crystallinity&#8208;state MOF (LC&#8208;MOF) membranes are realized by a facile general method of interface layer polarization induction. This is achieved using an interface layer having metal ions with dense and uniform distribution, resulting in the creation of abundant open metal sites. Three types of LC&#8208;MOF membranes (45&#8211;150 nm) are fabricated, among which ZIF&#8208;8 membranes modified in situ with diethanolamine (DZIF&#8208;8) display the best performance for propylene/propane separation, showing unprecedented propylene permeance (2000&#8211;3000 Gas Permeance Units) with very high propylene/propane selectivity (90&#8211;120).

      <title>Active Site Engineering in Porous Electrocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
Porous electrocatalysts are the most popular class of materials that can provide a large density of accessible active sites and efficient mass transport. Representative progress of active site engineering in porous electrocatalysts for efficient electrocatalysis of hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, CO2 reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, and oxygen evolution reaction, are reviewed.








Abstract
Electrocatalysis is at the center of many sustainable energy conversion technologies that are being developed to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. The past decade has witnessed significant progresses in the exploitation of advanced electrocatalysts for diverse electrochemical reactions involved in electrolyzers and fuel cells, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, the recent research advances made in porous electrocatalysts for these five important reactions are reviewed. In the discussions, an attempt is made to highlight the advantages of porous electrocatalysts in multiobjective optimization of surface active sites including not only their density and accessibility but also their intrinsic activity. First, the current knowledge about electrocatalytic active sites is briefly summarized. Then, the electrocatalytic mechanisms of the five above&#8208;mentioned reactions (HER, ORR, CO2RR, NRR, and OER), the current challenges faced by these reactions, and the recent efforts to meet these challenges using porous electrocatalysts are examined. Finally, the future research directions on porous electrocatalysts including synthetic strategies leading to these materials, insights into their active sites, and the standardized tests and the performance requirements involved are discussed.

      <title>Dielectric Properties of Ultrathin CaF2 Ionic Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>
Calcium fluoride (CaF2) is an attractive high&#8208;k dielectric for 2D electronics because its surface is terminated with fluorine atoms, which leads to a defect&#8208;free van der Waals interface with 2D materials. Ultrathin CaF2 ionic crystals (grown by molecular beam epitaxy at 250 &#186;C) are shown to exhibit outstanding dielectric performance (i.e., homogeneity, leakage current, and dielectric strength), which is much better than that observed in SiO2, TiO2, and h&#8208;BN.








Abstract
Mechanically exfoliated 2D hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) is currently the preferred dielectric material to interact with graphene and 2D transition metal dichalcogenides in nanoelectronic devices, as they form a clean van der Waals interface. However, h&#8208;BN has a low dielectric constant (&#8776;3.9), which in ultrascaled devices results in high leakage current and premature dielectric breakdown. Furthermore, the synthesis of h&#8208;BN using scalable methods, such as chemical vapor deposition, requires very high temperatures (&gt;900 &#176;C) , and the resulting h&#8208;BN stacks contain abundant few&#8208;atoms&#8208;wide amorphous regions that decrease its homogeneity and dielectric strength. Here it is shown that ultrathin calcium fluoride (CaF2) ionic crystals could be an excellent solution to mitigate these problems. By applying &gt;3000 ramped voltage stresses and several current maps at different locations of the samples via conductive atomic force microscopy, it is statistically demonstrated that ultrathin CaF2 shows much better dielectric performance (i.e., homogeneity, leakage current, and dielectric strength) than SiO2, TiO2, and h&#8208;BN. The main reason behind this behavior is that the cubic crystalline structure of CaF2 is continuous and free of defects over large regions, which prevents the formation of electrically weak spots.

      <title>Crystallized Monolayer Semiconductor for Ohmic Contact Resistance, High Intrinsic Gain, and High Current Density</title>
      <dc:description>
Contact resistance and intrinsic gain are important performance indicators of organic field&#8208;effect transistors. Staggered structure devices based on highly crystallized monolayer organic semiconductor provide outstanding contact, carrier mobility, and intrinsic gain. Organic 2D materials can potentially play an important role in next&#8208;generation flexible electronics.








Abstract
The contact resistance limits the downscaling and operating range of organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). Access resistance through multilayers of molecules and the nonideal metal/semiconductor interface are two major bottlenecks preventing the lowering of the contact resistance. In this work, monolayer (1L) organic crystals and nondestructive electrodes are utilized to overcome the abovementioned challenges. High intrinsic mobility of 12.5 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and Ohmic contact resistance of 40 &#937; cm are achieved. Unlike the thermionic emission in common Schottky contacts, the carriers are predominantly injected by field emission. The 1L&#8208;OFETs can operate linearly from VDS&#160;=&#160;&#8722;1&#160;V to VDS as small as &#8722;0.1&#160;mV. Thanks to the good pinch&#8208;off behavior brought by the monolayer semiconductor, the 1L&#8208;OFETs show high intrinsic gain at the saturation regime. At a high bias load, a maximum current density of 4.2 &#181;A &#181;m&#8722;1 is achieved by the only molecular layer as the active channel, with a current saturation effect being observed. In addition to the low contact resistance and high&#8208;resolution lithography, it is suggested that the thermal management of high&#8208;mobility OFETs will be the next major challenge in achieving high&#8208;speed densely integrated flexible electronics.

In article number 2001675, Uriel Levy, Shlomo Magdassi, and co&#8208;workers report transparent yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) gain&#8208;medium structures at micrometer&#8208;size, using 3D printing based on two&#8208;photon polymerization of inks composed only of solutions. The printed objects are polycrystalline, and, upon doping with Nd, light emission is enabled. 3D printing of gain media at the microscale may be used for lighting and lasing, as well as other exciting optical applications.

      <title>Realization of Epitaxial Thin Films of the Topological Crystalline Insulator Sr3SnO</title>
      <dc:description>
Epitaxial thin films of the candidate topological crystalline insulator Sr3SnO are realized by adsorption&#8208;controlled molecular&#8208;beam epitaxy. In situ angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy demonstrates that the bulk electronic structure closely matches the predicted band structure. This research opens opportunities to investigate and manipulate topological states by tuning symmetries via strain engineering and heterostructuring.








Abstract
Topological materials are derived from the interplay between symmetry and topology. Advances in topological band theories have led to the prediction that the antiperovskite oxide Sr3SnO is a topological crystalline insulator, a new electronic phase of matter where the conductivity in its (001) crystallographic planes is protected by crystallographic point group symmetries. Realization of this material, however, is challenging. Guided by thermodynamic calculations, a deposition approach is designed and implemented to achieve the adsorption&#8208;controlled growth of epitaxial Sr3SnO single&#8208;crystal films by molecular&#8208;beam epitaxy (MBE). In situ transport and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal the metallic and electronic structure of the as&#8208;grown samples. Compared with conventional MBE, the used synthesis route results in superior sample quality and is readily adapted to other topological systems with antiperovskite structures. The successful realization of thin films of Sr3SnO opens opportunities to manipulate topological states by tuning symmetries via strain engineering and heterostructuring.

      <title>Ferrimagnetic Skyrmions in Topological Insulator/Ferrimagnet Heterostructures</title>
      <dc:description>
The strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling in topological surface states provides a large interfacial noncollinear Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction in topological insulator/ferrimagnet heterostructures, resulting in small&#8208;size (radius around 100 nm) skyrmions in the adjacent ferrimagnet at room temperature, where antiferromagnetically coupled skyrmion sublattices are observed.








Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions are topologically nontrivial chiral spin textures that have potential applications in next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;efficient and high&#8208;density spintronic devices. In general, the chiral spins of skyrmions are stabilized by the noncollinear Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI), originating from the inversion symmetry breaking combined with the strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC). Here, the strong SOC from topological insulators (TIs) is utilized to provide a large interfacial DMI in TI/ferrimagnet heterostructures at room temperature, resulting in small&#8208;size (radius &#8776; 100 nm) skyrmions in the adjacent ferrimagnet. Antiferromagnetically coupled skyrmion sublattices are observed in the ferrimagnet by element&#8208;resolved scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy, showing the potential of a vanishing skyrmion Hall effect and ultrafast skyrmion dynamics. The line&#8208;scan spin profile of the single skyrmion shows a N&#233;el&#8208;type domain wall structure and a 120 nm size of the 180&#176; domain wall. This work demonstrates the sizable DMI and small skyrmions in TI&#8208;based heterostructures with great promise for low&#8208;energy spintronic devices.

      <title>Borophene: New Sensation in Flatland</title>
      <dc:description>
Borophene is considered as one of the most promising 2D nanomaterials, owing to its unique structural and electronic properties. The various synthetic approaches for the fabrication of borophene nanostructures with different phases and morphologies, including free&#8208;standing borophene sheets, are described. The frontline applications of these nanostructures in flexible electronics, sensing, disease diagnosis, catalysis, and hybrid energy storage are also considered.








Abstract
Borophene, a 2D allotrope of boron and the lightest elemental Dirac material, is the latest very promising 2D material owing to its unique structural and electronic characteristics of the X3 and &#946;12 phases. The high atomic density on ridgelines of the &#946;12 phase of borophene provides a substantial orbital overlap, which leads to an excellent electron density in the conduction level and thus to a highly metallic behavior. These unique structural characteristics and electronic properties of borophene attract significant scientific interest. Herein, approaches for crystal growth/synthesis of these unique nanostructures and their potential technological applications are discussed. Various substrate&#8208;supported ultrahigh&#8208;vacuum growth techniques for borophene, such as molecular beam epitaxy, atomic layer deposition, and chemical vapor deposition, along with their challenges, are also summarized. The sonochemical exfoliation and modified Hummer's technique for the synthesis of free&#8208;standing borophene are also discussed. Solution&#8208;phase exfoliation seems to address the scalability issues and expands the applications of these unique materials to various fields, including renewable energy devices and ultrafast sensors. Furthermore, the electronic, optical, thermal, and elastic properties of borophene are thoroughly discussed and are compared with those of graphene and its &#8220;cousins.&#8221; Numerous frontline applications are envisaged and an outlook is presented.

      <title>Directly Grown Vertical Graphene Carpets as Janus Separators toward Stabilized Zn Metal Anodes</title>
      <dc:description>
Directly grown vertical graphene carpet on one side of commercial glass fiber separator affords evenly distributed electric field, lowered local current density, and boosted zincophilic effect, thereby enabling a Janus separator toward stabilized Zn anode.








Abstract
Zinc metal anode has garnered a great deal of scientific and technological interest. Nevertheless, major bottlenecks restricting its large&#8208;scale utilization lie in the poor electrochemical stability and unsatisfactory cycling life. Herein, a Janus separator is developed via directly growing vertical graphene (VG) carpet on one side of commercial glass fiber separator throughout chemical vapor deposition. A simple air plasma treatment further renders the successful incorporation of oxygen and nitrogen heteroatoms on bare graphene. Thus&#8208;derived 3D VG scaffold affording large surface area and porous structure can be viewed as a continuation of planar zinc anode. In turn, the Janus separator harvests homogenous electric field distribution and lowered local current density at the interface of the anode/electrolyte, as well as harnesses favorable zincophilic feature for building&#8208;up uniform Zn ionic flux. Such a separator engineering enables an impressive rate and cycle performance (93% over 5000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1) for Zn&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors and outstanding energy density (182&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) for V2O5//Zn batteries, respectively. This strategy with large scalability and cost&#8208;effectiveness represents a universal route to protect prevailing metal anodes (Zn, Na, K) in rechargeable batteries.

      <title>Targeting Neutrophils for Enhanced Cancer Theranostics</title>
      <dc:description>
A neutrophil targeting nanomedicine is developed to enhance tumor accumulation and improve therapeutic efficacy achieved via in situ cross&#8208;linking catalyzed by endogenous myeloperoxidase. In combination with photodynamic therapy, lung metastasis is inhibited by blocking neutrophil recruitment into the lung through sustained release of a 5&#8208;lipoxygenase inhibitor.








Abstract
Improving tumor accumulation and delivery efficiency is an important goal of nanomedicine. Neutrophils play a vital role in both chemically mediating inflammatory response through myeloperoxidase (MPO) and biologically promoting metastasis during inflammation triggered by the primary tumor or environmental stimuli. Herein, a novel theranostic nanomedicine that targets both the chemical and biological functions of neutrophils in tumor is designed, facilitating the enhanced retention and sustained release of drug cargos for improved cancer theranostics. 5&#8208;hydroxytryptamine (5&#8208;HT) is equipped onto nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with photosensitizers and Zileuton (a leukotriene inhibitor) to obtain MPO and neutrophil targeting NPs, denoted as HZ&#8208;5 NPs. The MPO targeting property of 5&#8208;HT modified NPs is confirmed by noninvasive positron emission tomography imaging studies. Furthermore, photodynamic therapy is used to initiate the inflammatory response which further mediated the accumulation and retention of neutrophil targeting NPs in a breast cancer model. This design renders a greatly improved theranostic nanomedicine for efficient tumor suppression, and more importantly, inhibition of neutrophil&#8208;mediated lung metastasis via the sustained release of Zileuton. This work presents a novel strategy of targeting neutrophils for improved tumor theranostics, which may open up new avenues in designing nanomedicine through exploiting the tumor microenvironment.

      <title>Wet&#8208;Style Superhydrophobic Antifogging Coatings for Optical Sensors</title>
      <dc:description>
Wet&#8208;style superhydrophobic antifogging coatings that exhibit superhydrophobicity and self&#8208;cleaning properties are prepared by pattern transferring low&#8208;surface&#8208;energy micropillars on a polymer&#8211;silica nanocomposite. The polymer&#8211;silica nanocomposite allows the coating to simultaneously maintain an excellent optical property in fogging conditions by preferentially guiding the water vapor to condense into this underlying hydrophilic reservoir.








Abstract
Transparent substrates are widely used for optical applications from lenses for personal and sports eyewear to transparent displays and sensors. While these substrates require excellent optical properties, they often suffer from a variety of environmental challenges such as excessive fogging and surface contamination. In this work, it is demonstrated that a wet&#8208;style superhydrophobic coating, which simultaneously exhibits antifogging, antireflective, and self&#8208;cleaning properties, can be prepared by pattern transferring low&#8208;surface&#8208;energy microstructures onto a heterostructured nanoscale thin film comprising polymers and silica nanoparticles. The polymer&#8211;silica nanocomposite base layer serves as a hydrophilic reservoir, guiding the water molecules to preferentially condense into this underlying region and suppress reflection, while the low&#8208;surface&#8208;energy microstructure enables contaminants adsorbed on the surface to be easily removed by rinsing with water.

&lt;p&gt;Wet&#8208;style superhydrophobic antifogging coatings that exhibit superhydrophobicity and self&#8208;cleaning properties are prepared by pattern transferring low&#8208;surface&#8208;energy micropillars on a polymer&#8211;silica nanocomposite. The polymer&#8211;silica nanocomposite allows the coating to simultaneously maintain an excellent optical property in fogging conditions by preferentially guiding the water vapor to condense into this underlying hydrophilic reservoir.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transparent substrates are widely used for optical applications from lenses for personal and sports eyewear to transparent displays and sensors. While these substrates require excellent optical properties, they often suffer from a variety of environmental challenges such as excessive fogging and surface contamination. In this work, it is demonstrated that a wet&#8208;style superhydrophobic coating, which simultaneously exhibits antifogging, antireflective, and self&#8208;cleaning properties, can be prepared by pattern transferring low&#8208;surface&#8208;energy microstructures onto a heterostructured nanoscale thin film comprising polymers and silica nanoparticles. The polymer&#8211;silica nanocomposite base layer serves as a hydrophilic reservoir, guiding the water molecules to preferentially condense into this underlying region and suppress reflection, while the low&#8208;surface&#8208;energy microstructure enables contaminants adsorbed on the surface to be easily removed by rinsing with water.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In Situ Construction of a LiF&#8208;Enriched Interface for Stable All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries and its Origin Revealed by Cryo&#8208;TEM</title>
      <dc:description>
Based on the atomic visualization of the lithium (Li)/poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) interface through cryo&#8208;transmission electron microscopy, Li2S additive is revealed to promote the decomposition of LiN(CF3SO2)2 (LiTFSI) to generate uniform LiF nanocrystals in situ, rendering uniform Li deposition and preventing PEO bond cleavage. This optimized interface promises the PEO electrolyte&#8208;based Li metal batteries with significantly improved cycling lifespan.








Abstract
The application of solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) is still inherently limited by the unstable lithium (Li)/electrolyte interface, despite the advantages of security, flexibility, and workability of SPEs. Herein, the Li/electrolyte interface is modified by introducing Li2S additive to harvest stable all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Cryo&#8208;transmission electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;TEM) results demonstrate a mosaic interface between poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) electrolytes and Li metal anodes, in which abundant crystalline grains of Li, Li2O, LiOH, and Li2CO3 are randomly distributed. Besides, cryo&#8208;TEM visualization, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, reveals that the introduction of Li2S accelerates the decomposition of N(CF3SO2)2&#8722; and consequently promotes the formation of abundant LiF nanocrystals in the Li/PEO interface. The generated LiF is further verified to inhibit the breakage of C&#63743;O bonds in the polymer chains and prevents the continuous interface reaction between Li and PEO. Therefore, the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LMBs with the LiF&#8208;enriched interface exhibit improved cycling capability and stability in a cell configuration with an ultralong lifespan over 1800 h. This work is believed to open up a new avenue for rational design of high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LMBs.

      <title>Excess&#8208;Li Localization Triggers Chemical Irreversibility in Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;Rich Layered Oxides</title>
      <dc:description>
Through a real&#8208;time study on electronic/structural evolutions, the chemical irreversibility of Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides (LMR) is profoundly investigated, proving the structural origin of its irreversibility: the localization of excess&#8208;Li in a lattice structure. This work proposes an alternative design for chemically&#8208;reversible LMR, which is a delocalized excess&#8208;Li system, providing material understandings to develop high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes for Li&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides (LMRs) have emerged as practically feasible cathode materials for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their extra anionic redox behavior and market competitiveness. However, sluggish kinetics regions (&lt;3.5 V vs Li/Li+) associated with anionic redox chemistry engender LMRs with chemical irreversibility (first&#8208;cycle irreversibility, poor rate properties, voltage fading), which limits their practical use. Herein, the structural origin of this chemical irreversibility is revealed through a comparative study involving Li1.15Mn0.51Co0.17Ni0.17O2 with relatively localized and delocalized excess&#8208;Li in its lattice system. Operando fine&#8208;interval X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy is used to simultaneously observe the interplay between transition&#8208;metal&#8211;oxygen (TM&#8208;O) redox chemistry and TM migration behavior in real time. Density functional theory calculations show that excess&#8208;Li localization in the LMR structure attenuates TM&#8208;O covalency and stability, leading to overall chemical irreversibility. Hence, the delocalized excess&#8208;Li system is proposed as an alternative design for practically feasible LMR cathodes with restrained TM migration and sustainable O&#8208;redox chemistry.

      <title>Enabling Superior Sodium Capture for Efficient Water Desalination by a Tubular Polyaniline Decorated with Prussian Blue Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel tubular&#8208;structured electrode material, i.e., polyaniline nanotubes decorated with Prussian blue nanocrystals, is demonstrated through a simple preparation strategy, which successfully combines the characteristics of two traditional Faradaic materials and achieves high&#8208;performance capacitive deionization toward water desalination.








Abstract
The application of electrochemical energy storage materials to capacitive deionization (CDI), a low&#8208;cost and energy&#8208;efficient technology for brackish water desalination, has recently been proven effective in solving problems of traditional CDI electrodes, i.e., low desalination capacity and incompatibility in high salinity water. However, Faradaic electrode materials suffer from slow salt removal rate and short lifetime, which restrict their practical usage. Herein, a simple strategy is demonstrated for a novel tubular&#8208;structured electrode, i.e., polyaniline (PANI)&#8208;tube&#8208;decorated with Prussian blue (PB) nanocrystals (PB/PANI composite). This composite successfully combines characteristics of two traditional Faradaic materials, and achieves high performance for CDI. Benefiting from unique structure and rationally designed composition, the obtained PB/PANI exhibits superior performance with a large desalination capacity (133.3 mg g&#8722;1 at 100 mA g&#8722;1), and ultrahigh salt&#8208;removal rate (0.49 mg g&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at 2 A g&#8722;1). The synergistic effect, interfacial enhancement, and desalination mechanism of PB/PANI are also revealed through in situ characterization and theoretical calculations. Particularly, a concept for recovery of the energy applied to CDI process is demonstrated. This work provides a facile strategy for design of PB&#8208;based composites, which motivates the development of advanced materials toward high&#8208;performance CDI applications.

      <title>Reactivity, Selectivity, and Stability of Zeolite&#8208;Based Catalysts for Methane Dehydroaromatization</title>
      <dc:description>
Development of efficient catalytic materials for the direct conversion of natural gas to liquid hydrocarbons is a challenging task that is one of the chemical &#8220;holy grails&#8221;. Here, recent progress in the synthesis, characterization and understanding of zeolite&#8208;based catalysts for methane dehydroaromatization to benzene is reviewed together with the unsolved issues and future prospects in the field.








Abstract
Non&#8208;oxidative dehydroaromatization is arguably the most promising process for the direct upgrading of cheap and abundant methane to liquid hydrocarbons. This reaction has not been commercialized yet because of the suboptimal activity and swift deactivation of benchmark Mo&#8208;zeolite catalysts. This progress report represents an elaboration on the recent developments in understanding of zeolite&#8208;based catalytic materials for high&#8208;temperature non&#8208;oxidative dehydroaromatization of methane. It is specifically focused on recent studies, relevant to the materials chemistry and elucidating i) the structure of active species in working catalysts; ii) the complex molecular pathways underlying the mechanism of selective conversion of methane to benzene; iii) structure, evolution and role of coke species; and iv) process intensification strategies to improve the deactivation resistance and overall performance of the catalysts. Finally, unsolved challenges in this field of research are outlined and an outlook is provided on promising directions toward improving the activity, stability, and selectivity of methane dehydroaromatization catalysts.

Abstract
PCPDTBT&#8208;SO3K (CPE&#8208;K), a conjugated polyelectrolyte, is presented as a mixed conductor material that can be used to fabricate high transconductance accumulation mode organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). OECTs are utilized in a wide range of applications such as analyte detection, neural interfacing, impedance sensing, and neuromorphic computing. The use of interdigitated contacts to enable high transconductance in a relatively small device area in comparison to standard contacts is demonstrated. Such characteristics are highly desired in applications such as neural&#8208;activity sensing, where the device area must be minimized to reduce invasiveness. The physical and electrical properties of CPE&#8208;K are fully characterized to allow a direct comparison to other top performing OECT materials. CPE&#8208;K demonstrates an electrical performance that is among the best reported in the literature for OECT materials. In addition, CPE&#8208;K OECTs operate in the accumulation mode, which allows for much lower energy consumption in comparison to commonly used depletion mode devices.

&lt;p&gt;PCPDTBT&#8208;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;K (CPE&#8208;K), a conjugated polyelectrolyte, is presented as a mixed conductor material that can be used to fabricate high transconductance accumulation mode organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCPDTBT&#8208;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;K (CPE&#8208;K), a conjugated polyelectrolyte, is presented as a mixed conductor material that can be used to fabricate high transconductance accumulation mode organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). OECTs are utilized in a wide range of applications such as analyte detection, neural interfacing, impedance sensing, and neuromorphic computing. The use of interdigitated contacts to enable high transconductance in a relatively small device area in comparison to standard contacts is demonstrated. Such characteristics are highly desired in applications such as neural&#8208;activity sensing, where the device area must be minimized to reduce invasiveness. The physical and electrical properties of CPE&#8208;K are fully characterized to allow a direct comparison to other top performing OECT materials. CPE&#8208;K demonstrates an electrical performance that is among the best reported in the literature for OECT materials. In addition, CPE&#8208;K OECTs operate in the accumulation mode, which allows for much lower energy consumption in comparison to commonly used depletion mode devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Supported by Crystalline Porous Materials: Views from the Inside</title>
      <dc:description>
Like a pearl in a crown, single&#8208;atom catalysts supported with crystalline porous materials have recently attracted great interest in heterogeneous catalysis. This review presents research progress on these catalysts, mainly focusing on their atomic structure detection, electronic property analysis, and in&#8208;situ catalytic studies using synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy techniques.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have recently emerged as an exciting system in heterogeneous catalysis showing outstanding performance in many catalytic reactions. Single&#8208;atom catalytic sites alone are not stable and thus require stabilization from substrates. Crystalline porous materials such as zeolites and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are excellent substrates for SACs, offering high stability with the potential to further enhance their performance due to synergistic effects. This review features recent work on the structure, electronic, and catalytic properties of zeolite and MOF&#8208;protected SACs, offering atomic&#8208;scale views from the &#8220;inside&#8221; thanks to the subatomic resolution of synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure and associated methods will be shown to be powerful tools in identifying the single&#8208;atom site and can provide details into the coordination environment and bonding disorder of SACs. The X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure will be demonstrated as a valuable method in probing the electronic properties of SACs by analyzing the white line intensity, absorption edge shift, and pre&#8208;/postedge features. Emphasis is also placed on in situ/operando XAS using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art equipment, which can unveil the changes in structure and properties of SACs during the dynamic catalytic processes in a highly sensitive and time&#8208;resolved manner.

      <title>A 13.56&#160;MHz Rectifier Based on Fully Inkjet Printed Organic Diodes</title>
      <dc:description>
The very first example of a fully inkjet printed organic Schottky diode capable of working at radio frequencies, with a very high rectification ratio, is presented. A rectifier circuit, fabricated by integrating the presented fully printed diodes and capacitors, can successfully rectify a 13.56&#160;MHz sinusoidal AC signal, and supply power to a polymer circuit printed on a plastic foil.








Abstract
The increasing diffusion of portable and wearable technologies results in a growing interest in electronic devices having features such as flexibility, lightness&#8208;in&#8208;weight, transparency, and wireless operation. Organic electronics is proposed as a potential candidate to fulfill such needs, in particular targeting pervasive radio&#8208;frequency (RF) applications. Still, limitations in terms of device performances at RF, particularly severe when large&#8208;area and scalable fabrication techniques are employed, have largely precluded the achievement of such an appealing scenario. In this work, the rectification of an electromagnetic wave at 13.56&#160;MHz with a fully inkjet printed polymer diode is demonstrated. The rectifier, a key enabling component of future pervasive wireless systems, is fabricated through scalable large&#8208;area methods on plastic. To provide a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle demonstration of its future applicability, its adoption in powering a printed integrated polymer circuit is presented.

      <title>Bioinspired Multifunctional Cellular Plastics with a Negative Poisson&#8217;s Ratio for High&#8208;Energy Dissipation</title>
      <dc:description>
Cellular plastics with complex porous structure and composition distribution are in great demand for various engineering applications, yet are challenging to realize through conventional foaming technologies. An ice&#8208;templating approach, involving a controlled freezing process of a monomer/water emulsion, followed by cryopolymerization and room temperature thawing, is developed to fabricate such cellular plastics at a scalable and environmentally friendly manner.








Abstract
Cellular plastics have been widely used in transportation, aerospace, and personal safety applications owing to their excellent mechanical, thermal, and acoustic properties. It is highly desirable to impart them with a complex porous structure and composition distribution to obtain specific functionality for various engineering applications, which is challenging with conventional foaming technologies. Herein, it is demonstrated that this can be achieved through the controlled freezing process of a monomer/water emulsion, followed by cryopolymerization and room temperature thawing. As ice is used as a template, this method is environmentally friendly and capable of producing cellular plastics with various microstructures by harnessing the numerous morphologies of ice crystals. In particular, a cellular plastic with a radially aligned structure shows a negative Poisson&#8217;s ratio under compression. The rigid plastic shows a much higher energy dissipation capability compared to other materials with similar negative Poisson&#8217;s ratios. Additionally, the simplicity and scalability of this approach provides new possibilities for fabricating high&#8208;performance cellular plastics with well&#8208;defined porous structures and composition distributions.

      <title>Oxygen&#8208;Detecting Synaptic Device for Realization of Artificial Autonomic Nervous System for Maintaining Oxygen Homeostasis</title>
      <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;sensitive artificial synaptic device that simultaneously detects oxygen concentration and generates a synaptic signal is fabricated. This device successfully achieves an interconversion between the excitatory and inhibitory modes of the synaptic current at various oxygen concentrations. The device is also used to realize a negative feedback system for maintaining oxygen homeostasis, which mimics the human autonomic nervous system.








Abstract
Incorporation of various functions of a biological nervous system into electronic devices is an intriguing challenge in the realization of a human&#8208;like recognition and response system. Emerging artificial synaptic devices capable of processing electronic signals through neuromorphic functions operate such biomimetic systems similarly to biological nervous systems. Here, an oxygen&#8208;sensitive artificial synaptic device that simultaneously detects oxygen concentration and generates a synaptic signal is demonstrated. The device successfully achieves an interconversion between the excitatory and inhibitory modes of the synaptic current at various oxygen concentrations by virtue of an oxygen&#8208;sensitive trilayered organic double heterojunction. The oxygen&#8208;induced traps in the organic layer modulate the majority charge carrier from holes to electrons, and this modulation induces an interconversion between the excitatory and inhibitory modes according to the environmental oxygen condition. Finally, the proposed synaptic device is applied to the realization of a negative feedback system for regulation of oxygen homeostasis, which mimics the human autonomic nervous system. The oxygen&#8208;sensitive synaptic device proposed in this study is expected to open up new possibilities for the development of a biomimetic neural system that can respond appropriately to various environmental changes.

      <title>A Promoted Charge Separation/Transfer System from Cu Single Atoms and C3N4 Layers for Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Based on chlorophyll sodium copper salt (CSC) in situ intercalated supramolecular and following pyrolysis procedure, Cu single atoms (Cu&#63743;Nx) are anchored in and between C3N4 layers, which open both in&#8208;plane and interlayer charge transfer channels. Therefore, the hydrogen evolution ability is significantly improved (212 &#181;mol h&#8722;1, catalyst 20 mg). It also shows impressive conversion and selectivity for the oxidation of benzene.








Abstract
Establishing highly effective charge transfer channels in carbon nitride (C3N4) for enhancing its photocatalytic activity is still a challenging issue. Herein, for the first time, the engineering of C3N4 layers with single&#8208;atom Cu bonded with compositional N (Cu&#63743;Nx) is demonstrated to address this challenge. The Cu&#63743;Nx is formed by intercalation of chlorophyll sodium copper salt into a melamine&#8208;based supramolecular precursor followed by controlled pyrolysis. Two groups of Cu&#63743;Nx are identified: in one group each of Cu atoms is bonded with three in&#8208;plane N atoms, while in the other group each of Cu atoms is bonded with four N atoms of two neighboring C3N4 layers, thus forming both in&#8208;plane and interlayer charge transfer channels. Importantly, ultrafast spectroscopy has further proved that Cu&#63743;Nx can greatly improve in&#8208;plane and interlayer separation/transfer of charge carriers and in turn boost the photocatalytic efficiency. Consequently, the catalyst exhibits a superior visible&#8208;light photocatalytic hydrogen production rate (&#8776;212 &#181;mol h&#8722;1/0.02 g catalyst), 30 times higher than that of bulk C3N4. Moreover, it leads to an outstanding conversion rate (92.3%) and selectivity (99.9%) for the oxidation of benzene under visible light.

   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt; are identified: in one group each of Cu atoms is bonded with three in&#8208;plane N atoms, while in the other group each of Cu atoms is bonded with four N atoms of two neighboring C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; layers, thus forming both in&#8208;plane and interlayer charge transfer channels. Importantly, ultrafast spectroscopy has further proved that Cu&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt; can greatly improve in&#8208;plane and interlayer separation/transfer of charge carriers and in turn boost the photocatalytic efficiency. Consequently, the catalyst exhibits a superior visible&#8208;light photocatalytic hydrogen production rate (&#8776;212 &#181;mol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;/0.02 g catalyst), 30 times higher than that of bulk C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Moreover, it leads to an outstanding conversion rate (92.3%) and selectivity (99.9%) for the oxidation of benzene under visible light.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interfacial Oxygen&#8208;Driven Charge Localization and Plasmon Excitation in Unconventional Superconductors</title>
      <dc:description>
Manipulation of charge localization in optimal&#8208;doped copper oxide (cuprate) thin&#8208;film on SrTiO3 substrate via interfacial orbital hybridization has been reported. A high&#8208;energy plasmon is further observed. Unraveling the mechanism of interfacial effect and charge localization in cuprate systems provides important clues in understanding their underlying electronic structures and superconductive properties.








Abstract
Charge localization is critical to the control of charge dynamics in systems such as perovskite solar cells, organic&#8208;, and nanostructure&#8208;based photovoltaics. However, the precise control of charge localization via electronic transport or defect engineering is challenging due to the complexity in reaction pathways and environmental factors. Here, charge localization in optimal&#8208;doped La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 thin&#8208;film on SrTiO3 substrate (LSCO/STO) is investigated, and also a high&#8208;energy plasmon is observed. Charge localization manifests as a near&#8208;infrared mid&#8208;gap state in LSCO/STO. This is ascribed to the interfacial hybridization between the Ti3d&#8208;orbitals of the substrate and O2p&#8208;orbitals of the film. The interfacial effect leads to significant changes in the many&#8208;body correlations and local&#8208;field effect. The local&#8208;field effect results in an inhomogeneous charge distribution, and due to perturbation by an external field, the high polarizability of this nonuniform charge system eventually generates the high&#8208;energy plasmon. Transformation of the electronic correlations in LSCO/STO is further demonstrated via temperature&#8208;dependent spectral&#8208;weight transfer. This study of charge localization in cuprates and interfacial hybridization provides important clues to their electronic structures and superconductive properties.

Present study pioneers the technology of pulsed laser irradiation in liquid from a solid target to liquid, and yields liquid ternary supranano (&lt;10&#160;nm)&#8208;alloys with a unique core&#8211;shell structure. The decoration of such supranano&#8208;alloys as an electron mediator at grain boundaries promotes the electron extraction and transfer of the hybrid perovskite film and drives the efficiency up to 22.03%.








Abstract
Creating colloids of liquid metal with tailored dimensions has been of technical significance in nano&#8208;electronics while a challenge remains for generating supranano (&lt;10&#160;nm) liquid metal to unravel the mystery of their unconventional functionalities. Present study pioneers the technology of pulsed laser irradiation in liquid from a solid target to liquid, and yields liquid ternary nano&#8208;alloys that are laborious to obtain via wet&#8208;chemistry synthesis. Herein, the significant role of the supranano liquid metal on mediating the electrons at the grain boundaries of perovskite films, which are of significance to influence the carriers recombination and hysteresis in perovskite solar cells, is revealed. Such embedding of supranano liquid metal in perovskite films leads to a cesium&#8208;based ternary perovskite solar cell with stabilized power output of 21.32% at maximum power point tracing. This study can pave a new way of synthesizing multinary supranano alloys for advanced optoelectronic applications.

      <title>Shining Light on Poly(ethylene glycol): From Polymer Modification to 3D Laser Printing of Water Erasable Microstructures</title>
      <dc:description>
A new approach is introduced to access tailored poly(ethylene glycol) materials that can be deconstructed, simply by water. Besides the green light&#8208;induced backbone&#8208;modification of macromolecules, a photoresist is developed for the synthesis of covalently cured macroscopic gels that can be cleaved on&#8208;demand. The resist is also applicable to direct laser printing, making it feasible to fabricate water&#8208;erasable 3D microstructures.








Abstract
The implementation of stimuli&#8208;responsive bonds into 3D network assemblies is a key concept to design adaptive materials that can reshape and degrade. Here, a straightforward but unique photoresist is introduced for the tailored fabrication of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) materials that can be readily erased by water, even without the need for acidic or basic additives. Specifically, a new class of photoresist is developed that operates through the backbone crosslinking of PEG when irradiated in the presence of a bivalent triazolinedione. Hence, macroscopic gels are obtained upon visible light&#8208;emitting diode irradiation (&#955; &gt; 515 nm) that are stable in organic media but rapidly degrade upon the addition of water. Photoinduced curing is also applicable to multiphoton laser lithography (&#955; &gt; 700 nm), hence providing access to 3D printed microstructures that vanish when immersed in water at 37 &#176;C. Materials with varying crosslinking densities are accessed by adapting the applied laser writing power, thereby allowing for tunable hydrolytic erasing timescales. A new platform technology is thus presented that enables the crosslinking and 3D laser printing of PEG&#8208;based materials, which can be cleaved and erased in water, and additionally holds potential for the facile modification and backbone degradation of polyether&#8208;containing materials in general.

      <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Silicon Oxide for Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A laser&#8208;induced silicon oxide (LI&#8208;SiOx) layer derived from a commercial adhesive tape can improve the reversibility of Li metal batteries. The coating results in superior performance by suppressing the formation of Li dendrites and presenting higher average coulombic efficiency of 99.3% (2.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 2.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and improved cycle life compared to the electrode without an SiOx coating.








Abstract
The development of a rechargeable Li metal anode (LMA) is an important milestone for improved battery technology. Practical issues hindering LMAs are the formation of Li dendrites and inactive Li during plating and stripping processes, which can cause short circuits, thermal runaway, and low coulombic efficiency (CE). Here, the use of a laser&#8208;induced silicon oxide (LI&#8208;SiOx) layer derived from a commercial adhesive tape to improve the reversibility of Li metal batteries (LMBs) is studied. The silicone&#8208;based adhesive of the tape is converted by a commercial infrared laser into a homogeneous porous SiOx layer deposited directly over the current collector. The coating results in superior performance by suppressing the formation of Li dendrites and inactive Li and presenting higher average CE of 99.3% (2.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 2.0 mA cm&#8722;2) compared to bare electrodes. The thickness and morphology of the deposited Li is investigated, revealing a different mechanism of Li deposition on coated electrodes. The laser coating affords a method that is fast and avoids the use of toxic organic solvents and extensive drying times. The improved performance with the SiOx coating is demonstrated in LMB with a zero&#8208;excess (&#8220;anode&#8208;free&#8221;) configuration where a 100% improved performance is verified.

The laser coating affords a method that is fast and avoids the use of toxic organic solvents and extensive drying times. The improved performance with the SiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt; coating is demonstrated in LMB with a zero&#8208;excess (&#8220;anode&#8208;free&#8221;) configuration where a 100% improved performance is verified.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Heterogeneous Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Heterogeneous single&#8208;atom catalysts exhibit promising performance for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. Various valuable reduction products have been produced on different single&#8208;atom catalysts. In these catalysts, single atomic sites coordinate with heteroatoms, such as N and S, and locate in N&#8208;doped carbon materials, graphene, or metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived carbon frameworks.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is of great importance to tackle the rising CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. The CO2RR can be driven by renewable energy sources, producing precious chemicals and fuels, with the implementation of this process largely relying on the development of low&#8208;cost and efficient electrocatalysts. Recently, a range of heterogeneous and potentially low&#8208;cost single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) containing non&#8208;precious metals coordinated to earth&#8208;abundant elements have emerged as promising candidates for the CO2RR. Unfortunately, the real catalytically active centers and the key factors that govern the catalytic performance of these SACs remain ambiguous. Here, this ambiguity is addressed by developing a fundamental understanding of the CO2RR&#8208;to&#8208;CO process on SACs, as CO accounts for the major product from CO2RR on SACs. The reaction mechanism, the rate&#8208;determining steps, and the key factors that control the activity and selectivity are analyzed from both experimental and theoretical studies. Then, the synthesis, characterization, and the CO2RR performance of SACs are discussed. Finally, the challenges and future pathways are highlighted in the hope of guiding the design of the SACs to promote and understand the CO2RR on SACs.

      <title>Designer Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Size&#8208;Exclusion&#8208;Based Hydrocarbon Separations: Progress and Challenges</title>
      <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials hold tremendous promise for highly efficient separations of industrially important hydrocarbons owing to their exceptional tunability in pore structure and functionality. The current review summarizes recent progress as well as existing challenges for size&#8208;exclusion&#8208;based hydrocarbon separations with designer MOFs.








Abstract
The separation of hydrocarbons is of primary importance in the petrochemical industry but remains a challenging process. Hydrocarbon separations have traditionally relied predominantly on costly and energy&#8208;intensive heat&#8208;driven procedures such as low&#8208;temperature distillations. Adsorptive separation based on porous solids represents an alternative technology that is potentially more energy efficient for the separation of some hydrocarbons. Great efforts have been made recently not only in the development of adsorbents with optimal separation performance but also toward the subsequent implementation of adsorption&#8208;based separation technology. Emerging as a relatively new class of multifunctional porous materials, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold substantial promise as adsorbents for highly efficient separation of hydrocarbons. This is because of their exceptional and intrinsic porosity tunability, which enables size&#8208;exclusion&#8208;based separations that render the highest possible separation selectivity. In this review, recent advances in the development of MOFs for separation of selected groups of hydrocarbons are reviewed, including methane/C2 hydrocarbons, normal alkanes, alkane isomers, and alkane/alkene/alkyne and C8 alkylaromatics, with a particular focus on separations based on the size&#8208;exclusion mechanism. Insights into tailor&#8208;made structures, material design strategies, and structure&#8211;property relationships will be elucidated. In addition, the existing challenges and possible future directions of this important research field will be discussed.

      <dc:description>
Recent research progress on nanopore&#8208;supported metal nanocatalysts for H2 generation from various liquid&#8208;phase chemical hydrogen storage materials is reviewed, mainly focusing on the presentation of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic strategies and advanced characterizations of these nanocatalysts and their catalytic performances in hydrogen generation.

Abstract
Hydrogen has emerged as an environmentally attractive fuel and a promising energy carrier for future applications to meet the ever&#8208;increasing energy challenges. The safe and efficient storage and release of hydrogen remain a bottleneck for realizing the upcoming hydrogen economy. Hydrogen storage based on liquid&#8208;phase chemical hydrogen storage materials is one of the most promising hydrogen storage techniques, which offers considerable potential for large&#8208;scale practical applications for its excellent safety, great convenience, and high efficiency. Recently, nanopore&#8208;supported metal nanocatalysts have stood out remarkably in boosting the field of liquid&#8208;phase chemical hydrogen storage. Herein, the latest research progress in catalytic hydrogen production is summarized, from liquid&#8208;phase chemical hydrogen storage materials, such as formic acid, ammonia borane, hydrous hydrazine, and sodium borohydride, by using metal nanocatalysts confined within diverse nanoporous materials, such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks, porous carbons, zeolites, mesoporous silica, and porous organic polymers. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic strategies and advanced characterizations for these nanocatalysts, as well as their catalytic performances in hydrogen generation, are presented. The limitation of each hydrogen storage system and future challenges and opportunities on this subject are also discussed. References in related fields are provided, and more developments and applications to achieve hydrogen energy will be inspired.

      <title>Lanthanide&#8208;Doped Near&#8208;Infrared Nanoparticles for Biophotonics</title>
      <dc:description>
Lanthanide&#8208;doped near&#8208;infrared nanoparticles are emerging as a new class of optical probes for biological applications. A set of strategies to overcome the fundamental limits for enhanced luminescence brightness are presented, and their cutting&#8208;edge biophotonic applications ranging from high spatiotemporal optical imaging to highly sensitive in vivo biosensing, and to light mediated synergistic therapy are highlighted.








Abstract
Light in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral region is increasingly utilized in bioapplications, providing deeper penetration in biological tissues owing to the lower absorption and scattering in comparison with light in the visible range. Lanthanide&#8208;doped luminescent nanoparticles with excitation and/or emission in the NIR range have recently attracted tremendous attention as one of the prime candidates for noninvasive biological applications due to their unique optical properties, such as large Stokes shift, spectrally sharp luminescence emissions, long luminescence lifetimes, and excellent photostability. Herein, recent advances of lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles with NIR upconversion or downshifting luminescence and their uses in cutting&#8208;edge biophotonic applications are presented. A set of efficient strategies for overcoming the fundamental limit of low luminescence brightness of lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles is introduced. An in&#8208;depth literature review of their state&#8208;of&#8208;art biophotonics applications is also included, showing their superiority for high&#8208;resolution imaging, single&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;level detection, and efficacy for tissue&#8208;penetrating diagnostics and therapeutics.

      <title>Ferroelectric Tunnel Junctions: Modulations on the Potential Barrier</title>
      <dc:description>
Ferroelectric tunnel junctions are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation nonvolatile memory devices, which exhibit attractive advantages of high&#8208;density of data storage, nondestructive readout, fast write/read access, and low energy consumption. Recent advances in tunneling electroresistance and the emerging physics of ferroelectric tunnel junctions with electronic and ionic modulations on tunneling barrier profiles are discussed and the potential applications are outlined.








Abstract
Recently, ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) have attracted considerable attention for potential applications in next&#8208;generation memories, owing to attractive advantages such as high&#8208;density of data storage, nondestructive readout, fast write/read access, and low energy consumption. Herein, recent progress regarding FTJ devices is reviewed with an emphasis on the modulation of the potential barrier. Electronic and ionic approaches that modulate the ferroelectric barriers themselves and/or induce extra barriers in electrodes or at ferroelectric/electrode interfaces are discussed with the enhancement of memory performance. Emerging physics, such as nanoscale ferroelectricity, resonant tunneling, and interfacial metallization, and the applications of FTJs in nonvolatile data storage, neuromorphic synapse emulation, and electromagnetic multistate memory are summarized. Finally, challenges and perspectives of FTJ devices are underlined.

      <title>Chromatic Dispersion Manipulation Based on Metalenses</title>
      <dc:description>
The metalens is one of the most basic and important applications of metasurfaces. The noticeable achievements over the past few years in the field of chromatic dispersion control based on metalenses are highlighted, especially in the development of achromatic metalenses. A perspective on this specific branch of applications and future prospects are also presented.








Abstract
Metasurfaces are 2D metamaterials composed of subwavelength nanoantennas according to specific design. They have been utilized to precisely manipulate various parameters of light fields, such as phase, polarization, amplitude, etc., showing promising functionalities. Among all meta&#8208;devices, the metalens can be considered as the most basic and important application, given its significant advantage in integration and miniaturization compared with traditional lenses. However, the resonant dispersion of each nanoantenna in a metalens and the intrinsic chromatic dispersion of planar devices and optical materials result in a large chromatic aberration in metalenses that severely reduces the quality of their focusing and imaging. Consequently, how to effectively suppress or manipulate the chromatic aberration of metalenses has attracted worldwide attention in the last few years, leading to variety of excellent achievements promoting the development of this field. Herein, recent progress in chromatic dispersion control based on metalenses is reviewed.

They have been utilized to precisely manipulate various parameters of light fields, such as phase, polarization, amplitude, etc., showing promising functionalities. Among all meta&#8208;devices, the metalens can be considered as the most basic and important application, given its significant advantage in integration and miniaturization compared with traditional lenses. However, the resonant dispersion of each nanoantenna in a metalens and the intrinsic chromatic dispersion of planar devices and optical materials result in a large chromatic aberration in metalenses that severely reduces the quality of their focusing and imaging. Consequently, how to effectively suppress or manipulate the chromatic aberration of metalenses has attracted worldwide attention in the last few years, leading to variety of excellent achievements promoting the development of this field. Herein, recent progress in chromatic dispersion control based on metalenses is reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Jeff = 1/2 Antiferromagnet Sr2IrO4: A Golden Avenue toward New Physics and Functions</title>
      <dc:description>
The perovskite Sr2IrO4 hosts a novel Jeff = 1/2 state related to strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, and represents a rare example of iridates that is better understood both theoretically and experimentally. In the last decade, fascinating electronic properties have been revealed in this material. These developments are reviewed with regard to two aspects: fundamentals and functions.








Abstract
Iridates have been providing a fertile ground for studying emergent phases of matter that arise from the delicate interplay of various fundamental interactions with approximate energy scale. Among these highly focused quantum materials, the perovskite Sr2IrO4, which belongs to the Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper series, stands out and has been intensively addressed in the last decade, since it hosts a novel Jeff = 1/2 state that is a profound manifestation of strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling. Moreover, the Jeff = 1/2 state represents a rare example of iridates that is better understood both theoretically and experimentally. Here, Sr2IrO4 is taken as an example to review the recent advances of the Jeff = 1/2 state in two aspects: materials fundamentals and functionality potentials. In the fundamentals part, the basic issues for the layered canted antiferromagnetic order of the Jeff = 1/2 magnetic moments in Sr2IrO4 are illustrated, and then the progress of the antiferromagnetic order modulation through diverse routes is highlighted. Subsequently, for the functionality potentials, fascinating properties such as atomic&#8208;scale giant magnetoresistance, anisotropic magnetoresistance, and nonvolatile memory, are addressed. To conclude, prospective remarks and an outlook are given.

Abstract
Silicon and other inorganic semiconductor nanowires (NWs) have been extensively investigated in the last two decades for constructing high&#8208;performance nanoelectronics, sensors, and optoelectronics. For many of these applications, these tiny building blocks have to be integrated into the existing planar electronic platform, where precise location, orientation, and layout controls are indispensable. In the advent of More&#8208;than&#8208;Moore's era, there are also emerging demands for a programmable growth engineering of the geometry, composition, and line&#8208;shape of NWs on planar or out&#8208;of&#8208;plane 3D sidewall surfaces. Here, the critical technologies established for synthesis, transferring, and assembly of NWs upon planar surface are examined; then, the recent progress of in&#8208;plane growth of horizontal NWs directly upon crystalline or patterned substrates, constrained by using nanochannels, an epitaxial interface, or amorphous thin film precursors is discussed. Finally, the unique capabilities of planar growth of NWs in achieving precise guided growth control, programmable geometry, composition, and line&#8208;shape engineering are reviewed, followed by their latest device applications in building high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistors, photodetectors, stretchable electronics, and 3D stacked&#8208;channel integration.

      <title>The Material Efforts for Quantized Hall Devices Based on Topological Insulators</title>
      <dc:description>
Topological insulators (TIs) are materials hosting exotic topological quantum effects including the quantum Hall effect and the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The material development history of TIs and magnetic TIs and recent research progress are reviewed, focusing on the realization of these quantized transports, which will promote fundamental research and potential applications in the future.








Abstract
A topological insulator (TI) is a kind of novel material hosting a topological band structure and plenty of exotic topological quantum effects. Achieving quantized electrical transport, including the quantum Hall effect (QHE) and the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), is an important aspect of realizing quantum devices based on TI materials. Intense efforts are made in this field, in which the most essential research is based on the optimization of realistic TI materials. Herein, the TI material development process is reviewed, focusing on the realization of quantized transport. Especially, for QHE, the strategies to increase the surface transport ratio and decrease the threshold magnetic field of QHE are examined. For QAHE, the evolution history of magnetic TIs is introduced, and the recently discovered magnetic TI candidates with intrinsic magnetizations are discussed in detail. Moreover, future research perspectives on these novel topological quantum effects are also evaluated.

Abstract
In the last two decades, remarkable progress has been achieved in the field of optoelectronic devices based on III&#8208;nitride semiconductors. In terms of photonics applications in the visible&#8211;UV spectral range, III&#8208;nitrides are one of the most promising materials. For instance, emerging gallium nitride (GaN)&#8208;based micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) technology for high&#8208;resolution display, and UV photo&#8208;detection for environmental monitoring, health, and medical applications. In this work, hybrid micro/nano&#8208;LEDs with integration of II&#8211;VI quantum dots by means of lithography and nano&#8208;imprinting patterning techniques are demonstrated, and high&#8208;performance red/green/blue and white emissions are achieved. Consequently, plasmonic nanolasers are designed and fabricated using a metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor structure, where strong surface plasmon polariton coupling leads to the efficient lasing with a low excitation threshold from the visible to UV tunable spectral range. Furthermore, performance&#8208;improved AlGaN UV solar&#8208;blind avalanche photodiodes (APDs) with a separate absorption and multiplication structure by polarization engineering are reported. These APDs deliver a record&#8208;high avalanche gain of up to 1.6 &#215; 105. These newest advances in nano/micro&#8208;LEDs, nanolasers, and APDs can shed light on the emerging capabilities of III&#8208;nitride in cutting&#8208;edge applications.

      <title>Electrode Materials Engineering in Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction: Energy Input and Conversion Efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>
Electrode materials are considered to be important components for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction systems, as they affect the energy input method and CO2 conversion efficiencies. Various photo&#8208;anode and bio&#8208;anode materials for lowering external bias and progress on cathode catalysts for improving CO2 conversion efficiencies are comprehensively reviewed. Moreover, enhancement strategies in the design of these electrode materials are highlighted.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR) is a promising technology to simultaneously alleviate CO2&#8208;caused climate hazards and ever&#8208;increasing energy demands, as it can utilize CO2 in the atmosphere to provide the required feedstocks for industrial production and daily life. In recent years, substantial progress in ECR systems has been achieved by the exploitation of various novel electrode materials. The anodic materials and cathodic catalysts that have, respectively, led to high&#8208;efficiency energy input and effective heterogenous catalytic conversion in ECR systems are comprehensively reviewed. Based on the differences in the nature of energy sources and the role of materials used at the anode, the fundamentals of ECR systems, including photo&#8208;anode&#8208;assisted ECR systems and bio&#8208;anode&#8208;assisted ECR systems, are explained in detail. Additionally, the cathodic reaction mechanisms and pathways of ECR are described along with a discussion of different design strategies for cathode catalysts to enhance conversion efficiency and selectivity. The emerging challenges and some perspective on both anode materials and cathodic catalysts are also outlined for better development of ECR systems.

     alt="Electrode Materials Engineering in Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction: Energy Input and Conversion Efficiency"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Electrode materials are considered to be important components &lt;/b&gt; for electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction systems, as they affect the energy input method and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion efficiencies. Various photo&#8208;anode and bio&#8208;anode materials for lowering external bias and progress on cathode catalysts for improving CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion efficiencies are comprehensively reviewed. Moreover, enhancement strategies in the design of these electrode materials are highlighted.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction (ECR) is a promising technology to simultaneously alleviate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;caused climate hazards and ever&#8208;increasing energy demands, as it can utilize CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere to provide the required feedstocks for industrial production and daily life. In recent years, substantial progress in ECR systems has been achieved by the exploitation of various novel electrode materials. The anodic materials and cathodic catalysts that have, respectively, led to high&#8208;efficiency energy input and effective heterogenous catalytic conversion in ECR systems are comprehensively reviewed. Based on the differences in the nature of energy sources and the role of materials used at the anode, the fundamentals of ECR systems, including photo&#8208;anode&#8208;assisted ECR systems and bio&#8208;anode&#8208;assisted ECR systems, are explained in detail. Additionally, the cathodic reaction mechanisms and pathways of ECR are described along with a discussion of different design strategies for cathode catalysts to enhance conversion efficiency and selectivity. The emerging challenges and some perspective on both anode materials and cathodic catalysts are also outlined for better development of ECR systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Photonic Metamaterial Absorbers: Morphology Engineering and Interdisciplinary Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Photonic metamaterial absorbers (PMAs) are reviewed, focusing on their morphology engineering and interdisciplinary applications. Feasible methods to tailor the subwavelength&#8208;scale structures of PMAs for optimizing their absorption performances are presented. Incorporated with interdisciplinary techniques, the application of PMAs in coloration, sensing, steam generation, and photodetection is also discussed.








Abstract
Recent advances in nanofabrication technologies have spurred many breakthroughs in the field of photonic metamaterials that provide efficient ways of manipulating light&#8211;matter interaction at subwavelength scales. As one of the most important applications, photonic metamaterials can be used to implement novel optical absorbers. First the morphology engineering of various photonic metamaterial absorbers is discussed, which is highly associated with impendence matching conditions and resonance modes of the absorbers, thus directly determines their absorption efficiency, operational bandwidth, incident angle, and polarization dependence. Then, the recent achievements of various interdisciplinary applications based on photonic metamaterial absorbers, including structural color generation, ultrasensitive optical sensing, solar steam generation, and highly responsive photodetection, are reviewed. This report is expected to provide an overview and vision for the future development of photonic metamaterial absorbers and their applications in novel nanophotonic systems.

      <dc:description>
Electrodeposition induces material syntheses on conductive surfaces and demonstrates the advantages of controlling material thickness, engineering interfaces, and realizing a conformal coating. These features may enable electrodeposition to meet some needs for battery fabrication that conventional technologies can rarely achieve. The latest progress in electrodeposition technologies for Li&#8208;based batteries is summarized.








Abstract
Electrodeposition induces material syntheses on conductive surfaces, distinguishing it from the widely used solid&#8208;state technologies in Li&#8208;based batteries. Electrodeposition drives uphill reactions by applying electric energy instead of heating. These features may enable electrodeposition to meet some needs for battery fabrication that conventional technologies can rarely achieve. The latest progress of electrodeposition technologies in Li&#8208;based batteries is summarized. Each component of Li&#8208;based batteries can be electrodeposited or synthesized with multiple methods. The advantages of electrodeposition are the main focus, and they are discussed in comparison with traditional technologies with the expectation to inspire innovations to build better Li&#8208;based batteries. Electrodeposition coats conformal films on surfaces and can control the film thickness, providing an effective approach to enhancing battery performance. Engineering interfaces by electrodeposition can stabilize the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and strengthen the adhesion of active materials to substrates, thereby prolonging the battery longevity. Lastly, a perspective of future studies on electrodepositing batteries is provided. The significant merits of electrodeposition should greatly advance the development of Li&#8208;based batteries.

      <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Nanocages: A New Platform for Advanced Energy Storage and Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;based nanocages have emerged as a new platform for advanced energy storage and conversion owing to their hollow interior cavity with microchannels across the shells, their high specific surface area with defective outer surface, and their tunable electronic structure. Up&#8208;to&#8208;date progress on the synthesis, encapsulating/supporting of carbon&#8208;based nanocages and their applications is presented, along with the research challenges and trends.








Abstract
Energy storage and conversion play a crucial role in modern energy systems, and the exploration of advanced electrode materials is vital but challenging. Carbon&#8208;based nanocages consisting of sp2 carbon shells feature a hollow interior cavity with sub&#8208;nanometer microchannels across the shells, high specific surface area with a defective outer surface, and tunable electronic structure, much different from the intensively studied nanocarbons such as carbon nanotubes and graphene. These structural and morphological characteristics make carbon&#8208;based nanocages a new platform for advanced energy storage and conversion. Up&#8208;to&#8208;date synthetic strategies of carbon&#8208;based nanocages, the utilization of their unique porous structure and morphology for the construction of composites with foreign active species, and their significant applications to the advanced energy storage and conversion are reviewed. Structure&#8211;performance correlations are discussed in depth to highlight the contribution of carbon&#8208;based nanocages. The research challenges and trends are also envisaged for deepening and extending the study and application of this multifunctional material.

The exploration of quantum&#8208;inspired symmetries in optical and photonic systems has witnessed immense research interest both fundamentally and technologically in a wide range of subject areas in physics and engineering.

Abstract
Engineered nanomaterials have been extensively employed as therapeutics for tumor management. Meanwhile, the complex tumor niche along with multiple barriers at the cellular level collectively hinders the action of nanomedicines. Here, the advanced strategies that hold promise for overcoming the numerous biological barriers facing nanomedicines are summarized. Starting from tumor entry, methods that promote tissue penetration of nanomedicine and address the hypoxia issue are also highlighted. Then, emphasis is given to the significance of overcoming both physical barriers, such as membrane&#8208;associated efflux pumps, and biological features, such as resistance to apoptosis. The pros and cons for an individual approach are presented. In addition, the associated technical problems are discussed, along with the importance of balancing the therapeutic merits and the additional cost of sophisticated nanomedicine designs.

      <title>Constructing Metastructures with Broadband Electromagnetic Functionality</title>
      <dc:description>
Broadband electromagnetic response is often required in the applications of metastructures. It is therefore important to reassess the principles of constructing broadband electromagnetic metastructures. Some recent developments in realizing broadband electromagnetic response by dispersion compensation, nonresonant effects, and some trade&#8208;off approaches are reviewed. Perspectives are given on the development of broadband metastructured materials.








Abstract
Electromagnetic metastructures stand for the artificial structures with a characteristic size smaller than the wavelength, which may efficiently manipulate the states of light. However, their applications are often restricted by the bandwidth of the electromagnetic response of the metastructures. It is therefore essential to reassert the principles in constructing broadband electromagnetic metastructures. Herein, after summarizing the conventional approaches for achieving broadband electromagnetic functionality, some recent developments in realizing broadband electromagnetic response by dispersion compensation, nonresonant effects, and several trade&#8208;off approaches are reviewed, followed by some perspectives for the future development of broadband metamaterials. It is anticipated that broadband metastructures will have even more substantial applications in optoelectronics, energy harvesting, and information technology.

      <title>Nonlinear Beam Shaping in Domain Engineered Ferroelectric Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>
Nonlinear holography is a universal technique for nonlinear beam shaping, in which the nonlinear polarization wave acts as the reference beam, while the harmonic wave acts as the object beam. The interference fringe is imprinted onto a nonlinear crystal with modulated domain patterns. This method can be used to engineer the wave front of an arbitrary harmonic wave.








Abstract
Domain engineered ferroelectric crystals are a type of microstructure functional material that is used widely in the area of nonlinear optics. Herein, research processes in the area of nonlinear beam shaping using domain engineered crystals in the past decade are reviewed. The newly developed design methods, such as the nonlinear Huygens&#8211;Fresnel principle, nonlinear volume holography, and caustic design, which have analogs in linear optics, are introduced. Using the proposed methods for nonlinear beam shaping, multiple function integration, generation of Airy beams, and arbitrary curved trajectories are realized. As an extra degree of freedom, orbital angular momentum of light beams is generated and manipulated through domain engineering. Discussions and future directions in this field are presented.

      <title>Tin and Mixed Lead&#8211;Tin Halide Perovskite Solar Cells: Progress and their Application in Tandem Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress of tin and mixed Pb&#8211;Sn halide perovskite solar cells is summarized, including an introduction of device structures, fabrication methods, strategies to improve both performance and stability, and an outlook of pure tin&#8208;based halide, mixed Pb&#8211;Sn halide, and monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have recently attracted enormous attention for photovoltaic applications due to their superior optical and electrical properties. Lead (Pb) halide perovskites stand out among this material series, with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 25%. According to the Shockley&#8211;Queisser (SQ) limit, lead halide perovskites typically exhibit bandgaps that are not within the optimal range for single&#8208;junction solar cells. Partial or complete replacement of lead with tin (Sn) is gaining increasing research interest, due to the promise of further narrowing the bandgaps. This enables ideal solar utilization for single&#8208;junction solar cells as well as the construction of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. In addition, the usage of Sn provides a path to the fabrication of lead&#8208;free or Pb&#8208;reduced perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Recent progress in addressing the challenges of fabricating efficient Sn halide and mixed lead&#8211;tin (Pb&#8211;Sn) halide PSCs is summarized herein. Mixed Pb&#8211;Sn halide perovskites hold promise not only for higher efficiency and more stable single&#8208;junction solar cells but also for efficient all&#8208;perovskite monolithic tandem solar cells.

      <title>Electrochemical and Structural Analysis in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries by Analytical Electron Microscopy: Progress and Perspectives</title>
      <dc:description>
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries with high energy density and safety are attracting tremendous attention. Progress in the characterization of the microstructure and dynamic behavior for batteries using ex situ/in situ transmission electron microscopy is systematically reviewed. Potential opportunities for combining cryo&#8208;electron microscopy and ptychographic phase imaging to alleviate radiation damage and enhance image contrast of light atoms are discussed as a perspective.








Abstract
Advanced scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and its associated instruments have made significant contributions to the characterization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state (ASS) Li batteries, as these tools provide localized information on the structure, morphology, chemistry, and electronic state of electrodes, electrolytes, and their interfaces at the nano&#8208; and atomic scale. Furthermore, the rapid development of in situ techniques has enabled a deep understanding of interfacial dynamic behavior and heterogeneous characteristics during the cycling process. However, due to the beam&#8208;sensitive nature of light elements in the interphases, e.g., Li and O, thorough and reliable studies of the interfacial structure and chemistry at an ultrahigh spatial resolution without beam damage is still a formidable challenge. Herein, the following points are discussed: (1) the recent contributions of advanced STEM to the study of ASS Li batteries; (2) current challenges associated with using this method; and (3) potential opportunities for combining cryo&#8208;electron microscopy and the STEM phase contrast imaging techniques.

      <title>Self&#8208;Healing Polymers Based on Coordination Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
Coordination bonds have been demonstrated to be effective for constructing self&#8208;healing polymers in recent years. The advantages of coordination bonds in constructing self&#8208;healing polymers are discussed, and the various metal&#8211;ligand bonds being utilized in self&#8208;healing polymers along with some examples of functional self&#8208;healing polymers originating from metal&#8211;ligand interactions are summarized. A few concerns and future directions in this research field are proposed.








Abstract
Self&#8208;healing ability is an important survival feature in nature, with which living beings can spontaneously repair damage when wounded. Inspired by nature, people have designed and synthesized many self&#8208;healing materials by encapsulating healing agents or incorporating reversible covalent bonds or noncovalent interactions into a polymer matrix. Among the noncovalent interactions, the coordination bond is demonstrated to be effective for constructing highly efficient self&#8208;healing polymers. Moreover, with the presence of functional metal ions or ligands and dynamic metal&#8211;ligand bonds, self&#8208;healing polymers can show various functions such as dielectrics, luminescence, magnetism, catalysis, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, and shape&#8208;memory behavior. Herein, the recent developments and achievements made in the field of self&#8208;healing polymers based on coordination bonds are presented. The advantages of coordination bonds in constructing self&#8208;healing polymers are highlighted, the various metal&#8211;ligand bonds being utilized in self&#8208;healing polymers are summarized, and examples of functional self&#8208;healing polymers originating from metal&#8211;ligand interactions are given. Finally, a perspective is included addressing the promises and challenges for the future development of self&#8208;healing polymers based on coordination bonds.

     alt="Self&#8208;Healing Polymers Based on Coordination Bonds"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Coordination bonds have been demonstrated to be effective for constructing self&#8208;healing polymers &lt;/b&gt; in recent years. The advantages of coordination bonds in constructing self&#8208;healing polymers are discussed, and the various metal&#8211;ligand bonds being utilized in self&#8208;healing polymers along with some examples of functional self&#8208;healing polymers originating from metal&#8211;ligand interactions are summarized. A few concerns and future directions in this research field are proposed.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self&#8208;healing ability is an important survival feature in nature, with which living beings can spontaneously repair damage when wounded. Inspired by nature, people have designed and synthesized many self&#8208;healing materials by encapsulating healing agents or incorporating reversible covalent bonds or noncovalent interactions into a polymer matrix. Among the noncovalent interactions, the coordination bond is demonstrated to be effective for constructing highly efficient self&#8208;healing polymers. Moreover, with the presence of functional metal ions or ligands and dynamic metal&#8211;ligand bonds, self&#8208;healing polymers can show various functions such as dielectrics, luminescence, magnetism, catalysis, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, and shape&#8208;memory behavior. Herein, the recent developments and achievements made in the field of self&#8208;healing polymers based on coordination bonds are presented. The advantages of coordination bonds in constructing self&#8208;healing polymers are highlighted, the various metal&#8211;ligand bonds being utilized in self&#8208;healing polymers are summarized, and examples of functional self&#8208;healing polymers originating from metal&#8211;ligand interactions are given. Finally, a perspective is included addressing the promises and challenges for the future development of self&#8208;healing polymers based on coordination bonds.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Graphene Hybrid Structures for Integrated and Flexible Optoelectronics</title>
      <dc:description>
Low light absorption and inefficient carrier extraction are two fundamental limitations in graphene photodetectors. Recent progress in using graphene hybrid structures to enable highly sensitive, broadband, and ultrafast optoelectronic devices, and their potential applications in integrated and flexible electronics are reviewed.








Abstract
Graphene (Gr) has many unique properties including gapless band structure, ultrafast carrier dynamics, high carrier mobility, and flexibility, making it appealing for ultrafast, broadband, and flexible optoelectronics. To overcome its intrinsic limit of low absorption, hybrid structures are exploited to improve the device performance. Particularly, van der Waals heterostructures with different photosensitive materials and photonic structures are very effective for improving photodetection and modulation efficiency. With such hybrid structures, Gr hybrid photodetectors can operate from ultraviolet to terahertz, with significantly improved R (up to 109 A W&#8722;1) and bandwidth (up to 128 GHz). Furthermore, integration of Gr with silicon (Si) complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) circuits, the human body, and soft tissues is successfully demonstrated, opening promising opportunities for wearable sensors and biomedical electronics. Here, the recent progress in using Gr hybrid structures toward high&#8208;performance photodetectors and integrated optoelectronic applications is reviewed.

      <title>Functional Materials Under Stress: In Situ TEM Observations of Structural Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
Several examples of current progress regarding in situ mechanical scanning/transmission electron microscopy techniques are addressed. Probing of local microstructures from atomic to micrometer scales in functional materials that are under high stress loads is possible. Advancements of these state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques make it possible to study the behavior of materials with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution.








Abstract
The operating conditions of functional materials usually involve varying stress fields, resulting in structural changes, whether intentional or undesirable. Complex multiscale microstructures including defects, domains, and new phases, can be induced by mechanical loading in functional materials, providing fundamental insight into the deformation process of the involved materials. On the other hand, these microstructures, if induced in a controllable fashion, can be used to tune the functional properties or to enhance certain performance. In situ nanomechanical tests conducted in scanning/transmission electron microscopes (STEM/TEM) provide a critical tool for understanding the microstructural evolution in functional materials. Here, select results on a variety of functional material systems in the field are presented, with a brief introduction into some newly developed multichannel experimental capabilities to demonstrate the impact of these techniques.

      <dc:description>
Recent advances in the liquid&#8208;crystal (LC)&#8208;mediated geometric phase are briefly summarized, from nematic&#8208;LC&#8208;mediated transmissive to chiral&#8208;LC&#8208;mediated broadband reflective planar optics. Numerous spin&#8208;controlled functionalities are presented, including not only conventional beam steering and focusing, but also advanced light structuring. A comprehensive understanding of LC&#8208;based geometric phase planar optics and their numerous applications is provided.








Abstract
Planar optical elements that can manipulate the multidimensional physical parameters of light efficiently and compactly are highly sought after in modern optics and nanophotonics. In recent years, the geometric phase, induced by the photonic spin&#8211;orbit interaction, has attracted extensive attention for planar optics due to its powerful beam shaping capability. The geometric phase can usually be generated via inhomogeneous anisotropic materials, among which liquid crystals (LCs) have been a focus. Their pronounced optical properties and controllable and stimuli&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly behavior introduce new possibilities for LCs beyond traditional panel displays. Recent advances in LC&#8208;mediated geometric phase planar optics are briefly reviewed. First, several recently developed photopatterning techniques are presented, enabling the accurate fabrication of complicated LC microstructures. Subsequently, nematic LC&#8208;based transmissive planar optical elements and chiral LC&#8208;based broadband reflective elements are reviewed systematically. Versatile functionalities are revealed, from conventional beam steering and focusing, to advanced structuring. Combining the geometric phase with structured LC materials offers a satisfactory platform for planar optics with desired functionalities and drastically extends exceptional applications of ordered soft matter. Some prospects on this rapidly advancing field are also provided.

      <title>Plasmonic Microspheres: Plasmonic Janus Microspheres Created from Pickering Emulsion Drops (Adv. Mater. 26/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article 2001384, Shin&#8208;Hyun Kim and co&#8208;workers design plasmonic Janus microspheres using emulsion drops whose interface is decorated by particles. The emulsion drops made of acrylate resin are photopolymerized and the particles are removed. The directional deposition of the metal renders the top hemispheres as plasmonically colored and the position of the particles at the interface is precisely controlled by aging, which enables the tuning of the plasmonic property. The plasmonic colors can be switched on and off by controlling the orientation of the Janus microspheres with an external electric field.

      <title>Detection of Viruses: A Lipid&#8208;Nanopillar&#8208;Array&#8208;Based Immunosorbent Assay (Adv. Mater. 26/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2001360, Jwa&#8208;Min Nam and co&#8208;workers report a lipid&#8208;nanopillar&#8208;array&#8208;based immunosorbent assay (LNAIA) for rapid, sensitive, and quantitative detection of viruses. LNAIA is based on fluid fluorophore&#8208;labeled antibodies on lipid&#8208;modified nanopillar array structures, and it enables reliable quantification of H1N1 virus targets down to 150 viruses within 25 min on a conventional fluorescence microscopy setup.

      <title>Water Splitting: In Situ Formation of Oxygen Vacancies Achieving Near&#8208;Complete Charge Separation in Planar BiVO4 Photoanodes (Adv. Mater. 26/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2001385, Lianzhou Wang and co&#8208;workers develop a planar BiVO4 photoanode with in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed oxygen vacancies in the whole film for efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting. They reveal that, under AM 1.5 G illumination, oxygen vacancies increase the majority charge carrier density and photovoltage, leading to an excellent applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency of 2.76%.

      <title>Bio&#8208;Nanocomposite Coatings: Multifunctional Bio&#8208;Nanocomposite Coatings for Perishable Fruits (Adv. Mater. 26/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article 1908291, Muhammad M. Rahman, Pulickel M. Ajayan, and co&#8208;workers present a conformal bio&#8208;nanocomposite coating based on cellulose nanocrystals and poly(albumen) that increases the shelf&#8208;life of fresh produce by retarding ripening, dehydration, and microbial attack. The coating is edible, easily washable, and made from readily available inexpensive materials, which makes it a promising solution to combat food wastage.

      <dc:description>
In article number 2001268, Paolo Samor&#236; and co&#8208;workers report the fabrication of all&#8208;semiconducting mixed&#8208;dimensional van der Waals heterostructures based on monolayer 2D MoS2 and bottom&#8208;up synthesized 1D graphene nanoribbons, which efficiently suppress the typical persistent photoconductivity effect of MoS2. Upon interfacing with physisorbed photochromic molecules, the charge transport of MoS2&#8211;graphene nanoribbons in field&#8208;effect transistors can be significantly photomodulated, which corresponds to multilevel output currents for high&#8208;performance optoelectronics.
