         <title>Ultra&#8208;Strong and High&#8208;Tough Thermoset Epoxy Resins from Hyperbranched Topological Structure and Subnanoscaled Free Volume</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The strength and toughness of thermoset epoxy resins are generally mutually exclusive, as are the high performance and rapid recyclability. Experimentally determined mechanical strength values are usually much lower than their theoretical values. The preparation of thermoset epoxy resins with high modulus, high toughness, ultra&#8208;strong strength and highly efficient recyclability is still a large challenge. Here, we are the first to synthesize novel hyperbranched epoxy resins (Bn, n = 6, 12, 24) containing an imide structure by a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction. Bn shows an excellent comprehensive function in simultaneously improving the strength, modulus, toughness, low&#8208;temperature resistance and degradability of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol&#8208;A (DGEBA). All the mechanical properties first increase and then decrease with minimization of the free volume properties. The improvement is attributable to uniform molecular holes or free volume by a molecular mixture of linear and hyperbranched topological structures. The precise measurement and controllability of the molecular free volume properties of epoxy resins is first discovered, as well as the imide structure degradation of crosslinked epoxy resins. We have successfully resolved the two conflicts between strength and toughness and between high performance during service and high efficiency during degradation. These findings provide a route for designing ultra&#8208;strong, tough and recyclable thermoset epoxy resins.

         <title>In Situ Dual&#8208;Interface Passivation Strategy Enables The Efficiency of Formamidinium Perovskite Solar Cells Over 25%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation photovoltaics owing to their unparalleled power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Currently, approaches to further improve device efficiencies tend to focus on the passivation of interfacial defects. Although various strategies have been developed to mitigate these defects, many involve complex and time&#8208;consuming post&#8208;treatment processes, thereby hindering their widespread adoption in commercial applications. In this work, we develop a concise but efficient in situ dual&#8208;interface passivation strategy wherein 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium methanesulfonate (MS) is employed as a precursor additive. During perovskite crystallization, MS can either be enriched downward through precipitation with SnO2, or can be aggregated upward through lattice extrusion. These self&#8208;assembled MS species play a significant role in passivating the defect interfaces, thereby reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination losses, and promoting more efficient charge extraction. As a result, a PCE &gt;25% (certified PCE of 24.84%) was achieved with substantially improved long&#8208;term storage and photo&#8208;thermal stabilities. This strategy provides valuable insights into interfacial passivation and holds promise for the industrialization of PSCs.

         <title>Engineered CpG&#8208;Loaded Nanorobots Drive Autophagy&#8208;Mediated Immunity for TLR9&#8208;Positive Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Smart nanorobots have emerged as novel drug delivery platforms in nanomedicine, potentially improving anti&#8208;cancer efficacy and reducing side effects. In this study, we developed an intelligent tumor microenvironment&#8208;responsive nanorobot that effectively delivers CpG payloads to Toll&#8208;like receptor 9 (TLR9)&#8208;positive tumors to induce autophagy&#8208;mediated cell death for immunotherapy. The nanorobots were fabricated by co&#8208;self&#8208;assembly of two amphiphilic triblock polymer peptides: one containing the MMP2&#8208;cleaved GPLGVRGS motif to control the mechanical opening of the nanorobots and provide targeting capability for TLR&#8208;9&#8208;positive tumors and the other consisting of an arginine&#8208;rich GRRRDRGRS sequence that can condense nuclear acid payloads through electrostatic interactions. Using multiple tumor&#8208;bearing mouse models, we investigated whether the intravenous injection of CpG&#8208;loaded nanorobots could effectively deliver CpG payloads to TLR&#8208;9&#8208;positive tumors and elicit anti&#8208;tumor immunity through TLR9 signaling and autophagy. Therefore, besides being a commonly used adjuvant for tumor vaccination, CpG&#8208;loaded nanorobots can effectively reprogram the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment and suppress tumor growth and recurrence. This nanorobot&#8208;based CpG immunotherapy can be considered a feasible approach to induce anti&#8208;tumor immunity, showing great therapeutic potential for the future treatment of TLR9&#8208;positive cancers.

Abstract
Over the past three years, remarkable advancements in organic solar cells (OSCs) have emerged, propelled by the introduction of Y6&#8212;an innovative A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A type small molecule non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA). This review provides a critical discussion of the current knowledge about the structural and physical properties of the PM6:Y6 material combination in relation to its photovoltaic performance. The design principles of PM6 and Y6 are discussed, covering charge transfer, transport, and recombination mechanisms. Then, the authors delve into blend morphology and degradation mechanisms before considering commercialization. The current state of the art is presented, while also discussing unresolved contentious issues, such as the blend energetics, the pathways of free charge generation, and the role of triplet states in recombination. As such, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the PM6:Y6 material combination and its potential for further development in the field of organic solar cells. By addressing both the successes and challenges associated with this system, this review contributes to the ongoing research efforts toward achieving more efficient and stable organic solar cells.

         <title>1D Magnetic MX3 Single&#8208;Chains (M = Cr, V and X = Cl, Br, I)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D magnetic van der Waals materials with composition MX3 (M = Cr, V, and X = Cl, Br, I) confined in carbon nanotubes are investigated. Atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy identifies unique 1D face&#8208;sharing octahedron MX3 structure. Charge transfer from carbon nanotube to MX3 single&#8208;chain plays a critical role in stabilizing the chain structures.








Abstract
Magnetic materials in reduced dimensions are not only excellent platforms for fundamental studies of magnetism, but they play crucial roles in technological advances. The discovery of intrinsic magnetism in monolayer 2D van der Waals systems has sparked enormous interest, but the single&#8208;chain limit of 1D magnetic van der Waals materials has been largely unexplored. This paper reports on a family of 1D magnetic van der Waals materials with composition MX3 (M = Cr, V, and X = Cl, Br, I), prepared in fully&#8208;isolated fashion within the protective cores of carbon nanotubes. Atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy identifies unique structures that differ from the well&#8208;known 2D honeycomb lattice MX3 structure. Density functional theory calculations reveal charge&#8208;driven reversible magnetic phase transitions.

         <title>Epitaxial Ultrathin Pt Atomic Layers on Crn Nanoparticles Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The construction of platinum (Pt) atomic layers is an effective strategy to improve the utilization efficiency of Pt atoms in electrocatalysis, thus is important for reducing the capital costs of a wide range of energy storage and conversion devices. However, the substrates used to grow Pt atomic layers are largely limited to noble metals and their alloys, which is not conducive to reducing catalyst costs. Herein, low&#8208;cost chromium nitride (CrN) was utilized as a support for the loading of epitaxial ultrathin Pt atomic layers via a simple thermal ammonolysis method. Owing to the strong anchoring and electronic regulation of Pt atomic layers by CrN, the obtained Pt&#8208;ALs/CrN electrocatalyst (containing electron&#8208;deficient Pt sites) exhibited excellent activity and endurance for the formic acid oxidation reaction, with a mass activity of 5.17 A mgPt&#8722;1 that was 13.6 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C catalyst. This novel strategy demonstrates that CrN can replace noble metals as a low&#8208;cost substrate for constructing Pt atomic layers catalysts.

         <title>Chiroptical Switching of Electrochromic Polymer Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The interaction between light and chiroptical polymers plays a crucial role in chiroptics, spintronics, and chiral&#8208;spin selectivity. Despite considerable successes in creating dissymmetric polymer films, the elucidation of chiroptical activities under electrochemical switching remains unexplored. Here we report homogeneous chiral electrochromics using chiral assembly of conjugated polymers through a transient solidification process with molecular chiral templates. In their neutral state, the chiral electrochromic polymers directly produce a remarkably dissymmetric polarization&#8208;dependent transmittance. The circular dichroism (CD) and dissymmetric transmission can be tuned by adjusting the doping level of the electrochemically active polymer films. Under high levels of oxidation, the chiroptical activities are reversed with strong bleaching in the visible, leading to formation of monosignate CD spectra over the infrared region. The matching between circular polarization handedness and chirality of chiroptical polymers makes a distinct impact on optical contrast and color switching dynamics due to the flipped chiroptical activities through polymer redox reactions. The differential circularly polarized transmission in the chiral see&#8208;through display can make a well&#8208;resolved color change in human eyes, demonstrating proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept devices for 3D imaging and information encryption. Our work serves as a foundation to develop advanced on&#8208;chip fabrication of circular polarization&#8208;multiplexed display in flexible and highly integrated platforms.

         <title>Brain&#8208;Targeted Liposomes Loaded with Monoclonal Antibodies Reduce Alpha&#8208;Synuclein Aggregation and Improve Behavioral Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors highlight a targeted drug delivery system for treating Parkinson's disease. By engineering brain&#8208;targeted liposomes with transferrin on the outer surface of the nanoparticles, and containing therapeutic antibodies, they achieve successful crossing of the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier and effective treatment of brain neurons. This approach reduces alpha&#8208;synuclein aggregation and neuroinflammation, showcasing its potential for delivering biologics in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.








Abstract
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) hold promise in treating Parkinson's disease (PD), although poor delivery to the brain hinders their therapeutic application. In the current study, it is demonstrated that brain&#8208;targeted liposomes (BTL) enhance the delivery of mAbs across the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier (BBB) and into neurons, thereby allowing the intracellular and extracellular treatment of the PD brain. BTL are decorated with transferrin to improve brain targeting through overexpressed transferrin&#8208;receptors on the BBB during PD. BTL are loaded with SynO4, a mAb that inhibits alpha&#8208;synuclein (AS) aggregation, a pathological hallmark of PD. It is shown that 100&#8208;nm BTL cross human BBB models intact and are taken up by primary neurons. Within neurons, SynO4 is released from the nanoparticles and bound to its target, thereby reducing AS aggregation, and enhancing neuronal viability. In vivo, intravenous BTL administration results in a sevenfold increase in mAbs in brain cells, decreasing AS aggregation and neuroinflammation. Treatment with BTL also improve behavioral motor function and learning ability in mice, with a favorable safety profile. Accordingly, targeted nanotechnologies offer a valuable platform for drug delivery to treat brain neurodegeneration.

         <title>Catechin&#8208;Functionalized Cationic Lipopolymer Based Multicomponent Nanomicelles for Lung&#8208;Targeting Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multicomponent nano&#8208;scaled micellar composite, Ac/Pc, consisting of catechin functionalized cationic lipopolymer (Pc) and serum albumin (Ac) is the focus of this work. The use of grafting catechins on polyelectrolyte macromolecules has resulted in the construction of a carrier with lung&#8208;targeted, effective delivery of catechins intracellularly, giving the carrier the properties of catechins, i.e., cancer cell&#8208;selective apoptosis&#8208;induction and normal cell protection. Cationic liposomes, Pc, tend to accumulate in the pulmonary microvasculature due to electrostatic effects, as well as are able to deliver the micellar system intracellularly. Albumin in the system acts as a biocompatible anti&#8208;plasma absorbent and can form complexes with positively charged Pc under electrostatic interactions, prolonging the in vivo retention time and reducing side effects.








Abstract
Catechins from green tea are one of the most effective natural compounds for cancer chemoprevention and have attracted extensive research. Cancer cell&#8208;selective apoptosis&#8208;inducing properties of catechins depend on efficient intracellular delivery. However, the low bioavailability limits the application of catechins. Herein, a nano&#8208;scaled micellar composite composed of catechin&#8208;functionalized cationic lipopolymer and serum albumin is constructed. Cationic liposomes tend to accumulate in the pulmonary microvasculature due to electrostatic effects and are able to deliver the micellar system intracellularly, thus improving the bioavailability of catechins. Albumin in the system acts as a biocompatible anti&#8208;plasma absorbent, forming complexes with positively charged lipopolymer under electrostatic interactions, contributing to prolonged in vivo retention. The physicochemical properties of the nano&#8208;micellar complexes are characterized, and the antitumor properties of catechin&#8208;functionalized materials are confirmed by reactive oxygen species (ROS), caspase&#8208;3, and cell apoptosis measurements. The role of each functional module, cationic polymeric liposome, and albumin is revealed by cell penetration, in vivo animal assays, etc. This multicomponent micellar nanocomposite has the potential to become an effective vehicle for the treatment of lung diseases such as pneumonia, lung tumors, sepsis&#8208;induced lung injury, etc. This study also demonstrates that it is a great strategy to create a delivery system that is both tissue&#8208;targeted and biologically active by combining cationic liposomes with the native bioactive compound catechins.

         <title>Augmenting Immunotherapy via Bioinspired MOF&#8208;Based ROS Homeostasis Disruptor with Nanozyme&#8208;Cascade Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart nanozyme with multiple activities, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and glutathione oxidase, is designed to reverse the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors and activate host immunity through nanozyme&#8208;mediated cascade reactions. After synergy with &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 blocking antibody, the outstanding efficacy of immunotherapy is acquired by the guide of tumor microenvironment&#8208;activated fluorescence imaging /1H/19F dual&#8208;nuclei magnetic resonance imaging.








Abstract
Despite its remarkable clinical breakthroughs, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy remains limited by the insufficient immune response in the &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor. Nanozyme&#8208;based antitumor catalysis is associated with precise immune activation in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, a cascade&#8208;augmented nanoimmunomodulator (CMZM) with multienzyme&#8208;like activities, which includes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and glutathione oxidase (GSHOx), that dissociates under an acidic and abundant GSH TME, is proposed for multimodal imaging&#8208;guided chemodynamic therapy (CDT)/photodynamic therapy (PDT) enhanced immunotherapy. Vigorous multienzyme&#8208;like activities can not only produce O2 to alleviate hypoxia and promote the polarization of M2 to M1 macrophages, but also generate ROS (&#8226;OH and 1O2) and deplete GSH in the TME to expose necrotic cell fragments and reverse immunosuppressive TME by eliciting the maturation of dendritic cells and infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in tumors. Therefore, inhibitory effects on both primary and distant tumors are achieved through synergy with an &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 blocking antibody. This cascade multienzyme&#8208;based nanoplatform provides a smart strategy for highly efficient ICB immunotherapy against &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors by revising immunosuppressive TME.

         <title>Anion Exchange Ionomers: Design Considerations and Recent Advances&#8208; an Electrochemical Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Alkaline&#8208;based electrochemical devices, such as anion exchange membrane fuel cells and electrolysers, are receiving increasing attention. However, while the catalysts and membrane have been methodically studied, the ionomer has been largely overlooked. In fact, most of the studies in alkaline electrolytes have been conducted using the commercial proton exchange ionomer Nafion. The ionomer does not only provide ionic conductivity, but it is essential for gas transport and water management, as well as controlling the mechanical stability and the morphology of the catalyst layer. Moreover, the ionomer has distinct requirement that differ from those of anion&#8208;exchange membranes, such as a high gas permeability, and that depend on the specific electrode, such as water management. As a result, it is necessary to tailor the ionomer structure to the specific application, in isolation and as part of the catalyst layer. In this review, we will provide an overview of the current state of the art for anion exchange ionomers, summarizing their specific requirements and limitations in the context of AEM electrolysers and fuel cells.

         <title>Room&#8208;temperature Van Der Waals Ferromagnet Switching by Spin&#8208;Orbit Torques</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Emerging wide varieties of the van der Waals (vdW) magnets with atomically thin and smooth interfaces holds great promise for next&#8208;generation spintronic devices. However, due to the lower Curie temperature of the vdW ferromagnets than room temperature, electrically manipulating its magnetization at room temperature has not been realized. In this work, we demonstrate the perpendicular magnetization of vdW ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 can be effectively switched at room temperature in Fe3GaTe2/Pt bilayer by spin&#8208;orbit torques (SOTs) with a relatively low current density of 1.3&#215;107A/cm2. Moreover, the high SOT efficiency of &#958;DL&#8764;0.28${\xi }_{DL}\sim 0.28$ is quantitatively determined by harmonic measurements, which is higher than those in Pt&#8208;based heavy metal/conventional ferromagnet devices. Our findings of room&#8208;temperature vdW ferromagnet switching by SOTs provide a significant basis for the development of vdW&#8208;ferromagnet&#8208;based spintronic applications.

         <title>Charge Density Wave Order and Electronic Phase Transitions in a Dilute d&#8208;Band Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The observation of charge density wave (CDW) order and a series of hysteretic phase transitions are reported in a dilute d&#8208;band semiconductor, BaTiS3. The combined experimental and theoretical investigations suggest the role of electron&#8211;phonon coupling and non&#8208;negligible electron&#8211;electron interactions. This work opens new opportunites for exploring CDW&#160;physics in the dilute filling limit and developing novel electronic devices.








Abstract
As one of the most fundamental physical phenomena, charge density wave (CDW) order predominantly occurs in metallic systems such as quasi&#8208;1D metals, doped cuprates, and transition metal dichalcogenides, where it is well understood in terms of Fermi surface nesting and electron&#8211;phonon coupling mechanisms. On the other hand, CDW phenomena in semiconducting systems, particularly at the low carrier concentration limit, are less common and feature intricate characteristics, which often necessitate the exploration of novel mechanisms, such as electron&#8211;hole coupling or Mott physics, to explain. In this study, an approach combining electrical transport, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, and density&#8208;functional theory calculations is used to investigate CDW order and a series of hysteretic phase transitions in a dilute d&#8208;band semiconductor, BaTiS3. These experimental and theoretical findings suggest that the observed CDW order and phase transitions in BaTiS3 may be attributed to both electron&#8211;phonon coupling and non&#8208;negligible electron&#8211;electron interactions in the system. This work highlights BaTiS3 as a unique platform to explore CDW physics and novel electronic phases in the dilute filling limit and opens new opportunities for developing novel electronic devices.

         <title>Intermediates Regulation via Electron&#8208;Deficient Cu Sites for Selective Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu/Co0.85SeVSe nanosheets for catalyzing NO3RR are developed by introducing Cu dopants and Se vacancies into Cu0.85Se to efficiently enhance electron transfer from Cu to Co through the bridging Se atoms, leading to the formation of deficient electronic Cu sites that accelerate NO3&#8722; dissociation and eventually facilitate the NO3RR process.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3), known as one of the fundamental raw materials for manufacturing commodities such as chemical fertilizers, dyes, ammunitions, pharmaceuticals, and textiles, exhibits a high hydrogen storage capacity of &#8776;17.75%. Electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO3RR) to valuable ammonia at ambient conditions is a promising strategy to facilitate the artificial nitrogen cycle. Herein, copper&#8208;doped cobalt selenide nanosheets with selenium vacancies are reported as a robust and highly efficient electrocatalyst for the reduction of nitrate to ammonia, exhibiting a maximum Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;93.5% and an ammonia yield rate of 2360&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.60&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. The in situ spectroscopical and theoretical study demonstrates that the incorporation of Cu dopants and Se vacancies into cobalt selenide efficiently enhances the electron transfer from Cu to Co atoms via the bridging Se atoms, forming the electron&#8208;deficient structure at Cu sites to accelerate NO3&#8722; dissociation and stabilize the *NO2 intermediates, eventually achieving selective catalysis in the entire NO3RR process to produce ammonia efficiently.

         <title>Marriage of High&#8208;Throughput Gradient Surface Generation With Statistical Learning for the Rational Design of Functionalized Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the marriage of gradient surface generation with statistical learning, a strategy of biomaterial rational design is developed. The parameter combinations are screened in a high&#8208;throughput fashion, and the optimal conditions beyond the experimentally tested range are extrapolated. Subsequently, an unprecedented ternary functionalized surface is designed for orthopedic implant, with optimal osteogenic, angiogenic, and neurogenic activities.








Abstract
Functional biomaterial is already an important aspect in modern therapeutics; yet, the design of novel multi&#8208;functional biomaterial is still a challenging task nowadays. When several biofunctional components are present, the complexity that arises from their combinations and interactions will lead to tedious trial&#8208;and&#8208;error screening. In this work, a novel strategy of biomaterial rational design through the marriage of gradient surface generation with statistical learning is presented. Not only can parameter combinations be screened in a high&#8208;throughput fashion, but also the optimal conditions beyond the experimentally tested range can be extrapolated from the models. The power of the strategy is demonstrated in rationally designing an unprecedented ternary functionalized surface for orthopedic implant, with optimal osteogenic, angiogenic, and neurogenic activities, and its optimality and the best osteointegration promotion are confirmed in vitro and in vivo, respectively. The presented strategy is expected to open up new possibilities in the rational design of biomaterials.

         <title>Layered Inorganic Silicate Aerogel Pillared by Nanoclusters for High Temperature Thermal Insulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered inorganic silicate aerogel pillared with nanoclusters has been developed for high temperature thermal insulation. The well dispersed and strong coupled nanocluster pillars in the interlayers not only significantly decrease the solid thermal conductivity but also maintain the layered structure under high temperatures.








Abstract
Layered inorganic material, with large&#8208;area interlayer surface and interface, provides an essential material platform for constructing new configuration of functional materials. Herein, a layered material pillared with nanoclusters realizing high temperature thermal insulation performance is demonstrated for the first time. Specifically, systematic synchrotron radiation spectroscopy and finite element calculation analysis show that ZrOx nanoclusters served as &#8220;pillars&#8221; to effectively produce porous structures with enough boundary defect while maintaining the layered structure, thereby significantly reducing solid state thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.32&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, 298&#8211;573&#160;K). Moreover, the layered inorganic silicate material assembled aerogel also exhibits superior thermal insulation performance from room temperature (0.034&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, 298&#160;K, air conditions) to high temperature (0.187&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, 1073&#160;K, air conditions) and largely enhanced compressive strength (42&#160;kPa at 80% compression), which is the best layered material&#8208;based aerogel that has achieved synergistic improvement in thermal and mechanical performance so far. Layered inorganic silicate aerogel pillared by nanoclusters will pave a new avenue for the design of advanced thermal insulation materials under extreme conditions.

         <title>Bioactivable STING Nanoagonists to Synergize NIR&#8208;II Mild Photothermal Therapy Primed Robust and Long&#8208;Term Anticancer Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extracellular matrix anchoring stimulator of interferon genes agonist&#8208;based photoimmunothernostic nanomedicine is developed, which can be activated by NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided mild photothermal therapy&#8208;induced neutrophilic inflammation. In orthotopic breast tumors, this strategy leads to the mice regaining tumor&#8208;free survival of at least 2 months. In addition, the immune&#8208;mediated abscopal effect shows inhibition of the distant solid tumor growth.








Abstract
Pharmacological activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway has become a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy. However, the insufficient tumorous accumulation, rapid clearance, and short duration of drug efficacy in the tumor microenvironment of small structural STING agonists greatly compromise the therapeutic efficacy. Herein, a tumorous extracellular matrix (ECM) is presented anchoring STING agonist&#8208;based photoimmunothernostic nanomedicine (SAPTN) that can be activated by mild&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy (mild PTT) induced neutrophilic inflammation. The SAPTN owns second window near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) photonics properties fitting for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided cancer therapy. The aggregates SAPTN targeting to the ECM provide slow and continuous release of potent STING agonists diABZIs. The mild PTT and long&#8208;lasting STING agonists released in the ECM synergistically&#160;prime systematic, robust, and long&#8208;term anticancer immunity. In a tumor model, this approach leads to complete tumor eradication in about 100% of mice with orthotopic breast tumors, and the mice regained tumor&#8208;free survival of at least 2 months. In addition, the immune&#8208;mediated abscopal effect shows inhibition of the distant solid tumor growth by intratumoral administration of SAPTN with laser irradiation. Overall, this approach represents a generalized photoactivable nanomedicine to prime anticancer immunity for improved cancer theranostics.

         <title>Breaking the Trade&#8208;Off Between Polymer Dielectric Constant and Loss via Aluminum Oxo Macrocycle Dopants for High&#8208;Performance Neuromorphic Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping the polymer dielectrics with structurally precise Aluminum Oxo Macrocycles successfully breaks the inherent trade&#8208;off between dielectric constant and loss. The resulting hybrid dielectrics enable high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistors, ultralow power synapses (0.9&#160;fJ&#160;spike&#8722;1) with photoelectric synergistic modulation, and flexible artificial neuromorphic retinas capable of recognizing handwritten numbers with a high accuracy of 91.15% via in&#8208;sensor reservoir computing.








Abstract
The dielectric layer is crucial in regulating the overall performance of field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs), the key component in central processing units, sensors, and displays. Despite considerable efforts being devoted to developing high&#8208;permittivity (k) dielectrics, limited progress is made due to the inherent trade&#8208;off between dielectric constant and loss. Here, a solution is presented by designing a monodispersed disk&#8208;shaped Ce&#8211;Al&#8211;O&#8208;macrocycle as a dopant in polymer dielectrics. The molecule features a central Ce(III) core connected with eight Al atoms through sixteen bridging hydroxyls and eight 3&#8208;aminophenyl peripheries. The incorporation of this macrocycle in polymer dielectrics results in an up to sevenfold increase in dielectric constants and up to 89% reduction in dielectric loss at low frequencies. Moreover, the leakage&#8208;current densities decrease, and the breakdown strengths are improved by 63%. Relying on the above merits, FETs bearing cluster&#8208;doped polymer dielectrics give near three&#8208;orders source&#8208;drain current increments while maintaining low&#8208;level leakage/off currents, resulting in much higher charge&#8208;carrier mobilities (up to 2.45&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1) and on/off ratios. This cluster&#8208;doping strategy is generalizable and shows great promise for ultralow&#8208;power photoelectric synapses and neuromorphic retinas. This work successfully breaks the trade&#8208;off between dielectric constant and loss and offers a unique design for polymer composite dielectrics.

         <title>Recent Progress in Functional Nanomaterials towards the Storage, Separation, and Removal of Tritium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tritium is a prime fuel to generate fusion power, but its storage and separation in pure form are major challenges in nuclear industries. This review discusses recent progress and main research trends in hydrogen isotope storage and separation while emphasizing tritium using metal hydrides, nanoporous zeolites, and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and 2&#8208;D layered graphene, h&#8208;BN, and MXenes based on their diverse functionalities.








Abstract
Tritium is a sustainable next&#8208;generation prime fuel for generating nuclear energy through fusion reactions to fulfill the increasing global energy demand. Owing to the scarcity&#8211;high demand tradeoff, tritium must be bred inside a fusion reactor to ensure sustainability and must therefore be separated from its isotopes (protium and deuterium) in pure form, stored safely, and supplied on demand. Existing multistage isotope separation technologies exhibit low separation efficiency and require intensive energy inputs and large capital investments. Furthermore, tritium&#8208;contaminated heavy water constitutes a major fraction of nuclear waste, and accidents like the one at Fukushima Daiichi leave behind thousands of tons of diluted tritiated water, whose removal is beneficial from an environmental point of view. In this review, the recent progress and main research trends in hydrogen isotope storage and separation by focusing on the use of metal hydride (e.g., intermetallic, and high&#8208;entropy alloys), porous (e.g., zeolites and metal organic frameworks (MOFs)), and 2&#8208;D layered (e.g., graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), and MXenes) materials to separate and store tritium based on their diverse functionalities are discussed. Finally, the challenges and future directions for implementing tritium storage and separation are summarized in the reviewed materials.

         <title>Cellular Membrane&#8208;Engineered Nanovesicles as a Three&#8208;Stage Booster to Target&#160;the Lesion Core</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For targeted delivery to the lesion core of injured myocardium, a cellular membrane&#8208;engineered nanovesicle (CMEV) is constructed by integrating a neutrophil membrane, specific antibody, and gelled drug&#8208;loaded core as a three&#8208;stage booster. CMEV enhances the efficacy of catestatin in improving cardiomyocyte apoptosis, excessive fibrosis, macrophage polarization, and angiogenesis. Thus, CMEV significantly ameliorates cardiac function and adverse remodeling to treat ischemic cardiomyopathy.








Abstract
The lesion core is the area with the most serious injury and vigorous repair. Existing nanocarriers are difficult to break through the targeted delivery to the lesion core for precise treatment in the intracellular and extracellular microenvironment. Herein, a cellular membrane&#8208;engineered nanovesicle (CMEV) with a hierarchical structure is constructed using the double emulsion&#8208;extrusion method by integrating a neutrophil membrane, functional antibody, and gelled drug&#8208;loaded core as a three&#8208;stage booster to target the lesion core and deliver catestatin (CST), a small therapeutic peptide, for ischemic cardiomyopathy therapy. By coating the neutrophil membrane outside the shell, CMEV is endowed with the function of neutrophil&#8208;like migration to achieve the first stage of tissue targeting. Based on the specific anchoring to injured myocardium, a myosin light chain 3 (MLC3) antibody is embedded to fulfill the second stage of CMEV accumulation in the lesion core. The gelled core containing CST&#8208;sodium alginate (NaAlg) with a pH&#8208;responsive shell is prepared by ionic cross&#8208;linking to accomplish the third stage of precise CST administration. Triggered by the microenvironment, NaAlg electrostatically adheres to the lesion core for sustained release, enhancing the efficacy of CST in improving cardiomyocyte apoptosis, excessive fibrosis, macrophage polarization, and angiogenesis. Thus, the &#8220;three&#8208;stage booster&#8221; nanovesicle significantly ameliorates cardiac function and adverse remodeling to treat ischemic cardiomyopathy.

CMEV enhances the efficacy of catestatin in improving cardiomyocyte apoptosis, excessive fibrosis, macrophage polarization, and angiogenesis. Thus, CMEV significantly ameliorates cardiac function and adverse remodeling to treat ischemic cardiomyopathy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesion core is the area with the most serious injury and vigorous repair. Existing nanocarriers are difficult to break through the targeted delivery to the lesion core for precise treatment in the intracellular and extracellular microenvironment. Herein, a cellular membrane-engineered nanovesicle (CMEV) with a hierarchical structure is constructed using the double emulsion-extrusion method by integrating a neutrophil membrane, functional antibody, and gelled drug-loaded core as a three-stage booster to target the lesion core and deliver catestatin (CST), a small therapeutic peptide, for ischemic cardiomyopathy therapy. By coating the neutrophil membrane outside the shell, CMEV is endowed with the function of neutrophil-like migration to achieve the first stage of tissue targeting. Based on the specific anchoring to injured myocardium, a myosin light chain 3 (MLC3) antibody is embedded to fulfill the second stage of CMEV accumulation in the lesion core. The gelled core containing CST-sodium alginate (NaAlg) with a pH-responsive shell is prepared by ionic cross-linking to accomplish the third stage of precise CST administration. Triggered by the microenvironment, NaAlg electrostatically adheres to the lesion core for sustained release, enhancing the efficacy of CST in improving cardiomyocyte apoptosis, excessive fibrosis, macrophage polarization, and angiogenesis. Thus, the &#8220;three-stage booster&#8221; nanovesicle significantly ameliorates cardiac function and adverse remodeling to treat ischemic cardiomyopathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Targeted Exosome Therapeutic Confers Both CfDNA Scavenging and Macrophage Polarization for Ameliorating Rheumatoid Arthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel therapeutic MEX+cP is constructed by utilizing M2 macrophage&#8208;derived exosome as a chassis, which is modified with oligolysine and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)&#8208;cleavable polyethylene glycol. After intravenous injection into a collagen&#8208;induced arthritis (CIA) animal model, MEX+cP enriches at inflamed joints, wherein MMP cleavage exposes MEX+ to exert both cfDNA scavenging and M1&#8208;to&#8208;M2 polarization for efficiently ameliorating CIA.








Abstract
Only a minority of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients achieve disease remission, so the exploration of additional pathogenic factors and the development of new therapeutics are needed. Here, strong correlations among the cell&#8208;free DNA (cfDNA) level and the inflammatory response in clinical synovial fluid samples and RA disease activity are discovered. The important role of cfDNA in disease development in a collagen&#8208;induced arthritis (CIA) murine model is also demonstrated. Building on these findings, a novel therapeutic based on anti&#8208;inflammatory (M2) macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes as chassis, that are modified with both oligolysine and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)&#8208;cleavable polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the membrane, is developed. After intravenous injection, PEG&#8208;enabled prolonged circulation and C&#9472;C motif chemokine ligand&#8208;directed accumulation together result in enrichment at inflamed joints. Following subsequent MMP cleavage, the positively charged oligolysine is exposed for cfDNA scavenging, while exosomes induce M2 polarization. By using a classical CIA murine model and a newly established CIA canine model, it is demonstrated that the rationally designed exosome therapeutic substantially suppresses inflammation in joints and provides strong chondroprotection and osteoprotection, revealing its potential for effective CIA amelioration.

         <title>Introducing a Phenyl End Group in the Inner Side Chains of A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A Acceptors Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells Processed with Nonhalogenated Solvent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new small molecule acceptors Y6&#8208;Ph and L8&#8208;Ph with phenyl&#8208;alkyl inner side chains are synthesized. The results show that the phenyl&#8208;alkyl side chains can suppress the molecular excessive aggregation and make the molecular packing more orderly under the long&#8208;time film&#8208;forming process with nonhalogenated solvents processing. Therefore, the L8&#8208;Ph&#8208;based organic solar cells processed by o&#8208;xylene achieve a high power conversion efficiency of 18.40%.








Abstract
Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) processed by nonhalogenated solvents is unsatisfactory due to the unfavorable morphology. Herein, two new small molecule acceptors&#160;(SMAs) Y6&#8208;Ph and L8&#8208;Ph are synthesized by introducing a phenyl end group in the inner side chains of the SMAs of Y6 and L8&#8208;BO, respectively, for overcoming the excessive aggregation of SMAs in the long&#8208;time film forming processed by nonhalogenated solvents. First, the effect of the film forming time on the aggregation property and photovoltaic performance of Y6, L8&#8208;BO, Y6&#8208;Ph, and L8&#8208;Ph is studied by using the commonly used solvents: chloroform (CF) (rapid film forming process) and chlorobenzene (CB) (slow film forming process). It is&#160;found that Y6&#8208; and L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based OSCs exhibit a dramatic drop in PCE&#160;from CF&#8208; to CB&#8208;processed devices owing to the large phase separation, while the Y6&#8208;Ph and L8&#8208;Ph based OSCs show obviously increased PCEs Furthermore, L8&#8208;Ph&#8208;based OSCs processed by nonhalogenated solvent o&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) achieved a high PCE of 18.40% with an FF of 80.11%. The results indicate that introducing a phenyl end group in the inner side chains is an effective strategy to modulate the morphology and improve the photovoltaic performance of the OSCs processed by nonhalogenated solvents.

         <title>Exploring the Role of Spatial Confinement in Immune Cell Recruitment and Regeneration of Skin Wounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study shows that spatial confinement within microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffolds modulates immune cell recruitment in vivo in wounds and implants. MAP scaffolds impart regenerative wound healing with an IgG1&#8208;biased Th2 response. MAP scaffolds made with large microgels (130 &#181;m) promote a balanced pro&#8208;regenerative macrophage response, resulting in enhanced wound healing with mature collagen regeneration and reduced inflammation levels.








Abstract
Microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffolds are injectable granular materials comprised of micron sized hydrogel particles (microgels). The diameter of these microgels directly determines the size of the interconnected void space between particles where infiltrating or encapsulated cells reside. This tunable porosity allows the authors to use MAP scaffolds to study the impact of spatial confinement (SC) on both cellular behaviors and the host response to biomaterials. Despite previous studies showing that pore size and SC influence cellular phenotypes, including mitigating macrophage inflammatory response, there is still a gap in knowledge regarding how SC within a biomaterial modulates immune cell recruitment in vivo in wounds and implants. Thus, the immune cell profile within confined and unconfined biomaterials is studied using small (40&#160;&#181;m), medium (70&#160;&#181;m), and large (130&#160;&#181;m) diameter spherical microgels, respectively. This work uncovered that MAP scaffolds impart regenerative wound healing with an IgG1&#8208;biased Th2 response. MAP scaffolds made with large microgels promote a balanced pro&#8208;regenerative macrophage response, resulting in enhanced wound healing with mature collagen regeneration and reduced inflammation levels.

         <title>The State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;Art Solution&#8208;Processed Single Component Organic Photodetectors Achieved by Strong Quenching of Intermolecular Emissive State and High Quadrupole Moment in Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient solution&#8208;processed single&#8208;component organic photodetectors using non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with strong donor/acceptor character are demonstrated. Efficient photocurrent generation is achieved via strong quenching of intermolecular charge transfer excitonic (CTE) states by electric field and CTE dissociation due to large interfacial energetic offset induced by high quadrupole moments of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors.








Abstract
A bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) blend is commonly used as the photoactive layer in organic photodetectors (OPDs) to utilize the donor (D)/acceptor (A) interfacial energetic offset for exciton dissociation. However, this strategy often complicates optimization procedures, raising serious concerns over device processability, reproducibility, and stability. Herein, highly efficient OPDs fabricated with single&#8208;component organic semiconductors are demonstrated via solution&#8208;processing. The non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with strong intrinsic D/A character are used as the photoactive layer, where the emissive intermolecular charge transfer excitonic (CTE) states are formed within &lt;1&#160;ps, and efficient photocurrent generation is achieved via strong quenching of these CTE states by reverse bias. Y6 and IT&#8208;4F&#8208;based OPDs show excellent OPD performances, low dark current density (&#8776;10&#8722;9 A cm&#8722;2), high responsivity (&#8805;0.15 A W&#8722;1), high specific detectivity (&gt;1012 Jones), and fast photo&#8208;response time (&lt;10 &#181;s), comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art BHJ OPDs. Together with strong CTE state quenching by electric field, these excellent OPD performances are also attributed to the high quadrupole moments of NFA molecules, which can lead to large interfacial energetic offset for efficient CTE dissociation. This work opens a new way to realize efficient OPDs using single&#8208;component systems via solution&#8208;processing and provides important molecular design rules.

         <title>Regulating Isolated&#8208;Molecular and Aggregated&#8208;State Phosphorescence for Multicolor Afterglow by Photoactivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general principle is proposed to design color&#8208;tunable phosphorescence with isolated&#8208;molecular and aggregated&#8208;state emitting centers. The isolated&#8208;molecular phosphorescence lifetime in 1,3,6,8&#8208;pyrene tetra sulfonic acid tetrasodium salt (PTA)/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) film can reach 1735.71 ms with minimal influence on aggregated&#8208;state phosphorescence after photo&#8208;activation. Moreover, multi&#8208;color afterglow display, ultraviolet detection, and multilevel information encryption are demonstrated based on these materials.








Abstract
Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) materials have attracted considerable attention in recent years. Herein, a new type of flexible films is fabricated by doping amphipathic pyrene tetrasulfonic acid sodium salts into amorphous poly(vinyl alcohol) matrix, which enables the realization of color&#8208;tunable UOP spanning from orange&#8208;red to green after excitation light is switched off. Interestingly, precise control of the proportion of isolated&#8208;molecular and aggregated&#8208;state phosphorescence is demonstrated for colorful afterglow using photo&#8208;activation. An increase in the dynamic phosphorescence lifetime of isolated molecules is observed from 894.75 to 1735.71 ms following an 8 min irradiation under ambient conditions. The photo&#8208;activation, however, showed little influence on aggreated&#8208;state phosphorescence. This flexible and processable film exhibits versatile applications in multicolor afterglow displays, ultraviolet detection, multilevel information encryption, etc. This study not only provides a strategy for the rational regulation of UOP colors but also expands the application potential of color&#8208;tunable UOP materials.

         <title>Suppression of Interphase Dissolution Via Solvent Molecule Tuning for Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;solvation and thermal&#8208;stable electrolyte is proposed for highly reliable sodium metal batteries via solvent molecule tuning, which induces a low solubility interphase and tailored solvation sheath of Na+ ions. These synergistically minimize the dissolution of solid electrolyte interphase, self&#8208;discharge, and passivate the hyper&#8208;active metallic Na anode at both room and high temperatures.








Abstract
Solvent molecule tuning is used to alter the redox potentials of solvents or ion&#8208;solvent binding energy for high&#8208;voltage or low&#8208;temperature electrolytes. Herein, an electrolyte design strategy that effectively suppresses solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) dissolution and passivates highly&#8208;reactive metallic Na anode via solvent molecule tuning is proposed. With rationally lengthened phosphate backbones with &#9472;CH2&#9472; units, the low&#8208;solvation tris(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) phosphate (TOP) molecule effectively weakens the solvation ability of carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, reduces the free solvent ratio, and enables an anion&#8208;enriched primary Na+ ion solvation sheath. The decreased free solvent and compact lower&#8208;solubility interphase established in this electrolyte prevent electrodes from continuous SEI dissolution and parasitic reactions at both room temperature (RT) and high temperature (HT). As a result, the Na/Na3V2(PO4)3 cell with the new electrolyte achieves impressive cycling stability of 95.7% capacity retention after 1800 cycles at 25 &#176;C and 62.1% capacity retention after 700 cycles at 60&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the TOP&#160;molecule not only maintains the nonflammable feature of phosphate but also attains higher thermal stability, which endows the electrolyte with high safety and thermal stability. This design concept for electrolytes offers a promising path to long&#8208;cycling and high&#8208;safety&#160;sodium metal batteries.

         <title>Natural Wood&#8208;Derived Macroporous Cellulose for Highly Efficient and Ultrafast Elimination of Double&#8208;Stranded RNA from In Vitro&#8208;Transcribed mRNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a highly efficient and ultrafast method for dsRNA elimination using natural wood&#8208;derived macroporous cellulose (WMC). Scalable mRNA purification can be also achieved by integrating a WMC&#8208;filled column with fast&#8208;protein liquid chromoatography. WMC purification improves the enhanced green fluorescent protein&#160;mRNA expression efficiency and significantly reduces cytokine secretion and innate immune responses in the cells.








Abstract
Double&#8208;stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a major impurity that can induce innate immune responses and cause adverse drug reactions. Removing dsRNA is an essential and non&#8208;trivial process in manufacturing mRNA. Current methods for dsRNA elimination use either high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography or microcrystalline cellulose, rendering the process complex, expensive, toxic, and/or time&#8208;consuming. This study introduces a highly efficient and ultrafast method for dsRNA elimination using natural wood&#8208;derived macroporous cellulose (WMC). With a naturally formed large total pore area and low tortuosity, WMC removes up to 98% dsRNA within 5&#160;min. This significantly shortens the time for mRNA purification and improves purification efficiency. WMC can also be filled into chromatographic columns of different sizes and integrates with fast&#8208;protein liquid chromatography for large&#8208;scale mRNA purification to meet the requirements of mRNA manufacture. This study further shows that WMC purification improves the enhanced green fluorescent protein mRNA expression efficiency by over 28% and significantly reduces cytokine secretion and innate immune responses in the cells. Successfully applying WMC provides an ultrafast and efficient platform for mRNA purification, enabling large&#8208;scale production with significant cost reduction.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer&#8211;Liquid Metal Composite: Ultrafast, Untethered, and Programmable Actuation by Induction Heating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The liquid crystal elastomer&#8211;liquid metal (LCE&#8208;LM) composite consists of LM embedded between LCE layers enabling ultrafast, reversible, and programmable actuation by eddy current induction heating. It integrates selective and sequential heating functions that are further exploited for multimodal pop&#8208;up deformation, on&#8208;ground omnidirectional robotic motion, and in&#8208;water object manipulation and crawling.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are a class of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that have been intensively studied for applications including artificial muscles, shape morphing structures, and soft robotics due to their capability of large, programmable, and fully reversible actuation strains. To fully take advantage of LCEs, rapid, untethered, and programmable actuation methods are highly desirable. Here, a liquid crystal elastomer&#8208;liquid metal (LCE&#8208;LM) composite is reported, which enables ultrafast and programmable actuations by eddy current induction heating. The composite consists of LM sandwiched between two LCE layers printed via direct ink writing (DIW). When subjected to a high&#8208;frequency alternating magnetic field, the composite is actuated in milliseconds. By moving the magnetic field, the eddy current is spatially controlled for selective actuation. Additionally, sequential actuation is achievable by programming the LM thickness distribution in a sample. With these capabilities, the LCE&#8208;LM composite is further exploited for multimodal deformation of a pop&#8208;up structure, on&#8208;ground omnidirectional robotic motion, and in&#8208;water targeted object manipulation and crawling.

         <title>Ultrasonic Field Induces Better Crystallinity and Abundant Defects at Grain Boundaries to Develop CuS Electromagnetic Wave Absorber</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrasonic induced&#8208;cavitation effect can significantly promote CuS crystallization and lead to the accumulation of S defects at grain boundaries. As a result, the CuS with nitrate precursor under USF (UNCu) shows the optimum effective absorption bandwidth of 10.24&#160;GHz at a thickness of 3.5&#160;mm, which is 228.6% more than the WUNCu (absence of USF).








Abstract
Ultrasonic field (USF) is widely used to regulate the intrinsic properties of materials that are not applied in electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption. One reason is that the lack of a response mechanism for the materials to USF hinders the expansion of their EMW absorption performance. Therefore, to address this issue, a series of CuS nanoparticles with diverse anions are&#160;constructed in the presence or absence of USF. The ultrasonic&#8208;induced cavitation effect can significantly promote CuS crystallization and lead to the accumulation of S defects at the grain boundaries (GBs). Furthermore, the S defects at the GBs are&#160;easily oriented and arranged, allowing the polarization relaxation retention to be maintained at 10&#160;wt%. Consequently, the CuS with a nitrate precursor under USF shows an optimum effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 10.24&#160;GHz at a thickness of 3.5&#160;mm, which is&#160;228.6% more than that without the USF. CuS with a chloride precursor also achieves an EAB of 3.92&#160;GHz, even at a considerably low filler ratio. Thus, this&#160;study demonstrates the response mechanism of diverse anions to the USF for the first time and provides a novel technique to optimize the EMW absorption performance of semiconductors.

Consequently, the CuS with a nitrate precursor under USF shows an optimum effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 10.24&#160;GHz at a thickness of 3.5&#160;mm, which is&#160;228.6% more than that without the USF. CuS with a chloride precursor also achieves an EAB of 3.92&#160;GHz, even at a considerably low filler ratio. Thus, this&#160;study demonstrates the response mechanism of diverse anions to the USF for the first time and provides a novel technique to optimize the EMW absorption performance of semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Operational Stability by Cavity Control of Single&#8208;Layer Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy to improve the operational stability of single&#8208;layer organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence is introduced by increasing the emissive layer thickness to the second&#8208;order interference maximum, leading to devices with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 16% and LT50 at 100&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 close to 90&#160;000&#160;h.








Abstract
Highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters are realized in recent years, but the device lifetime needs further improvement for practical display or lighting applications. In this work, a device design principle is presented by tuning the optical cavity of single&#8208;layer undoped devices, to realize efficient and long&#8208;lived TADF OLEDs. Extending the cavity length to the second&#8208;order interference maximum by increasing the emissive layer thickness broadens the recombination zone, while the optical outcoupling efficiency remains close to that of the thinner first&#8208;order devices. Such a device design leads to efficient and stable single&#8208;layer undoped OLEDs with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 16%, an LT90 of 452&#160;h, and an LT50 of 3693&#160;h at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which is doubled compared to the first&#8208;order counterparts. It is further demonstrated that the widely&#8208;used empirical relation between OLED lifetime and light intensity originates from triplet&#8211;polaron annihilation, resulting in an extrapolated LT50 at 100&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 of close to 90&#160;000&#160;h, approaching the demands for practical backlight applications.

         <title>Isomerized Green Solid Additive Engineering for Thermally Stable and Eco&#8208;Friendly All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Approaching 19% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isomerized solid additive engineering based on volatile dithienothiophene (DTT) isomers is empolyed to achieve a remarkable PCE of 18.72% for all&#8208;PSCs processed with green solvent. More importantly, the all&#8208;PSCs fabricated with this approach offer excellent compatibility with large&#8208;area blade&#8208;coating techniques, and demonstrate exceptional thermal stability with extrapolated T80 lifetime of 14&#160;000&#160;h.








Abstract
Laboratory&#8208;scale all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have exhibited remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 19%. However, the utilization of hazardous solvents and nonvolatile liquid additives poses challenges for eco&#8208;friendly commercialization, resulting in&#160;the trade&#8208;off between device efficiency and operation stability. Herein, an innovative approach based on isomerized solid additive engineering is proposed, employing volatile dithienothiophene (DTT) isomers to modulate intermolecular interactions and facilitate molecular stacking within the photoactive layers. Through elucidating the underlying principles of the DTT&#8208;induced polymer assembly on molecular level, a PCE of 18.72% is achieved for devices processed with environmentally benign solvents, ranking it among the highest record values for eco&#8208;friendly all&#8208;PSCs. Significantly, such superiorities of the DTT&#8208;isomerized strategy afford excellent compatibility with large&#8208;area blade&#8208;coating techniques, offering a promising pathway for industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing of all&#8208;PSCs. Moreover, these devices demonstrate enhanced thermal stability with a promising extrapolated T80 lifetime of 14&#160;000&#160;h, further bolstering their potential for sustainable technological advancement.

         <title>Wet&#8208;Adaptive Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wet&#8208;adaptive electronic skin (WADE&#8208;skin) is developed, which consists of a next&#8208;to&#8208;skin wet&#8208;adhesive fibrous layer, a next&#8208;to&#8208;air waterproof fibrous layer, and a stretchable and permeable liquid metal electrode layer. This WADE&#8208;skin simultaneously achieves superb stretchability, wet adhesion, permeability, biocompatibility, and waterproof property, enabling stable device performance and comfortable wearing for underwater electrocardiogram detection and human&#8208;machine interactions.








Abstract
Skin electronics provides remarkable opportunities for non&#8208;invasive and long&#8208;term monitoring of a wide variety of biophysical and physiological signals that are closely related to health, medicine, and human&#8208;machine interactions. Nevertheless, conventional skin electronics fabricated on elastic thin films are difficult to adapt to the wet microenvironments of the skin: Elastic thin films are non&#8208;permeable, which block the skin perspiration; Elastic thin films are difficult to adhere to wet skin; Most skin electronics are difficult to work underwater. Here, a Wet&#8208;Adaptive Electronic Skin (WADE&#8208;skin) is reported, which consists of a next&#8208;to&#8208;skin wet&#8208;adhesive fibrous layer, a next&#8208;to&#8208;air waterproof fibrous layer, and a stretchable and permeable liquid metal electrode layer. While the electronic functionality is determined by the electrode design, this WADE&#8208;skin simultaneously offers superb stretchability, wet adhesion, permeability, biocompatibility, and waterproof property. The WADE&#8208;skin can rapidly adhere to human skin after contact for a few seconds and stably maintain the adhesion over weeks even under wet conditions, without showing any negative effect to the skin health. The use of WADE&#8208;skin is demonstrated for the stable recording of electrocardiogram during intensive sweating as well as underwater activities, and as the strain sensor for the underwater operation of virtual reality&#8208;mediated human&#8208;machine interactions.

         <title>Regulating Lithium Transfer Pathway to Avoid Capacity Fading of Nano Si Through Sub&#8208;Nano Scale Interfused SiOx/C Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SiOx/C coating has electron/ion dual transport paths and robust mechanical flexibility, enabling a fast and stable lithium diffusion pathway towards encapsulated Si. A fast reaction kinetics, stable SEI, and an antiagglomeration distinction are realized, endowing the obtained Si@SiOx/C composite anode material with a high capacity and prolonged lifespan.








Abstract
Si nanoparticles (NPs) are considered as a promising high&#8208;capacity anode material owing to their ability to prevent mechanical failure from drastic volume change during (de)lithiation. However, upon cycling, a quick capacity fading is still observed for Si NPs, and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this contribution, it is demonstrated that the quick capacity fading is mainly caused by the generation of dead (electrochemically inert) Si with blocked electron conductivity in a densely composited Si/SEI (solid electrolyte interface) hybrid. This is due to the combined influence of electrolyte&#8208;related side reactions and the accompanied agglomeration of Si NPs. A compact, sub&#8208;nano scale interfused SiOx/C composite coating onto the Si NPs is constructed, and a highly stabilized electrochemistry is achieved upon long cycling. The SiOx/C coating with electron/ion dual transport paths and robust mechanical flexibility enables a fast and stable lithium ion/electron dual diffusion pathway towards the encapsulated Si. With fast reaction kinetics, stable SEI, and an antiagglomeration feature, the obtained Si@SiOx/C composite demonstrates a stable high capacity. This work unravels new perspectives on the capacity fading of Si NPs and provides an effective encapsulating method to remedy the structure degradation and capacity fading of nano Si.

According to the manipulation of the ionization and de&#8208;ionization processe of oxygen vacancies within the Ga2O3, the device shows fast photoresponse at low voltages and persistent photoconductivity behavior at high voltages. Accordingly, various functions of the photodetector and neuromorphic vision sensor are achieved by one device and switched via bias voltage regulation.








Abstract
Simultaneous implementation of photodetector and neuromorphic vision sensor (NVS) on a single device faces a great challenge, due to the inherent speed discrepancy in their photoresponse characteristics. In this work, a trench&#8208;bridged GaN/Ga2O3/GaN back&#8208;to&#8208;back double heterojunction array device is fabricated to enable the advanced functionalities of both devices on a single device. Interestingly, the device shows fast photoresponse and persistent photoconductivity behavior at low and high voltages, respectively, through the modulation of oxygen vacancy ionization and de&#8208;ionization processes in Ga2O3. Consequently, the role of the optoelectronic device can be altered between the photodetector and NVS by simply adjusting the magnitude of bias voltage. As a photodetector, the device is able to realize fast optical imaging and optical communication functions. On the other hand, the device exhibits outstanding image sensing, image memory, and neuromorphic visual pre&#8208;processing as an NVS. The utilization of NVS for image pre&#8208;processing leads to a noticeable enhancement in both recognition accuracy and efficiency. The results presented in this work not only offer a new avenue to obtain complex functionality on a single optoelectronic device but also provide opportunities to implement advanced robotic vision systems and neuromorphic computing.

         <title>KERS&#8208;Inspired Nanostructured Mineral Coatings Boost IFN&#8208;&#947; mRNA Therapeutic Index for Antitumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cytokines play an important role in tumor immunotherapy but are easily degraded. Inspired by kinetic energy recovery systems in hybrid vehicles, a cytokine efficacy recovery system is designed to substantially augment the therapeutic index of mRNA&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy via a &#8220;capture and stabilize&#8221; mechanism exerted by a nanostructured mineral coating carrying therapeutic cytokine mRNA.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;associated macrophage (TAM) reprogramming is a promising therapeutic approach for cancer immunotherapy; however, its efficacy remains modest due to the low bioactivity of the recombinant cytokines used for TAM reprogramming. mRNA therapeutics are capable of generating fully functional proteins for various therapeutic purposes but accused for its poor sustainability. Inspired by kinetic energy recovery systems (KERS) in hybrid vehicles, a cytokine efficacy recovery system (CERS) is designed to substantially augment the therapeutic index of mRNA&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy via a &#8220;capture and stabilize&#8221; mechanism exerted by a nanostructured mineral coating carrying therapeutic cytokine mRNA. CERS remarkably recycles nearly 40% expressed cytokines by capturing them onto the mineral coating to extend its therapeutic timeframe, further polarizing the macrophages to strengthen their tumoricidal activity and activate adaptive immunity against tumors. Notably, interferon&#8208;&#947; (IFN&#8208;&#947;) produced by CERS exhibits &#8776;42&#8208;fold higher biological activity than recombinant IFN&#8208;&#947;, remarkably decreasing the required IFN&#8208;&#947; dosage for TAM reprogramming. In tumor&#8208;bearing mice, IFN&#8208;&#947; cmRNA@CERS effectively polarizes TAMs to inhibit osteosarcoma progression. When combined with the PD&#8208;L1 monoclonal antibody, IFN&#8208;&#947; cmRNA@CERS significantly boosts antitumor immune responses, and substantially prevents malignant lung metastases. Thus, CERS&#8208;mediated mRNA delivery represents a promising strategy to boost antitumor immunity for tumor treatment.

         <title>A &#8220;Trinity&#8221; Design of Li&#8208;O2 Battery Engaging the Slow&#8208;Release Capsule of Redox Mediators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart &#8220;trinity&#8221; design of Li&#8208;O2 battery is initiated by employing hollow cobalt metal organic frameworks impregnating iodized polypyrrole simultaneously for cathode catalyst, anode protection, and slow&#8208;release redox mediators (RM). Mechanistic investigations assert the critical role of RM&#8208;mediated solution growth of crystalline Li2O2 to greatly boost both the capacity and cycling reversibility.








Abstract
Nonaqueous Li&#8208;O2 battery (LOB) represents one of the promising next&#8208;gen energy storage solutions owing to its ultrahigh energy density but suffers from problems such as high charging overpotential, slow redox kinetics, Li anode corrosion, etc., calling for a systemic optimization of the battery configuration and structural components. Herein, an ingenious &#8220;trinity&#8221; design of LOB is initiated by implementing a hollowed cobalt metal organic framework (MOF) impregnating iodized polypyrrole simultaneously as the cathode catalyst, anode protection layer, and slow&#8208;release capsule of redox mediators, so as to systemically address issues of impeded mass transport and redox kinetics on the cathode, dendrite growth, and surface corrosion on the anode, as well as limited intermediate solubility in the low donor&#8208;number (DN) solvent. As a result of the systemic effort, the LOB constructed demonstrates an ultralow discharge/charge polarization of 0.2&#160;V, prolonged cycle life of 1244&#160;h and total discharge capacity of 28.41&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. Mechanistic investigations attribute the superb LOB performance to the redox&#8208;mediated solution growth mechanism of crystalline Li2O2 with both enhanced reaction kinetics and reversibility. This study offers a paradigm in designing smart materials to raise the performance bar of Li&#8208;O2 battery toward realistic applications.

         <title>Processable Hydroxide Ink with Oriented Microstructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pinpoints the inner relationship between the microstructure and rheology as well as the mechanical engineering, achieving the fabrication of hydroxide production including continuous fiber, meter&#8208;level film, and free&#8208;standing aerogel. Also, the enlarge&#8208;batch fabrication (capacity of 10&#160;L) of hydroxide is successfully executed, paving the way for further practical application of hydroxide&#8208;based production in the foreseeable future.








Abstract
The intrinsic poor processability of hydroxide originating from the structural property greatly hinders their practical applications. Here, a processable highly&#8208;concentrated nickel/cobalt double hydroxide ink is reported to meet the practical demand. The inner nanoflakes in ink possess a high width/thickness ratio (&gt;100), which endows the highly&#8208;concentrated ink (60&#160;mg&#160;mL&#8722;1) with liquid&#8208;like rheology properties. Further, the elliptical diffusive arc in small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering pattern and porous and ordered alignment morphology in cryogenic temperature scanning electron microscopy confirms the locally oriented arrangement of nanoflakes in the ink. Benefiting from this interior&#8208;ordered structure, the ink can be processed into meter&#8208;level film, continuous yarn, and rigid and free&#8208;standing aerogel, respectively. In particular, the films can be used as electrodes directly in aqueous zinc ion batteries and deliver a favorable capacity (382&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 @ 200&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1) as well as long cycle stability (capacity retention rate of 88% @ 1000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 after 400&#160;cycles). Moreover, the enlarged&#8208;batched fabrication with the introduction of efficient thermal conduction in a 10&#160;L reactor is also carried out successfully. These results clarify the inner relationship between microstructure&#8208;rheology and mechanical engineering for hydroxides, thus paving the way to develop hydroxide&#8208;based products for future practical applications.

         <title>An Integrative Bioorthogonal Nanoengineering Strategy for Dynamically Constructing Heterogenous Tumor Spheroids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioorthogonal nanoengineering strategy (BONE) is developed for building photothermal dynamic tumor spheroids. In this process, biosynthetic machinery incorporated bioorthogonal azide reporters into cell surface glycoconjugates, followed by reacting with a multivalent click ligand (ClickRod). BONE not only effectively assembled multiple types of cells together, but dynamically regulated cell fates under light stimulation, which together enhanced the development of tumor models.








Abstract
Although tumor models have revolutionized perspectives on cancer aetiology and treatment, current cell culture methods remain challenges in constructing organotypic tumor with in vivo&#8208;like complexity, especially native characteristics, leading to unpredictable results for in vivo responses. Herein, the bioorthogonal nanoengineering strategy (BONE) for building photothermal dynamic tumor spheroids is developed. In this process, biosynthetic machinery incorporated bioorthogonal azide reporters into cell surface glycoconjugates, followed by reacting with multivalent click ligand (ClickRod) that is composed of hyaluronic acid&#8208;functionalized gold nanorod carrying dibenzocyclooctyne moieties, resulting in rapid construction of tumor spheroids. BONE can effectively assemble different cancer cells and immune cells together to construct heterogenous tumor spheroids is identified. Particularly, ClickRod exhibited favorable photothermal activity, which precisely promoted cell activity and shaped physiological microenvironment, leading to formation of dynamic features of original tumor, such as heterogeneous cell population and pluripotency, different maturation levels, and physiological gradients. Importantly, BONE not only offered a promising platform for investigating tumorigenesis and therapeutic response, but also improved establishment of subcutaneous xenograft model under mild photo&#8208;stimulation, thereby significantly advancing cancer research. Therefore, the first bioorthogonal nanoengineering strategy for developing dynamic tumor models, which have the potential for bridging gaps between in vitro and in vivo research is presented.

In this process, biosynthetic machinery incorporated bioorthogonal azide reporters into cell surface glycoconjugates, followed by reacting with multivalent click ligand (ClickRod) that is composed of hyaluronic acid-functionalized gold nanorod carrying dibenzocyclooctyne moieties, resulting in rapid construction of tumor spheroids. BONE can effectively assemble different cancer cells and immune cells together to construct heterogenous tumor spheroids is identified. Particularly, ClickRod exhibited favorable photothermal activity, which precisely promoted cell activity and shaped physiological microenvironment, leading to formation of dynamic features of original tumor, such as heterogeneous cell population and pluripotency, different maturation levels, and physiological gradients. Importantly, BONE not only offered a promising platform for investigating tumorigenesis and therapeutic response, but also improved establishment of subcutaneous xenograft model under mild photo-stimulation, thereby significantly advancing cancer research. Therefore, the first bioorthogonal nanoengineering strategy for developing dynamic tumor models, which have the potential for bridging gaps between in vitro and in vivo research is presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A General and Convenient Peptide Self&#8208;Assembling Mechanism for Developing Supramolecular Versatile Nanomaterials Based on The Biosynthetic Hybrid Amyloid&#8208;Resilin Protein</title>

Abstract
Self&#8208;assembling peptides are valuable building blocks to fabricate supramolecular biomaterials, which have attracted great attention due to their broad applications ranging from biomedicine to biotechnology. However, the limited choice of an analogous method to induce a desired set of globular proteins into peptide hydrogels hinders these designs. In addition, it is vital to impart numerous macroscopic material properties in one material, which are essential for successful tissue engineering or biomedical applications. Here, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;implement and tunable self&#8208;assembling strategy, which employs Ure2 amyloidogenic peptide, was described to induce any target proteins of choice to assemble into supramolecular hydrogels alone or in combination with notable compositional control. Furthermore, through fusing the amyloidogenic peptide with different kinds of resilin&#8208;like polypeptides, the collective effect of nanoscale interactions among amyloid nanofibrils and partially disordered elastomeric polypeptides, which consisted of folded globular GB1 domain and a consensus repeat from the unstructured resilin, was investigated. This led to many useful macroscopic material properties simultaneously emerging from one pure protein material, i.e., strong adhesion to any substrates under wet conditions, rapidly self&#8208;assembling into robust and porous hydrogels, adaptation to remodeling processes, strongly promoting cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, we demonstrated this supramolecular material's robust performance in vitro and vivo for tissue engineering, cosmetic and hemostasis applications and exhibited superior performance compared to corresponding commercial counterparts. To the best of our knowledge, few pure protein&#8208;based materials could meet such seemingly mutually exclusive properties simultaneously. Such versatility renders this novel supramolecular nanomaterial as next&#8208;generation functional protein&#8208;based materials, and we demonstrated the sequence level modulation of structural order and disorder as an untapped principle for the design of new proteins.

         <title>Phenylboronic Acid Functionalized Calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;based Solid&#8208;State Supramolecular Electrolyte</title>

Abstract
Solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) suffer from the low ionic conductivity and poor capability of suppressing lithium (Li) dendrites, which limits their utility in the preparation of all solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). We report here a flexible solid supramolecular electrolyte that incorporates a new anion capture agent, namely a phenylboronic acid functionalized calix[4]pyrrole (C4P), into a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) matrix. The resulting solid&#8208;state supramolecular electrolyte demonstrated high ionic conductivity (1.9 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 60&#176;C) and a high Li+ transference number (tLi+ = 0.70). Furthermore, the assembled Li|C4P&#8208;PEO&#8208;LiTFSI|LiFePO4 cell allowed for stable cycling over 1200 cycles at 1 C at 60&#176;C, as well as good rate performance. The favorable performance of the C4P&#8208;PEO&#8208;LiTFSI SPE leads us to suggest it could prove useful in the creation of high energy density solid&#8208;state LMBs.

         <title>A Non&#8208;Expendable Leveler as Electrolyte Additive Enabling Homogenous Lithium Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A leveling agent of 4,6&#8208;Dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;Mercaptopyrimidine (DMP) typically used in the copper electroplating industry is selected as a non&#8208;expendable electrolyte additive for Li metal anodes. The DMP leveler successfully adjusts the solvation structure due to strong coordination ability and absorbs on Li metal forming a functional molecular layer. Consequently, the Li deposition is flat, dendrite&#8208;free, and less by&#8208;products from interfacial side reactions.








Abstract
Li metal anodes are extensively studied owing to their unparalleled advantages in achieving high energy density. However, safety issues originating from dendritic Li growth are always a huge hindrance for applications in Li metal batteries (LMBs). In this study, a functional additive, 4,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;mercaptopyrimidine (DMP), which is a typical leveler in the copper electroplating industry, is selected to suppress Li dendrite formation. Various Li&#8208;metal&#8208;based batteries are systematically investigated and they show stable performances, such as excellent cycling stability above 800&#160;h at 3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in Li||Li cells and 400 cycles with high coulombic efficiencies (CEs &gt;98%) at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in Li||Cu cells. Furthermore, a comprehensive verification of the protective mechanism induced by the DMP leveling agent shows that the leveler updated the Li+ solvation structure and occupied the inner Helmholtz plane of the Li anode. The planar DMP molecular layer absorbed on the surface of the Li metal can suppress side reactions and modify the Li deposition behavior via steric hindrance, inducing homogeneous Li deposition. Interestingly, the DMP leveler does not participate in the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase. This study can stimulate further ideas on non&#8208;depleting but effective levelers as electrolyte additives for high&#8208;performance LMBs.

         <title>Bionic Micro&#8208;Texture Duplication and RE3+ Space&#8208;Selective Doping of Unclonable Silica Nanocomposites for Multilevel Encryption and Intelligent Authentication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicolor micro&#8208;texture&#8208;based physical unclonable functions fluorescence glass labels (MTPLs) are exploited by RE3+ space&#8208;selective doping and soft replication method. The prepared micro&#8208;scale MTPLs possess tunable multilevel authentication models, including macro&#8208;scale multicolor fluorescent 2D patterns, micro&#8208;scale pattern, color 3D information, and intelligence authentication. A high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform with interactive authentication also is established for multilevel encryption and intelligent authentication.








Abstract
High&#8208;capacity optical data storage and information encryption by using glass substrates are fascinating due to merits of expanding the functionality and applicability of the optoelectronic field. However, the development of glass substrate&#8208;based multi&#8208;dimensional information encryption methods has remained a challenge because of the high hardness, brittleness and melting temperature of glasses. Herein, inspired by the unique natural structure of plant leaves, multicolor micro&#8208;texture&#8208;based physical unclonable functions (PUFs) fluorescence glass labels (MTPLs) are exploited by using ultraviolet photocurable silica nanocomposites and soft replication method. It is the first time that simultaneous rare&#8208;earth ion (RE3+) space&#8208;selective doping and bionic micro&#8208;texture replication onto transparent glass have been realized, in which the doping position and fluorescence color of RE3+ and height information of unclonable micro&#8208;texture can be selectively equipped for multilevel information encryption. The prepared micro&#8208;scale MTPLs are endowed with tunable multilevel authentication models, including macro&#8208;scale multicolor fluorescent 2D patterns, micro&#8208;scale pattern, color 3D information and intelligence authentication. A high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform with interactive authentication is also established based on the high robustness and security of MTPLs. Such unclonable bionic MTPLs based on RE3+ space&#8208;selective doping and micro&#8208;texture duplication provide an effective and potentially universal approach for multilevel encryption and intelligent authentication.

         <title>Understanding Microstructural Development of Perovskite Crystallization for High Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enhanced interaction between 4&#8242;&#8208;cyanogroup&#8208;[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8722;4&#8208;acyl acrylate and PbI2 during annealing leads to the formation of a new intermediate complex, which not only induces diffusion&#8208;controlled growth but also increases diffusion activation energy, leading to delayed crystallization. Therefore, the optimized device has high efficiency (24.53%) and excellent stability (maintaining 89% of the initial efficiency after 6600 h aging in ambient).








Abstract
Solution crystallization in film devices has attracted broad interest from various fields such as perovskite solar cells.

&lt;p&gt;The enhanced interaction between 4&#8242;-cyanogroup-[1,1&#8242;-biphenyl]&#8722;4-acyl acrylate and PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during annealing leads to the formation of a new intermediate complex, which not only induces diffusion-controlled growth but also increases diffusion activation energy, leading to delayed crystallization. Therefore, the optimized device has high efficiency (24.53%) and excellent stability (maintaining 89% of the initial efficiency after 6600 h aging in ambient).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution crystallization in film devices has attracted broad interest from various fields such as perovskite solar cells. However, the detailed perovskite crystallization kinetics remain unclear due to the difficulty of in situ observation of grain cluster growth during annealing. This article presents the development of an in situ laser scanning confocal polarized microscopy with a temperature-controlled stage to observe nucleation and growth of perovskite crystal clusters. It is found that enhanced interactions by a liquid crystal with perovskite form a new intermediate complex that induces diffusion-controlled growth according to Avrami equation. The retarded cluster growth (63&#160;nm s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) originates from enlarged diffusion activation energy 40&#160;kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; compared with 152&#160;nm s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 37&#160;kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for the Control film during annealing. Finally, the optimized perovskite films with enhanced crystallographic and optical characteristics are applied in solar cells to achieve a champion efficiency of 24.53% with open circuit voltage of 1.172&#160;V and fill factor of 82.78%.

         <title>A Mediator&#8208;Free Multi&#8208;Ply Biofuel Cell Using an Interfacial Assembly between Hydrophilic Enzymes and Hydrophobic Conductive Oxide Nanoparticles with Pointed Apexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a groundbreaking mediator&#8208;free hybrid biofuel cell that demonstrates exceptional performance is introduced. Through a multi&#8208;ply electrode design and an innovative assembly approach involving hydrophobic conductive oxide nanoparticles with distinct shapes and hydrophilic glucose oxidases, significant enhancements in power output and operation stability are achieved for cotton fiber&#8208;based biofuel cells.








Abstract
Biofuel cells (BFCs) based on enzymatic electrodes hold great promise as power sources for biomedical devices. However, their practical use is hindered by low electron transfer efficiency and poor operational stability of enzymatic electrodes. Here, a novel mediator&#8208;free multi&#8208;ply BFC that overcomes these limitations and exhibits both substantially high&#8208;power output and long&#8208;term operational stability is presented. The approach involves the utilization of interfacial interaction&#8208;induced assembly between hydrophilic glucose oxidase (GOx) and hydrophobic conductive indium tin oxide nanoparticles (ITO NPs) with distinctive shapes, along with a multi&#8208;ply electrode system. For the preparation of the anode, GOx and oleylamine&#8208;stabilized ITO NPs with bipod/tripod type are covalently assembled onto the host fiber electrode composed of multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes and gold (Au)&#160;NPs. Remarkably, despite the contrasting hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties, this interfacial assembly approach allows for the formation of nanoblended GOx/ITO NP film, enabling efficient electron transfer within the anode. Additionally, the cathode is prepared by sputtering Pt onto the host electrode. Furthermore, the multi&#8208;ply fiber electrode system exhibits unprecedented high&#8208;power output (&#8776;10.4&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and excellent operational stability (2.1&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, &#8776;49% after 60 days of continuous operation). The approach can provide a basis for the development of high&#8208;performance BFCs.

         <title>Integrating Liquification of the Gelated Tumor Interstitium around Nanomedicines with Biconditional GD2&#8208;Targeting for Precise and Safe Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasma protein&#8208;like nanomedicine p(EK&#8208;co&#8208;C&#8208;SPA&#8208;ss&#8208;Dox) is developed to enable the integration of all&#8208;barrier&#8208;penetration with active targeting in a single nanodelivery system. Moreover, it is revealed both mechanisms: liquification of surrounding gelated water molecules by zwitterionic p(EK) shell to overcome diffusion barrier in polysaccharide&#8208;gel&#8208;filling tumor&#160;interstitium, and pH&#8208;triggered targeting to GD2&#8208;overexpressed solid tumor by a negative&#8208;biased zwitterionic shell of nanomedicine.








Abstract
The quick diffusion of nanomedicines in the polysaccharide&#8208;gel&#8208;filling tumor interstitium and precise active targeting are two major obstacles that have not yet been overcome. Here, a poly(L&#8208;glutamyl&#8208;L&#8208;lysine(EK) (p(EK))&#8208;camouflaged, doxorubicin (Dox)&#8208;conjugated nanomedicine is developed to demonstrate the underlying mechanism of zwitterionic shell in synchronous barrier&#8208;penetration and biconditional active targeting. The zwitterionic p(EK) shell liquifies its surrounding water molecules in the polysaccharide gel of tumor&#160;interstitium, leading to five times faster diffusion than the pegylated Doxil with similar size in tumor tissue. Its doped sulfonate groups lead to more precise active tumor&#8208;targeting than disialoganglioside (GD2) antibody by meeting the dual requirements of tumor microenvironment (TME) pH and overexpression of GD2 on tumor. Consequently, the concentrations of the nanomedicine in tumor are always higher than in life&#8208;supported organs in whole accumulation process, reaching over ten times higher Dox in GD2&#8208;overexpressing MCF&#8208;7 tumors than in life&#8208;supporting organs. Furthermore, the nanomedicine also avoids anti&#8208;GD2&#8208;like accumulation in GD2&#8208;expressing kidney in a mouse model. Thus, the nanomedicine expands the therapeutic window of Doxil by more than three times and eliminates tumors with negligible myocardial and acute toxicity. This new insight paves an avenue to design nanodelivery systems for highly precise and safe chemotherapy.

         <title>Highly Efficient Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells Enabled by Mixed&#8208;Cation Surface Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel and effective mixed&#8208;cation passivation system (CE) to synergically passivate various types of traps in wide&#8208;Eg perovskite, resulting in a record open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of wide&#8208;Eg PVSCs (1.35&#160;V) and a high fill factor (FF) of 83.29%. These improvements lead to a record PCE of 24.47% when applied to fabricated perovskite/organic tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (POTSCs) are gaining attention due to their easy fabrication, potential to surpass the S&#8208;Q limit, and superior flexibility. However, the low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of wide bandgap (Eg) perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have hindered their development. This work presents a novel and effective mixed&#8208;cation passivation strategy (CE) to passivate various types of traps in wide&#8208;Eg perovskite. The complementary effect of 4&#8208;trifluoro phenethylammonium (CF3&#8208;PEA+, denoted as CA+) and ethylenediammonium (EDA2+, denoted as EA2+) reduces both electron/hole defect densities and non&#8208;radiative recombination rate, resulting in a record open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of wide&#8208;Eg PVSCs (1.35&#160;V) and a high fill factor (FF) of 83.29%. These improvements lead to a record PCE of 24.47% when applied to fabricated POTSCs, the highest PCE to date. Furthermore, unencapsulated POTSCs exhibit excellent photo and thermal stability, retaining over 90% of their initial PCE after maximum power point (MPP) tracking or exposure to 60&#160;&#176;C for 500&#160;h. These findings imply that the synergic effect of surface passivators is a promising strategy to achieve high&#8208;efficiency and stable wide&#8208;Eg PVSCs and corresponding POTSCs.

         <title>Precisely Inhibiting Excessive Intestinal Epithelial Cell Apoptosis to Efficiently Treat Inflammatory Bowel Disease with Oral Pifithrin&#8208;&#945; Embedded Nanomedicine (OPEN)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
OPEN can effectively target IBD lesions and slowly release PFT&#945;. OPEN specifically targets p53 signaling, inhibits excessive apoptosis of IECs in IBD lesions, and plays a role in promoting intestinal epithelial barrier repair, anti&#8208;inflammation, and regulating intestinal microbiome, while having good biocompatibility.








Abstract
The increased incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has seriously affected the life quality of patients. IBD develops due to excessive intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) apoptosis, disrupting the gut barrier, colonizing harmful bacteria, and initiating persistent inflammation. The current therapeutic approaches that reduce inflammation are limited. Although IBD can be treated significantly by directly preventing IEC apoptosis, achieving this therapeutic approach remains challenging. Accordingly, the authors are the first to develop an oral pifithrin&#8208;&#945; (PFT&#945;, a highly specific p53 inhibitor) embedded nanomedicine (OPEN) to effectively treat IBD by inhibiting excessive IEC apoptosis. As a major hub for various stressors, p53 is a central determinant of cell fate, and its inhibition can effectively reduce excessive IEC apoptosis. The tailored OPEN can precisely inhibit the off&#8208;target and inactivation resulting from PFT&#945; entry into the bloodstream. Subsequently, it persistently targets IBD lesions with high specificity to inhibit the pathological events caused by excessive IEC apoptosis. Eventually, OPEN exerts a significant curative effect compared with the clinical first&#8208;line drugs 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid (5&#8208;ASA) and dexamethasone (DEX). Consequently, the OPEN therapeutic strategy provides new insights into comprehensive IBD therapy.

&lt;p&gt;The increased incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has seriously affected the life quality of patients. IBD develops due to excessive intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) apoptosis, disrupting the gut barrier, colonizing harmful bacteria, and initiating persistent inflammation. The current therapeutic approaches that reduce inflammation are limited. Although IBD can be treated significantly by directly preventing IEC apoptosis, achieving this therapeutic approach remains challenging. Accordingly, the authors are the first to develop an oral pifithrin-&#945; (PFT&#945;, a highly specific p53 inhibitor) embedded nanomedicine (OPEN) to effectively treat IBD by inhibiting excessive IEC apoptosis. As a major hub for various stressors, p53 is a central determinant of cell fate, and its inhibition can effectively reduce excessive IEC apoptosis. The tailored OPEN can precisely inhibit the off-target and inactivation resulting from PFT&#945; entry into the bloodstream. Subsequently, it persistently targets IBD lesions with high specificity to inhibit the pathological events caused by excessive IEC apoptosis. Eventually, OPEN exerts a significant curative effect compared with the clinical first-line drugs 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and dexamethasone (DEX). Consequently, the OPEN therapeutic strategy provides new insights into comprehensive IBD therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Adsorption and Proton Chemistry of Ultra&#8208;Stabilized Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Manganese Dioxide Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structural stability strategy is proposed to inhibit the dissolution of MnO2 in Zn&#8208;based aqueous devices and provide atomic insights. Meanwhile, the storage mechanism of proton chemistry and Zn ion surface adsorption in CoxMnO2 is revealed. Moreover, the mechanism of the influence of the anode selection on the surface adsorption process is studied.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable Zinc (Zn) batteries incorporating MnO2 cathodes possess favorable sustainability properties and are being considered for low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;safety energy storage. However, unstable electrode structures and unclear charge storage mechanisms limit their development. Here, advanced transmission electron microscopy, electrochemical analysis, and theoretical calculations are utilized to study the working mechanisms of a Zn/MnO2 battery with a Co2+&#8208;stabilized, tunnel&#8208;structured &#945;&#8208;MnO2 cathode (CoxMnO2). It is shown that Co2+ can be pre&#8208;intercalated into &#945;&#8208;MnO2 and occupy the (2&#160;&#215;&#160;2) tunnel structure, which improves the structural stability of MnO2, facilitates the proton diffusion and Zn2+ adsorption on the MnO2 surface upon battery cycling. It is further revealed that for the MnO2 cathode, the charge storage reaction proceeds mainly by proton intercalation with the formation of &#945;&#8208;HyCoxMnO2, and that the anode design (with or without Zn metal) affects the surface adsorption of by&#8208;product Zn4SO4(OH)6&#183;nH2O on MnO2 surface. This work advances the fundamental understanding of rechargeable Zn batteries and also sheds light on efficient electrode modifications toward performance enhancement.

         <title>Highly Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Self&#8208;Assembled Colloidal Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through modification of the substrate's surface properties and control of the interactions among colloidal quantum wells, self&#8208;assembled of the layer with an exceptionally high distribution of in&#8208;plane transitions dipole moment of 95% is successfully realized. Incorporation of the novel hole transfer layer PF8Cz effectively suppresses electron leakage, which leads to the high&#8208;performance light&#8208;emitting diodes with a peak external quantum efficiency of 26.9%.








Abstract
Nanocrystal&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (Nc&#8208;LEDs) have immense potential for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;definition displays and lighting applications. They offer numerous advantages, such as low cost, high luminous efficiency, narrow emission, and long lifetime. However, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of Nc&#8208;LEDs, typically employing isotropic nanocrystals, is limited by the out&#8208;coupling factor. Here efficient, bright, and long lifetime red Nc&#8208;LEDs based on anisotropic nanocrystals of colloidal quantum wells (CQWs) are demonstrated. Through modification of the substrate's surface properties and control of the interactions among CQWs, a self&#8208;assembled layer with an exceptionally high distribution of in&#8208;plane transitions dipole moment of 95%, resulting in an out&#8208;coupling factor of 37% is successfully spin&#8208;coated. The devices exhibit a remarkable peak EQE of 26.9%, accompanied by a maximum brightness of 55&#160;754&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a long operational lifetime (T95@100&#160;cd m&#8722;2) over 15&#160;000&#160;h. These achievements represent a significant advancement compared to previous studies on Nc&#8208;LEDs incorporating anisotropic nanocrystals. The work is expected to provide a general self&#8208;assembly strategy for enhancing the light extraction efficiency of Nc&#8208;LEDs based on anisotropic nanocrystals.

         <title>Highly Efficient Nitrogen&#8208;Fixing Microbial Hydrogel Device for Sustainable Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microbial device, designed to operate at the air&#8208;water interface, facilitates concomitant supply of gaseous reactants, smooth capture of gaseous products, and efficient sunlight delivery. Efficient nitrogen fixation and hydrogen generation, low fabrication cost, and mechanical durability corroborate the potential of the floatable microbial device toward practical and sustainable solar energy conversion.








Abstract
Conversion of sunlight and organic carbon substrates to sustainable energy sources through microbial metabolism has great potential for the renewable energy industry. Despite recent progress in microbial photosynthesis, the development of microbial platforms that warrant efficient and scalable fuel production remains in its infancy. Efficient transfer and retrieval of gaseous reactants and products to and from microbes are particular hurdles. Here, inspired by water lily leaves floating on water, a microbial device designed to operate at the air&#8211;water interface and facilitate concomitant supply of gaseous reactants, smooth capture of gaseous products, and efficient sunlight delivery is presented. The floatable device carrying Rhodopseudomonas parapalustris, of which nitrogen fixation activity is first determined through this study, exhibits a hydrogen production rate of 104&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;m&#8722;2, which is 53 times higher than that of a conventional device placed at a depth of 2&#160;cm in the medium. Furthermore, a scaled&#8208;up device with an area of 144 cm2 generates hydrogen at a high rate of 1.52 L&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;m&#8722;2. Efficient nitrogen fixation and hydrogen generation, low fabrication cost, and mechanical durability corroborate the potential of the floatable microbial device toward practical and sustainable solar energy conversion.

         <title>Enantioselective Oral Absorption of Molecular Chiral Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
l&#8208;tartaric acid modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (l&#8208;CMSNs) performs better in the sequential oral absorption processes than those of the d&#8208;chiral (d&#8208;CMSN), racemic (Dl&#8208;CMSN), and achiral (MSN) counterparts via multiple chiral recognition mechanisms, and ultimately undertaking the responsibility of efficient oral drug delivery. These findings validate the dominant role of chirality in determining the biological fate of nanocarriers.








Abstract
Inspired by the unique pharmacological effects of chiral drugs in the asymmetrical body environments, it is assumed that the chirality of nanocarriers is also a key factor to determine their oral adsorption efficiency, apart from their size, shape, etc. Herein, l/d&#8208;tartaric acid modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (l/d&#8208;CMSNs) are fabricated via a one&#8208;pot cocondensation method, and focused on whether the oral adsorption of nanocarriers will be benefited from their chirality. It is found that l&#8208;CMSN performed better in the sequential oral absorption processes, including mucus permeation, mucosa bio&#8208;adhesion, cellular uptake, intestinal transport and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) retention, than those of the d&#8208;chiral (d&#8208;CMSN), racemic (dl&#8208;CMSN), and achiral (MSN) counterparts. The multiple chiral recognition mechanisms are experimentally and theoretically demonstrated following simple differential adsorption on biointerfaces, wherein electrostatic interaction is the dominant energy. During the oral delivery task, l&#8208;CMSN, which is proven to be stable, nonirritative, biocompatible, and biodegradable, is efficiently absorbed into the blood (1.72&#8211;2.05&#8208;fold higher than other nanocarriers), and helps the loaded doxorubicin (DOX) to achieve better intestinal transport (2.32&#8211;27.03&#8208;times higher than other samples), satisfactory bioavailability (449.73%) and stronger antitumor effect (up to 95.43%). These findings validated the dominant role of chirality in determining the biological fate of nanocarriers.

During the oral delivery task, &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l-&lt;/span&gt;CMSN, which is proven to be stable, nonirritative, biocompatible, and biodegradable, is efficiently absorbed into the blood (1.72&#8211;2.05-fold higher than other nanocarriers), and helps the loaded doxorubicin (DOX) to achieve better intestinal transport (2.32&#8211;27.03-times higher than other samples), satisfactory bioavailability (449.73%) and stronger antitumor effect (up to 95.43%). These findings validated the dominant role of chirality in determining the biological fate of nanocarriers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sugar&#8208;derived Nanocrystalline Graphite Matrix C/C Composites With Excellent Ablative Resistance At 3000 &#730;c</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sugars are renewable resources essential to human life, but they are rarely used as raw materials for the industrial production of carbon&#8208;based materials, especially for the preparation of carbon fibre&#8208;reinforced carbon&#8208;matrix (C/C) composites, which are extremely useful for the semiconductor and aerospace sectors. Herein, we report a method utilizing sugar&#8208;derived carbon to replace petrochemicals as dense matrix to preparing C/C composites. The matrix from sugar&#8208;derived C/C (S&#8208;C/C) composites has a nanocrystalline graphite structure that is highly thermally stable and effectively bonded to the carbon fibres. The mechanical properties of the S&#8208;C/C composite are comparable to those prepared from petrochemical sources; significantly, it exhibits a linear ablation rate of 0.03 mm s&#8722;1 after 200 s of ablation at 3000&#176;C in 10 MW m&#8722;2 heat flux. This new class of S&#8208;C/C is promising for use in a broad range of fields, ranging from semiconductor to aerospace.

&lt;p&gt;Sugars are renewable resources essential to human life, but they are rarely used as raw materials for the industrial production of carbon-based materials, especially for the preparation of carbon fibre-reinforced carbon-matrix (C/C) composites, which are extremely useful for the semiconductor and aerospace sectors. Herein, we report a method utilizing sugar-derived carbon to replace petrochemicals as dense matrix to preparing C/C composites. The matrix from sugar-derived C/C (S-C/C) composites has a nanocrystalline graphite structure that is highly thermally stable and effectively bonded to the carbon fibres. The mechanical properties of the S-C/C composite are comparable to those prepared from petrochemical sources; significantly, it exhibits a linear ablation rate of 0.03 mm s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 200 s of ablation at 3000&#176;C in 10 MW m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; heat flux.

         <title>High&#8208;Stable Lead&#8208;Free Solar Cells Achieved by Surface Reconstruction of Quasi&#8208;2D Tin&#8208;Based Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tin halide perovskites are an appealing alternative to lead perovskites. However, owing to the lower redox potential of Sn(II)/Sn(IV), particularly under the presence of oxygen and water, the accumulation of Sn(IV) at the surface layer will negatively impact the device's performance and stability. To this end, we have introduced a novel multifunctional molecule, 1,4&#8208;phenyldimethylammonium dibromide diamine (phDMADBr), to form a self&#8208;assembly protective layer on the surface of Sn&#8208;based perovskite films. Strong interactions between phDMADBr and the perovskite surface improve electron transfer, passivating uncoordinated Sn(II), and fortify against water and oxygen. In&#8208;situ GIWAXS analysis confirms the enhanced thermal stability of the quasi&#8208;2D phase, and hence the overall enhanced stability of the perovskite. Long&#8208;term stability in devices is achieved, retaining over 90% of the original efficiency for more than 200 hours in a 10% RH moisture N2 environment. These findings propose a new approach to enhance the operational stability of Sn&#8208;based perovskite devices, offering a strategy in advancing lead&#8208;free optoelectronic applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Performing and Capacitive&#8208;Matched Triboelectric Implants Driven by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In implantable bioelectronics, which aim for semi&#8208;permanent use of devices, biosafe energy sources and packaging materials to protect devices are essential elements. However, research so far has been conducted in a direction where they cannot coexist. Here, we report the development of capacitance&#8208;matched triboelectric implants driven by ultrasound under 500&#160;mW/cm2 safe intensity and realize a battery&#8208;free, miniatured, and wireless neurostimulator with full titanium (Ti) packaging. The triboelectric implant with high dielectric composite, which has ultralow output impedance, can efficiently deliver sufficient power to generate the stimulation pulse without an energy&#8208;storing battery, despite ultrasound attenuation due to the Ti, and has the highest energy transmission efficiency among those reported so far. In vivo study using a rat model demonstrated that the proposed device system is an effective solution for relieving urinary symptoms. These achievements provide a significant step toward permanently implantable devices for controlling human organs and treating various diseases.

         <title>Heterostructured Bimetallic MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF Architectures for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electron modulation presents a captivating approach to fabricate efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), yet it remains a challenging undertaking. In this study, we propose an effective strategy to regulate the electronic structure of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by the construction of MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF heterogeneous architectures. As a representative heterogeneous architectures, MOF&#8208;74 on MOF&#8208;274 hybrids are in&#8208;situ prepared on three&#8208;dimensional (3D) metal substrates (NiFe alloy foam (NFF)) via a two&#8208;step self&#8208;assembly method, resulting in MOF&#8208;(74 + 274)@NFF. Through a combination of spectroscopic and theory calculation, our study unveils the successful modulation of the electronic property of MOF&#8208;(74 + 274)@NFF. This modulation arises from the phase conjugation of the two MOFs and the synergistic effect of the multi&#8208;metallic centers (Ni and Fe). Consequently, MOF&#8208;(74 + 274)@NFF exhibits excellent OER activity, displaying ultralow overpotentials of 198 and 223&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in the 1.0 and 0.1&#160;M KOH solutions, respectively. This work paves the way for manipulating the electronic structure of electrocatalysts to enhance their catalytic activity.

         <title>Recent Advances in Room Temperature Phosphorescence Metal&#8208;Organic Hybrids: Structures, Properties And Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic hybrid (MOH) materials with room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) have drawn numerous attentions in recent years due to their superior RTP properties of high phosphorescence efficiency and ultralong emission lifetime. Great achievement has been realized in developing MOH materials with high&#8208;performance RTP, but a systematic study on MOH materials with RTP feature is lacking. In this review, we highlighted recent advances in metal&#8208;organic hybrid RTP materials. The molecular packing, the photophysical properties and their applications of metal&#8208;organic hybrid RTP materials were discussed in detail. Metal&#8208;organic hybrid RTP materials can be divided into six parts: coordination polymers, metal organic frameworks (MOFs), metal&#8208;halide hybrids, organic ionic crystals, organic ionic polymers, and organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites. These RTP materials have been successfully applied in time&#8208;resolved data encryption, fingerprint recognition, information logic gate, X&#8208;ray image and photo&#8208;memory. This review not only provides the basic principle of designing RTP metal&#8208;organic hybrids, but also propounds the research prospect of RTP metal&#8208;organic hybrids in the future. This review offers many effective strategies for developing metal&#8208;organic hybrids with excellent RTP properties, thus satisfying the practical applications.

Abstract
Flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium ion batteries (SIBs) featuring their low&#8208;cost, high safety and excellent mechanical strength have attracted widespread interest in the field of wearable electronic devices. However, the development of such batteries faces great challenges including the construction of interfacial compatible flexible electrode materials and addressing the high safety demands of electrolyte. Here selenium&#8208;vacancies regulated bimetallic selenide heterojunctions anchored on waste cotton cloth&#8208;derived flexible carbon cloth (FCC) with robust interfacial C&#8208;Se&#8208;Co/Fe chemical bonds as a flexible anode material (CCFSF) is proposed by a one&#8208;step ultrafast and solvent&#8208;free microwave pyrolysis method. Rich selenium vacancies and CoSe2/FeSe2&#8208;x heterostructures are synchronously formed that can significantly improve ionic and electronic diffusion kinetics. Additionally, a uniform carbon layer coating on the surface of Se&#8208;deficient heterostructures endows it with outstanding structural stability, thus a high reversible area capacity of 1.65 mAh cm&#8722;2 can be obtained at a current density of 1.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 after 1000 cycles. The flexible cathode (PB@FCC) is also fabricated by directly growing Prussian blue nanoparticles on the FCC. Furthermore, an advanced flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8208;ion pouch cell is assembled by coupling CCFSF anode, PB@FCC cathode with P(VDF&#8208;HFP)&#8208;based gel polymer electrolyte. The as&#8208;constructed full cell not only demonstrates excellent energy storage performance but also robust mechanical flexibility and safety. The present work offers an effective avenue to achieve high safety flexible energy storage device, promoting the development of flexible wearable electronic devices.

         <title>Amorphous Carbon Films for Electronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 43, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces various synthetic approaches and physical properties of amorphous carbon (a&#8208;C) thin films and discusses the potential applications including hardmasks, EUV pellicles, diffusion barriers, deformable electrodes and interconnections, sensors, active layers, electrodes for energy, micro&#8208;supercapacitors, batteries, nanogenerators, EMI shielding, and nanomembranes.








Abstract
While various crystalline carbon allotropes, including graphene, have been actively investigated, amorphous carbon (a&#8208;C) thin films have received relatively little attention. The a&#8208;C is a disordered form of carbon bonding with a broad range of the C&#63743;C bond length and bond angle. Although accurate structural analysis and theoretical approaches are still insufficient, reproducible structure&#8211;property relationships have been accumulated. As the a&#8208;C thin film is now adapted as a hardmask in the semiconductor industry and new properties are reported continuously, expectations are growing that it can be practically used as active materials beyond as a simple sacrificial layer. In this perspective review article, after a brief introduction to the synthesis and properties of the a&#8208;C thin films, their potential practical applications are proposed, including hardmasks, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) pellicles, diffusion barriers, deformable electrodes and interconnects, sensors, active layers, electrodes for energy, micro&#8208;supercapacitors, batteries, nanogenerators, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, and nanomembranes. The article ends with a discussion on the technological challenges in a&#8208;C thin films.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Porosity MgO Microparticles for Heat&#8208;Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 43, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By making the MgO particles ultrahighly porous, the structural collapse due to volume changes is minimized when hydration and dehydration reactions occur. Additionally, upon using a very large reaction surface, pure MgO not only reaches 90.3% of the theoretical storage value, but also reaches a high reaction rate. The stability of the heat storage and release cycle is confirmed.








Abstract
Continuous industrial development has increased the demand of energy. Inevitably, the development of energy sources is steadily progressing using various methods. Rather than establishing a new energy source, a system for storing waste heat generated by industry has now been accepted as a useful strategy. Among such systems, the hydration and dehydration reactions of MgO/Mg(OH)2&#160;are eco&#8208;friendly, have relatively low toxicity and risk, and have a large reserves. Therefore, it is a promising candidate for a heat&#8208;storage system. In this study, ultrahigh&#8208;porosity particles are used to maximize the heat&#8208;storage efficiency of pure MgO. Due to its large surface area, the heat storage rate is 90.3% of the theoretical value and the reaction rate is very high. In addition, as structural collapse, likely to be caused by volume changes between reactions, is blocked as the porous region is filled and emptied, the cycle stability is secured. Ultrahigh&#8208;porosity MgO microparticles can be used to build eco&#8208;friendly heat&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Transition Metal Ion Doping on ZIF&#8208;8 Enhances the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 43, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron&#8208;rich sp2 C atoms of optimized copper doping on ZIF&#8208;8 lead to a local effect between the Zn&#8211;N4 and Cu&#8211;N4 moieties, achieving a maximum Faradaic efficiency for CO2 to CO of 88.5% at &#8211;1.0&#160;V (versus RHE) with a stability over 6&#160;h.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2&#160;to diverse value&#8208;added chemicals is a unique, environmentally friendly approach for curbing greenhouse gas emissions while addressing sluggish catalytic activity and low Faradaic efficiency (FE) of electrocatalysts. Here, zeolite&#8208;imidazolate&#8208;frameworks&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) containing various transition metal ions&#8212;Ni, Fe, and Cu&#8212;at varying concentrations upon doping are fabricated for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to carbon monoxide (CO) without further processing. Atom coordination environments and theoretical electrocatalytic performance are scrutinized via X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)&#160;and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Upon optimized Cu doping on ZIF&#8208;8, Cu0.5Zn0.5/ZIF&#8208;8 achieves a high partial current density of 11.57&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2 and maximum FE for CO of 88.5% at &#8211;1.0&#160;V (versus RHE) with a stable catalytic activity over 6&#160;h. Furthermore, the electron&#8208;rich sp2 C atom facilitates COOH* promotion after Cu doping of ZIF&#8208;8, leading to a local effect between the zinc&#8211;nitrogen&#160;(Zn&#8211;N4) and copper&#8211;nitrogen (Cu&#8211;N4) moieties. Additionally, the advanced CO2RR pathway is illustrated from various perspectives, including the pre&#8208;H&#8208;covered state under the CO2RR. The findings expand the pool of efficient metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based CO2RR catalysts, deeming them viable alternatives to conventional catalysts.

Additionally, the advanced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR pathway is illustrated from various perspectives, including the pre-H-covered state under the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR. The findings expand the pool of efficient metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)-based CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR catalysts, deeming them viable alternatives to conventional catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Curable Acrylic Resins toward UV&#8208;Light&#8208;Blocking Adhesives for Foldable Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 43, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new acrylic resin that can be efficiently polymerized using visible light in the presence of oxygen and UV&#8208;abosrbers is presented, which can be used to develop UV&#8208;blocking optically clear adhesives (OCAs) applicable in flexible displays. Using this system, a UV&#8208;blocking OCA that nearly meets the specifications of an OCA used in commercialized foldable smartphones is realized.








Abstract
Current technological advances in the organic light&#8208;emitting diode panel design of foldable smartphones demand advanced adhesives with UV&#8208;blocking abilities, beyond their conventional roles of bonding objects and relieving deformation stress. However, optically clear adhesives (OCAs) with UV&#8208;blocking ability cannot be prepared using conventional UV&#8208;curing methods relying on a photoinitiator. Herein, a new acrylic resin that can be efficiently cured using visible light without oxygen removal is presented, which may be used to develop UV&#8208;blocking OCAs for use in current flexible displays. A novel photocatalyst and a specific combination of additives facilitate sufficiently rapid curing under visible light in the presence of UV&#8208;absorbers. Only a very small amount of the highly active photocatalyst is required to prepare UV&#8208;blocking OCA films with very high transparency in the visible region. Using this system, a UV&#8208;blocking OCA that nearly meets the specifications of an OCA used in commercialized foldable smartphones is realized. This technology can also be utilized in other applications that require highly efficient visible light curing, such as optically clear resins, dental resins, and 3D/4D&#8208;printable materials.

         <title>Future Research Directions in Perovskite Solar Cells: Exquisite Photon Management and Thermodynamic Phase Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 43, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light management to maximize external luminescence efficiency and photon absorptivity and methodology for enthalpy&#8208;driven thermodynamic phase stability are future research directions toward extremely efficient and stable perovskite solar cells approaching theoretical power conversion efficiency.








Abstract
As power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has rapidly increased up to 25.7% in 2022, a curiosity about the achievable limit of the PCE has prevailed and demands understanding about the underlying fundamentals to step forward. Meanwhile, outstanding long&#8208;term stability of PSCs over 1000&#160;h has been reported at operating conditions or under damp heat test with 85&#160;&#176;C/85% relative humidity. Herein comes the question as to whether the phase stability issue of perovskite crystal is completely resolved in the most recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite film or if it deceives everyone into believing so by significantly slowing the kinetics. On the one hand, the fundamental origins of a discrepancy between reported values and the theoretical limit are thoroughly examined, where the importance of light management is greatly emphasized with the introduction of external luminescence as a key parameter to narrow the gap. On the other hand, the phase stability of a perovskite film is understood from thermodynamic point of view to address viable approaches to lower the Gibbs free energy, distinguishing the kinetically trapped condition from the thermodynamically stable phase.

         <title>Multiscale Architectured Membranes, Electrodes, and Transport Layers for Next&#8208;Generation Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 43, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the recent progress in the key components of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) based on a novel architecturing strategy is highlighted. Diverse multiscale architecture technologies for modifying and reconstructing the membrane, electrode, and transport layers for realizing high&#8208;performance and reliable PEMFCs, focusing on their structures and functions, are comprehensively presented.








Abstract
Over the past few decades, considerable advances have been achieved in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) based on the development of material technology. Recently, an emerging multiscale architecturing technology covering nanometer, micrometer, and millimeter scales has been regarded as an alternative strategy to overcome the hindrance to achieving high&#8208;performance and reliable PEMFCs. This review summarizes the recent progress in the key components of PEMFCs based on a novel architecture strategy. In the first section, diverse architectural methods for patterning the membrane surface with random, single&#8208;scale, and multiscale structures as well as their efficacy for improving catalyst utilization, charge transport, and water management are discussed. In the subsequent section, the electrode structures designed with 1D and 3D multiscale structures to enable low Pt usage, improve oxygen transport, and achieve high electrode durability are elucidated. Finally, recent advances in the architectured transport layer for improving mass transportation including pore gradient, perforation, and patterned wettability for gas diffusion layer and 3D structured/engineered flow fields are described.

         <title>A Reflection on Sustainable Anode Materials for Electrochemical Chloride Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 43, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of sustainable anode materials for electrochemical chlorine production is reviewed. This review summarizes the mechanism of chlorine evolution reaction and the history of the development of anode materials. In addition, the recent progress in designing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts and evaluating anode materials for industrial applications is highlighted. This review provides challenges and future perspectives for developing cost&#8208;effective and stable electrocatalysts.









Abstract
Chloride oxidation is a key industrial electrochemical process in chlorine&#8208;based chemical production and water treatment. Over the past few decades, dimensionally stable anodes (DSAs) consisting of RuO2&#8208; and IrO2&#8208;based mixed&#8208;metal oxides have been successfully commercialized in the electrochemical chloride oxidation industry. For a sustainable supply of anode materials, considerable efforts both from the scientific and industrial aspects for developing earth&#8208;abundant&#8211;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts have been made. This review first describes the history of commercial DSA fabrication and strategies to improve their efficiency and stability. Important features related to the electrocatalytic performance for chloride oxidation and reaction mechanism are then summarized. From the perspective of sustainability, recent progress in the design and fabrication of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free anode materials, as well as methods for evaluating the industrialization of novel electrocatalysts, are highlighted. Finally, future directions for developing highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for industrial chloride oxidation are proposed.

         <title>Review of Semiconductor Flash Memory Devices for Material and Process Issues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 43, October 26, 2023. </description>

V&#8208;NAND flash memory, regarding charge&#8208;trap materials (polycrystalline Si vs Si3N4&#8722;x), cell array architecture (NOR vs NAND), device configuration (2D vs 3D), and multilevel cell technologies is reviewed. Ways to overcome current challenges in materials and process technologies for 3D V&#8208;NAND are also suggested.








Abstract
Vertically integrated NAND (V&#8208;NAND) flash memory is the main data storage in modern handheld electronic devices, widening its share even in the data centers where installation and operation costs are critical. While the conventional scaling rule has been applied down to the design rule of &#8776;15&#160;nm (year 2013), the current method of increasing device density is stacking up layers. Currently, 176&#8208;layer&#8208;stacked V&#8208;NAND flash memory is available on the market. Nonetheless, increasing the layers invokes several challenges, such as film stress management and deep contact hole etching. Also, there should be an upper bound for the attainable stacking layers (400&#8211;500) due to the total allowable chip thickness, which will be reached within 6&#8211;7 years. This review summarizes the current status and critical challenges of charge&#8208;trap&#8208;based flash memory devices, with a focus on the material (floating&#8208;gate vs charge&#8208;trap&#8208;layer), array&#8208;level circuit architecture (NOR vs NAND), physical integration structure (2D vs 3D), and cell&#8208;level programming technique (single vs multiple levels). Current efforts to improve fabrication processes and device performances using new materials are also introduced. The review suggests directions for future storage devices based on the ionic mechanism, which may overcome the inherent problems of flash memory devices.

         <title>Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities in Oxide Semiconductor Devices: A Key Building Block for Applications Ranging from Display Backplanes to 3D Integrated Semiconductor Chips</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 43, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fundamentals of oxide semiconductors are addressed, including a brief history, the function of the constituents and defects, transport mechanisms, and reliability issues. Furthermore, recent achievements of oxide semiconductor transistors are reviewed, and their potential for monolithic 3D integration are introduced. Finally, remaining questions and future directions of oxide semiconductor devices are discussed for next&#8208;generation electronics.








Abstract
As Si has faced physical limits on further scaling down, novel semiconducting materials such as 2D transition metal dichalcogenides and oxide semiconductors (OSs) have gained tremendous attention to continue the ever&#8208;demanding downscaling represented by Moore's law. Among them, OS is considered to be the most promising alternative material because it has intriguing features such as modest mobility, extremely low off&#8208;current, great uniformity, and low&#8208;temperature processibility with conventional complementary&#8208;metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor&#8208;compatible methods. In practice, OS has successfully replaced hydrogenated amorphous Si in high&#8208;end liquid crystal display devices and has now become a standard backplane electronic for organic light&#8208;emitting diode displays despite the short time since their invention in 2004. For OS to be implemented in next&#8208;generation electronics such as back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line transistor applications in monolithic 3D integration beyond the display applications, however, there is still much room for further study, such as high mobility, immune short&#8208;channel effects, low electrical contact properties, etc. This study reviews the brief history of OS and recent progress in device applications from a material science and device physics point of view. Simultaneously, remaining challenges and opportunities in OS for use in next&#8208;generation electronics are discussed.

         <title>Thermal Transport Properties of Phonons in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 43, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reviews the experimental and theoretical research of the thermal transport properties of halide perovskites since 2016. The microscopic behaviors of phonons are discussed along with the nonphononic descriptions. Also, the recent trends of the halide perovskites for thermal&#8208;related applications are presented.








Abstract
Halide perovskites have emerged as promising candidates for various applications, such as photovoltaic, optoelectronic and thermoelectric applications. The knowledge of the thermal transport of halide perovskites is essential for enhancing the device performance for these applications and improving the understanding of heat transport in complicated material systems with atomic disorders. In this work, the current understanding of the experimentally and theoretically obtained thermal transport properties of halide perovskites is reviewed. This study comprehensively examines the reported thermal conductivity of methylammonium lead iodide, which is a prototype material, and provides theoretical frameworks for its lattice vibrational properties. The frameworks and discussions are extended to other halide perovskites and derivative structures. The implications for device applications, such as solar cells and thermoelectrics, are discussed.

         <title>Revival of Ferroelectric Memories Based on Emerging Fluorite&#8208;Structured Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 43, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorite&#8208;structured ferroelectrics are breakthrough materials for the development of ferroelectric memories for nanoscale electronic devices owing to their scalability and complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility as well as the availability of established deposition techniques. This review covers the history of ferroelectric memory based on conventional ferroelectric to recent research on fluorite&#8208;structured ferroelectrics and remaining issues to achieve large&#8208;scale integration for practical industrial applications.








Abstract
Over the last few decades, the research on ferroelectric memories has been limited due to their dimensional scalability and incompatibility with complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The discovery of ferroelectricity in fluorite&#8208;structured oxides revived interest in the research on ferroelectric memories, by inducing nanoscale nonvolatility in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art gate insulators by minute doping and thermal treatment. The potential of this approach has been demonstrated by the fabrication of sub&#8208;30&#160;nm electronic devices. Nonetheless, to realize practical applications, various technical limitations, such as insufficient reliability including endurance, retention, and imprint, as well as large device&#8208;to&#8208;device&#8208;variation, require urgent solutions. Furthermore, such limitations should be considered based on targeting devices as well as applications. Various types of ferroelectric memories including ferroelectric random&#8208;access&#8208;memory, ferroelectric field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistor, and ferroelectric tunnel junction should be considered for classical nonvolatile memories as well as emerging neuromorphic computing and processing&#8208;in&#8208;memory. Therefore, from the viewpoint of materials science, this review covers the recent research focusing on ferroelectric memories from the history of conventional approaches to future prospects.

         <title>Design Strategies for Hydroxyapatite&#8208;Based Materials to Enhance Their Catalytic Performance and Applicability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 43, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxyapatite (HAP) is a potentially important catalytic material with high flexibility and multifunctionality. A variety of HAP modification methods to achieve high catalytic performance are discussed, including ionic composition change, morphology control, dopant engineering, and catalyst support engineering. Experimental and theoretical explorations to understand structure&#8211;activity relations are also covered to provide the design strategies for HAP catalytic materials.








Abstract
Hydroxyapatite (HAP) is a green catalyst that has a wide range of applications in catalysis due to its high flexibility and multifunctionality. These properties allow HAP to accommodate a large number of catalyst modifications that can selectively improve the catalytic performance in target reactions. To date, many studies have been conducted to elucidate the effect of HAP modification on the catalytic activities for various reactions. However, systematic design strategies for HAP catalysts are not established yet due to an incomplete understanding of underlying structure&#8211;activity relationships. In this review, tuning methods of HAP for improving the catalytic performance are discussed: 1) ionic composition change, 2) morphology control, 3) incorporation of other metal species, and 4) catalytic support engineering. Detailed mechanisms and effects of structural modulations on the catalytic performances for attaining the design insights of HAP catalysts are investigated. In addition, computational studies to understand catalytic reactions on HAP materials are also introduced. Finally, important areas for future research are highlighted.

         <title>Technological Breakthroughs in Chip Fabrication, Transfer, and Color Conversion for High&#8208;Performance Micro&#8208;LED Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 43, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Technical issues in integration of full&#8208;color micro&#8208;LED display, in the aspects of quantum efficiency, mass transfer technique, and color conversion technique, are reviewed. Various approaches for improving quantum efficiency of device along with methods of massively and accurately transferring them to a target substrate are discussed. Color conversion techniques and their deposition methods of quantum dots on micro&#8208;LEDs are introduced.








Abstract
The implementation of high&#8208;efficiency and high&#8208;resolution displays has been the focus of considerable research interest. Recently, micro light&#8208;emitting diodes (micro&#8208;LEDs), which are inorganic light&#8208;emitting diodes of size &lt;100&#8201;&#181;m2, have emerged as a promising display technology owing to their superior features and advantages over other displays like liquid crystal displays and organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Although many companies have introduced micro&#8208;LED displays since 2012, obstacles to mass production still exist. Three major challenges, i.e., low quantum efficiency, time&#8208;consuming transfer, and complex color conversion, have been overcome with technological breakthroughs to realize cost&#8208;effective micro&#8208;LED displays. In the review, methods for improving the degraded quantum efficiency of GaN&#8208;based micro&#8208;LEDs induced by the size effect are examined, including wet chemical treatment, passivation layer adoption, LED structure design, and growing LEDs in self&#8208;passivated structures. Novel transfer technologies, including pick&#8208;up transfer and self&#8208;assembly methods, for developing large&#8208;area micro&#8208;LED displays with high yield and reliability are discussed in depth. Quantum dots as color conversion materials for high color purity, and deposition methods such as electrohydrodynamic jet printing or contact printing on micro&#8208;LEDs are also addressed. This review presents current status and critical challenges of micro&#8208;LED technology and promising technical breakthroughs for commercialization of high&#8208;performance displays.

         <dc:description>
Various human&#8208;interactive sensing displays (HISDs) enabling facile detection of human information, followed by visualization of the information have been developed with innovative materials design and device architectures, making them suitable for emerging human&#8211;machine interface technologies including numerous biomedical and healthcare applications. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in emerging HISDs with their perspectives for future development.








Abstract
The development of human&#8208;interactive sensing displays (HISDs) that simultaneously detect and visualize stimuli is important for numerous cutting&#8208;edge human&#8211;machine interface technologies. Therefore, innovative device platforms with optimized architectures of HISDs combined with novel high&#8208;performance sensing and display materials are demonstrated. This study comprehensively reviews the recent advances in HISDs, particularly the device architectures that enable scaling&#8208;down and simplifying the HISD, as well as material designs capable of directly visualizing input information received by various sensors. Various HISD platforms for integrating sensors and displays are described. HISDs consist of a sensor and display connected through a microprocessor, and attempts to assemble the two devices by eliminating the microprocessor are detailed. Single&#8208;device HISD technologies are highlighted in which input stimuli acquired by sensory components are directly visualized with various optical components, such as electroluminescence, mechanoluminescence and structural color. The review forecasts future HISD technologies that demand the development of materials with molecular&#8208;level synthetic precision that enables simultaneous sensing and visualization. Furthermore, emerging HISDs combined with artificial intelligence technologies and those enabling simultaneous detection and visualization of extrasensory information are discussed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 43, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inorganic 2D membranes are promising candidates for energy harvesting, water desalination, and ion sieving applications. Ion&#8208;transport control in nanofluidics is key to membrane performance. Fundamental ion&#8208;transport control based on the force&#8211;flux relationship is discussed for potential membrane designs, considering both electrostatic and structural contributions to the flux.








Abstract
Inorganic 2D materials offer a new approach to controlling mass diffusion at the nanoscale. Controlling ion transport in nanofluidics is key to energy conversion, energy storage, water purification, and numerous other applications wherein persistent challenges for efficient separation must be addressed. The recent development of 2D membranes in the emerging field of energy harvesting, water desalination, and proton/Li&#8208;ion production in the context of green energy and environmental technology is herein discussed. The fundamental mechanisms, 2D membrane fabrication, and challenges toward practical applications are highlighted. Finally, the fundamental issues of thermodynamics and kinetics are outlined along with potential membrane designs that must be resolved to bridge the gap between lab&#8208;scale experiments and production levels.

         <title>Revisiting the Design Strategies for Metasurfaces: Fundamental Physics, Optimization, and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 43, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metasurfaces are ultracompact optical components that can manipulate light. Conventional design principles of metasurfaces based on unit&#8208;cell approach are introduced, which includes retrieval of source fields that generate desired light fields and materialization of the source fields. Then, unconventional metasurfaces that may provide opportunities beyond the conventional design principles are discussed.








Abstract
Over the last two decades, the capabilities of metasurfaces in light modulation with subwavelength thickness have been proven, and metasurfaces are expected to miniaturize conventional optical components and add various functionalities. Herein, various metasurface design strategies are reviewed thoroughly. First, the scalar diffraction theory is revisited to provide the basic principle of light propagation. Then, widely used design methods based on the unit&#8208;cell approach are discussed. The methods include a set of simplified steps, including the phase&#8208;map retrieval and meta&#8208;atom unit&#8208;cell design. Then, recently emerging metasurfaces that may not be accurately designed using unit&#8208;cell approach are introduced. Unconventional metasurfaces are examined where the conventional design methods fail and finally potential design methods for such metasurfaces are discussed.

         <title>Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries: From Fundamental Research to Industrialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 43, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are on the verge of transitioning from lab&#8208;level fundamental research to large&#8208;scale manufacturing. In this review, approaches to address the intrinsic physicochemical shortcomings of LMBs at the material and electrode levels are summarized. Issues relating to scaling up lab&#8208;scale knowledge and the adoption and resolution thereof by industry are reviewed together with processing and economic considerations.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are representative of post&#8208;lithium&#8208;ion batteries with the great promise of increasing the energy density drastically by utilizing the low operating voltage and high specific capacity of metallic lithium. LMBs currently stand at a point of transition at which the accumulation of knowledge from fundamental research is being translated into large&#8208;scale commercialization. This review summarizes the available strategies for addressing the intrinsic shortcomings of LMBs, such as the suppression of dendritic growth and parasitic reactions from the material to the electrode to the cell level. The discussion pertaining to the cell level includes efforts and concerns relating to scaling up established knowledge and expertise with the view of commercialization. This review intends to encourage researchers in both fundamental research institutions and industry to make a synergistic effort and share their views comprehensively to ensure that LMB technology continues to evolve in harmony to become a mature technology.

         <title>MOF&#8208;Based Chemiresistive Gas Sensors: Toward New Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 43, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are being designed with more sophisticated and tailored strategies by the development of computer sciences, and the unlimited versatility of MOFs provides potential to be used in gas sensors as sensing materials, heterostructures, and templates. These MOF&#8208;based gas sensors will increase the diversity of gas&#8208;sensing libraries, and are expected to achieve novel functionalities.








Abstract
The sensing performances of gas sensors must be improved and diversified to enhance quality of life by ensuring health, safety, and convenience. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which exhibit an extremely high surface area, abundant porosity, and unique surface chemistry, provide a promising framework for facilitating gas&#8208;sensor innovations. Enhanced understanding of conduction mechanisms of MOFs has facilitated their use as gas&#8208;sensing materials, and various types of MOFs have been developed by examining the compositional and morphological dependences and implementing catalyst incorporation and light activation. Owing to their inherent separation and absorption properties and catalytic activity, MOFs are applied as molecular sieves, absorptive filtering layers, and heterogeneous catalysts. In addition, oxide&#8208; or carbon&#8208;based sensing materials with complex structures or catalytic composites can be derived by the appropriate post&#8208;treatment of MOFs. This review discusses the effective techniques to design optimal MOFs, in terms of computational screening and synthesis methods. Moreover, the mechanisms through which the distinctive functionalities of MOFs as sensing materials, heterostructures, and derivatives can be incorporated in gas&#8208;sensor applications are presented.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 43, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The industrial demands for commercial solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diode (SOLED) displays are outlined, along with the current status of SOLEDs in industry and academia. For their practical use in displays, technical challenges and directions of research and development in SOLEDs to achieve high efficiency, long lifetime, and good processability are reviewed.








Abstract
This review outlines problems and progress in development of solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (SOLEDs) in industry and academia. Solution processing has several advantages such as low consumption of materials, low&#8208;cost processing, and large&#8208;area manufacturing. However, use of a solution process entails complications, such as the need for solvent resistivity and solution&#8208;processable materials, and yields SOLEDs that have limited luminous efficiency, severe roll&#8208;off characteristics, and short lifetime compared to OLEDs fabricated using thermal evaporation. These demerits impede production of practical SOLED displays. This review outlines the industrial demands for commercial SOLEDs and the current status of SOLED development in industries and academia, and presents research guidelines for the development of SOLEDs that have high efficiency, long lifetime, and good processability to achieve commercialization.

         <title>Strategies to Extend the Lifetime of Perovskite Downconversion Films for Display Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 43, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategies to increase the structural stability of perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) are reviewed. The standard conditions to test the reliability of PeNCs downconversion films are also listed and recent progress on the stability improvement of PeNCs for downconversion displays is discussed, their current commercialization status is presented, and future PeNC research is suggested.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) have outstanding luminescent properties that are suitable for displays that have high color purity and high absorption coefficient; so they are evaluated for application as light emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, light&#8208;converters for downconversion displays, and future near&#8208;eye augmented reality/virtual reality displays. However, PeNCs are chemically vulnerable to heat, light, and moisture, and these weaknesses must be overcome before devices that use PeNCs can be commercialized. This review examines strategies to overcome the low stability of PeNCs and thereby permit the fabrication of stable downconversion films, and summarizes downconversion&#8208;type display applications and future prospects. First, methods to increase the chemical stability of PeNCs are examined. Second, methods to encapsulate PeNC downconversion films to increase their lifetime are reviewed. Third, methods to increase the long&#8208;term compatibility of resin with PeNCs, and finally, how to secure stability using fillers added to the resin are summarized. Fourth, the method to manufacture downconversion films and the procedure to evaluate their reliability for commercialization is then described. Finally, the prospects of a downconversion system that exploits the properties of PeNCs and can be employed to fabricate fine pixels for high&#8208;resolution displays and for near&#8208;eye augmented reality/virtual reality devices are explored.

         <title>A Mechanistic Insight into the Oxygen Redox of Li&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes and their Related Electronic/Atomic Behaviors Upon Cycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 43, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li&#8208;rich layered cathodes exhibit anionic redox, which increases their capacity. This specific characteristic originates from their unique honeycomb&#8208;type superstructure leading to the Li&#8211;O&#8211;Li configuration, which produces O 2p NB states. Although there are contradictions in the literature, different strategies have been attempted to suppress cation migration and oxygen release to ensure reversible oxygen redox and solve the practical issues.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich cathodes are extensively investigated as their energy density is superior to Li stoichiometric cathode materials. In addition to the transition metal redox, this intriguing electrochemical performance originates from the redox reaction of the anionic sublattice. This new redox process, the so&#8208;called anionic redox or, more directly, oxygen redox in the case of oxides, almost doubles the energy density of Li&#8208;rich cathodes compared to conventional cathodes. Numerous theoretical and experimental investigations have thoroughly established the current understanding of the oxygen redox of Li&#8208;rich cathodes. However, different reports are occasionally contradictory, indicating that current knowledge remains incomplete. Moreover, several practical issues still hinder the real&#8208;world application of Li&#8208;rich cathodes. As these issues are related to phenomena resulting from the electronic to atomic evolution induced by unstable oxygen redox, a fundamental multiscale understanding is essential for solving the problem. In this review, the current mechanistic understanding of oxygen redox, the origin of the practical problems, and how current studies tackle the issues are summarized.

         <title>PopTouch: A Submillimeter Thick Dynamically Reconfigured Haptic Interface with Pressable Buttons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Our interactions with touchscreens rely heavily on vision: we press virtual buttons and push virtual sliders that provide no mechanical sense of the object they seek to represent. We report here PopTouch: a 500&#160;&#956;m thick flexible haptic display that creates pressable physical buttons on demand. PopTouch can be mounted directly on touchscreens or any other smooth surface, flat or curved. The buttons of PopTouch are independently controlled hydraulically amplified electrostatic zipping taxels (tactile pixels) that generate 1.5&#160;mm of out of plane displacement. When pressed by the user, the buttons provide intuitive mechanical feedback thanks to a snap&#8208;through characteristic in their force&#8208;displacement profile. The snap&#8208;through threshold can be as high as 4 N, and is tuned by design and actuation parameters. We present two versions of PopTouch: a transparent PopTouch for integration on Touchscreens with built&#8208;in touch sensing, such as smartphones and a sensorized PopTouch, with embedded thin&#8208;film piezoelectric sensors on each taxel, for integration on substrates without built&#8208;in touch sensing, such as a steering wheel. PopTouch adds static and vibrating button&#8208;like haptics to any device thanks to its thin profile, flexibility, low power consumption (6&#160;mW per button), rapid refresh rate (2&#160;Hz), and freely configured array format.

         <title>Cation Defect&#8208;Engineered Boost Fast Kinetics of Two&#8208;Dimensional Topological Bi2Se3 Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
The challenge with aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) lies in finding suitable cathode materials that can provide high capacity and fast kinetics. Herein, two&#8208;dimensional topological Bi2Se3 with acceptable Bi&#8208;vacancies for ZIBs cathode (Cu&#8208;Bi2&#8208;xSe3) is constructed through one&#8208;step hydrothermal process accompanied by Cu heteroatom introduction. The cation&#8208;deficient Cu&#8208;Bi2&#8208;xSe3 nanosheets (&#8764; 4&#160;nm) bring improved conductivity from large surface topological metal states contribution and enhanced bulk conductivity. Besides, the increased adsorption energy and reduced Zn2+ migration barrier demonstrated by density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrate the decreased Coulombic ion&#8208;lattice repulsion of Cu&#8208;Bi2&#8208;xSe3. Therefore, Cu&#8208;Bi2&#8208;xSe3 exhibits both enhanced ion and electron transport capability, leading to more carrier reversible insertion proved by in&#8208;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction (SXRD). These features endow Cu&#8208;Bi2&#8208;xSe3 with sufficient specific capacity (320&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1), high&#8208;rate performance (97&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1), and reliable cycling stability (70&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1 after 4000 cycles). Furthermore, quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state fiber&#8208;shaped ZIBs employing the Cu&#8208;Bi2&#8208;xSe3 cathode demonstrate respectable performance and superior flexibility even under high mass loading. This work implements a conceptually innovative strategy represented by cation defect design in topological insulator cathode for achieving high&#8208;performance battery electrochemistry.

         <title>A Nanozyme&#8208;Based Electrode for High&#8208;Performance Neural Recording</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Implanted neural electrodes have been widely used to treat brain diseases that require high sensitivity and biocompatibility at the tissue&#8208;electrode interface. However, currently used clinical electrodes cannot meet both these requirements simultaneously, which hinders the effective recording of electronic signals. Herein, nanozyme&#8208;based neural electrodes incorporating bioinspired atomically precise clusters were developed as a general strategy with a heterogeneous design for multiscale and ultrasensitive neural recording via quantum transport and biocatalytic processes. Owing to the dual high&#8208;speed electronic and ionic currents at the electrode&#8208;tissue interface, the impedance of nanozyme electrodes was 26 times lower than that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal electrodes, and the acquisition sensitivity for the local field potential was &#8764;10 times higher than that of clinical PtIr electrodes, enabling a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) of up to 14.7&#160;dB for single&#8208;neuron recordings in rats. The electrodes provided more than 100&#8208;fold higher antioxidant and multi&#8208;enzyme&#8208;like activities, which effectively decreased 67% of the neuronal injury area by inhibiting glial proliferation and allowing sensitive and stable neural recording. Moreover, nanozyme electrodes can considerably improve the SNR of seizures in acute epileptic rats and is expected to achieve precise localization of seizure foci in clinical settings.

         <title>Highly Reliable Van Der Waals Memory Boosted by A Single 2d Charge Trap Medium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Charge trap materials that can store carriers efficiently and controllably are desired for memory applications. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are promising for highly compacted and reliable memory mainly due to their ease of constructing atomically uniform interfaces, however, remain unexplored as being charge trap media. Here we discover that 2D semiconducting PbI2 is an excellent charge trap material for non&#8208;volatile memory and artificial synapses. It is simple to construct PbI2&#8208;based charge trap devices since no complicated synthesis or additional defect manufacturing are required. As a demonstration, MoS2/PbI2 device exhibits a large memory window of 120&#160;V, fast write speed of 5 &#956;s, high on&#8208;off ratio around 106, multilevel memory of over 8 distinct states, high reliability with endurance up to 104 cycles and retention over 1.2&#215;104 seconds. We envision that PbI2 with ionic activity caused by the natively formed iodine vacancies is unique to combine with unlimited 2D materials for versatile van der Waals devices with high&#8208;integration and multifunctionality.

         <title>Magnetic Putty as a Reconfigurable, Recyclable, and Accessible Soft Robotic Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Permanent magnetic particles embedded in a viscoelastic putty matrix result in a self&#8208;healing soft magnetic material with both high remanence and low coercivity, providing hard&#8208;magnetic performance without the need for inaccessible strong magnetic fields. Programmable and reconfigurable magnetization, frequency&#8208;dependent force output, and easy to shape and assemble, magnetic putty can be a versatile tool in research prototyping and inspire future explorations.








Abstract
Magnetically hard materials are widely used to build soft magnetic robots, providing large magnetic force/torque and macrodomain programmability. However, their high magnetic coercivity often presents practical challenges when attempting to reconfigure magnetization patterns, requiring a large magnetic field or heating. In this study, magnetic putty is introduced as a magnetically hard and soft material with large remanence and low coercivity. It is shown that the magnetization of magnetic putty can be easily reoriented with maximum magnitude using an external field that is only one&#8208;tenth of its coercivity. Additionally, magnetic putty is a malleable, autonomous self&#8208;healing material that can be recycled and repurposed. The authors anticipate magnetic putty could provide a versatile and accessible tool for various magnetic robotics applications for fast prototyping and explorations for research and educational purposes.

         <title>Monolithic 3D Integration of Analog RRAM&#8208;Based Computing&#8208;in&#8208;Memory and Sensor for Energy&#8208;Efficient Near&#8208;Sensor Computing</title>

A monolithic three&#8208;dimensional (M3D) integration of photosensor array, analog computing&#8208;in&#8208;memory (CIM), and Si complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) circuits, named M3D&#8208;SAIL is demonstrated, to achieve an energy&#8208;efficient NSC architecture. This architecture achieved an accuracy of 96.7% while with lower energy consumption and faster speed than its 2D counterpart.








Abstract
In the era of the Internet of Things, vast amounts of data generated at sensory nodes impose critical challenges on the data&#8208;transfer bandwidth and energy efficiency of computing hardware. A near&#8208;sensor computing (NSC) architecture places the processing units closer to the sensors such that the generated data can be processed almost in situ with high efficiency. This study demonstrates the monolithic three&#8208;dimensional (M3D) integration of a photosensor array, analog computing&#8208;in&#8208;memory (CIM), and Si complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) logic circuits, named M3D&#8208;SAIL. This approach exploits the high&#8208;bandwidth on&#8208;chip data transfer and massively parallel CIM cores to realize an energy&#8208;efficient NSC architecture. The 1st layer of the Si CMOS circuits serves as the control logic and peripheral circuits. The 2nd layer comprises a 1&#160;k&#8208;bit one&#8208;transistor&#8208;one&#8208;resistor (1T1R) array with InGaZnOx field&#8208;effect transistor (IGZO&#8208;FET) and resistive random&#8208;access memory (RRAM) for analog CIM. The 3rd layer comprises multiple IGZO&#8208;FET&#8208;based photosensor arrays for wavelength&#8208;dependent optical sensing. The structural integrity and function of each layer are comprehensively verified. Furthermore, NSC is implemented using the M3D&#8208;SAIL architecture for a typical video keyframe&#8208;extraction task, achieving a high classification accuracy of 96.7% as well as a 31.5&#215; lower energy consumption and 1.91&#215; faster computing speed compared to its&#160;2D counterpart.

         <title>Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Using Superaerophobic Ni Nanoarrays with Accelerated H2 Bubble Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a systematic investigation on the impact of nanoscale surface morphologies on H2 bubble release behaviors and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance, it is revealed that highly porous catalyst consisting of an array of Ni nanorods exhibits the superaerophobic nature, leading to accelerated release of H2 bubbles from the surface along with effective open pore channels, and hence, remarkably enhanced HER performance.








Abstract
Despite the adverse effects of H2 bubbles adhering to catalyst's surface on the performance of water electrolysis, the mechanisms by which H2 bubbles are effectively released during the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remain elusive. In this study, a systematic investigation on the effect of nanoscale surface morphologies on H2 bubble release behaviors and HER performance by employing earth&#8208;abundant Ni catalysts consisting of an array of Ni nanorods (NRs) with controlled surface porosities is performed. Both aerophobicity and hydrophilicity of the catalyst's surface vary according to the surface porosity of catalysts. The Ni catalyst with the highest porosity of &#8776;52% exhibits superaerophobic nature as well as the best HER performance among the Ni catalysts. It is found that the Ni catalyst's superaerophobicity combined with the effective open pore channels enables the accelerated release of H2 bubbles from the surface, leading to a significant improvement in geometric activities, particularly at high current densities, as well as intrinsic activities including both specific and mass activities. It is also demonstrated that the superaerophobicity enabled by highly porous Ni NRs can be combined with Pt and Cr having optimal binding abilities to further optimize electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Structured Colloidal Gels for High&#8208;Resolution 3D Micropatterning of Proteins at Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new reaction&#8208;diffusion self&#8208;assembly system in which proteins function as diffusive reactants to assemble stable clay&#8208;protein composite hydrogels is reported. The opportunity to exploit this system to assemble stable 3D patterning of bioactive proteins with high protein loading, resolution, and scalability is demonstrated.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly, the spontaneous ordering of components into patterns, is widespread in nature and fundamental to generating function across length scales. Morphogen gradients in biological development are paradigmatic as both products and effectors of self&#8208;assembly and various attempts have been made to reproduce such gradients in biomaterial design. To date, approaches have typically utilized top&#8208;down fabrication techniques that, while allowing high&#8208;resolution control, are limited by scale and require chemical cross&#8208;linking steps to stabilize morphogen patterns in time. Here, a bottom&#8208;up approach to protein patterning is developed based on a novel binary reaction&#8208;diffusion process where proteins function as diffusive reactants to assemble a nanoclay&#8208;protein composite hydrogel. Using this approach, it is possible to generate scalable and highly stable 3D patterns of target proteins down to sub&#8208;cellular resolution through only physical interactions between clay nanoparticles and the proteins and ions present in blood. Patterned nanoclay gels are able to guide cell behavior to precisely template bone tissue formation in vivo. These results demonstrate the feasibility of stabilizing 3D gradients of biological signals through self&#8208;assembly processes and open up new possibilities for morphogen&#8208;based therapeutic strategies and models of biological development and repair.

         <title>Negative Photoresponse Switching via Electron&#8211;Hole Recombination at The Type III Junction of MoTe2 Channel/SnS2 Top Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;speed phototransistor is designed, which has a type III junction between p&#8208;MoTe2 channel and n&#8208;SnS2 top layer. The photodetecting device operates with a basis of negative photoresponse, which originates from the recombination of photoexcited electrons within the n&#8208;SnS2 layer and accumulated holes in the p&#8208;MoTe2 channel.








Abstract
Extensive study on 2D&#160;van der Waals (vdW) heterojunctions has primarily focused on PN diodes for fast&#8208;switching photodetection, while achieving the same from 2D channel phototransistors is rare despite their other advantages. Here, a high&#8208;speed phototransistor featuring a type III junction between p&#8208;MoTe2 channel and n&#8208;SnS2 top layer is designed. The photodetecting device operates with a basis of negative photoresponse (NPR), which originates from the recombination of photoexcited electrons in n&#8208;SnS2 and accumulated holes in the p&#8208;MoTe2 channel. For the NPR to occur, high&#8208;energy photons capable of exciting SnS2 (band gap &#8776;2.2&#160;eV) are found to be effective because lower&#8208;energy photons simply penetrate the SnS2 top layer only to excite MoTe2, leading to normal positive photoresponse (PPR) which is known to be slow due to the photogating effects. The NPR transistor showcases 0.5&#160;ms fast photoresponses and a high responsivity over 5000 A W&#8722;1. More essentially, such carrier recombination mechanism is clarified with three experimental evidences. The phototransistor is finally modified with Au contact on n&#8208;SnS2, to be a more practical device displaying voltage output. Three different photo&#8208;logic states under blue, near infrared (NIR), and blue&#8208;NIR mixed photons are demonstrated using the voltage signals.

For the NPR to occur, high-energy photons capable of exciting SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (band gap &#8776;2.2&#160;eV) are found to be effective because lower-energy photons simply penetrate the SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; top layer only to excite MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, leading to normal positive photoresponse (PPR) which is known to be slow due to the photogating effects. The NPR transistor showcases 0.5&#160;ms fast photoresponses and a high responsivity over 5000 A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. More essentially, such carrier recombination mechanism is clarified with three experimental evidences. The phototransistor is finally modified with Au contact on n-SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to be a more practical device displaying voltage output. Three different photo-logic states under blue, near infrared (NIR), and blue-NIR mixed photons are demonstrated using the voltage signals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Switching of Perpendicular Magnetization by Spin&#8211;Orbit Torque</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrical switching of perpendicular magnetization is key for the development of fast, dense, reliable magnetic memory, and computing technologies. Here is a focused review of the advances and challenges in the understanding of devices of switching of perpendicular magnetization by spin&#8211;orbit torques toward the goal of energy&#8208;efficient, dense, fast perpendicular spin&#8211;orbit torque applications.








Abstract
Magnetic materials with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are of great interest for the development of nonvolatile magnetic memory and computing technologies due to their high stabilities at the nanoscale. However, electrical switching of such perpendicular magnetization in an energy&#8208;efficient, deterministic, scalable manner has remained a big challenge. This problem has recently attracted enormous efforts in the field of spintronics. Here, recent advances and challenges in the understanding of the electrical generation of spin currents, the switching mechanisms and the switching strategies of perpendicular magnetization, the switching current density by spin&#8211;orbit torque of transverse spins, the choice of perpendicular magnetic materials are reviewed, and the progress in prototype perpendicular SOT memory and logic devices toward the goal of energy&#8208;efficient, dense, fast perpendicular spin&#8211;orbit torque applications is summarized.

         <title>Interfacial Polymerization Produced Magnetic Particles with Nano&#8208;Filopodia for Highly Accurate Liquid Biopsy in the PSA Gray Zone</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immune cell&#8208;inspired magnetic particles with nano&#8208;filopodia (NFMPs) are successfully prepared, capturing circulating tumor cells (CTCs) efficiently with high sensitivity, superior to commercial magnetic microparticles. The nano&#8208;filopodia are unprecedentedly constructed on polymer&#8208;based magnetic particles by introducing electrostatic interactions in emulsion interfacial polymerization. Assisted by machine learning, the NFMPs strategy demonstrates high sensitivity (100%), enabling accurate clinical prostate cancer diagnosis in the prostate&#8208;specific antigen (PSA) gray zone.








Abstract
Magnetic particles are leading separation materials for biological purification and detection. Existing magnetic particles, which almost rely on molecule&#8208;level interactions, however, often encounter bottlenecks in highly efficient cell&#8208;level separation due to the underestimate of surface structure effects. Here, immune cell&#8208;inspired magnetic particles with nano&#8208;filopodia (NFMPs) produced by interfacial polymerization for highly efficient capture of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and further accurate clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer are reported . The unprecedented construction of nano&#8208;filopodia on polymer&#8208;based magnetic particles is achieved by introducing electrostatic interactions in emulsion interfacial polymerization. Due to the unique nano&#8208;filopodia, the NFMPs allow remarkably enhanced CTCs capture efficiency (86.5%&#160;&#177;&#160;2.8%) compared with smooth magnetic particles (SMPs, 35.7%&#160;&#177;&#160;5.7%). Under the assistance of machine learning by combining with prostate&#8208;specific antigen (PSA) and free to total PSA (F/T&#8208;PSA), the NFMPs strategy demonstrates high sensitivity (100%), high specificity (93.3%), and a high area under the curve (AUC) value (98.1%) for clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer in the PSA gray zone. The NFMPs are anticipated as an efficient platform for CTCs&#8208;based liquid biopsy toward early cancer diagnosis and prognosis evaluation.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Speed Aqueous Copper Electrodes Stabilized by Phosphorylated Interphase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;cost and reliable in situ phosphate interphase engineering implements on aqueous copper metal electrodes. Robust interphase enables ultrahigh current shocks up to 100 mA cm&#8722;2, and brings at least an order of magnitude improvement in cycling stability for symmetric cells and full batteries, representing exciting possibilities for realizing practically aqueous metal electrodes.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy metal anodes for large&#8208;scale reversible batteries with inexpensive and nonflammable aqueous electrolytes promise the capability of supporting higher current density, satisfactory lifetime, nontoxicity, and low&#8208;cost commercial manufacturing, yet remain out of reach due to the lack of reliable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase engineering. Herein, in situ formed robust interphase on copper metal electrodes (CMEs) induced by a trace amount of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (0.05&#160;m in 1&#160;m CuSO4&#8211;H2O electrolyte) to fulfill all aforementioned requirements is demonstrated. Impressively, an unprecedented ultrahigh&#8208;speed copper plating/stripping capability is achieved at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2&#160;for over 12&#160;000 cycles, corresponding to an accumulative areal capacity up to tens of times higher than previously reported CMEs. The use of solid&#8208;electrolyte interface&#8208;protection strategy brings at least an order of magnitude improvement in cycling stability for symmetric cells (Cu||Cu, 2800&#160;h) and full batteries with CMEs using either sulfur cathodes (S||Cu, 1000 cycles without capacity decay) or zinc anodes (Cu||Zn with all&#8208;metal electrodes, discharge voltage &#8776;1.02&#160;V). The comprehensive analysis reveals that the hydrophilic phosphate&#8208;rich interphase nanostructures homogenize copper&#8208;ion deposition and suppress nucleation overpotential, enabling dendrite&#8208;free CMEs with sustainability and ability to tolerate unusual&#8208;high power densities. The findings represent an&#160;elegant&#160;forerunner&#160;toward the promising goal of metal electrode applications.

Abstract
It is always a great challenge to achieve high&#8208;efficiency solution&#8208;processed ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) 1931 chromaticity coordinates matching the blue primary of Rec. International Telecommunication Union&#8208;Radiocommunication BT.2100, which specifies high dynamic range television image parameters. Inspired by hybrid local and charge transfer (HLCT) excited state emitters improving exciton utilization through high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing, here, a series of high&#8208;performance blue emitters by a V&#8208;shaped symmetric donor (D)&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor (A)&#8211;&#960;&#8211;D design strategy are developed. Here, the large torsions and unstable bonds of D&#8211;A structures can be improved through &#960; bridges, and also the conjugation length and donor groups can be easily adjusted. The obtained emitters merit excellent photophysical and electrochemical properties, thermal stability, solution processibility, and HLCT excited state excellence. Results suggest that the OLEDs based on the obtained blue emitters all achieve high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of more than 8% with very low efficiency roll&#8208;off. In particular, the device based on 4&#697;,5&#697;&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)spiro[fluorene&#8208;9,2&#697;&#8208;imidazole] exhibits a satisfactory ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue emission (CIEx,y = 0.1579, 0.0387) and a record&#8208;high EQEmax (10.40%) among solution&#8208;processed HLCT OLEDs, which is very close to the record EQEmax of devices by vacuum vapor deposition technology.

         <title>Axially Encoded Mechano&#8208;Metafiber Electronics by Local Strain Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work fabricates continuously encoded mechano&#8208;metafiber by axial integrating stiff and soft elastic components with tailored length and content through program&#8208;controlled microfluidic sequence spinning. This work develops two essential nonlinear deformation modes of spun metafibers, which are local strain amplification and retardation for designing highly sensitive strain sensors, stretchable fiber devices, and high&#8208;voltage supercapacitors as well as axial electroluminescent arrays.








Abstract
Multimaterial integration, such as soft elastic and stiff components, exhibits rich deformation and functional behaviors to meet complex needs. Integrating multimaterials in the level of individual fiber is poised to maximize the functional design capacity of smart wearable electronic textiles, but remains unfulfilled. Here, this work continuously integrates stiff and soft elastic components into single fiber to fabricate encoded mechano&#8208;metafiber by programmable microfluidic sequence spinning (MSS). The sequences with programmable modulus feature the controllable localization of strain along metafiber length. The mechano&#8208;metafibers feature two essential nonlinear deformation modes, which are local strain amplification and retardation. This work extends the sequence&#8208;encoded metafiber into fiber networks to exhibit greatly enhanced strain amplification and retardation capability in cascades. Local strain engineering enables the design of highly sensitive strain sensors, stretchable fiber devices to protect brittle components and the fabrication of high&#8208;voltage supercapacitors as well as axial electroluminescent arrays. The approach allows the scalably design of multimaterial metafibers with programmable localized mechanical properties for woven metamaterials, smart textiles, and wearable electronics.

         <title>Valence Oscillation of Ru Active Sites for Efficient and Robust Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The robust inter&#8208;doped (Ru&#8211;W)Ox heterostructures enhance the activity and stability of acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by inducing valence oscillation and stabilizing RuOx on WOx substrates. The asymmetric Ru&#8211;O&#8211;W units synergistically adsorb oxygen intermediates, resulting in improved intrinsic activity and demonstrating potential for practical applications with low overpotential and excellent stability.








Abstract
The continuous oxidation and leachability of active sites in Ru&#8208;based catalysts hinder practical application in proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE). Herein, robust inter&#8208;doped tungsten&#8211;ruthenium oxide heterostructures [(Ru&#8211;W)Ox] fabricated by sequential rapid oxidation and metal thermomigration processes are proposed to enhance the activity and stability of acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The introduction of high&#8208;valent W species induces the valence oscillation of the Ru sites during OER, facilitating the cyclic transition of the active metal oxidation states and maintaining the continuous operation of the active sites. The preferential oxidation of W species and electronic gain of Ru sites in the inter&#8208;doped heterostructure significantly stabilize RuOx on WOx substrates beyond the Pourbaix stability limit of bare RuO2. Furthermore, the asymmetric Ru&#8211;O&#8211;W active units are generated around the heterostructure interface to adsorb the oxygen intermediates synergistically, enhancing the intrinsic OER activity. Consequently, the inter&#8208;doped (Ru&#8211;W)Ox heterostructures not only demonstrate an overpotential of 170&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and excellent stability of 300&#160;h in acidic electrolytes but also exhibit the potential for practical applications, as evidenced by the stable operation at 0.5 A cm&#8722;2 for 300&#160;h in PEMWE.

         <title>Mechanically Gated Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The groundbreaking discovery of Piezo channels reveals how mechanical force initiates the nerve impulses that help to perceive and adapt to the world. This work is an attempt to mimic Piezo channels. A revolutionary two&#8208;terminal transistor gated only by a tiny force &lt;1&#160;&#181;N instead of voltage, achieving over three orders of magnitude ON/OFF ratio is developed.








Abstract
Silicon&#8208;based field effect transistors have underpinned the information revolution in the last 60 years, and there is a strong desire for new materials, devices, and architectures that can help sustain the computing power in the age of big data and artificial intelligence. Inspired by the Piezo channels, a mechanically gated transistor abandoning electric gating altogether, achieving an ON/OFF ratio over three orders of magnitude under a mechanical force of hundreds of nN is developed. The two&#8208;terminal device utilizes flexoelectric polarization induced by strain gradient, which modulates the carrier concentration in a Van der Waals structure significantly, and it mimics Piezo channels for artificial tactile perception. This simple device concept can be easily adapted to a wide range of semiconducting materials, helping promote the fusion between mechanics and electronics in a similar way as mechanobiology.

         <title>Tailoring Enantiomeric Chiral Channels in Metal&#8208;Peptide Networks: A Novel Foldamer&#8208;Based Approach for Host&#8208;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This groundbreaking research uncovers an approach for crafting chiral channels in metal&#8208;peptide networks (MPNs). The strategic integration of foldamer ligands and CuI clusters allows precise, atomic&#8208;level modifications. The technique expedites enantiomer discrimination in mixtures and prompts adaptable molecules to adopt specific chiral forms. It promises the potential for multifunctional materials useful in catalysis, drug delivery, and sensing technologies.








Abstract
Designing chiral channels in organic frameworks presents an ongoing challenge due to the intricate control of size, shape, and functionality required. A novel approach is presented, which crafts enantiomeric chiral channels in metal&#8208;peptide networks (MPNs) by integrating short foldamer ligands with CuI clusters. The MPN structure serves as a 3D blueprint for host&#8208;guest chemistry, fostering modular substitution to refine chiral channel properties at the atomic scale. Incorporating hydrogen bond networks augments guest molecule interactions with the channel surface. This approach expedites enantiomer discrimination in racemic mixtures and incites adaptable guest molecules to take on specific axially chiral conformations. Distinct from traditional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and conventional reticular architectures, this foldamer&#8208;based methodology provides a predictable and customizable host&#8208;guest interaction system within a 3D topology. This innovation sets the stage for multifunctional materials that merge host&#8208;guest interaction systems with metal&#8208;complex properties, opening up potential applications in catalysis, sensing, and drug delivery.

         <title>Transparent Recombination Electrode with Dual&#8208;Functional Transport and Protective Layer for Efficient and Stable Monolithic Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly conductive and transparent indium tin oxide is introduced by sputtering as recombination electrode for tandem solar cells (TSCs), and dual&#8208;functional C1 is employed as both transport and protective layer to avoid damaging the underlying material during sputtering and enhance electron transport. Monolithic perovskite/organic TSC with high power conversion efficiency&#160;of 24.07% and excellent stability is demonstrated.








Abstract
Rational selection and design of recombination electrodes (RCEs) are crucial to enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of monolithic tandem solar cells (TSCs). Sputtered indium tin oxide (ITO) with high conductivity and excellent transmittance is introduced as RCE in perovskite/organic TSCs. To prevent high&#8208;energy ITO particles destroy the underlying material during sputtering, dual&#8208;functional transport and protective layer (C1) is employed. The styryl group in C1 can be thermally crosslinked to serve as a sputtering protective layer. Meanwhile, the conjugated phenanthroline skeleton in C1 shows high electron mobility and hole blocking capability to promote the electron transport process at the interfaces and effectively reduce charge accumulation. Monolithic perovskite/organic TSC with high PCE of 24.07% and excellent stability is demonstrated by stacking a 1.77&#160;eV bandgap perovskite layer and a 1.35&#160;eV bandgap organic active layer. This strategy provides new insights for overcoming the fundamental efficiency limits of single&#8208;junction devices and promotes the further development of TSC devices.

         <title>Synthesis of Clean Hydrogen Gas from Waste Plastic at Zero Net Cost</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Waste plastics are upcycled into H2 and graphene. This catalyst&#8208;free process achieves comparable yields to metal&#8208;catalyzed steam methane reforming (grey H2), producing 84% less greenhouse gases. Further, graphene is produced as a value&#8208;added byproduct while using less energy than electrolysis (green H2). The sale of this graphene at only 5% of the current market value affords clean H2 production at a negative cost.








Abstract
Hydrogen gas (H2) is the primary storable fuel for pollution&#8208;free energy production, with over 90&#160;million tonnes used globally per year. More than 95% of H2 is synthesized through metal&#8208;catalyzed steam methane reforming that produces 11 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per tonne H2. &#8220;Green H2&#8221; from water electrolysis using renewable energy evolves no CO2, but costs 2&#8211;3&#215; more, making it presently economically unviable. Here&#160;catalyst&#8208;free conversion of waste plastic into clean H2 along with high purity graphene is reported. The scalable procedure evolves no CO2 when deconstructing polyolefins and produces H2 in purities up to 94% at high mass yields. The sale of graphene byproduct at just 5% of its current value yields H2 production at a negative cost. Life&#8208;cycle assessment demonstrates a 39&#8211;84% reduction in emissions compared to other H2 production methods, suggesting the flash H2 process to be an economically viable, clean H2 production route.

         <title>An Immunomodulatory Hydrogel by Hyperthermia&#8208;Assisted Self&#8208;Cascade Glucose Depletion and ROS Scavenging for Diabetic Foot Ulcer Wound Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An immunomodulatory hydrogel with robust hyperthermia&#8208;assisted self&#8208;cascade glucose depletion and ROS scavenging properties is designed for treating diabetic foot ulcer wounds.








Abstract
Current therapeutic protocols for diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), a severe and rapidly growing chronic complication in diabetic patients, remain nonspecific. Hyperglycemia&#8208;caused inflammation and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) are common obstacles encountered in DFU wound healing, often leading to impaired recovery. These two effects reinforce each other, forming an endless loop. However, adequate and inclusive methods are still lacking to target these two aspects and break the vicious cycle. This study proposes a novel approach for treating DFU wounds, utilizing an immunomodulatory hydrogel to achieve self&#8208;cascade glucose depletion and ROS scavenging to regulate the diabetic microenvironment. Specifically, AuPt@melanin&#8208;incorporated (GHM3) hydrogel dressing is developed to facilitate efficient hyperthermia&#8208;enhanced local glucose depletion and ROS scavenging. Mechanistically, in vitro/vivo experiments and RNA sequencing analysis demonstrate that GHM3 disrupts the ROS&#8208;inflammation cascade cycle and downregulates the ratio of M1/M2 macrophages, consequently improving the therapeutic outcomes for dorsal skin and DFU wounds in diabetic rats. In conclusion, this proposed approach offers a facile, safe, and highly efficient treatment modality for DFUs.

         <title>Reductant Engineering in Stable and High&#8208;Quality Tin Perovskite Single Crystal Growth for Heterojunction X&#8208;Ray Detectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin perovskite has attracted much attention due to its smaller bandgap, while the instability of Sn2+ limits the tin perovskite single crystal growth under ambient conditions. Oxalic acid, serving as a reductant, is proved&#160;to be suitable for the solution growth of high&#8208;quality tin perovskite single crystals under ambient air, inhibiting oxidation, reducing defects, and improving device performance.








Abstract
Tin perovskites have emerged as a promising alternative material to address the toxicity of lead perovskites and the low bandgap of around 1.1&#160;eV is also compatible with tandem solar cell applications. Nevertheless, the optoelectronic performance of solution&#8208;processed tin perovskite single&#8208;crystal counterparts still lags behind because of the tin instability under ambient conditions during crystal growth and limited reductants to protect the Sn2+ ions from oxidation. Here, the reductant engineering to grow high&#8208;quality tin perovskite single crystals under ambient conditions is studied. Oxalic acid (H2C2O4) serves as an excellent reductant and sacrificial agent to protect Sn2+ ions in methanol due to its suitable redox potential of &#8722;0.49&#160;V, and the CO2 as the oxidation product in the gas state can be easily separated from the solution. The FPEA2SnI4 single crystal grown by this strategy exhibits low trap density perovskite surface by constructing an FPEA2PbI4&#8208;FPEA2SnI4 (FPI&#8208;FSI) single crystal heterojunction for X&#8208;ray detection. An improved X&#8208;ray sensitivity of 1.7 &#215; 105 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 is realized in the heterojunction device, outperforming the control FPEA2PbI4 counterpart.

         <title>Step&#8208;Nucleation In Situ Self&#8208;Repair to Prepare Rollable Large&#8208;Area Ultrathin MOF Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A step&#8208;nucleation in situ self&#8208;repair strategy to fabricate rollable large&#8208;area (2400 cm2) ultrathin (210&#8211;300&#160;nm) zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) membranes is elucidated. Two spiral&#8208;wound membrane modules with an area of 4800 cm2 are prepared. Both the membranes and membrane modules show unprecedented high olefin gas permeance and good olefin/paraffin gas selectivity, thus promoting ZIF membrane practical applications.








Abstract
Ultrathin membranes with ultrahigh permeance and good gas selectivity have the potential to greatly decrease separation process costs, but it requires the practical preparation of large area membranes for implementation. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are very attractive for membrane gas separation applications. However, to date, the largest MOF membrane area reported in the literature is only about 100 cm2. In the present study, a new step&#8208;nucleation in situ self&#8208;repair strategy is proposed that enables the preparation of large&#8208;area (2400 cm2) ultrathin and rollable MOF membranes deposited on an inexpensive flexible polymer membrane support layer for the first time, combining a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)&#8210;metal&#8208;ion layer and a pure metal&#8208;ion layer. The main role of the pure metal&#8208;ion layer is to act as the main nucleation sites for MOF membrane growth, while the PVA&#8210;metal&#8208;ion layer acts as a slow&#8208;release metal&#8208;ion source, which supplements MOF crystal nucleation to repair any defects occurring. Membrane modules are necessary components for membrane applications, and spiral&#8208;wound modules are among the most common module formats that are widely applied in gas separation. A 4800 cm2 spiral&#8208;wound membrane module&#160;was successfully prepared, demonstrating the practical implementation of large&#8208;area MOF membranes.

         <title>Diagnosing the Electrostatic Shielding Mechanism for Dendrite Suppression in Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous zinc electrolytes offer the potential for cheaper rechargeable batteries due to their safe compatibility with the high capacity metal anode, yet they are stymied by irregular zinc deposition and consequent dendrite growth. Suppressing dendrite formation by tailoring the electrolyte is a proven approach from lithium batteries, yet the underlying mechanistic understanding that guides such tailoring does not necessarily directly translate from one system to the other. Here, we show that the electrostatic shielding mechanism, a fundamental concept in electrolyte engineering for stable metal anodes, has different consequences for the plating morphology in aqueous zinc batteries. We use operando electrochemical transmission electron microscopy to directly observe the zinc nucleation and growth under different electrolyte compositions, and reveal that electrostatic shielding additive suppresses dendrites by inhibiting secondary zinc nucleation along the (100) edges of existing primary deposits, and encouraging preferential deposition on the (002) faces, leading to a dense and block&#8208;like zinc morphology. The strong influence of the crystallography of Zn on the electrostatic shielding mechanism was further confirmed with Zn||Ti cells and density functional theory modelling. This work demonstrates the importance of considering the unique aspects of the aqueous zinc battery system when using concepts from other battery chemistries.

&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc electrolytes offer the potential for cheaper rechargeable batteries due to their safe compatibility with the high capacity metal anode, yet they are stymied by irregular zinc deposition and consequent dendrite growth. Suppressing dendrite formation by tailoring the electrolyte is a proven approach from lithium batteries, yet the underlying mechanistic understanding that guides such tailoring does not necessarily directly translate from one system to the other. Here, we show that the electrostatic shielding mechanism, a fundamental concept in electrolyte engineering for stable metal anodes, has different consequences for the plating morphology in aqueous zinc batteries. We use operando electrochemical transmission electron microscopy to directly observe the zinc nucleation and growth under different electrolyte compositions, and reveal that electrostatic shielding additive suppresses dendrites by inhibiting secondary zinc nucleation along the (100) edges of existing primary deposits, and encouraging preferential deposition on the (002) faces, leading to a dense and block-like zinc morphology. The strong influence of the crystallography of Zn on the electrostatic shielding mechanism was further confirmed with Zn||Ti cells and density functional theory modelling. This work demonstrates the importance of considering the unique aspects of the aqueous zinc battery system when using concepts from other battery chemistries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Lewis Acid Driving Asymmetric Interfacial Electron Distribution to Stabilize Active Species for Efficient Neutral Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Neutral oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with unique reactive environments exhibits extremely slow reaction kinetics, posing significant challenges in the design of catalysts. Herein, a built&#8208;in electric field between the tungstate (Ni&#8208;FeWO4) with adjustable work function and Lewis acid WO3 is elaborately constructed to regulate asymmetric interfacial electron distribution, which promotes electron accumulation of Fe sites in the tungstate. This decelerates the rapid dissolution of Fe under the OER potentials, thereby retaining the active hydroxyl oxide with the optimized OER reaction pathway. Meanwhile, Lewis acid WO3 enhances hydroxyl adsorption near the electrode surface to improve mass transfer. As expected, the optimized Ni&#8208;FeWO4@WO3/NF self&#8208;supporting electrode achieves a low overpotential of 235 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in neutral media and maintains stable operation for 200 hours. Furthermore, the membrane electrode assembly constructed by such self&#8208;supporting electrode exhibits robust stability for 250 hours during neutral seawater electrolysis. This work deepens the understanding of the reconstruction of OER catalysts in neutral environments and paves the way for development of the energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Hierarchical Ohmic Contact Interface Engineering for Efficient Hydrazine&#8208;assisted Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydrazine oxidation reaction coupled with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is an effective strategy to achieve low energy water splitting for hydrogen production. In order to realize the application of hydrazine&#8208;assisted HER system, researchers have been focusing on the development of electrocatalysts with integrated dual active sites, while the performance under high current density is still unsatisfying. In this work, hierarchical Ohmic contact interface engineering is designed and used as a bridge between the NiMo and Ni2P heterojunction towards industrial current density applications, with the charge transfer impedance greatly eliminated via such a pathway with low energy barrier. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the importance of charge redistribution and energy barrier at the Ohmic contact interface is investigated by significantly reducing the voltage of overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) at high current density. Intriguingly, the NiMo/Ni2P hierarchical Ohmic contact heterojunction can drive current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm&#8722;2 with only 181 mV and 343 mV cell voltage in the OHzS electrolyzer with high electrocatalytic stability. The proposed hierarchical Ohmic contact interface engineering paves new avenue for hydrogen production with low energy consumption.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered and Self&#8208;Healable Extraocular&#8208;Muscle&#8208;Like Actuator Based on Dielectric Elastomer Actuator and Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>

Abstract
Although dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are promising artificial muscles for use as visual prostheses in patients with permanent oculomotor nerve palsy (ONP), high driving voltage coupled with the vulnerable compliant electrodes coated on the dielectric elastomers limits their safe long&#8208;term service. Herein, a self&#8208;healable polydimethylsiloxane compliant electrode based on reversible imine bonds and hydrogen bonds was prepared and coated on both sides of an acrylic ester film to develop a self&#8208;healable DEA (SDEA), followed by actuation with a high&#8208;output triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) to construct a self&#8208;powered DEA (TENG&#8208;SDEA). Under 135.9&#160;kV/mm, the self&#8208;powered SDEA exhibited an elevated actuated strain of 50.6%, comparable to the actuation of SDEA under DC power. Moreover, the mechanically damaged TENG&#8208;SDEA displayed a high self&#8208;healing efficiency of over 90% after self&#8208;healing for 3&#160;h at room temperature for 10 cycles. A low electric current of TENG ensuring the safe using of TENG&#8208;SDEAs and an extraocular&#8208;muscle&#8208;like actuator with oriented motion ability integrated by several TENG&#8208;SDEAs was constructed. Additionally, the SDEA was directly used as a flexible capacitive sensor for real&#8208;time monitoring of the patient's muscle movement. Accordingly, a medical aid system based on a conjunction of the extraocular&#8208;muscle&#8208;like actuator and flexible capacitive sensor was manufactured to helped the patients suffering from permanent ONP with disease control and prevention, as well as serve in physical rehabilitation and treatment.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Data Processing with Memristor Crossbar Array&#8208;Based Graph Reservoir</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Memristor&#8208;based physical reservoir computing is a robust framework for processing complex spatiotemporal data parallelly. However, conventional memristor&#8208;based reservoirs cannot capture the spatial relationship between the time&#8208;varying inputs due to the specific mapping scheme assigning one input signal to one memristor conductance. This study introduces a physical &#8220;graph reservoir&#8221; using a metal cell at the diagonal&#8208;crossbar array (mCBA) with dynamic self&#8208;rectifying memristors. Input and inverted input signals are applied to the word and bit lines of the mCBA, respectively, storing the correlation information between input signals in the memristors. In this way, the mCBA graph reservoirs can map the spatiotemporal correlation of the input data in a high&#8208;dimensional feature space. The high&#8208;dimensional mapping characteristics of the graph reservoir achieve notable results, including a normalized root&#8208;mean&#8208;square error of 0.09 in Mackey&#8208;Glass time series prediction, a 97.21% accuracy in MNIST recognition, and an 80.0% diagnostic accuracy in human connectome classification.

         <title>Smart&#8208;Responsive HOF Heterostructures with Multiple Spatial&#8208;Resolved Emission Modes towards Photonic Security Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Luminescent hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with the unique dynamics and versatile functional sites hold great potential application in information security, yet most of responsive HOFs focus on the single&#8208;component framework with restrained emission control, limiting further applications in advanced confidential information protection. Herein, we report the first smart&#8208;responsive HOF heterostructure with multiple spatial&#8208;resolved emission modes for covert photonic security platform. The HOF heterostructures are prepared by integrating different HOFs into a single microwire based on a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted epitaxial growth method. The distinct responsive behaviors of HOFs permit the heterostructure to simultaneously display the thermochromism via the framework transformation and the acidichromism via the protonation effect, thus generating multiple emission modes. The dual stimuli&#8208;controlled spatial&#8208;resolved emissive modes constitute the fingerprint of a heterostructure, and enable the establishment of the smart responsive photonic barcode with multiple convert states, which further demonstrate the dynamic coding capability and enhanced security in anti&#8208;counterfeiting label application. These results offer a promising route to design function&#8208;oriented smart responsive HOF micro&#8208;devices towards advanced anticounterfeiting applications.

         <title>Heterointerface Design of Perovskite Single Crystals for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal halide perovskite single crystals (MHP&#8208;SCs) are known for their facile fabrication into large sizes using inexpensive solution methods. Owing to their combination of large mobility&#8208;lifetime products and strong X&#8208;ray absorption, they are considered promising materials for efficient X&#8208;ray detection. However, they suffer from large dark currents and severe ion migration, which limit their sensitivity and stability in critical X&#8208;ray detection applications. Herein, a heterointerface design is proposed to reduce both the dark current and ion migration by forming a heterojunction with a high&#8208;energy band barrier in the space&#8208;charge region. In addition, the carrier transport performance was significantly improved using heterointerface engineering by designing a gradient band structure in the SCs. The SC heterojunction detectors exhibited a high sensitivity of 3.98 &#215; 105 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with a low detection limit of 12.2 nGyair s&#8722;1 and high a spatial resolution of 10.2 lp mm&#8722;1 during imaging. These values are among the highest reported for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MHP X&#8208;ray detectors. Moreover, the detectors showed excellent stability under continuous X&#8208;ray irradiation and maintained a clear X&#8208;ray imaging performance after 240 days. Owing to the built&#8208;in potential of heterojunctions, the SC detectors exhibit efficient self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection. Therefore, this study provides novel insights into the design and fabrication of X&#8208;ray detectors with high detection efficiency and stability, which are beneficial for developing inexpensive, high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray detection imaging equipment.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal halide perovskite single crystals (MHP-SCs) are known for their facile fabrication into large sizes using inexpensive solution methods. Owing to their combination of large mobility-lifetime products and strong X-ray absorption, they are considered promising materials for efficient X-ray detection. However, they suffer from large dark currents and severe ion migration, which limit their sensitivity and stability in critical X-ray detection applications. Herein, a heterointerface design is proposed to reduce both the dark current and ion migration by forming a heterojunction with a high-energy band barrier in the space-charge region. In addition, the carrier transport performance was significantly improved using heterointerface engineering by designing a gradient band structure in the SCs. The SC heterojunction detectors exhibited a high sensitivity of 3.98 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; &#956;C Gy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a low detection limit of 12.2 nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and high a spatial resolution of 10.2 lp mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; during imaging. These values are among the highest reported for state-of-the-art MHP X-ray detectors. Moreover, the detectors showed excellent stability under continuous X-ray irradiation and maintained a clear X-ray imaging performance after 240 days. Owing to the built-in potential of heterojunctions, the SC detectors exhibit efficient self-powered X-ray detection. Therefore, this study provides novel insights into the design and fabrication of X-ray detectors with high detection efficiency and stability, which are beneficial for developing inexpensive, high-resolution X-ray detection imaging equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tough And Moldable Sustainable Cellulose&#8208;Based Structural Materials via Multiscale Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
All&#8208;natural materials derived from cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) are expected to be used to replace engineering plastics and have attracted much attention. However, the lack of crack extension resistance and three&#8208;dimensional formability of nanofiber&#8208;based structural materials hinders their practical applications. Here, we report a multiscale interface engineering strategy to construct high&#8208;performance cellulose&#8208;based materials. The sisal microfibers are surface treated to expose abundant active CNFs with positive charges, thereby enhancing their interfacial combination with the negatively charged CNFs. The robust multiscale dual network enables easy molding of multiscale cellulose&#8208;based structural materials into complex three&#8208;dimensional special&#8208;shaped structures, resulting in nearly twofold and fivefold improvements in toughness and impact resistance compared with those of CNFs&#8208;based materials. Moreover, this multiscale interface engineering strategy endows cellulose&#8208;based structural materials with better comprehensive performance than petrochemical&#8208;based plastics and broadens cellulose's potential for lightweight applications as structural materials with lower environmental effects.

         <title>Controlled Growth of Single&#8208;Crystal Graphene Wafers on Twin&#8208;Boundary&#8208;Free Cu(111) Substrates</title>

Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal graphene (SCG) wafers are needed to enable mass&#8208;electronics and optoelectronics owing to their excellent properties and compatibility with silicon&#8208;based technology. Controlled synthesis of high&#8208;quality SCG wafers can be done exploiting single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) substrates as epitaxial growth substrates recently. However, current Cu(111) films prepared by magnetron sputtering on single&#8208;crystal sapphire wafers still suffer from in&#8208;plane twin boundaries, which degrade the SCG chemical vapor deposition. Here, we show how to eliminate twin boundaries on Cu and achieve 4&#8242;&#8217; Cu(111) wafers with &#8764;95% crystallinity. The introduction of a temperature gradient on Cu films with designed texture during annealing drives abnormal grain growth across the whole Cu wafer. In&#8208;plane twin boundaries are eliminated via migration of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane grain boundaries. SCG wafers grown on the resulting single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) substrates exhibit improved crystallinity with &gt;97% aligned graphene domains. As&#8208;synthesized SCG wafers exhibit an average carrier mobility up to 7284 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 at room temperature from 103 devices and a uniform sheet resistance with only 5% deviation in 4&#8242;&#8217; region.

         <title>New Nanophotonics Approaches for Enhancing the Efficiency and Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Over the past decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has experienced a remarkable ascent, soaring from 3.8% in 2009 to a remarkable record of 26.1% in 2023. Many recent approaches for improving PSC performance employ nanophotonic technologies, from light harvesting and thermal management to the manipulation of charge carrier dynamics. Plasmonic nanoparticles (NP) and arrayed dielectric nanostructures have been applied to tailor the light absorption, scattering, and conversion, as well as the heat dissipation within PSCs to improve their PCE and operational stability. In this review, we begin with a concise introduction to define the realm of nanophotonics by focusing on the nanoscale interactions between light and surface plasmons or dielectric photonic structures. We then elaborate on the prevailing strategies that utilize resonance&#8208;enhanced light&#8208;matter interactions for boosting the PCE and stability of PSCs from light trapping, carrier transportation and thermal management perspectives, and discuss the resultant practical applications, such as semi&#8208;transparent photovoltaics (PV), colored PSCs, and smart perovskite windows. Finally, we review the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nanophotonic paradigms in PSCs, and highlight the benefits of these approaches in improving the aesthetic effects and energy&#8208;saving character of PSC&#8208;integrated buildings.

         <title>3D Printing of Self&#8208;Healing Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In this review article, we present a comprehensive overview of the latest advances in the field of 3D printable structures with self&#8208;healing properties. Three&#8208;dimensional printing (3DP) is a versatile technology that enables the rapid manufacturing of complex geometric structures with precision and functionality not previously attainable. However, the application of 3DP technology is still limited by the availability of materials with customizable properties specifically designed for additive manufacturing. The addition of self&#8208;healing properties within 3D printed objects is of high interest as it can improve the performance and lifespan of structural components, and even enable the mimicking of living tissues for biomedical applications, such as organs printing. In the review, we will discuss and analyze the most relevant results reported in recent years in the development of self&#8208;healing polymeric materials that can be processed via 3D printing. After introducing the chemical and physical self&#8208;healing mechanism that can be exploited, the literature review here reported will focus in particular on printability and repairing performances. At last, actual perspective and possible development field will be critically discussed.

         <title>Selective Electroreduction of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to Dimethylfuran in Neutral Electrolytes via Hydrogen Spillover and Adsorption Configuration Adjustment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), one of the essential C6 biomass derivatives, has been deeply investigated in electrocatalytic reduction upgrading. Nevertheless, the high product selectivity and rational design strategy of electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic HMF reduction is still a challenge. Here, we achieve a high selective electro&#8208;reduction of HMF to dimethylfuran (DMF) on Pd single atom loaded on TiO2 via hydrogen spillover and adsorption configuration adjustment in neutral electrolytes. Combining the density functional theory calculation and in&#8208;situ characterization, it was revealed that Pd single atom could weaken the interaction between the Pd atom and adsorbed hydrogen (*H) to promote the *H spillover for increasing *H coverage on the surface and maintain the tilted adsorption configuration to activate C = O bond; thus the selectivity of DMF on Pd single atom loaded on TiO2 increased to 90.33%. Besides, it is elaborated that low *H coverage on TiO2 favors the formation of bis(hydroxymethyl)hydro&#8208;furoin (BHH), and the flat adsorption configuration of HMF on Pd nanoparticles benefits to form 2,5&#8208;dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF); thus the selectivity of BHH on TiO2 and that of DHMF on Pd nanoparticles loaded on Vulcan&#8208;XC72 can reach 70.16% and 89.63%. This work provides a promising approach for modifying electrocatalysts to realize the selective electroreduction of HMF to value&#8208;added products.

         <title>High Entropy Oxides Modulate Atomic&#8208;Level Interactions for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
The strong electrostatic interaction between high&#8208;charge&#8208;density zinc ions (112 C mm&#8722;3) and the fixed crystallinity of traditional oxide cathodes with delayed charge compensation hinders the development of high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, to intrinsically promote electron transfer efficiency and improve lattice tolerance, we propose a revolutionary family of high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) materials with multipath electron transfer and remarkable structural stability as cathodes for AZIBs. Benefiting from the unique &#8220;cock&#8208;tail&#8221; effect, the interaction of diverse type metal&#8208;atoms in HEOs achieves essentially broadened d&#8208;band and lower degeneracy than monometallic oxides, which contribute to convenient electron transfer and one of the best rate&#8208;performance (136.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10.0 A g&#8722;1) in AZIBs. In addition, the intense lattice strain field of HEOs is highly tolerant to the electrostatic repulsion of high&#8208;charge&#8208;density Zn2+, leading to an outstanding cycling stability in AZIBs. Moreover, the super selectability of elements in HEOs exhibits significant potential for AZIBs.

         <title>Interfacial Assembly of Two&#8208;Dimensional Graphene&#8208;Derived Ion Channels for Water&#8208;Based Green Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The utilization of sustained and green energy is believed to alleviate increasing menace of global environmental concerns and energy dilemma. Interfacial assembly of two&#8208;dimensional graphene&#8208;derived ion channels (2D&#8208;GDIC) with tunable ion/fluid transport behavior enables efficient harvesting of renewable green energy from ubiquitous water, especially for osmotic energy harvesting. In this Review, we summarize various interfacial assembly strategies for fabricating diverse 2D&#8208;GDICs and discuss their ion transport properties. We analyze how particular structure and charge density/distribution of 2D&#8208;GDIC can be modulated to minimize internal resistance of ion/fluid transport and enhance energy conversion efficiency, and we highlight stimuli&#8208;responsive functions and stability of 2D&#8208;GDIC and further examine the possibility of integrating 2D&#8208;GDIC with other energy conversion systems. Notably, the presented preparation and applications of 2D&#8208;GDIC also inspire and guide other 2D materials to fabricate sophisticated ion channels for targeted applications. Finally, we analyze potential challenges in this field and offer a prospect to future developments toward high&#8208;performance or large&#8208;scale real&#8208;word applications.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Sensitive Intelligent Nanosystems: A Promising Strategy for the Treatment of Neurological Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Neurological diseases are a major global health challenge, affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Ultrasound therapy plays an irreplaceable role in the treatment of neurological diseases due to its non&#8208;invasive, highly focused, and strong tissue penetration capabilities. However, the complexity of brain and nervous system and the safety risks associated with prolonged exposure to ultrasound therapy severely limit the applicability of ultrasound therapy. Ultrasound&#8208;sensitive intelligent nanosystems (USINs) are a novel therapeutic strategy for neurological diseases that bring greater spatiotemporal controllability and improved safety to overcome these challenges. This review provides a detailed overview of therapeutic strategies and clinical advances of ultrasound in neurological diseases, focusing on the potential of USINs&#8208;based ultrasound in the treatment of neurological diseases. Based on the physical and chemical effects induced by ultrasound, rational design of USINs is a prerequisite for improving the efficacy of ultrasound therapy. Recent developments of ultrasound&#8208;sensitive nanocarriers and nanoagents are systemically reviewed. Finally, the challenges and developing prospects of USINs are discussed in depth, with a view to providing useful insights and guidance for efficient ultrasound treatment of neurological diseases.

         <title>Bionic Luminescent Skin as Ultrasensitive Temperature&#8208;Acoustic Sensor for Underwater Information Perception and Transmission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bioinspired artificial luminescent skin (L&#8208;skin) integrated with multiple sensing functions significantly promotes the development of smart devices. It is considerably challenging to realize underwater sensing technologies. Here, a sharkskin&#8208;inspired Eu@HOF&#8208;TJ&#8208;1@TA L&#8208;skin (1) is prepared for both temperature and sound sensing. 1 is an ultrathin and flexible temperature sensor, in 298.15&#8722;358.15 K, exhibiting ultrahigh maximum relative sensitivity (97.669% K&#8722;1) and low minimum uncertainty (0.000952 K). The temperature response mechanism is analyzed deeply. As a waterproofing acoustic sensor, 1 can monitor sound in both air and water with the greatest sound response frequencies of 400 and 300&#160;Hz in air and water, respectively. The maximum sensitivities of 1 in air and water are 6593765.2 and 1346124.5 cps&#183;Pa&#8722;1, respectively. The response times of 1 in air and water are as fast as 20 and 10&#160;ms. The sound response processes of 1 in air and water are simulated by finite element simulation. Moreover, by using sharkskin&#8208;inspired 1, the actual water temperature can be monitored, and a series of water sound information can be recognized by using an artificial neural network. This work proposes a sharkskin&#8208;inspired L&#8208;skin for temperature and acoustic sensing and promotes the development of underwater sensing technology with high performances.

         <title>Structural Understanding for High&#8208;Voltage Stabilization of Lithium Cobalt Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The rapid development of modern consumer electronics is placing higher demands on lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2; LCO) cathode that powers them. Increasing operating voltage is exclusively effective in boosting LCO capacity and energy density but is inhibited by the innate high&#8208;voltage instability of LCO structure that serves as the foundation and determinant of its electrochemical behavior in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). This has stimulated extensive research on LCO structural stabilization. Here, we focus on the fundamental structural understanding of LCO cathode from long&#8208;term studies. Multi&#8208;scale structures concerning LCO bulk and surface and various structural issues along with their origins and corresponding stabilization strategies with specific mechanisms are uncovered and elucidated at length, which will certainly deepen and advance our knowledge of LCO structure and further its inherent relationship with electrochemical performance. And based on these understandings, remaining questions and opportunities for future stabilization of LCO structure are also emphasized.

         <title>Advancements in Microwave Absorption Motivated by Interdisciplinary Research</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Microwave absorption materials (MAMs) were originally developed for military purposes, but have since evolved into versatile materials with promising applications in modern technologies, including household use. Despite significant progress in bench&#8208;side research over the past decade, MAMs remain limited in their scope and have yet to be widely adopted. This review explores the history of MAMs from first&#8208;generation coatings to second&#8208;generation functional absorbers, identifies bottlenecks hindering their maturation. It also presents potential solutions such as exploring broader spatial scales, advanced characterization, introducing liquid media, utilizing novel toolbox (machine learning), and proximity of lab to end&#8208;user. Additionally, it meticulously presents compelling applications of MAMs in medicine, mechanics, energy, optics, and sensing, which go beyond absorption efficiency, along with their current development status and prospects. This interdisciplinary research direction differs from previous research which primarily focused on meeting traditional requirements (i. e., thin, lightweight, wide, and strong), and can be defined as the next generation of smart absorbers. Ultimately, the effective utilization of ubiquitous electromagnetic waves, aided by third&#8208;generation MAMs, should be better aligned with future expectations.

         <title>Deep Learning&#8208;Assisted Active Metamaterials with Heat&#8208;Enhanced Thermal Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Heat management is crucial for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications such as passive radiative cooling, thermally adjustable wearables, and camouflage systems. Their adaptive versions, to cater to varied requirements, lean on the potential of adaptive metamaterials. Existing efforts, however, feature with highly anisotropic parameters, narrow working&#8208;temperature ranges, and the need for manual intervention, which remain long&#8208;term and tricky obstacles for the most advanced self&#8208;adaptive metamaterials. To surmount these barriers, we introduce heat&#8208;enhanced thermal diffusion metamaterials powered by deep learning. Such active metamaterials can automatically sense ambient temperatures and swiftly, as well as continuously, adjust their thermal functions with a high degree of tunability. They maintain robust thermal performance even when external thermal fields change direction, and both simulations and experiments demonstrate exceptional results. Furthermore, we design two metadevices with on&#8208;demand adaptability, performing distinctive features with isotropic materials, wide working temperatures, and spontaneous response. This work offers a framework for the design of intelligent thermal diffusion metamaterials and can be expanded to other diffusion fields, adapting to increasingly complex and dynamic environments.

         <title>Structural Regulation of Photocatalyst to Optimize Hydroxyl Radical Production Pathways for Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening of phenol in wastewater is the pivotal step in photocatalytic degradation. The highly selective generation of catalytical active species (&#8226;OH) to facilitate this process presents a significant scientific challenge. Therefore, a novel approach for designing photocatalysts with single&#8208;atom containment in COFs (M&#8208;COFs) is proposed. The selection of imine&#8208;linked COFs containing abundant N and O&#8208;chelate sites provides a solid foundation for anchoring metal atom. These dispersed metal atom possess rapid accumulation and transfer capabilities for photogenerated electrons, while the periodic &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure in 2D&#8208;COFs establishes an effective platform. Additionally, the Lewis acid properties of imine bonds in COFs can enhance the adsorption capacity towards gases with Lewis base properties such as O2 and N2. It has been demonstrated that the Pd2+@Tp&#8208;TAPT, designed based on this concept, exhibits efficient oxygen adsorption and follows the reaction pathway of O2&#8594;&#8226;O2&#8722;&#8594;H2O2&#8594;&#8226;OH with high selectivity, thereby achieving completely degradation of refractory phenol through photocatalysis within 10 mins. We anticipate that the selective generation of catalytic active species via advanced material design concepts will serve as a significant reference for achieving precise material catalysis in the future.

         <title>Space&#8208;Confined Synthesis of Monolayer Graphdiyne in MXene Interlayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Graphdiyne (GDY) is an artificial carbon allotrope that is conceptually similar to graphene but composed of sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. Monolayer GDY (ML&#8208;GDY) is predicted to be an ideal two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductor material with a wide range of applications. However, its synthesis has posed a significant challenge, leading to difficulties in experimentally validating theoretical properties. Here, we report that in&#8208;situ acetylenic homocoupling of hexaethynylbenzene within the sub&#8208;nanometer interlayer space of MXene can effectively prevent out&#8208;of&#8208;plane growth or vertical stacking of the material, resulting in ML&#8208;GDY with in&#8208;plane periodicity. The subsequent exfoliation process successfully yields free&#8208;standing GDY monolayers with micrometer&#8208;scale lateral dimensions. The fabrication of field&#8208;effect transistor on free&#8208;standing ML&#8208;GDY makes the first measurement of its electronic properties possible. The measured electrical conductivity (5.1&#215;103 S m&#8722;1) and carrier mobility (231.4 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) at room temperature are remarkably higher than those of the previously reported multilayer GDY materials. The space&#8208;confined synthesis using layered crystals as templates provides a new strategy for preparing 2D materials with precisely controlled layer numbers and long&#8208;range structural order.

         <title>Achieving Record&#8208;high Stretchability and Mechanical Stability in Organic Photovoltaic Blends with a Dilute&#8208;absorber Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have potential for applications in wearable electronics. Except for high power conversion efficiency (PCE), excellent tensile properties and mechanical stability are required for achieving high&#8208;performance wearable OSCs, while the present metrics barely meet the stretchable requirements. Herein, we propose a facile and low&#8208;cost strategy for constructing intrinsically stretchable OSCs by introducing a readily accessible polymer elastomer as a diluent for organic photovoltaic blends. Remarkably, record&#8208;high stretchability with a fracture strain of up to 1000% and mechanical stability with elastic recovery&gt;90% under cyclic tensile tests were realized in the OSCs active layers for the first time. Specifically, the tensile properties of best&#8208;performing all&#8208;polymer photovoltaic blends were increased by up to 250 times after blending. Previously unattainable performance metrics (fracture strain &gt;50% and PCE &gt;10%) were achieved simultaneously for the resulting photovoltaic films. Furthermore, an overall evaluation parameter y was proposed for the efficiency&#8208;cost&#8208;stretchability balance of photovoltaic blend films. The y value of our dilute&#8208;absorber system was two orders of magnitude greater than those of prior state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art systems. Additionally, intrinsically stretchable devices were prepared to verify the mechanical stability. Overall, this work offers a new avenue for constructing and comprehensively evaluating intrinsically stretchable organic electronic films.

         <title>Scalable Printing of Metal Nanostructures Through Superluminescent Light Projection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Direct printing of metallic nanostructures is highly desirable but current techniques cannot achieve nanoscale resolutions or are too expensive and slow. Photoreduction of solvated metal ions into metallic nanoparticles is an attractive strategy because it is faster than deposition&#8208;based techniques. However, it is still limited by the resolution versus cost tradeoff because sub&#8208;diffraction printing of nanostructures requires high&#8208;intensity light from expensive femtosecond lasers. Here, we have overcome this tradeoff by leveraging the spatial and temporal coherence properties of low&#8208;intensity diode&#8208;based superluminescent light. We present the superluminescent light projection (SLP) technique to rapidly print sub&#8208;diffraction nanostructures, as small as 210&#160;nm and at periods as small as 300&#160;nm, with light that is a billion times less intense than femtosecond lasers. We demonstrate printing of arbitrarily complex 2D nanostructured silver patterns over 30&#160;&#956;m &#215; 80&#160;&#956;m areas in 500&#160;ms time scales. The post&#8208;annealed nanostructures exhibit an electrical conductivity up to 1/12th that of bulk silver. SLP is up to 480 times faster and 35 times less expensive than printing with femtosecond lasers. Therefore, it transforms nanoscale metal printing into a scalable format, thereby significantly enhancing the transition of nano&#8208;enabled devices from research laboratories into real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>A Tunable Soft Silicone Bioadhesive for Secure Anchoring of Diverse Medical Devices to Wet Biological Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Silicone is utilized widely in medical devices for its compatibility with tissues and bodily fluids, making it a versatile material for implants and wearables. To effectively bond silicone devices to biological tissues, a reliable adhesive is required to create a strong and long&#8208;lasting interface. This study introduces BioAdheSil, a silicone&#8208;based bioadhesive designed to provide robust adhesion on both sides of the interface, facilitating bonding between dissimilar substrates, namely silicone devices and tissues. The adhesive's design focuses on two key aspects: wet tissue adhesion capability and tissue&#8208;infiltration&#8208;based long&#8208;term integration. BioAdheSil is formulated by mixing soft silicone oligomers with siloxane coupling agents and absorbents for bonding the hydrophobic silicone device to hydrophilic biological tissues. Incorporation of biodegradable absorbents eliminates surface water and controls porosity, while silane crosslinkers provide interfacial strength. Over time, BioAdheSil transitions from non&#8208;permeable to permeable through enzyme degradation, creating a porous structure that facilitates cell migration and tissue integration, potentially enabling long&#8208;lasting adhesion. Experimental results demonstrate that BioAdheSil outperforms commercial adhesives and elicits no adverse response in rats. BioAdheSil offers practical utility for adhering silicone devices to wet tissues, including long&#8208;term implants and transcutaneous devices. In this study, we demonstrate its functionality through applications such as tracheal stents and LVAD (Left Ventricular Assist Device) lines.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicone is utilized widely in medical devices for its compatibility with tissues and bodily fluids, making it a versatile material for implants and wearables. To effectively bond silicone devices to biological tissues, a reliable adhesive is required to create a strong and long-lasting interface. This study introduces BioAdheSil, a silicone-based bioadhesive designed to provide robust adhesion on both sides of the interface, facilitating bonding between dissimilar substrates, namely silicone devices and tissues. The adhesive's design focuses on two key aspects: wet tissue adhesion capability and tissue-infiltration-based long-term integration. BioAdheSil is formulated by mixing soft silicone oligomers with siloxane coupling agents and absorbents for bonding the hydrophobic silicone device to hydrophilic biological tissues. Incorporation of biodegradable absorbents eliminates surface water and controls porosity, while silane crosslinkers provide interfacial strength. Over time, BioAdheSil transitions from non-permeable to permeable through enzyme degradation, creating a porous structure that facilitates cell migration and tissue integration, potentially enabling long-lasting adhesion. Experimental results demonstrate that BioAdheSil outperforms commercial adhesives and elicits no adverse response in rats. BioAdheSil offers practical utility for adhering silicone devices to wet tissues, including long-term implants and transcutaneous devices. In this study, we demonstrate its functionality through applications such as tracheal stents and LVAD (Left Ventricular Assist Device) lines.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Engineering Mesoscopic 3D tumor Models with A Self&#8208;Organizing Vascularized Matrix</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Advanced in vitro systems such as multicellular spheroids and lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip devices have been developed, but often fall short in reproducing the tissue scale and self&#8208;organization of human diseases. We here introduce a bio&#8208;printed artificial tumor model with endothelial and stromal cells self&#8208;organizing into perfusable and functional vascular structures. Our model uses 3D hydrogel matrices to embed multicellular tumor spheroids, allowing them to grow to mesoscopic scales and to interact with endothelial cells. We show that angiogenic multicellular tumor spheroids promote the growth of a vascular network, which in turn further enhances the growth of co&#8208;cultivated tumor spheroids. The self&#8208;developed vascular structure infiltrates the tumor spheroids, forms functional connections with the bioprinted endothelium, and can be perfused by erythrocytes and polystyrene microspheres. Moreover, cancer cells migrate spontaneously from the tumor spheroid through the self&#8208;assembled vascular network into the fluid flow. Additionally, tumor type specific characteristics of desmoplasia, angiogenesis, and metastatic propensity are preserved between patient&#8208;derived samples and tumors derived from this same material growing in our bioreactors. Overall, our modular approach opens up new avenues for studying tumor pathophysiology and cellular interactions in vitro, providing a platform for advanced drug testing while reducing the need for in vivo experimentation.

         <title>Hyperstable Eutectic Core&#8208;Spun Fiber Enabled Wearable Energy Harvesting and Personal Thermal Management Fabric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electronic textiles have gradually evolved into one of the most important mainstays of flexible electronics owing to their good wearability. However, textile multifunctionality is generally achieved by stacking functional modules, which is not conducive to wearability. Integrating these modules into a single fiber provides a better solution. In this work, a core&#8208;spun functional fiber (CSF) constructed from hyper&#8208;environmentally stable Zn&#8208;based eutectogel as the core layer and polytetrafluoroethylene as the sheath is designed. The CSF achieves a synergistic output effect of piezoelectricity&#8208;enhanced triboelectricity, as well as reliable hydrophobicity, and high mid&#8208;infrared emissivity and visible light reflectivity. A monolayer functionalized integrated textile is woven from the CSF to enable effective energy (mechanical and droplet energy) harvesting and personal thermal management functions. Furthermore, scenarios for the energy supply, motion detection, and outdoor use of electronic fabrics for electronics applications are demonstrated, opening new avenues for the functional integration of electronic textiles.

         <title>Direct Operando Visualization of Metal Support Interactions Induced by Hydrogen Spillover During CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The understanding of catalyst active sites is a fundamental challenge for the future rational design of optimized and bespoke catalysts. For instance, the partial reduction of Ce4+ surface sites to Ce3+ and the formation of oxygen vacancies are critical for CO2 hydrogenation, CO oxidation and the water gas shift reaction. Furthermore, metal nanoparticles, the reducible support, and metal support interactions are prone to evolve under reaction conditions, therefore a catalyst structure must be characterized under operando conditions to identify active states and deduce structure&#8208;activity relationships. In the present work, we investigate temperature&#8208;induced morphological and chemical changes in Ni nanoparticle&#8208;decorated mesoporous CeO2 by means of in situ quantitative multimode electron tomography and in situ heating electron energy loss spectroscopy, respectively. Moreover, we employ operando electron energy loss spectroscopy using a windowed gas cell and reveal the role of Ni&#8208;induced hydrogen spillover on active Ce3+ site formation and enhancement of the overall catalytic performance.

         <title>Leveraging Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles for Combination Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy has become a promising method for cancer treatment, bringing hope to advanced cancer patients. However, immune&#8208;related adverse events caused by immunotherapy also bring heavy burden to patients. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as an emerging nanomaterial with high biocompatibility, can eliminate tumors and induce tumor immunogenic cell death through different therapeutic modalities, including photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy and sonodynamic therapy. In addition, SPNs can work as a functional nanocarrier to synergize with a variety of immunomodulators to amplify anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. In this review, we comprehensively summarize SPNs&#8208;based combination cancer immunotherapy according to the SPNs&#8217; therapeutic modalities and the type of loaded immunomodulators. The in&#8208;depth understanding of existing SPNs&#8208;based therapeutic modalities will hopefully inspire the design of more novel nanomaterials with potent anti&#8208;tumor immune effects, and ultimately promote their clinical translation.

         <title>Surface Energy Engineering of Buried Interface for Highly Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Over 25%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The abundant oxygen&#8208;related defects (e.g., O vacancies, O&#8208;H) in the TiO2 electron transport layer results in high surface energy, which is detrimental to effective carrier extraction and seriously impairs the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. Here, novel surface energy engineering (SEE) was developed by applying a surfactant of heptadecafluorooctanesulphonate tetraethylammonium (HFSTA) on the surface of the TiO2. Theoretical calculations show that the HFSTA&#8208;TiO2 is less prone to form O vacancies, leading to lower surface energy, thus improving the carrier&#8208;extraction efficiency. The experimental results show that superior perovskite film was obtained due to the reduced heterogeneous nucleation sites and improved crystallization process on the modified TiO2. Furthermore, the flexible long alkyl chains in HFSTA considerably relieved the compressive stresses at the buried interface. By combining the passivation of TiO2, crystallization process modulation and stress relief, a champion PCE up to 25.03% was achieved. The device without encapsulation sustained 92.2% of its initial PCE after more than 2500&#160;h storage under air ambient with relative humidity of 25&#8211;30%. The SEE of a buried interface paves a new way towards high&#8208;efficiency, stable perovskite solar cells.

         <title>A 2d Heterostructure&#8208;Based Multifunctional Floating Gate Memory Device for Multimodal Reservoir Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The demand for economical and efficient data processing has led to a surge of interest in neuromorphic computing based on emerging two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials in recent years. As a rising van der Waals (vdW) p&#8208;type Weyl semiconductor with many intriguing properties, tellurium has been widely used in advanced electronics/optoelectronics. However, its application in floating gate memory devices for information processing has never been explored. Herein, we report an electronic/optoelectronic floating gate memory device enabled by tellurium&#8208;based 2D vdW heterostructure for multimodal reservoir computing. When subjected to intense electrical/optical stimuli, our device exhibits impressive nonvolatile electronic memory behaviors including &#8764;108 extinction ratio, &#8764;100&#8208;ns switching speed, &gt;4000 cycles, &gt;4000&#8208;s retention stability, and nonvolatile multi&#8208;bit optoelectronic programmable characteristics. When the input stimuli weaken, the nonvolatile memory degrades into volatile memory. Leveraging these rich nonlinear dynamics, we demonstrate a multimodal reservoir computing system with high recognition accuracy of 90.77% for event&#8208;type multimodal handwritten digit&#8208;recognition.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demand for economical and efficient data processing has led to a surge of interest in neuromorphic computing based on emerging two-dimensional (2D) materials in recent years. As a rising van der Waals (vdW) &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-type Weyl semiconductor with many intriguing properties, tellurium has been widely used in advanced electronics/optoelectronics. However, its application in floating gate memory devices for information processing has never been explored. Herein, we report an electronic/optoelectronic floating gate memory device enabled by tellurium-based 2D vdW heterostructure for multimodal reservoir computing. When subjected to intense electrical/optical stimuli, our device exhibits impressive nonvolatile electronic memory behaviors including &#8764;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; extinction ratio, &#8764;100-ns switching speed, &amp;gt;4000 cycles, &amp;gt;4000-s retention stability, and nonvolatile multi-bit optoelectronic programmable characteristics. When the input stimuli weaken, the nonvolatile memory degrades into volatile memory. Leveraging these rich nonlinear dynamics, we demonstrate a multimodal reservoir computing system with high recognition accuracy of 90.77% for event-type multimodal handwritten digit-recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
A microstructural informed thermodynamic model was utilized to tailor the pseudoelastic performance of a series of Fe&#8211;Mn&#8211;Al&#8211;Ni shape&#8208;memory alloys. Following this approach, the influence of the stability and the amount of the B2&#8208;ordered precipitates on the stability of the austenitic state and the pseudoelastic response was revealed. This was assessed by a combination of complementary nanoindentation measurements and incremental&#8208;strain tests under compressive loading. Based on these investigations, the applicability of the proposed models for the prediction of shape&#8208;memory capabilities of Fe&#8211;Mn&#8211;Al&#8211;Ni alloys was confirmed. Eventually, these thermodynamic considerations enable the guided enhancement of functional properties in this alloy system through the direct design of alloy compositions. The procedure proposed renders a significant advancement in the field of shape&#8208;memory alloys.

         <title>The One&#8208;Stop Integrated Nanoagent Based on Photothermal Therapy for Deep Infection Healing and Inflammation Inhibition</title>

Abstract
Chronic wounds caused by bacterial infections have become a major challenge in the medical field. Hypoxia condition in the chronic wound area extremely induces the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and up&#8208;regulates the expression of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor (HIF&#8208;1&#945;), both of which can enhance the production of pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 subtype macrophages while reducing the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 subtype macrophages. Besides, the bacteria&#8208;formed biofilms in the chronic wound area also hinder the penetration of therapeutic agents. Encouraged by the natural motors automatically executing tasks, we hypothesize that supplying sufficient oxygen (O2) would simultaneously drive therapeutic agent movement, rescue the hypoxic microenvironment, and disrupt the vicious cycle of inflammation. Here, we develop small organic molecule&#8208;based nanoparticles (2TT-mC6B@Cu5.4O NPs) that possess high photothermal conversion efficiency and enzymatic activities, including superoxide dismutase&#8208;, catalase&#8208;, and glutathione peroxidase&#8208;like activity. 2TT-mC6B@Cu5.4O NPs exhibit superior ROS scavenging and O2 production abilities in synergistically relieving inflammatory microenvironment and deep penetration of 2TT-mC6B@Cu5.4O NPs in the chronic wound tissues. By combining the photothermal property, 2TT-mC6B@Cu5.4O NPs can effectively eliminate bacteria in biofilms to promote wound healing. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis and in vivo experiments further demonstrate that 2TT-mC6B@Cu5.4O NPs effectively inhibit biological activities inside bacteria and alleviate hypoxia in deep tissue infections.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reconstruction of Highly Degraded LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 Towards Stable Single&#8208;Crystalline Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing demand for resources sustainability has promoted the recycle of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) to a strategic position. Direct recycle outperforms either hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurgical approaches due to the high added value and facile treatment processes. However, the traditional direct recycling technologies are only applicable for Ni&#8208;poor/middle cathodes. Herein, we directly recycle of spent Ni&#8208;rich LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (S&#8208;NCM) to performance&#8208;enhanced single&#8208;crystalline cathode materials using a simple but effective LiOH&#8208;NaCl molten salt. We systematically investigate the evolution process of the Li&#8208;supplement and grain&#8208;recrystallization during regeneration, and comprehensively prove the successful recovery of the highly degraded microstructure, including significant elimination of Ni2+ and O vacancies. Beneficial from the favorable reconstructed single&#8208;crystalline particles, the regenerated NCM (R&#8208;NCM) represents remarkably enhanced structural stability, electrochemical activity, O2 and cracks suppression during charge/discharge, thus achieving the excellent performances in long&#8208;term cycling and high&#8208;rate tests. As a result, R&#8208;NCM maintains the 86.5% reversible capacity at 1C after 200 cycles. Instructively, the present molten salt can be successfully applied for recycling spent NCMs with various Li and Ni compositions (e.g., LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2).

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Communication with Lighting: Rgb Wavelength Division Multiplexing OLEDs/OPDs Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A multichannel/multicolor visible light communication (VLC) system using entirely organic components, including organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photodiodes (OPDs), is developed to demonstrate indoor lighting applications where the integration of OLEDs and OPDs has significant potential. To achieve this, tricolor (R/G/B)&#8208;selective OPD arrays for the receiver and tricolor OLED arrays for the emitter are developed. For (R/G/B)&#8208;selective OPDs, a Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot electrode structure to enhance color selectivity and a thick junction structure to effectively accommodate a wide range of driving voltages are introduced. For tricolor OLEDs, fluorescent&#8208;emitting materials are used to enhance the operating frequency in addition to introducing a cavity structure to achieve narrow emission. Utilizing these spectrally refined tricolor OPDs/OLEDs, a VLC system is designed for indoor lighting applications, and a systematic analysis of their signal&#8208;to&#8208;interference ratio dependence on the distance or angle between the transmitter and receiver is performed. The study's findings indicate the importance of emission angle&#8208;dependent wavelength shift of the OLED and the luminosity function, which varies with wavelength, in the R/G/B mixed&#8208;white&#8208;light&#8208;based VLC systems. Finally, the feasibility of VLC using tricolor OPDs/OLEDs in the real&#8208;life context of indoor white&#8208;color lighting is demonstrated, showing that the transmitted data patterns well&#8208;matched the received data patterns.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Independent Synchronized Ros Generation and Hypoxia Prodrug Activation with Z&#8208;Scheme Heterostructure Sonosensitizer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Combination therapy has emerged as a promising approach for effective tumor treatment. However, the combination of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) and hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrugs (HAPs) has not been explored due to the contradictory requirement of oxygen (O2) for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and the necessity to avoid O2 for the activation of HAPs. In this study, we address this challenge by developing BiOCl&#8208;Au&#8208;Ag2S Z&#8208;scheme heterostructure nanoparticles loaded with tirapazamine (TPZ) to achieve O2&#8208;independent therapy. These nanoparticles demonstrate efficient electron&#8208;hole separation under ultrasound irradiation while maintaining a high redox potential. The generated holes react with water to efficiently produce hydroxyl radicals, while the electrons autonomously activate TPZ, negating the need for O2. In vitro and in vivo assessments validate the effective tumor elimination by these Z&#8208;scheme nanoparticles without disrupting the hypoxic environment. This innovative design overcomes the limitations associated with O2 requirement in SDT and introduces a novel strategy for HAP activation and synergistic therapy between ROS and HAP&#8208;based therapy.

         <title>A Janus&#8208;Ros Healing System Promoting Infectious Bone Regeneration via Sono&#8208;Epigenetic Modulation</title>

Abstract
Elimination of bacterial infections and simultaneously promoting osteogenic differentiation are highly required for infectious bone diseases. Massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) can damage cells, while low ROS concentrations as a molecular signal can regulate cellular fate. In this study, we develop a Janus&#8208;ROS healing system for infectious bone regeneration. An alendronate (ALN)&#8208;mediated defective metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) sonosensitizer is prepared, which can effectively clear Methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections and promote osteogenic differentiation under differential ultrasonic irradiation. In the presence of zirconium&#8211;phosphate coordination, the ALN&#8208;mediated porphyrin&#8208;based MOF (HN25) with a proper defect has great sonodynamic antibacterial efficiency (98.97%, 15&#160;min) and bone targeting ability. Notably, under low power ultrasound irradiation, HN25 can increase the chromatin accessibility of ossification&#8208;related genes and FOXO1 to promote bone repair through low ROS concentrations. Animal models of paravertebral infection, fracture with infection, and osteomyelitis demonstrate that HN25 successfully realizes the targeted and potent repair of various infectious bone tissues through rapid MRSA elimination, inhibiting osteoclast activity and promoting bone regeneration. Our results show that high catalytic efficiency and bioactive MOF can be constructed using pharmaceutical&#8208;mediated defect engineering. The Janus&#8208;ROS treatment is also a promising therapeutic mode for infectious tissue regeneration.

         <title>Low&#8208;Cost Hydrogen Production from Alkaline/Seawater Over a Single Step Synthesis of Mo3se4&#8208;Nise Core&#8208;Shell Nanowire Arrays</title>

Abstract
The rational design and steering of earth&#8208;abundant, efficient, and stable electrocatalysts for hydrogen generation is highly desirable but challenging with catalysts free of platinum group metals (PGMs). Mass production of high&#8208;purity hydrogen fuel from seawater electrolysis presents a transformative technology for sustainable alternatives. Here, we report a heterostructure of molybdenum selenide&#8208;nickel selenide (Mo3Se4&#8208;NiSe) core&#8208;shell nanowire arrays constructed on nickel foam by a single&#8208;step in situ hydrothermal process. This tiered structure provides improved intrinsic activity and high electrical conductivity for efficient charge transfer and endows excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity in alkaline and natural seawater conditions. The Mo3Se4&#8208;NiSe freestanding electrodes require small overpotentials of 84.4 and 166&#160;mV to reach a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline and natural seawater electrolytes, respectively. It maintained an impressive balance between electrocatalytic activity and stability. Experimental and theoretical calculations revealed that the Mo3Se4&#8208;NiSe interface provides abundant active sites for the HER process, which modulate the binding energies of adsorbed species and decrease the energetic barrier, providing a new route to design state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, PGM&#8208;free catalysts for hydrogen production from alkaline and seawater electrolysis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Oxidation Resistance of the Curved Surface of Achromatic Copper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of achromatic Cu films with semi&#8208;permanent stability and switchable superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic states on rough or curved surfaces is realized by an innovative strategy. Comprehensive atomic&#8208;resolution microscopy reveals that their surfaces are of a series of monoatomic steps and have a counterintuitive lattice contraction, which demonstrates the self&#8208;oxidation resistance of copper.








Abstract
Copper surfaces that exhibit a wide range of achromatic colors while still metallic have not been studied, despite advancements in antireflection coatings. A series of achromatic copper films grown with [111] preferred orientation by depositing 3D&#160;porous nanostructures is introduced via coherent/incoherent atomic sputtering epitaxy. The porous copper nanostructures self&#8208;regulate the giant oxidation resistance by constructing a curved surface that generates a series of monoatomic steps, followed by shrinkage of the lattice spacing of one or two surface layers. First&#8208;principles calculations confirm that these structural components cooperatively increase the energy barrier against oxygen penetration. The achromaticity of the single&#8208;crystalline porous copper films is systematically tuned by geometrical parameters such as pore size distribution and 3D linkage. The optimized achromatic copper films with high oxidation resistance show an unusual switching effect between superhydrophilicity and superhydrophobicity. The tailored 3D porous nanostructures can be a candidate material&#160;for numerous applications, such as antireflection coatings, microfluidic devices, droplet tweezers, and reversible wettability switches.

         <title>Optically Active MXenes in Van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene&#8208;based van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have recently gained tremendous attention as prospective optical materials that combine an extraordinary optical response with tunable light&#8211;matter interactions. This Perspective puts the spotlight on MXenes as facile 2D building blocks to design vertical MXene/2D assemblies. Further exploration of MXene/2D vdW heterostructures is encouraged since they can crosscut the current limitations of light utilization.








Abstract
The vertical integration of distinct 2D materials in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures provides the opportunity for interface engineering and modulation of electronic as well as optical properties. However, scarce experimental studies reveal many challenges for vdW heterostructures, hampering the fine&#8208;tuning of their electronic and optical functionalities. Optically active MXenes, the most recent member of the 2D family, with excellent hydrophilicity, rich surface chemistry, and intriguing optical properties, are a novel 2D platform for optoelectronics applications. Coupling MXenes with various 2D materials into vdW heterostructures can open new avenues for the exploration of physical phenomena of novel quantum&#8208;confined nanostructures and devices. Therefore, the fundamental basis and recent findings in vertical vdW heterostructures composed of MXenes as a primary component and other 2D materials as secondary components are examined. Their robust designs and synthesis approaches that can push the boundaries of light&#8208;harvesting, transition, and utilization are discussed, since MXenes provide a unique playground for pursuing an extraordinary optical response or unusual light conversion features/functionalities. The recent findings are finally summarized, and a perspective for the future development of next&#8208;generation vdW multifunctional materials enriched by MXenes is provided.

         <title>In Situ Li&#8208;Plating Diagnosis for Fast&#8208;Charging Li&#8208;Ion Batteries Enabled by Relaxation&#8208;Time Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective indicator of Li&#8208;plating onset is urgently needed to investigate the safety window of Li&#8208;ion batteries. This work demonstrates that the relaxation time constant of the charge&#8208;transfer process is promising for determining Li&#8208;plating onset. A relaxation&#8208;time detection method is proposed, allowing in situ diagnosis of the Li&#8208;plating behavior in fast&#8208;charging Li&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The Li&#8208;plating behavior of Li&#8208;ion batteries under fast&#8208;charging conditions is elusive due to a lack of reliable indicators of the Li&#8208;plating onset. In this work, the relaxation time constant of the charge&#8208;transfer process (&#964;CT) is proposed to be promising for the determination of Li&#8208;plating onset. A novel pulse/relaxation test method enables rapid access to the &#964;CT of the graphite anode during battery operation, applicable to both half and full batteries. The diagnosis of Li plating at varying temperatures and charging rates enriches the cognition of Li&#8208;plating behaviors. Li plating at low temperatures and high charging rates can be avoided because of the battery voltage limitations. Nevertheless, after the onset, severe Li plating evolves rapidly under harsh charging conditions, while the Li&#8208;plating process under benign charging conditions is accompanied by a simultaneous Li&#8208;intercalation process. The quantitative estimates indicate that Li plating at high temperatures/high charging rates leads to more irreversible capacity losses. This facile method with rational scientific principles can provide inspiration for exploring the safe boundaries of Li&#8208;ion batteries.

The quantitative estimates indicate that Li plating at high temperatures/high charging rates leads to more irreversible capacity losses. This facile method with rational scientific principles can provide inspiration for exploring the safe boundaries of Li-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Se Nanopowder Conversion into Lubricious 2D Selenide Layers by Tribochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple sprinkling of Se nanopowders onto sliding Mo and W thin films leads to the tribochemical in operando formation of lubricious 2D selenides. Due to the thermal and vacuum stability of the Se nanopowders they can be used to replenish sliding components with solid lubricants, avoiding the long&#8208;lasting problem of transition metal dichalcogenidelubricity degradation caused by environmental molecules.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) coatings have attracted enormous scientific and industrial interest due to their outstanding tribological behavior. The paradigmatic example is MoS2, even though selenides and tellurides have demonstrated superior tribological properties. Here, an innovative in operando conversion of Se nanopowders into lubricious 2D selenides, by sprinkling them onto sliding metallic surfaces coated with Mo and W thin films, is described. Advanced material characterization confirms the tribochemical formation of a thin tribofilm containing selenides, reducing the coefficient of friction down to below 0.1 in ambient air, levels typically reached using fully formulated oils. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations under tribological conditions reveal the atomistic mechanisms that result in the shear&#8208;induced synthesis of selenide monolayers from nanopowders. The use of Se nanopowder provides thermal stability and prevents outgassing in vacuum environments. Additionally, the high reactivity of the Se nanopowder with the transition metal coating in the conditions prevailing in the contact interface yields highly reproducible results, making it particularly suitable for the replenishment of sliding components with solid lubricants, avoiding the long&#8208;lasting problem of TMD&#8208;lubricity degradation caused by environmental molecules. The suggested straightforward approach demonstrates an unconventional and smart way to synthesize TMDs in operando and exploit their friction&#8208; and wear&#8208;reducing impact.

         <title>Rational Design of N&#8208;Doped Carbon&#8208;Coated Cobalt Nanoparticles for Highly Efficient and Durable Photothermal CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated Co nanoparticles, derived from two&#8208;step pyrolysis of ZIF&#8208;67 precursor, exhibit highly efficient and durable catalytic performance for photothermal hydrogenation of CO2. As verified by experimental observations and theoretical simulations, such a simple N&#8208;doped carbon coating strategy can effectively promote the desorption of CO and activation of CO2 and H2 molecules due to the strong photothermal effect.








Abstract
Photothermal CO2 hydrogenation to high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is an appealing approach to alleviate energy and environmental concerns. However, it still relies on the development of earth&#8208;abundant, efficient, and durable catalysts. Here, the design of N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated Co nanoparticles (NPs), as a photothermal catalyst, synthesized through a two&#8208;step pyrolysis of Co&#8208;based ZIF&#8208;67 precursor, is reported. Consequently, the catalyst exhibits remarkable activity and stability for photothermal CO2 hydrogenation to CO with a 0.75&#160;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 CO production rate under the full spectrum of light illumination. The high activity and durability of these Co NPs are mainly attributed to the synergy of the attuned size of Co NPs, the thickness of carbon layers, and the N doping species. Impressively, the experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations show that such a simple N&#8208;doped carbon coating strategy can effectively facilitate the desorption of generated CO and activation of reactants due to the strong photothermal effect. This work provides a simple and efficient route for the preparation of highly active and durable nonprecious metal catalysts for promising photothermal catalytic reactions.

         <title>Redox Triggers Guest Release and Uptake Across a Series of Azopyridine&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Capsules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active azo groups are introduced in replacement of imine bonds that have been previously utilized to construct metal&#8211;organic capsules, endowing the capsules with reversible redox behaviors that can release guests upon reduction and re&#8208;capsulate them through oxidation. Since azo groups can attach to various ligand cores, this can potentially be a general approach to realize guest release and uptake via redox.








Abstract
Precise control over guest release and recapture using external stimuli is a valuable goal, potentially enabling new modes of chemical purification. Including redox moieties within the ligand cores of molecular capsules to trigger the release and uptake of guests has proved effective, but this technique is limited to certain capsules and guests. Herein, the construction of a series of novel metal&#8211;organic capsules from ditopic, tritopic, and tetratopic ligands is demonstrated, all of which contain redox&#8208;active azo groups coordinated to FeII centers. Compared to their iminopyridine&#8208;based analogs, this new class of azopyridine&#8208;based capsules possesses larger cavities, capable of encapsulating more voluminous guests. Upon reduction of the capsules, their guests are released and may then be re&#8208;encapsulated when the capsules are regenerated by oxidation. Since the redox centers are on the ligand arms, they are modular and can be attached to a variety of ligand cores to afford varying and predictable architectures. This method thus shows promise as a generalized approach for designing redox&#8208;controlled guest release and uptake systems.

         <title>Polyhedron&#8208;Like Biomaterials for Innervated and Vascularized Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by space&#8208;filling polyhedra with open architectures, polyhedron&#8208;like scaffolds with spatial topologies are prepared via Digital Light Processing (DLP)&#8208;based 3D&#8208;printing technology to mimic the meshwork structure of cancellous bone. The polyhedron&#8208;like scaffolds exhibit satisfactory effects on stimulating osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis in vitro, and achieving good innervated and vascularized bone regeneration in vivo.








Abstract
Neural&#8208;vascular networks are densely distributed through periosteum, cortical bone, and cancellous bone, which is of great significance for bone regeneration and remodeling. Although significant progress has been made in bone tissue engineering, ineffective bone regeneration, and delayed osteointegration still remains an issue due to the ignorance of intrabony nerves and blood vessels. Herein, inspired by space&#8208;filling polyhedra with open architectures, polyhedron&#8208;like scaffolds with spatial topologies are prepared via 3D&#8208;printing technology to mimic the meshwork structure of cancellous bone. Benefiting from its spatial topologies, polyhedron&#8208;like scaffolds greatly promoted the osteogenic differentiation of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) via activating PI3K&#8208;Akt signals, and exhibiting satisfactory performance on angiogenesis and neurogenesis. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation elucidates that polyhedron&#8208;like scaffolds have a relatively lower area&#8208;weighted average static pressure, which is beneficial to osteogenesis. Furthermore, in vivo experiments further demonstrate that polyhedron&#8208;like scaffolds obviously promote bone formation and osteointegration, as well as inducing vascularization and ingrowth of nerves, leading to innervated and vascularized bone regeneration. Taken together, this work offers a promising approach for fabricating multifunctional scaffolds without additional exogenous seeding cells and growth factors, which holds great potential for functional tissue regeneration and further clinical translation.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Within live cells, DTTO molecules form amorphous spherical clusters which subsequently accumulate, coalesce, and lead to the formation of fibrous crystals interconnecting different cells. Remarkably, cells produce a distinctive crystalline form, that is, a bio&#8208;polymorph, which cannot be replicated outside cells. These fibers offer a new approach for artificially connecting cells and hold the potential for creating/regenerating cellular communication networks.








Abstract
The assembly of supramolecular structures within living systems is an innovative approach for introducing artificial constructs and developing biomaterials capable of influencing and/or regulating the biological responses of living organisms. By integrating chemical, photophysical, morphological, and structural characterizations, it is&#160;shown that the cell&#8208;driven assembly of 2,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene&#8208;4,4&#8208;dioxide (DTTO) molecules into fibers results in the formation of a &#8220;biologically assisted&#8221; polymorphic form, hence the term bio&#8208;polymorph. Indeed, X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that cell&#8208;grown DTTO fibers present a unique molecular packing leading to specific morphological, optical, and electrical properties. Monitoring the process of fiber formation in cells with time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence, it is&#160;established that cellular machinery is necessary for fiber production and a non&#8208;classical nucleation mechanism for their growth is postulated. These biomaterials may have disruptive applications in the stimulation and sense of living cells, but more crucially, the study of their genesis and properties broadens the&#160;understanding of life beyond the native components of cells.

         <title>High&#8208;Mass&#8208;Loading Li&#8211;S Batteries Catalytically Activated by Cerium Oxide: Performance and Failure Analysis under Lean Electrolyte Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D sulfur electrode with cotton&#8208;derived carbon as the substrate and CeOx as the catalyst is developed to achieve high sulfur mass loading and fast reaction kinetics under lean electrolyte conditions. The resulting Li&#8211;S cell is found to fail after 100&#8211;200 cycles during charging due to local short circuiting caused by Li dendrites penetrating the separator.








Abstract
Increasing sulfur mass loading and minimizing electrolyte amount remains a major challenge for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;S batteries, which needs to be tackled with combined efforts of materials development and mechanistic analysis. This work, following the same team's most recent identification of the potential&#8208;limiting step of Li&#8211;S batteries under lean electrolyte conditions, seeks to advance the understanding by extending it to a new catalyst and into the high&#8208;sulfur&#8208;mass&#8208;loading region. CeOx nanostructures are integrated into cotton&#8208;derived carbon to develop a multifunctional 3D network that can host a large amount of active material, facilitate electron transport, and catalyze the sulfur lithiation reaction. The resulting S/CeOx/C electrode can deliver a stable areal capacity of 9&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a high sulfur loading of 14&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5&#160;&#181;L&#160;mg&#8722;1. This study discovers that Li||S/CeOx/C cells usually fail during charging at high current density, as a consequence of local short circuiting caused by electrochemically deposited Li dendrites penetrating through the separator, a previously overlooked failure pattern distinctive to cells operating under lean electrolyte conditions. This work highlights the importance of developing new material structures and analyzing failure mechanisms in the advancement of Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Templating Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aerogel production methodology through freezing and lyophilization of engineerable liquid templates, generated via interfacial complexation through electrostatic interactions between the nanoparticles (NPs) and ligands, is introduced. The coined approach enables tuning of the multiscale porosities, 3D architecture, and characteristics of the aerogels by engineering the composition and arrangement of liquid templates toward advanced applications and functions.








Abstract
Modern materials science has witnessed the era of advanced fabrication methods to engineer functionality from the nano&#8208; to macroscales. Versatile fabrication and additive manufacturing methods are developed, but the ability to design a material for a given application is still limited. Here,&#160;a novel strategy that enables target&#8208;oriented manufacturing of ultra&#8208;lightweight aerogels with on&#8208;demand characteristics is introduced. The process relies on controllable liquid templating through interfacial complexation to generate tunable, stimuli&#8208;responsive 3D&#8208;structured (multiphase) filamentous liquid templates. The methodology involves nanoscale chemistry and microscale assembly of nanoparticles (NPs) at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces to produce hierarchical macroscopic aerogels featuring multiscale porosity, ultralow density (3.05&#8211;3.41&#160;mg cm&#8722;3), and high compressibility (90%) combined with elastic resilience and instant shape recovery. The challenges are overcome facing ultra&#8208;lightweight aerogels, including poor mechanical integrity and the inability to form predefined 3D constructs with on&#8208;demand functionality, for a multitude of applications. The controllable nature of the coined methodology enables tunable electromagnetic interference shielding with high specific shielding effectiveness (39 893&#160;dB cm2 g&#8722;1), and one of the highest&#8208;ever reported oil&#8208;absorption capacities (487 times the initial weight of aerogel for chloroform), to be obtained. These properties originate from the engineerable nature of liquid templating, pushing the boundaries of lightweight materials to systematic function design and applications.

         <title>Buried&#8208;Interface Engineering of Conformal 2D/3D Perovskite Heterojunction for Efficient Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells on Industrially Textured Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a hybrid two&#8208;step deposition method, prepared robust 2D perovskites with cross&#8208;linkable ligands underneath 3D perovskite enable the formation of a conformal 2D/3D heterostructure at the buried interface. Owing to the influence of the heterojunction on crystallization and interfacial modulation, perovskite&#8211;silicon tandem solar cells based on industrially fully textured silicon achieve an efficiency of 29.8% (certified 28.4%).








Abstract
Exploring strategies to control the crystallization and modulate interfacial properties for high&#8208;quality perovskite film on industry&#8208;relevant textured crystalline silicon solar cells is highly valued in the perovskite/silicon tandem photovoltaics community. The formation of a 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction is widely employed to passivate defects and suppress ion migration in the film surface of perovskite solar cells. However, realizing solution&#8208;processed heterostructures at the buried interface faces solvent incompatibilities with the challenge of underlying&#8208;layer disruption, and texture incompatibilities with the challenge of uneven coverage. Here, a hybrid two&#8208;step deposition method is used to prepare robust 2D perovskites with cross&#8208;linkable ligands underneath the 3D perovskite. This structurally coherent interlayer benefits by way of preferred crystal growth of strain&#8208;free and uniform upper perovskite, inhibits interfacial defect&#8208;induced instability and recombination, and promotes charge&#8208;carrier extraction with ideal energy&#8208;level alignment. The broad applicability of the bottom&#8208;contact heterostructure for different textured substrates with conformal coverage and various precursor solutions with intact properties free of erosion are&#160;demonstrated. With this buried interface engineering strategy, the resulting perovskite/silicon tandem cells, based on industrially textured Czochralski (CZ) silicon, achieve a certified efficiency of 28.4% (1.0 cm2), while retaining 89% of the initial PCE after over 1000 h operation.

         <title>Chiroptical Response Inversion and Enhancement of Room&#8208;Temperature Exciton&#8208;Polaritons Using 2D Chirality in Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The light&#8211;matter interaction between a 2D chiroptical film and a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity is investigated. The chiroptical response inversion of the 2D chiroptical film shall be ideally suited to the circularly polarized light switching feature in the Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity, resulting in the enhancement effect in the chiroptical signal.








Abstract
Although chiral semiconductors have shown promising progress in direct circularly polarized light (CPL) detection and emission, they still face potential challenges. A chirality&#8208;switching mechanism or approach integrating two enantiomers is needed to discriminate the handedness of a given CPL; additionally, a large material volume is required for sufficient chiroptical interaction. These two requirements pose significant obstacles to the simplification and miniaturization of the devices. Here, room&#8208;temperature chiral polaritons fulfilling dual&#8208;handedness functions and exhibiting a more&#8208;than&#8208;two&#8208;order enhancement of the chiroptical signal are demonstrated, by embedding a 40 nm&#8208;thick perovskite film with a 2D&#160;chiroptical effect into a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity. By mixing chiral perovskites with different crystal structures, a pronounced 2D&#160;chiroptical effect is accomplished in the perovskite film, featured by an inverted chiroptical response for counter&#8208;propagating CPL. This inversion behavior matches the photonic handedness switch during CPL circulation in the Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot&#160;cavity, thus harvesting giant enhancement of the chiroptical response. Furthermore, affected by the unique quarter&#8208;wave&#8208;plate effects, the polariton emission achieves a chiral dissymmetry of &#177;4% (for the emission from the front and the back sides). The room&#8208;temperature polaritons with the strong dissymmetric chiroptical interaction shall have implications on a fundamental level and future on&#8208;chip applications for biomolecule analysis and quantum computing.

&lt;p&gt;The light&#8211;matter interaction between a 2D chiroptical film and a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity is investigated. The chiroptical response inversion of the 2D chiroptical film shall be ideally suited to the circularly polarized light switching feature in the Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity, resulting in the enhancement effect in the chiroptical signal.

         <title>Colossal Optical Anisotropy from Atomic&#8208;Scale Modulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subtle atomic&#8208;scale structural modulations of a crystal can dramatically change its optical properties. Single&#8208;crystal plates of modulated quasi&#8208;1D chalcogenide Sr9/8TiS3 are shown to have a record in&#8208;plane birefringence &#916;n = ne &#8722; no = 2.1 (ne = 4.5,&#8197;no = 2.4) within a broad transparent window in the mid&#8208; to far&#8208;infrared. Structural modulation will be a new tool in realizing materials with large degrees of optical and optoelectronic anisotropy.








Abstract
Materials with large birefringence (&#916;n, where n is the refractive index) are sought after for polarization control (e.g., in wave plates, polarizing beam splitters, etc.), nonlinear optics, micromanipulation, and as a platform for unconventional light&#8211;matter coupling, such as hyperbolic phonon polaritons. Layered 2D&#160;materials can feature some of the largest optical anisotropy; however, their use in most optical systems is limited because their optical axis is out of the plane of the layers and the layers are weakly attached. This work demonstrates that a bulk crystal with subtle periodic modulations in its structure&#8212;Sr9/8TiS3&#8212;is transparent and positive&#8208;uniaxial, with extraordinary index ne = 4.5 and ordinary index no = 2.4 in the mid&#8208; to far&#8208;infrared. The excess Sr, compared to stoichiometric SrTiS3, results in the formation of TiS6 trigonal&#8208;prismatic units that break the chains of face&#8208;sharing TiS6 octahedra in SrTiS3 into periodic blocks of five TiS6 octahedral units. The additional electrons introduced by the excess Sr form highly oriented electron clouds, which selectively boost the extraordinary index ne and result in record birefringence (&#916;n &gt; 2.1 with low loss). The connection between subtle structural modulations and large changes in refractive index suggests new categories of anisotropic materials and also tunable optical materials with large refractive&#8208;index modulation.

         <title>An Ultrahighly Stretchable and Recyclable Starch&#8208;Based Gel with Multiple&#160;Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A starch&#8208;based ADM gel with high stretchability, swiftly self&#8208;healing ability, self&#8208;adhesive property, freezing resistance, moisturizing properties, and satisfactory sensing performance is prepared by a facile &#8220;cooking&#8221; strategy accompanying the gelatinization of AP and polymerization reaction of zwitterionic monomers. The ADM gel with reversible hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions can be recycled by the &#8220;kneading&#8221; method and the &#8220;dissolution&#8211;dialysis&#8221; process, respectively.








Abstract
With the development of various gel&#8208;based flexible sensors, novel gels with multiple integrated and efficient properties, particularly recyclability, have been developed. Herein, a starch&#8208;based ADM (amylopectin (AP)&#8211;poly(3&#8208;[dimethyl&#8208;[2&#8208;(2&#8208;methylprop&#8208;2&#8208; enoyloxy)ethyl]azaniumyl]propane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate) (PDMAPS)&#8211;MXene) gel is prepared by a facile &#8220;cooking&#8221; strategy accompanying the gelatinization of AP and polymerization reaction of zwitterionic monomers. Reversible crosslinking in the gel occurs through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. The ADM gel exhibits high stretchability (&#8776;2700%, after one month), swift self&#8208;healing performance, self&#8208;adhesive properties, favorable freezing resistance, and satisfactory moisturizing properties (&#8805;30&#160;days). Interestingly, the ADM gel can be recycled and reused by a &#8220;kneading&#8221; method and &#8220;dissolution&#8211;dialysis&#8221; process, respectively. Furthermore, the ADM gel can be assembled as a strain sensor with a broad working strain range (&#8776;800%) and quick response time (response time 211&#160;ms and recovery time 253&#160;ms, under 10% strain) to detect various macro&#8208; and micro&#8208;human&#8208;motions, even under harsh conditions such as pronunciation and handwriting. The ADM gel can also be used as a humidity sensor to investigate humidity and human respiratory status, suggesting its practical application in personal health management. This study provides a novel strategy for the preparation of high&#8208;performance recycled gels and flexible sensors.

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex&#8208;Filtered Selective Ion&#8208;to&#8208;Ion Current Amplification for Non&#8208;Invasive Ion Monitoring in Real Time</title>

         <dc:description>
Mimicking ion channeling and neuron signaling, synthesis of artificial K+&#8208;selective membrane, and its integration with the hydrogel&#8208;based ionic device are demonstrated, achieving K+&#8208;selective ion&#8208;to&#8208;ion amplification in complex biomixtures. The membrane exclusively allows K+ transport without water leakage; it is 250&#215; and 17&#215; more permeable toward K+ than Cl&#8722; and NMDG+, respectively, and permits a 500% larger K+ signal than Li+.








Abstract
Living cells efflux intracellular ions for maintaining cellular life, so intravital measurements of specific ion signals are of significant importance for studying cellular functions and pharmacokinetics. In this work, de novo synthesis of artificial K+&#8208;selective membrane and its integration with polyelectrolyte hydrogel&#8208;based open&#8208;junction ionic diode (OJID) is demonstrated, achieving a real&#8208;time K+&#8208;selective ion&#8208;to&#8208;ion current amplification in complex bioenvironments. By mimicking biological K+ channels and nerve impulse transmitters, in&#8208;line K+&#8208;binding G&#8208;quartets are introduced across freestanding lipid bilayers by G&#8208;specific hexylation of monolithic G&#8208;quadruplex, and the pre&#8208;filtered K+ flow is directly converted to amplified ionic currents by the OJID with a fast response time at 100&#160;ms intervals. By the synergistic combination of charge repulsion, sieving, and ion recognition, the synthetic membrane allows K+ transport exclusively without water leakage; it is 250&#215; and 17&#215; more permeable toward K+ than monovalent anion, Cl&#8722;, and polyatomic cation, N&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;glucamine+, respectively. The molecular recognition&#8208;mediated ion channeling provides a 500% larger signal for K+ as compared to Li+ (0.6&#215; smaller than K+) despite the same valence. Using the miniaturized device, non&#8208;invasive, direct, and real&#8208;time K+ efflux monitoring from living cell spheroids is achieved with minimal crosstalk, specifically in identifying osmotic shock&#8208;induced necrosis and drug&#8208;antidote dynamics.

Using the miniaturized device, non-invasive, direct, and real-time K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux monitoring from living cell spheroids is achieved with minimal crosstalk, specifically in identifying osmotic shock-induced necrosis and drug-antidote dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Protonated Organic Semiconductors: Origin of Water&#8208;Induced Charge&#8208;Trap Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mechanism of bias&#8208;stress&#8208;induced trap generation in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) is unveiled. The combined spectroscopic method proposes the trap generation from the protonation of low&#8208;bandgap polymers. This concept can be applied to promote the development of highly stable OFETs under bias stress and related application devices.








Abstract
Despite dramatic improvements in the electronic characteristics of organic semiconductors, the low operational stability of organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) hinders their direct use in practical applications. Although the literature contains numerous reports on the effects of water on the operational stability of OFETs, the underlying mechanisms of trap generation induced by water remain unclear. Here, a protonation&#8208;induced trap generation of organic semiconductors is proposed as a possible origin of the operational instability in organic field&#8208;effect transistors. Spectroscopic and electronic investigation techniques combined with simulations reveal that the direct protonation of organic semiconductors by water during operation may be responsible for the trap generation induced by bias stress; this phenomenon is independent of the trap generation at an insulator surface. In addition, the same feature occurred in small&#8208;bandgap polymers with fused thiophene rings irrespective of their crystalline ordering, implying the generality of protonation induced trap generation in various polymer semiconductors with a small bandgap. The finding of the trap&#8208;generation process provides new perspectives for achieving greater operational stability of organic field&#8208;effect transistors.

         <title>Non&#8208;Pore Dependent and MMP&#8208;9 Responsive Gelatin/Silk Fibroin Composite Microparticles as Universal Delivery Platform for Inhaled Treatment of Lung Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
GSC with adjusted particle sizes is fabricated through the microphase separation of gelatin (Gel) /silk fibroin (SF) systems and following desolvation process. This work specifically selects GSC with a diameter of 3 &#181;m as carriers for various drugs including small molecule chemotherapeutics, large protein drugs, and nucleic acid drugs for noninvasive aerosol inhalation therapy for lung cancer.








Abstract
Developing a drug delivery platform that possesses universal drug loading capacity to meet various requirements of cancer treatment is a challenging yet interesting task. Herein, a self&#8208;assembled gelatin/silk fibroin composite (GSC) particle based drug delivery system is developed via microphase separation followed by desolvation process. Thanks to its preassembled microphase stage, this GSC system is suitable for varying types of drugs. The desolvation process fix drugs inside GSC rapidly and densify the GSC structure, thereby achieving efficient drug loading and providing comprehensive protection for loaded drugs. Actually, the size of this brand&#8208;new non&#8208;pore dependent drug delivery system can be easily adjusted from 100&#160;nm to 20&#160;&#181;m to fit different scenarios. This work selects GSC with 3&#160;&#181;m diameter as the universal inhaled drug delivery platform, which shows an excellent transmucosal penetration and lung retention ability. Additionally, the MMP&#8208;9 sensitive degradation property of GSC enhances the targeted efficiency of drugs and reduces side effects. Intestinally, GSC can self&#8208;amplify the regulation of innate immunity to reverse the cancerous microenvironment into an antitumor niche, significantly improving the therapeutic effect of drugs. This study of GSC universal drug platform provides a new direction to develop the next&#8208;generation of drug delivery system for lung cancer.

         <title>Reinforcing Hydrogel by Nonsolvent&#8208;Quenching&#8208;Facilitated In&#160;Situ Nanofibrosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative nanofibrous hydrogel (nf&#8208;gel) constructed with constituent polymer nanofibers is proposed and fabricated using a two&#8208;step solvent&#8208;exchange method including an essential nonsolvent&#8208;quenching step. These nf&#8208;gels show remarkably enhanced mechanical properties and swelling resistance compared to their molecular counterparts. Particularly, they are isotropic, distinctly different from conventional fiber reinforced hydrogels.. .








Abstract
Nanofibrous hydrogels are pervasive in load&#8208;bearing soft tissues, which are believed to be key to their extraordinary mechanical properties. Enlighted by this phenomenon, a novel reinforcing strategy for polymeric hydrogels is proposed, where polymer segments in the hydrogels are induced to form nanofibers in&#160;situ by bolstering their controllable aggregation at the nanoscale level. Poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogels are chosen to demonstrate the virtue of this strategy. A nonsolvent&#8208;quenching step is introduced into the conventional solvent&#8208;exchange hydrogel preparation approach, which readily promotes the formation of nanofibrous hydrogels in the following solvent&#8208;tempering process. The resultant nanofibrous hydrogels demonstrate significantly improved mechanical properties and swelling resistance, compared to the conventional solvent&#8208;exchange hydrogels with identical compositions. This work validates the hypothesis that bundling polymer chains to form nanofibers can lead to nanofibrous hydrogels with remarkably enhanced mechanical performances, which may open a new horizon for single&#8208;component hydrogel reinforcement.

         <title>A Nanoconfined Water&#8211;Ion Coordination Network for Flexible Energy&#8208;Dissipation Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8211;ion interaction in a nanoconfined environment can significantly promote the interaction between ions and water molecules. Such a strong interaction&#160;facilitates the formation of ion clusters and limits particle dynamics. Based on this mechanism, a liquid&#8208;nanopore energy&#8208;dissipation system capable of providing flexible protection to personnel and devices and instrumentations against mechanical impacts and attacks is designed.








Abstract
Water&#8211;ion interaction in a nanoconfined environment that deeply constrains spatial freedoms of local atomistic motion with unconventional coupling mechanisms beyond that in a free, bulk state is essential to spark designs of a broad spectrum of nanofluidic devices with unique properties and functionalities. Here, it is&#160;reported that the interaction between ions and water molecules in a hydrophobic nanopore forms a coordination network with an interaction density that is nearly fourfold that of the bulk counterpart. Such strong interaction facilitates the connectivity of the water&#8211;ion network and is uncovered by corroborating the formation of ion clusters and the reduction of particle dynamics. A liquid&#8208;nanopore energy&#8208;dissipation system is designed and demonstrated in both molecular simulations and experiments that the formed coordination network controls the outflow of confined electrolytes along with a pressure reduction, capable of providing flexible protection for personnel and devices and instrumentations against external mechanical impact and attack.

         <title>Titania&#8208;Supported Cu&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Electrochemical Reduction of Acetylene to Ethylene at Low&#8208;Concentrations with Suppressed Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TiO2&#8208;supported Cu&#8208;single&#8208;atom electrocatalyst is synthesized for the electrochemical reduction of acetylene at low concentrations. The electrocatalysts promote acetylene activation whilst suppressing hydrogen evolution and ethylene hydrogenation, achieving a 99.8% acetylene conversion with a space velocity of 3.12&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;mL&#160;gCu&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and a turnover frequency of 8.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2&#160;s&#8722;1 in an ethylene&#8208;rich feed gas mixture.








Abstract
Electrochemical acetylene reduction (EAR) is a promising strategy for removing acetylene from ethylene&#8208;rich gas streams. However, suppressing the undesirable hydrogen evolution is vital for practical applications in acetylene&#8208;insufficient conditions. Herein, Cu single atoms are immobilized on anatase TiO2 nanoplates (Cu&#8208;SA/TiO2) for electrochemical acetylene reduction, achieving an ethylene selectivity of &#8776;97% with a 5&#160;vol% acetylene gas feed (Ar balance). At the optimal Cu&#8208;single&#8208;atom loading, Cu&#8208;SA/TiO2 is&#160;able to effectively suppress HER and ethylene over&#8208;hydrogenation even when using dilute acetylene (0.5&#160;vol%) or ethylene&#8208;rich gas feeds, delivering a 99.8% acetylene conversion, providing a turnover frequency of 8.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2&#160;s&#8722;1, which is superior to other EAR catalysts reported to date. Theoretical calculations show that the Cu single atoms and the TiO2 support acted cooperatively to promote charge transfer to adsorbed acetylene molecules, whilst also inhibiting hydrogen generation in alkali environments, thus allowing selective ethylene production with negligible hydrogen evolution at low acetylene concentrations.

&lt;p&gt;A TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-supported Cu-single-atom electrocatalyst is synthesized for the electrochemical reduction of acetylene at low concentrations. The electrocatalysts promote acetylene activation whilst suppressing hydrogen evolution and ethylene hydrogenation, achieving a 99.8% acetylene conversion with a space velocity of 3.12&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;mL&#160;g&lt;sub&gt;Cu&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Intrinsic Ferromagnetic Semiconductors with High Saturation Magnetization from Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of ferromagnetic semiconductor is obtained by exploiting the perovskite structure. The obtained (4ampy)CuCl4 exhibits a remarkably saturated magnetization up to 18.56 emu g&#8722;1, which is one of the highest&#8208;ever&#8208;reported values for organic/inorganic hybrid intrinsic ferromagnetic semiconductors.








Abstract
Ferromagnetic semiconductors (FMS) enable simultaneous control of both charge and spin transport of charge carriers, and they have emerged as a class of highly desirable but rare materials for applications in spin field&#8208;effect transistors and quantum computing. Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites with high compositional adjustability and structural versatility can offer unique benefits in the design of FMS but has not been fully explored. Here, a series of molecular FMSs based on the 2D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite structure, namely (2ampy)CuCl4, (3ampy)CuCl4, and (4ampy)CuCl4, is demonstrated, which exhibits high saturation magnetization, dramatic temperature&#8208;dependent conductivity change, and tunable ferromagnetic resonance. Magnetic measurements reveal a high saturation magnetization up to 18.56 emu g&#8722;1 for (4ampy)CuCl4, which is one of the highest value among reported hybrid FMSs to date. Conductivity studies of the three FMSs demonstrate that the smaller adjacent octahedron distance in the 2D layer results in higher conductivity. Systematic ferromagnetic resonance investigation shows that the gyromagnetic ratio and Landau factor values are strongly dependent on the types of organic cations used. This work demonstrates that 2D hybrid perovskite materials can simultaneously possess both tunable long&#8208;range ferromagnetic ordering and semiconductivity, providing a straightforward strategy for designing and synthesizing high&#8208;performance intrinsic FMSs.

         <title>A UV&#8208;Resistant Heterogeneous Wettability&#8208;Patterned Surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structure of cell membranes, a UV&#8208;resistant heterogeneous wettability&#8208;patterned surface (UPS) is designed via laser ablation of the coating of multilayer structures. The cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;like structure of the UPS regulates the migration of internal siloxane chain segments in the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions of the surface. UPS enables efficient patterning stability under intense UV irradiation of 3000&#160;min.








Abstract
Preparing UV&#8208;resistant heterogeneous wettability patterns is critical for the practical application of surfaces with heterogeneous wettability. However, combining UV&#8208;resistant superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic materials on heterogeneous surfaces is challenging. Inspired by the structure of cell membranes, a UV&#8208;resistant heterogeneous wettability&#8208;patterned surface (UPS) is designed via laser ablation of the coating of multilayer structures. UV&#8208;resistant superhydrophobic silica patterns can be created in situ on surfaces covered with superhydrophilic TiO2 nanoparticles. The UV resistance time of the UPS with a TiO2&#8208;based surface is more than two orders of magnitude higher than that obtained with other surface molecular modification methods that require a mask. The cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;like structure of the UPS regulates the migration of internal siloxane chain segments in the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions of the surface. The UPS enables efficient patterning of functional materials under UV irradiation, controlling the wetting behavior of liquids in open&#8208;air systems. Furthermore, its heterogeneous wettability remains stable even after 50&#160;h of intense UV irradiation (365&#160;nm, 500&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2). These UV&#8208;resistant heterogeneous wettability patterned surfaces will likely be applied in microfluidics, cell culture, energy conversion, and water collection in the future.

         <title>Investigating the Superior Performance of Hard Carbon Anodes in Sodium&#8208;Ion Compared With Lithium&#8208; and Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hard carbons are fabricated via hydrothermal carbonization and subsequent pyrolysis at different temperatures. The hard carbons, as anodes, exhibit differing ion&#8208;storage trends for Li, Na, and K. The best&#8208;performing material G1500 is tested against a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode in a Na&#8208;ion pouch cell, displaying excellent energy/power densities and cycling performance.








Abstract
Emerging sodium&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs) and potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) show promise in complementing lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) technology and diversifying the battery market. Hard carbon is a potential anode candidate for LIBs, NIBs, and KIBs due to its high capacity, sustainability, wide availability, and stable physicochemical properties. Herein, a series of hard carbons is synthesized by hydrothermal carbonization and subsequent pyrolysis at different temperatures to finely tune their structural properties. When tested as anodes, the hard carbons exhibit differing ion&#8208;storage trends for Li, Na, and K, with NIBs achieving the highest reversible capacity. Extensive materials and electrochemical characterizations are carried out to study the correlation of structural features with electrochemical performance and to explain the specific mechanisms of alkali&#8208;ion storage in hard carbons. In addition, the best&#8208;performing hard carbon is tested against a sodium cathode Na3V2(PO4)3 in a Na&#8208;ion pouch cell, displaying a high power density of 2172&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at an energy density of 181.5&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (based on the total weight of active materials in both anode and cathode). The Na&#8208;ion pouch cell also shows stable ultralong&#8208;term cycling (9000 h or 5142 cycles) and demonstrates the promising potential of such materials as sustainable, scalable anodes for beyond Li&#8208;batteries.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Molecule Bioelectronic Portable Array for Early Diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer Precursors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A portable enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)&#8208;like 96&#8208;array of bioelectronic sensors assays simultaneously both proteins and nucleic&#8208;acid biomarkers at the single&#8208;molecule level in 0.1&#160;mL of plasma. The prototype comprises a disposable cartridge and a reusable reader. A cohort of 47 patients is screened for the minimally invasive early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. The mucinous&#8208;cysts precursors are 100% correctly classified via a machine&#8208;learning analysis.








Abstract
A cohort of 47 patients is screened for pancreatic cancer precursors with a portable 96&#8208;well bioelectronic sensing&#8208;array for single&#8208;molecule assay in cysts fluid and blood plasma, deployable at point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC). Pancreatic cancer precursors are mucinous cysts diagnosed with a sensitivity of at most 80% by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cytopathological molecular analyses (e.g., KRASmut DNA). Adding the simultaneous assay of proteins related to malignant transformation (e.g., MUC1 and CD55) is deemed essential to enhance diagnostic accuracy. The bioelectronic array proposed here, based on single&#8208;molecule&#8208;with&#8208;a&#8208;large&#8208;transistor (SiMoT) technology, can assay both nucleic acids and proteins at the single&#8208;molecule limit&#8208;of&#8208;identification (LOI) (1% of false&#8208;positives and false&#8208;negatives). It comprises an enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)&#8208;like 8 &#215; 12&#8208;array organic&#8208;electronics disposable cartridge with an electrolyte&#8208;gated organic transistor sensor array, and a reusable reader, integrating a custom Si&#8208;IC chip, operating via software installed on a USB&#8208;connected smart device. The cartridge is complemented by a 3D&#8208;printed sensing gate cover plate. KRASmut, MUC1, and CD55 biomarkers either in plasma or cysts&#8208;fluid from 5 to 6 patients at a time, are multiplexed at single&#8208;molecule LOI in 1.5 h. The pancreatic cancer precursors are classified via a machine&#8208;learning analysis resulting in at least 96% diagnostic&#8208;sensitivity and 100% diagnostic&#8208;specificity. This preliminary study opens the way to POC liquid&#8208;biopsy&#8208;based early diagnosis of pancreatic&#8208;cancer precursors in plasma.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cohort of 47 patients is screened for pancreatic cancer precursors with a portable 96-well bioelectronic sensing-array for single-molecule assay in cysts fluid and blood plasma, deployable at point-of-care (POC). Pancreatic cancer precursors are mucinous cysts diagnosed with a sensitivity of at most 80% by state-of-the-art cytopathological molecular analyses (e.g., KRAS&lt;sup&gt;mut&lt;/sup&gt; DNA). Adding the simultaneous assay of proteins related to malignant transformation (e.g., MUC1 and CD55) is deemed essential to enhance diagnostic accuracy. The bioelectronic array proposed here, based on single-molecule-with-a-large-transistor (SiMoT) technology, can assay both nucleic acids and proteins at the single-molecule limit-of-identification (LOI) (1% of false-positives and false-negatives). It comprises an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-like 8 &#215; 12-array organic-electronics disposable cartridge with an electrolyte-gated organic transistor sensor array, and a reusable reader, integrating a custom Si-IC chip, operating via software installed on a USB-connected smart device. The cartridge is complemented by a 3D-printed sensing gate cover plate. KRAS&lt;sup&gt;mut&lt;/sup&gt;, MUC1, and CD55 biomarkers either in plasma or cysts-fluid from 5 to 6 patients at a time, are multiplexed at single-molecule LOI in 1.5 h.

         <title>Phase Engineering of 2D Spinel&#8208;Type Manganese Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generic strategy to phase&#8208;controllable synthesis of 2D single&#8208;crystalline spinel&#8208;type oxides with thicknesses down to one unit cell is proposed. A unique combination of ferromagnetic and semiconducting properties is demonstrated. Owing to its ultrathin geometry, a Mn3O4 nanosheet exhibits a superior ultraviolet detection performance with an ultralow noise power density of 0.126 pA Hz&#8722;1/2.








Abstract
2D magnetic materials have been of interest due to their unique long&#8208;range magnetic ordering in the low&#8208;dimensional regime and potential applications in spintronics. Currently, most studies are focused on strippable van der Waals magnetic materials with layered structures, which typically suffer from a poor stability and scarce species. Spinel oxides have a good environmental stability and rich magnetic properties. However, the isotropic bonding and close&#8208;packed nonlayered crystal structure make their 2D growth challenging, let alone the phase engineering. Herein, a phase&#8208;controllable synthesis of 2D single&#8208;crystalline spinel&#8208;type oxides is reported. Using the van der Waals epitaxy strategy, the thicknesses of the obtained tetragonal and hexagonal manganese oxide (Mn3O4) nanosheets can be tuned down to 7.1&#160;nm and one unit cell (0.7&#160;nm), respectively. The magnetic properties of these two phases are evaluated using vibrating&#8208;sample magnetometry and first&#8208;principle calculations. Both structures exhibit a Curie temperature of 48 K. Owing to its ultrathin geometry, the Mn3O4 nanosheet exhibits a superior ultraviolet detection performance with an ultralow noise power density of 0.126 pA Hz&#8722;1/2. This study broadens the range of 2D magnetic semiconductors and highlights their potential applications in future information devices.

         <title>Stabilization of Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells with a 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson Passivating Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>

CsPbI3 perovskites suffers fast transfer to non&#8208;perovskite phase, especially exposed to humidity. Using 2&#8208;(4&#8208;aminophenyl)ethylamine cation to construct a Dion&#8211;Jacobson 2D phase that covers the 3D inorganic perovskite surface, the obtained 2D/3D perovskite films exhibit excellent humidity resistance and higher temperature stability, resulting in improved efficiency and operational stability in solar cells.








Abstract
Inorganic metal halide perovskites such as CsPbI3 are promising for high&#8208;performance, reproducible, and robust solar cells. However, inorganic perovskites are sensitive to humidity, which causes the transformation from the black phase to the yellow &#948;, non&#8208;perovskite phase. Such phase instability has been a significant challenge to long&#8208;term operational stability. Here, a surface dimensionality reduction strategy is reported, using 2&#8208;(4&#8208;aminophenyl)ethylamine cation to construct a Dion&#8211;Jacobson 2D phase that covers the surface of the 3D inorganic perovskite structure. The Dion&#8211;Jacobson layer mainly grows at the grain boundaries of the perovskite, effectively passivating surface defects and providing favourable interfacial charge transfer. The resulting inorganic perovskite films exhibit excellent humidity resistance when submerged in an aqueous solution (isopropanol:water = 4:1 v/v) and exposed to a 50% humidity air atmosphere. The Dion&#8211;Jacobson 2D/3D inorganic perovskite solar cell (PSC) achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.5% with a Voc of 1.197&#160;eV. It retains 83% of its initial PCE after 1260&#160;h of maximum power point tracking under 1.2 sun illumination. The work demonstrates an effective way for stabilizing efficient inorganic perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Appended Nanosonosensitizers Targeting Tumor Glycolysis for Synergistic Sonodynamic&#8211;Immunometabolic Therapy of Spinal&#8208;Metastasized Tumors</title>

An oxygen&#8208;deficient molybdenum&#8208;oxide&#8208;based sonosensitizer is&#160;synthesized and integrated with a glycolysis&#8208;disturbing peptide for simultaneous sonodynamic therapy and tumor metabolic regulation. The reprogramming of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment is achieved by inhibiting glucose uptake and lactic acid secretion in the tumor glycolytic process, synergizing with sonodynamic&#8208;elicited immune activation for two&#8208;pronged sonodynamic&#8211;immunometabolic therapy.








Abstract
Despite recent advancements in cancer immunotherapy, challenges have yet to be surmounted to achieve two major goals of magnifying antitumor immunity and remodeling the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Here, a nanosystem (ODM&#8208;R) that integrates oxygen&#8208;deficient molybdenum oxide (ODM) nanosonosensitizers and R7 peptides with tumor metabolism regulation effects is designed and fabricated for synergistic sonodynamic&#8211;immunometabolic therapy of spinal&#8208;metastasized tumors. The ODM generates reactive oxygen species upon ultrasound irradiation to implement sonodynamic therapy (SDT), inducing cancer cell apoptosis and immunogenic cell death. The R7 attached on ODM markedly inhibits the uptake of glucose and excretion of lactic acid in cancer cells by perturbing the glycolysis process. The combination of SDT and tumor glycolysis obstruction by ODM&#8208;R guarantees satisfactory efficacy in synergizing with PD&#8208;L1 antibody to eradicate spinal&#8208;metastasized tumors, achieving concurrent sonodynamic&#8208;triggered immune activation and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment remodeling. This work provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of nanosonosensitizers for boosting cancer immunotherapy by SDT and tumor metabolic regulation.

         <title>All&#8208;Optical Data Processing with Photon&#8208;Avalanching Nanocrystalline Photonic Synapse</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly nonlinear, photoexcitation intensity&#8208;dependent luminescence and residual energy storage in photon&#8208;avalanching inorganic Tm3+&#8208;doped fluoride nanoparticles mimic the behavior of biological synapses. These properties enable all&#8208;optical information processing such as multiple inputs and weighted all&#8208;or&#8208;none response, short memory storage, paired&#8208;pulse facilitation, coincidence detection from multiple inputs, and complex 2D image data feature extraction.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Highly nonlinear, photoexcitation intensity-dependent luminescence and residual energy storage in photon-avalanching inorganic Tm&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-doped fluoride nanoparticles mimic the behavior of biological synapses. These properties enable all-optical information processing such as multiple inputs and weighted all-or-none response, short memory storage, paired-pulse facilitation, coincidence detection from multiple inputs, and complex 2D image data feature extraction.

         <title>Self&#8208;Construction of Efficient Interfaces Ensures High&#8208;Performance Direct Ammonia Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>

Self&#8208;structured NiFe and NiCu&#8208;decorated interfaces on the anode surface via the attachment of the reduced Sr2Fe1.35Mo0.45Cu0.2O6&#8722;&#948; anode catalytic layer onto the Ni&#8208;BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3&#8722;&#948; anode can dramatically enhance the catalytic activity for NH3 decomposition and durability of direct ammonia protonic ceramic fuel cells.








Abstract
Direct ammonia protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) are highly efficient energy conversion devices since ammonia as a carbon&#8208;neutral hydrogen&#8208;rich carrier shows great potential for storage and long&#8208;distance transportation when compared with hydrogen fuel. However, traditional Ni&#8208;based anodes readily suffer from severe structural destruction and dramatic deactivation after long&#8208;time exposure to ammonia. Here a Sr2Fe1.35Mo0.45Cu0.2O6&#8722;&#948; (SFMC) anode catalytic layer (ACL) painted onto a Ni&#8208;BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3&#8722;&#948; (BZCYYb) anode with enhanced catalytic activity and durability toward the direct utilization of ammonia is reported. A tubular Ni&#8208;BZCYYb anode&#8208;supported cells with the SFMC ACL show excellent peak power densities of 1.77 W cm&#8722;2 in wet H2 (3% H2O) and 1.02 W cm&#8722;2 in NH3 at 650 &#176;C. A relatively stable operation of the cells is obtained at 650 &#176;C for 200 h in ammonia fuel. Such achieved improvements in the activity and durability are attributed to the self&#8208;constructed interfaces with the phases of NiCu or/and NiFe for efficient NH3 decomposition, resulting in a strong NH3 adsorption strength of the SFMC, as confirmed by NH3 thermal conversion and NH3&#8208;temperature programmed desorption. This research offers a valuable strategy of applying an internal catalytic layer for highly active and durable ammonia PCFCs.

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Elimination of Defects via Controlled Perovskite Crystallization Dynamics for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>

It is found that a hydrogen&#8208;sulfate&#8208;based ionic liquid additive enables the phase&#8208;conversion pathway of precursors &#8594; solvated intermediates &#8594; &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, which results in the self&#8208;elimination of defects during crystallization. The improved perovskite crystallization dynamics finally endow&#160;solar cells with high efficiencies of 25.14% at 300 K and 26.12% at 240 K. 








Abstract
Understanding and controlling crystallization is crucial for high&#8208;quality perovskite films and efficient solar cells. Herein, the&#160;issue of defects in formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) formation is addressed, focusing on the role of intermediates. A comprehensive picture of structural and carrier evolution during crystallization is demonstrated using in situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Three crystallization stages are identified: precursors to the &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 intermediate, then to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, where defects spontaneously emerge. A hydrogen&#8208;sulfate&#8208;based ionic liquid additive is found to enable the phase&#8208;conversion pathway of precursors &#8594; solvated intermediates &#8594; &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, during which the spontaneous generation of &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 can be effectively circumvented. This additive extends the initial growth kinetics and facilitates solvent&#8211;FA+ ion exchange, which results in the self&#8208;elimination of defects during crystallization. Therefore, the improved crystallization dynamics lead to larger grain sizes and fewer defects within thin films. Ultimately, the improved perovskite crystallization dynamics enable&#160;high&#8208;performance solar cells,&#160;achieving impressive efficiencies of 25.14%&#160;at 300&#160;K and 26.12% at 240&#160;K. This breakthrough might open up a new era of application for the emerging perovskite photovoltaic technology to low&#8208;temperature environments such as near&#8208;space and polar regions.

         <title>Intermittent Defect Fluctuations in Oxide Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermittent, equilibrium dynamics of brownmillerite/perovskite domains in an epitaxial SrCoOx on LSAT substrate are revealed using in situ Bragg X&#8208;ray photon correlation spectroscopy. The dynamics appear to be thermally activated and can be tuned via epitaxial strain, consistent with results from density functional theory and phase field simulations.








Abstract
The heterogeneous nature, local presence, and dynamic evolution of defects typically govern the ionic and electronic properties of a wide variety of functional materials. While the last 50 years have seen considerable efforts into development of new methods to identify the nature of defects in complex materials, such as the perovskite oxides, very little is known about defect dynamics and their influence on the functionality of a material. Here, the discovery of the intermittent behavior of point defects (oxygen vacancies) in oxide heterostructures employing X&#8208;ray photon correlation spectroscopy is reported. Local fluctuations between two ordered phases in strained SrCoOx with different degrees of stability of the oxygen vacancies are observed. Ab&#8208;initio&#8208;informed phase&#8208;field modeling reveals that fluctuations between the competing ordered phases are modulated by the oxygen ion/vacancy interaction energy and epitaxial strain. The results demonstrate how defect dynamics, evidenced by measurement and modeling of their temporal fluctuations, give rise to stochastic properties that now can be fully characterized using coherent X&#8208;rays, coupled for the first time to multiscale modeling in functional complex oxide heterostructures. The study and its findings open new avenues for engineering the dynamical response of functional materials used in neuromorphic and electrochemical&#160;applications.

Utilization of Li2S as a Li supplement and interfacial promoter facilitates efficient Li compensation coupled interface strengthening against irreversible Li loss, enabling a durable quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free battery with long life, high energy, and remarkable safety.








Abstract
Initially, anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries present a promising power source that merges the high production feasibility of Li&#8208;ion batteries with the superb energy capabilities of Li&#8208;metal batteries. However, their application confronts formidable challenges of extremely short lifespan due to the inadequacy of zero&#8208;Li&#8208;excess cell configuration against irreversible Li loss. A Li compensation coupled interface engineering strategy is reported for realizing long&#8208;life quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free batteries. The Li2S is utilized as a sacrificial Li supplement to effectively counterbalance irreversible Li loss without damage to cell chemistry. Meanwhile, it demonstrates remarkable efficacy in establishing a robust yet slender inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid solid&#8208;state interphase for inhibiting cell degradation by dead and dendritic Li. This strategy enables quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free batteries with a long lifespan of 500 cycles. The Ah&#8208;scale quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells, featuring a high&#8208;loading LiFePO4 cathode and lean gel polymer electrolyte, exhibit a high specific energy of 300&#160;Wh&#160;kgcell&#8722;1. This achievement translates into an improvement of 46% in gravimetric energy and 94% in volumetric energy compared to LiFePO4||graphite batteries while outperforming LiFePO4||Li&#8208;metal batteries by 22&#8211;47% in volumetric energy. Such quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free cells also demonstrate good safety, showcasing remarkable resistance against nail penetration in ambient air without failure, smoke, or fire accidents.

         <title>Embedding Living Cells with a Mechanically Reinforced and Functionally Programmable Hydrogel Fiber Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel sheath&#8211;core living hydrogel fiber platform is introduced, wherein synthetic biology and microfluidic spinning are integrated, offering enhanced programmability, mechanical robustness, and functional diversity. The platform's innovative design allows for tailored porous architectures and improved mechanical performance, alongside applications like coloration of fibers and water pollutant detection through modified bacterial gene circuits.








Abstract
Living materials represent a new frontier in functional material design, integrating synthetic biology tools to endow materials with programmable, dynamic, and life&#8208;like characteristics. However, a major challenge in creating living materials is balancing the tradeoff between structural stability, mechanical performance, and functional programmability. To address this challenge, a sheath&#8211;core living hydrogel fiber platform that synergistically integrates living bacteria with hydrogel fibers to achieve both functional diversity and structural and mechanical robustness is proposed. In the design, microfluidic spinning is used to produce hydrogel fiber, which offers advantages in both structural and functional designability due to their hierarchical porous architectures that can be tailored and their mechanical performance that can be enhanced through a variety of post&#8208;processing approaches. By introducing living bacteria, the platform is endowed with programmable functionality and life&#8208;like capabilities. This work reconstructs the genetic circuits of living bacteria to express chromoproteins and fluorescent proteins as two prototypes that enable the coloration of living fibers and sensing water pollutants by monitoring the amount of fluorescent protein expressed. Altogether, this study establishes a structure&#8211;property&#8211;function optimized living hydrogel fiber platform, providing a new tool for accelerating the practical applications of the emerging living material systems.

         <title>Lattice Strain Engineering of Ni2P Enables Efficient Catalytic Hydrazine Oxidation&#8208;Assisted Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile yet robust strategy is developed for strain engineering of Ni2P via double&#8208;cation co&#8208;doping. Both experimental and theoretic results reveal that the compressive strain can effectively reduce the reaction energy barrier of HzOR and HER, thereby significantly enhance the performance of hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted hydrogen production.








Abstract
Hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolysis provides new opportunities to enable energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production while solving the issue of hydrazine pollution. Here, the synthesis of compressively strained Ni2P as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for boosting both the anodic hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is reported. Different from a multistep synthetic method that induces lattice strain by creating core&#8211;shell structures, a facile strategy is developed to tune the strain of&#160;Ni2P via dual&#8208;cation co&#8208;doping. The obtained Ni2P with a compressive strain of &#8722;3.62% exhibits significantly enhanced activity for both the HzOR and HER than counterparts with tensile strain and without strain. Consequently, the optimized Ni2P delivers current densities of 10 and 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at small cell voltages of 0.16 and 0.39&#160;V for hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolysis, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the compressive strain promotes water dissociation and concurrently tunes the adsorption strength of hydrogen intermediates, thereby facilitating the HER process on Ni2P. As for the HzOR, the compressive strain reduces the energy barrier of the potential&#8208;determining step for the dehydrogenation of *N2H4 to *N2H3. Clearly, this work paves a facile pathway to the synthesis of lattice&#8208;strained electrocatalysts via the dual&#8208;cation co&#8208;doping.

         <title>Structurally&#8208;Distorted RuIr&#8208;Based Nanoframes for Long&#8208;Duration Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally&#8208;distorted CdRu2IrOx nanoframes with twisted Ru&#8722;O, Ir&#8722;O, and Ru&#8211;M (M = Ru, Ir) are successfully constructed via cation exchange and sequential thermal treatment, which can be used as ultra&#8208;active and ultra&#8208;stable acidic OER catalyst due to the strong synergy between Ru and Ir.








Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a key role in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), yet the electrocatalysts still suffer from the disadvantages of low activity and poor stability in acidic conditions. Here, a new class of CdRu2IrOx nanoframes with distorted structure for acidic OER is successfully fabricated. Impressively, CdRu2IrOx displays an ultralow overpotential of 189&#160;mV and an ultralong stability of 1500&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 toward OER in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4. Moreover, a PEMWE using the distorted CdRu2IrOx can be steadily operated at 0.1 A cm&#8315;2 for 90&#160;h. Microstructural analyses and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) demonstrate that the synergy between Ru and Ir in CdRu2IrOx induces the distortion of Ru&#8722;O, Ir&#8722;O, and Ru&#8722;M (M = Ru, Ir) bonds. In situ XAS indicates that the applied potential leads to the deformation octahedral structure of RuOx/IrOx and the formation of stable Ru5+ species for OER. Theoretical calculations also reveal that the distorted structures can reduce the energy barrier of rate&#8208;limiting step during OER. This work provides an efficient strategy for constructing structural distortion to achieve significant enhancement on the activity and stability of OER catalysts.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>

Abstract
A crossbar array is an essential element that determines the operating position and simplifies the structure of devices. However, in the crossbar array, wiring numerous electrodes to address many positions poses significant challenges. In this study, a method is proposed that utilizes only two electrodes to determine multiple positions. The method significantly simplifies the wiring and device fabrication process. Instead of defining the node location of the crossbar, it is experimentally demonstrated that the x&#8211;y&#8211;z coordinates can be determined from i) the resistance change as a function of distance, ii) the resistance variation influenced by the electrode composition, and iii) capacitance fluctuation resulting from changes in the dielectric thickness. By employing two&#8208;terminal transparent electrodes, a fully functional 3D touch device is successfully fabricated, introducing a groundbreaking approach to simplify input device architectures.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ&#8208;Grown Cu Dendrites Plasmonically Enhance Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution on Facet&#8208;Engineered Cu2O</title>

Facet&#8208;engineered&#160;Cu2O nanostructures are synthesized by wet&#8208;chemical methods for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).&#160;Operando&#160;Raman spectroscopy and&#160;ex situ&#160;characterization techniques show that Cu2O is reduced during HER.&#160;Incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency measurements combined with ab&#160;initio&#160;nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the hot&#8208;electron injection from Cu dendrites to Cu2O facilitates the plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalytic HER activity.








Abstract
Herein, facet&#8208;engineered Cu2O nanostructures are synthesized by wet chemical methods for electrocatalytic HER, and it is found that the octahedral Cu2O nanostructures with exposed crystal planes of (111) (O&#8208;Cu2O) has the best hydrogen evolution performance. Operando Raman spectroscopy and ex&#8208;situ characterization techniques showed that Cu2O is reduced during HER, in which Cu dendrites are grown on the surface of the Cu2O nanostructures, resulting in the better HER performance of O&#8208;Cu2O after HER (O&#8208;Cu2O&#8208;A) compared with that of the as&#8208;prepared O&#8208;Cu2O. Under illumination, the onset potential of O&#8208;Cu2O&#8208;A is ca. 52 mV positive than that of O&#8208;Cu2O, which is induced by the plasmon&#8208;activated electrochemical system consisting of Cu2O and the in&#8208;situ generated Cu dendrites. Incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (IPCE) measurements and the simulated UV&#8211;Vis spectrum demonstrate the hot electron injection (HEI) from Cu dendrites to Cu2O. Ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations revealed the transfer of photogenerated electrons (27 fs) from Cu dendrites to Cu2O nanostructures is faster than electron relaxation (170 fs), enhancing its surface plasmons activity, and the HEI of Cu dendrites increases the charge density of Cu2O. These make the energy level of the catalyst be closer to that of H+/H2, evidenced by the plasmon&#8208;enhanced HER electrocatalytic activity.

         <title>Highly Stable and Efficient Formamidinium&#8208;Based 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells via Lattice Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A delicate selection of spacer cations and polarity&#8208;matched molecular additives is presented to manipulate the 2D perovskite lattice, improving related texture and stability. The optimized FA&#8208;based 2D perovskite photovoltaic devices achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 20.03% (certified efficiency of 19.30%). Furthermore, the devices exhibit less than 1% efficiency degradation after operation at maximum power point for 1000 h.








Abstract
Formamidinium (FA)&#8208;based 2D perovskites have emerged as highly promising candidates in solar cells. However, the insertion of 2D spacer cations into the perovskite lattice concomitantly introduces microstrain and unfavorable orientations that hinder efficiency and stability. In this study, by finely tuning the FA&#8208;based 2D perovskite lattice through spacer cation engineering, a stable lattice structure with balanced distortion, microstrain relaxation, and reduced carrier&#8211;lattice interactions is achieved. These advancements effectively stabilize the inherently soft lattice against light and thermal&#8208;aging stress. To reduce the photocurrent loss induced by undesired crystal texture, a polarity&#8208;matched molecular&#8208;type selenourea (SENA) additive is further employed to modulate the crystallization kinetics. The introduction of the SENA significantly inhibits the disordered crystallization induced by spacer cations and drives the templated growth of the quantum well structure with a vertical orientation. This controlled crystallization process effectively reduces crystal defects and enhances charge separation. Ultimately, the optimized FA&#8208;based perovskite photovoltaic devices achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.03% (certified steady&#8208;state efficiency of 19.30%), setting a new record for low&#8208;n 2D perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the devices exhibit less than 1% efficiency degradation after operating at maximum power point for 1000 h and maintain excellent stability after thermal aging and cycles of cold&#8211;warm shock, respectively.

Benefiting from the redistribution of d electrons for the spontaneous adsorption of *OH and the optimized binding energy of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) intermediates, an as&#8208;constructed novel trinuclear structure with nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single Mn atom adjacent to two Co atoms anchored in N&#8208;doped carbon (Co2MnN8/C) exhibits an exceptional ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.912&#160;V and outstanding stability.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed transition metal&#8211;nitrogen/carbon (M&#8211;N/C) catalysts have emerged as the most promising substitutes to the precious platinum counterparts toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the reported M&#8211;N/C catalysts are usually in the form of common M&#8211;N4 moieties with only a single metal active site, and they suffer from insufficient activity. Herein, an unusual trinuclear active structure is elaborately developed with a nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single Mn atom adjacent to two Co atoms (Co2MnN8) anchored in N&#8208;doped carbon as a highly efficient ORR catalyst via adsorption&#8211;pyrolysis of a bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate framework precursor. Atomic structural investigations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Co2MnN8 would experience a spontaneous OH binding to form Co2MnN8&#8208;2OH as the real active site, leading to a single electron&#8208;filled state in the dz2${\mathrm{d}}_{{z}^{2}}$ orbital and an optimized binding energy of intermediates. Accordingly, the as&#8208;developed Co2MnN8/C exhibits an unprecedented ORR activity with a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.912&#160;V and outstanding stability, not only surpassing the Pt/C catalyst but also representing a new record for the Co&#8208;based catalyst.

The deposition of volatilized Na+ on the surface of the cathode during sintering results in the formation of surface residual alkali (NaOH/Na2CO3NaHCO3) in layered cathode materials, leading to serious interfacial reactions and performance degradation. This phenomenon is particularly evident in O3&#8208;NaNi0.4Cu0.1Mn0.4Ti0.1O2 (NCMT). In this study, a strategy is proposed to transform waste into treasure by converting residual alkali into a solid electrolyte. Mg(CH3COO)2 and H3PO4 are reacted with surface residual alkali to generate the solid electrolyte NaMgPO4 on the surface of NCMT, which can be labeled as NaMgPO4@NaNi0.4Cu0.1Mn0.4Ti0.1O2&#8208;X (NMP@NCMT&#8208;X, where X indicates the different amounts of Mg2+ and PO43&#8722;). NaMgPO4 acts as a special ionic conductivity channel on the surface to improve the kinetics of the electrode reactions, remarkably improving the rate capability of the modified cathode at a high current density in the half&#8208;cell. Additionally, NMP@NCMT&#8208;2 enables a reversible phase transition from the P3 to OP2 phase in the charge&#8211;discharge process above 4.2&#160;V and achieves a high specific capacity of 157.3 mAh g&#8722;1 and outstanding capacity retention in the full cell. The strategy can effectively and reliably stabilize the interface and improve the performance of layered cathodes for Na&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs).

         <title>Engineering Sub&#8208;Nanometer Hafnia&#8208;Based Ferroelectrics to Break the Scaling Relation for High&#8208;Efficiency Piezocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;nanometer&#8208;sized Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) nanowires with an orthorhombic (Pca21) ferroelectric phase are synthesized. The ferroelectric polarization of flexible HZO SNWs can be easily switched by slight external vibration, resulting in dynamic modulation of the binding energy of adsorbates and thus breaking the "scaling relationship" during piezocatalysis.








Abstract
Reversible control of ferroelectric polarization is essential to overcome the heterocatalytic kinetic limitation. This can be achieved by creating a surface with switchable electron density; however, owing to the rigidity of traditional ferroelectric oxides, achieving polarization reversal in piezocatalytic processes remains challenging. Herein, sub&#8208;nanometer&#8208;sized Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) nanowires with a polymer&#8208;like flexibility are synthesized. Oxygen K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and negative spherical aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy reveal an orthorhombic (Pca21) ferroelectric phase of the HZO sub&#8208;nanometer wires (SNWs). The ferroelectric polarization of the flexible HZO SNWs can be easily switched by slight external vibration, resulting in dynamic modulation of the binding energy of adsorbates and thus breaking the &#8220;scaling relationship&#8221; during piezocatalysis. Consequently, the as&#8208;synthesized ultrathin HZO nanowires display superb water&#8208;splitting activity, with H2 production rate of 25687&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 under 40&#160;kHz ultrasonic vibration, which is 235&#160;and 41&#160;times higher than those of non&#8208;ferroelectric hafnium oxides and rigid BaTiO3 nanoparticles, respectively. More strikingly, the hydrogen production rates can reach 5.2&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 by addition of stirring exclusively.

         <title>Bifacial and Semitransparent Sb2(S,Se)3 Solar Cells for Single&#8208;Junction and Tandem Photovoltaic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifacial and semitransparent Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells exhibit exceptional bifaciality of 0.86 and satisfactory long&#8208;wavelength transmittance exceeding 60%, highly suitable for initial real&#8208;world applications that leverage their ability to effectively absorb tilted incident illumination and enhance performance by exploiting albedo. Furthermore, their compatibility with silicon solar cells enables their integration in tandem applications, unlocking further potential for promoted efficiency.








Abstract
Thin&#8208;film solar cells are expected to play a significant role in the space industry, building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV), indoor applications, and tandem solar cells, where bifaciality and semitransparency are highly desired. Sb2(S,Se)3 has emerged as a promising new photovoltaic (PV) material for its high absorption coefficient, tunable bandgap, and nontoxic and earth&#8208;abundant constituents. However, high&#8208;efficiency Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells exclusively employ monofacial architectures, leaving a considerable gap toward large&#8208;scale application in aforementioned fields. Here, a bifacial and semitransparent Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell and its extended application in tandem solar cells are reported. The transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) and the ultrathin inner n&#8211;i&#8211;p structure provide high long&#8208;wavelength transmittance. Despite the MnS/ITO Schottky junction, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 7.41% and 6.36% are achieved with front and rear illumination, respectively, contributing to a great bifaciality of 0.86. Consequently, the reported device gains great enhancement in PV performance by exploiting albedo of surroundings and shows exceptional capability in absorbing tilt incident light. Moreover, an&#160;Sb2(S,Se)3/Si tandem solar cell with a PCE of 11.66% is achieved in preliminary trials. These exciting findings imply that bifacial and semitransparent Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells possess tremendous potential in practical applications based on their unique characteristics.

         <title>Bioinspired Integrated Auxetic Elastomers Constructed by a Dual Dynamic Interfacial Healing Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired integrated auxetic elastomer (IAE) with a skeleton&#8208;matrix structure is elaborated through dual dynamic interfacial healing driven by disulfide bonds and hydrogen bonds. The IAE remedied the decline in mechanical performance caused by subtractive manufacturing while retaining its auxetic property in a large deformation, which paves a way for automatic scaled&#8208;up synthesis of modular heterogeneous metamaterials.








Abstract
Auxetic materials are appealing due to their unique characteristics of transverse expansion while being axially stretched. Nevertheless, current auxetic materials are often produced by the introduction of diverse geometric structures through cutting or other pore&#8208;making processes, which heavily weaken their mechanical performance. Inspired by the skeleton&#8208;matrix structures in natural organisms, this study reports an integrated auxetic elastomer (IAE) composed of high&#8208;modulus cross&#8208;linked poly(urethane&#8208;urea) as a skeleton and low&#8208;modulus non&#8208;cross&#8208;linked poly(urethane&#8208;urea) as a complementary&#8208;shape matrix. Benefiting from disulfide bonds and hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;promoted dual dynamic interfacial healing, the resulting IAE is flat, void&#8208;free, and has no sharp soft&#8208;to&#8208;hard interface. Its fracture strength and elongation at the break are increased to 400% and 150%, respectively, of the values of corrugated re&#8208;entrant skeleton alone, while the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) reserves within a strain range of 0%&#8211;104%. In addition, the advantageous mechanical and auxetic properties of this elastomer are further confirmed by finite element analysis. The concept of combining two dissimilar polymers into an integrated hybrid material solves the problem of the deterioration in mechanical performance of auxetic materials after subtractive manufacturing, while preserves the NPR effect in a large deformation, which provides a promising approach to robust auxetic materials for engineering applications.

         <title>Constructing Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Multiple&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials with Intrinsically Helical Chirality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An edge&#8208;topology molecular&#8208;engineering strategy is proposed to construct circularly polarized multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed &#64258;uorescence materials with intrinsically helical chirality. The enantiomers (P and M)&#8208;BN&#8208;Py&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit pure&#8208;green emission, with Commission Internationale de L&#8217;Eclairage coordinates of (0.29, 0.68), maximum external quantum efficiency exceeding 30%, and electroluminescence dissymmetry factor of approximately 4.40 &#215; 10&#8722;4.








Abstract
Advanced circularly polarized multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF) materials synergize the advantages of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), narrowband emission, and the TADF characteristic, which can be fabricated into highly efficient circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) with high color purity, directly facing the urgent market strategic demand of ultrahigh&#8208;definition and 3D displays. In this work, based on an edge&#8208;topology molecular&#8208;engineering (ETME) strategy, a pair of high&#8208;performance CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF enantiomers, (P and M)&#8208;BN&#8208;Py, is developed, which merges the intrinsically helical chirality into the MR framework. The optimized CP&#8208;OLEDs with (P and M)&#8208;BN&#8208;Py emitters and the newly developed ambipolar transport host PhCbBCz exhibit pure green emission with sharp peaks of 532&#160;nm, full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 37&#160;nm, and Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.29, 0.68). Importantly, they achieve remarkable maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 30.6% and 29.2%, and clear circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) signals with electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gELs) of &#8722;4.37&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 and +4.35&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 for (P)&#8208;BN&#8208;Py and (M)&#8208;BN&#8208;Py, respectively.

         <title>Anions Regulation Engineering Enables a Highly Reversible and Dendrite&#8208;Free Nickel&#8208;Metal Anode with Ultrahigh Capacities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel as a transition metal has excellent electrochemical properties, which is expected to be one of the attractive metal anodes in aqueous batteries. In this work, nickel&#8208;metal batteries by the design of an anion&#8208;regulation electrolyte achieve reversible nickel plating/stripping with an ultrahigh capacity of 1000&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and long cycle life of 15&#160;000&#160;times.








Abstract
The development of safe and high&#8208;energy metal anodes represents a crucial research direction. Here, the achievement of highly reversible, dendrite&#8208;free transition metal anodes with ultrahigh capacities by regulating aqueous electrolytes is reported. Using nickel (Ni) as a model, theoretical and experimental evidence demonstrating the beneficial role of chloride ions in inhibiting and disrupting the nickel hydroxide passivation layer on the Ni electrode is provided. As a result, Ni anodes with an ultrahigh areal capacity of 1000&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 (volumetric capacity of &#8776;6000&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3), and a Coulombic efficiency of 99.4% on a carbon substrate, surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal electrodes by approximately two orders of magnitude, are realized. Furthermore, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a series of full cells based on the Ni anode is&#160;developed. The designed Ni&#8211;MnO2 full battery exhibits a long lifespan of 2000 cycles, while the Ni&#8211;PbO2 full battery achieves a high areal capacity of 200&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. The findings of this study are important for enlightening a new arena toward the advancement of dendrite&#8208;free Ni&#8208;metal anodes with ultrahigh capacities and long cycle life for various energy&#8208;storage devices.

In article number 2302076, Philipp G. Gr&#252;tzmacher, Manel Rodr&#237;guez Ripoll, Carsten Gachot, Ali Erdemir, Maria Clelia Righi, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that when Se nanoparticles are sprinkled onto Mo or W metallic surfaces, friction comes down dramatically through the formation of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) during sliding. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations uncover the atomistic mechanisms responsible for the formation of these TMDs.

Bio&#8208;Polymorphs
In article number 2302756, Guglielmo Lanzani, Francesca Di Maria, and co&#8208;workers report the intracellular formation of crystalline, fluorescent, and conductive fibers. These cell&#8208;made &#8220;bio&#8221; polymorphic materials have the unique ability to &#8220;connect&#8221; cells by penetrating the plasma membrane of neighboring cells without killing them and to conform/adapt to the cellular movement, indicating high fiber flexibility and potentially allowing for dynamic interactions and information exchange.

Defect Dynamics
In article 2305383, Qingteng Zhang, Gang Wan, Vitalii Starchenko, Guoxiang Hu, Ho Nyung Lee, P. Ganesh, Dillon Fong, and co&#8208;workers study the domain boundary fluctuation between a metallic perovskite (Pv) phase and the insulating brownmillerite (Bm) phase domains in epitaxial SrCoOx film (2.5 &lt; x &lt; 3). Competition between the Pv and Bm phases leads to intermittent domain fluctuation even at thermal equilibrium, which provides novel perspectives for devices based on probabilistic (p)&#8208;bits beyond the Boolean logic.

Achromatic Copper Films
Diverse colors can be attained solely through manipulation of the surface of copper. Uniformly oxidizing the copper surface and controlling the thickness of the resulting oxide layer has proven that comprehensive natural coloration can be achieved. In article number 2210564, Young&#8208;Min Kim, Se&#8208;Young Jeong, and co&#8208;workers fabricate a rough copper surface, characterized by dendrites, to realize an extensive spectrum of achromatic colors. This unique rough copper surface, resembling nanocavities, effectively captures and traps light.

         <title>Aqueous Organic Batteries Using the Proton as a Charge Carrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proton (H+) as a charge carrier possesses unique properties such as fast diffusion dynamics, a low molar mass, and a small hydrated ion radius, endowing aqueous proton batteries (APBs) with a salient rate capability, a long&#8208;term life span, and an excellent low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance, as well as high safety. A comprehensive summary and evaluation of APBs employing organic electrodes as anode and/or cathode is presented, together with systematic discussions for guiding the rational design and the construction of APBs based on organic electrodes








Abstract
Benefiting from the merits of low cost, nonflammability, and high operational safety, aqueous rechargeable batteries have emerged as promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage applications. Among various metal&#8208;ion/non&#8208;metallic charge carriers, the proton (H+) as a charge carrier possesses numerous unique properties such as fast proton diffusion dynamics, a low molar mass, and a small hydrated ion radius, which endow aqueous proton batteries (APBs) with a salient rate capability, a long&#8208;term life span, and an excellent low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance. In addition, redox&#8208;active organic molecules, with the advantages of structural diversity, rich proton&#8208;storage sites, and abundant resources, are considered attractive electrode materials for APBs. However, the charge&#8208;storage and transport mechanisms of organic electrodes in APBs are still in their infancy. Therefore, finding suitable electrode materials and uncovering the H+&#8208;storage mechanisms are significant for the application of organic materials in APBs. Herein, the latest research progress on organic materials, such as small molecules and polymers for APBs, is reviewed. Furthermore, a comprehensive summary and evaluation of APBs employing organic electrodes as anode and/or cathode is provided, especially regarding their low&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;power performances, along with systematic discussions for guiding the rational design and the construction of APBs based on organic electrodes.

&lt;p&gt;Benefiting from the merits of low cost, nonflammability, and high operational safety, aqueous rechargeable batteries have emerged as promising candidates for large-scale energy-storage applications. Among various metal-ion/non-metallic charge carriers, the proton (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) as a charge carrier possesses numerous unique properties such as fast proton diffusion dynamics, a low molar mass, and a small hydrated ion radius, which endow aqueous proton batteries (APBs) with a salient rate capability, a long-term life span, and an excellent low-temperature electrochemical performance. In addition, redox-active organic molecules, with the advantages of structural diversity, rich proton-storage sites, and abundant resources, are considered attractive electrode materials for APBs. However, the charge-storage and transport mechanisms of organic electrodes in APBs are still in their infancy. Therefore, finding suitable electrode materials and uncovering the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-storage mechanisms are significant for the application of organic materials in APBs. Herein, the latest research progress on organic materials, such as small molecules and polymers for APBs, is reviewed. Furthermore, a comprehensive summary and evaluation of APBs employing organic electrodes as anode and/or cathode is provided, especially regarding their low-temperature and high-power performances, along with systematic discussions for guiding the rational design and the construction of APBs based on organic electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
An overview of the recent advances in implantable optoelectronics for neural activity monitoring and modulation is provided. Combining optical and electrical modes in a unitary neural network interface has gained momentum in recent years, and controlling the spatial coverage of illumination, designing light&#8208;activated modulators, and developing wireless light delivery and data transmission are crucial for maximizing the use of optical neuromodulation.








Abstract
Optogenetic modulation of brain neural activity that combines optical and electrical modes in a unitary neural system has recently gained robust momentum. Controlling illumination spatial coverage, designing light&#8208;activated modulators, and developing wireless light delivery and data transmission are crucial for maximizing the use of optical neuromodulation. To this end, biocompatible electrodes with enhanced optoelectrical performance, device integration for multiplexed addressing, wireless transmission, and multimodal operation in soft systems have been developed. This review provides an outlook for uniformly illuminating large brain areas while spatiotemporally imaging the neural responses upon optoelectrical stimulation with little artifacts. Representative concepts and important breakthroughs, such as head&#8208;mounted illumination, multiple implanted optical fibers, and micro&#8208;light&#8208;delivery devices, are discussed. Examples of techniques that incorporate electrophysiological monitoring and optoelectrical stimulation are presented. Challenges and perspectives are posed for further research efforts toward high&#8208;density optoelectrical neural interface modulation, with the potential for nonpharmacological neurological disease treatments and wireless optoelectrical stimulation.

         <title>Water&#8208;Resistant Conductive Gels toward Underwater Wearable Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Underwater wearable sensing is of great significance for improving the safety and efficiency of underwater activities. This review presents the representative design strategies for developing water&#8208;resistant conductive gels and their diversified applications in the underwater sensing field as wearable sensors, which provides guidance for promoting the rapid development of gel&#8208;based underwater wearable sensors.








Abstract
Conductive gels are developing vigorously as superior wearable sensing materials due to their intrinsic conductivity, softness, stretchability, and biocompatibility, showing a great potential in many aspects of lives. However, compared to their wide application on land, it is significant yet rather challenging for traditional conductive gels to realize sensing application under water. The swelling of gels and the loss of conductive components in the aqueous environment, resulted from the diffusion across the interface, lead to structural instability and sensing performance decline. Fortunately, great efforts are devoted to improving the water resistance of conductive gels and employing them in the field of underwater wearable sensing in recent years, and some exciting achievements are obtained, which are of great significance for promoting the safety and efficiency of underwater activities. However, there is no review to thoroughly summarize the underwater sensing application of conductive gels. This review presents a brief overview of the representative design strategies for developing water&#8208;resistant conductive gels and their diversified applications in the underwater sensing field as wearable sensors. Finally, the ongoing challenges for further developing water&#8208;resistant conductive gels for underwater wearable sensing are also discussed along with recommendations for the future.

Two distinct requirements of various nanomaterials, including from a single semiconductor or with van der Waals heterostructures, are summarized, including where strain must be avoided, such as solutions to produce strain&#8208;insensitive devices, and where strain is required, such as pressure&#8208;sensitive outcomes.








Abstract
2D materials with dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surfaces and atomically thin layers have been shown to be capable of being incorporated into flexible electronic devices. The electronic and optical properties of 2D materials can be tuned or controlled in other ways by using the intriguing strain engineering method. The latest and encouraging techniques in regard to creating flexible 2D nanoelectronics are condensed in this review. These techniques have the potential to be used in a wider range of applications in the near and long term. It is possible to use ultrathin 2D materials (graphene, BP, WTe2, VSe2 etc.) and 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) in order to enable the electrical behavior of the devices to be studied. A category of materials is produced on smaller scales by exfoliating bulk materials, whereas chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and epitaxial growth are employed on larger scales. This overview highlights two distinct requirements, which include from a single semiconductor or with van der Waals heterostructures of various nanomaterials. They include where strain must be avoided and where it is required, such as solutions to produce strain&#8208;insensitive devices, and such as pressure&#8208;sensitive outcomes, respectively. Finally, points&#8208;of&#8208;view about the current difficulties and possibilities in regard to using 2D materials in flexible electronics are provided.

         <title>Synergizing a Large Ordinary Nernst Effect and Axis&#8208;Dependent Conduction Polarity in Flat Band KMgBi Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The exploration of quantum materials in which an applied thermo/electrical/magnetic field along one crystallographic direction produces an anisotropic response has led to unique functionalities. Along these lines, KMgBi is a layered, narrow gap semiconductor near a critical state between multiple Dirac phases due to the presence of a flat band near the Fermi level. The valence band is highly anisotropic with minimal cross&#8208;plane dispersion, which, in combination with an isotropic conduction band, enables axis&#8208;dependent conduction polarity. Thermopower and Hall measurements indicate dominant p&#8208;type conduction along the cross&#8208;plane direction, and n&#8208;type conduction along the in&#8208;plane direction, leading to a significant zero&#8208;field transverse thermoelectric response when the heat flux is at an angle to the principal crystallographic directions. Additionally, a large Ordinary Nernst effect (ONE) is observed with an applied field.&#160; It arises from the ambipolar term in the Nernst effect, whereby the Lorentz force on electrons and holes makes them drift in opposite directions so that the resulting Nernst voltage becomes a function of the difference between their partial thermopowers, greatly enhancing the ONE. We prove that axis&#8208;dependent polarity&#160;can synergistically enhance the ONE, in addition to leading to a zero&#8208;field transverse thermoelectric performance.

         <title>A Transformable Supramolecular Bispecific Cell Engager for Augmenting Natural Killer and T Cell&#8208;Based Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Immune cells are pivotal in cancer immunotherapy, yet their therapeutic effectiveness is often hampered by limited tumor infiltration and inhibitory tumor microenvironments. We here introduce an alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&#8208;responsive and transformable supramolecular bis&#8208;specific cell engager (Supra&#8208;BiCE) to harness NK/T cells for effective cancer immunotherapy. The Supra&#8208;BiCE, consisting of both SA&#8208;P (a phosphorylated peptide targeting and blocking PD&#8208;L1) and SA&#8208;T (a phosphorylated peptide targeting and blocking TIGIT) is constructed by a simple co&#8208;assembling strategy. Upon intravenous administration, Supra&#8208;BiCE self&#8208;assembles into nanoribbons and interacts with NK/T cells via TIGIT. Notably, these nanoribbons undergo transformation into long nanofibrils within ALP&#8208;overexpressing tumor regions, resulting in enhanced binding affinities of Supra&#8208;BiCE to both PD&#8208;L1 and TIGIT. Consequently, this leads to the accumulation and retention of NK cells and CD8+ T cells within tumor regions. Furthermore, the combinatorial blockade of checkpoints by Supra&#8208;BiCE activates infiltrating NK/T cells, as evidenced by upregulated expression of perforin, granzyme B, TNF&#8208;a, and IL&#8208;2. Moreover, the adjustable peptide ratio in Supra&#8208;BiCE enables customization for optimal therapeutic effects against distinct tumor types. Particularly, Supra&#8208;BiCE (T:P = 1:3) achieved 98.27% tumor suppression rate against CT26 cell tumor model. Overall, our study offers a promising tool for engaging NK and T cells for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>A Dynamically Stable Mixed Conducting Interphase for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) metal batteries (ASSLMBs) employing sulfide solid electrolytes have attracted increasing attention owing to their superior safety and high energy density. However, the instability of sulfide electrolytes against Li metal generally induces the formation of two types of incompetent interphases, that is, solid&#8208;state interphase (SEI) and mixed conducting interphase (MCI), which significantly blocks the rapid Li&#8208;ion transport and induces uneven Li metal deposition and continuous interface degradation. In this contribution, a dynamically stable mixed conducting interphase (S&#8208;MCI) is proposed by in&#8208;situ stress self&#8208;limiting reactions to achieve the compatibility of Li metal with composite sulfide electrolytes (Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl) and Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS)) and the suppression of Li dendrite penetration. The rational design of composite electrolyte utilizes the expansion stress after the decomposition of working electrolyte to in turn constrain the further continuous decomposition of LGPS. Consequently, the dense S&#8208;MCI inherits the high dynamical stability of LPSCl&#8208;derived SEI and lithiophilic affinity of Li&#8208;Ge alloy in LGPS&#8208;derived MCI. The Li||Li symmetric cells with the protection of S&#8208;MCI can operate stably for 1500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2. The Li||NCM622 full cells present stable cycling for 100 cycles at 0.1 C with a high&#8208;capacity retention of 93.7%. This work sheds fresh insight into constructing electrochemically stable interphase for high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs.

&lt;p&gt;All-solid-state lithium (Li) metal batteries (ASSLMBs) employing sulfide solid electrolytes have attracted increasing attention owing to their superior safety and high energy density. However, the instability of sulfide electrolytes against Li metal generally induces the formation of two types of incompetent interphases, that is, solid-state interphase (SEI) and mixed conducting interphase (MCI), which significantly blocks the rapid Li-ion transport and induces uneven Li metal deposition and continuous interface degradation. In this contribution, a dynamically stable mixed conducting interphase (S-MCI) is proposed by &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; stress self-limiting reactions to achieve the compatibility of Li metal with composite sulfide electrolytes (Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl (LPSCl) and Li&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;GeP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (LGPS)) and the suppression of Li dendrite penetration.

         <title>A Lithium Intrusion&#8211;Blocking Interfacial Shield for Wide&#8211;Pressure&#8211;Range Solid&#8211;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Abstract
Lithium garnets are considered as promising solid&#8211;state electrolytes for next&#8211;generation solid&#8211;state Li metal batteries (SSLBs). However, the Li intrusion driven by external stack pressure triggers premature of Li metal batteries. Herein, for the first time, we report an in situ constructed interfacial shield to efficiently inhibit the pressure&#8211;induced Li intrusion in SSLBs. Theoretical modeling and experimental investigations reveal that high&#8211;hardness metallic Mo nanocrystals inside the shield effectively suppress Li dendrite growth without alloy hardening&#8211;derived interfacial contact deterioration. Meanwhile the electrically insulated Li2S as a shield component considerably promotes interfacial wettability and hinders Li dendrite penetration into the bulk of garnet electrolyte. Interfacial shield&#8211;protected Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO)&#8211;based cells exhibit significantly enhanced cyclability without short circuits under conventional pressures of &#8776;0.2&#160;MPa and even at high pressure of up to 70&#160;MPa; which is the highest endurable stack pressure reported for SSLBs using garnet electrolytes. These key findings are expected to promote the wide&#8211;pressure&#8211;range applications of SSLBs.

         <title>Exploring the Synergies of Single&#8208;Molecule Fluorescence and 2D Materials Coupled by DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating single&#8208;molecule (SM) fluorescence methods with 2D materials by using DNA and related nanostructures as molecular anchors provides significant benefits for both fields: deepening knowledge about the materials while adding information to SM fluorescence experiments. This Perspective delves into the rich interplay, highlights new opportunities for further synergies, and identifies challenges in this cross&#8208;disciplinary venture.








Abstract
The world of 2D materials is steadily growing, with numerous researchers attempting to discover, elucidate, and exploit their properties. Approaches relying on the detection of single fluorescent molecules offer a set of advantages, for instance, high sensitivity and specificity, that allow the drawing of conclusions with unprecedented precision. Herein, it is argued how the study of 2D materials benefits from fluorescence&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule modalities, and vice versa. A special focus is placed on DNA, serving as a versatile adaptor when anchoring single dye molecules to 2D materials. The existing literature on the fruitful combination of the two fields is reviewed, and an outlook on the additional synergies that can be created between them provided.

         <title>Tailor&#8208;Made White Photothermal Fabrics: A Bridge between Pragmatism and Aesthetic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A white composite fabric with an exceptional photo&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion capability that outperforms ordinary black photothermal fabric is developed. Collective characteristics of shape retention, softness, breathability, light weight, fast&#8208;drying, durability, and tailorability into diverse appearances are integrated into this novel fabric, which promises to satisfy the needs of future advanced garment manufacturing, thermoregulation, and aesthetics.








Abstract
Maintaining human thermal comfort in the cold outdoors is crucial for diverse outdoor activities, e.g., sports and recreation, healthcare, and special occupations. To date, advanced clothes are employed to collect solar energy as a heat source to stand cold climates, while their dull dark photothermal coating may hinder pragmatism in outdoor environments&#160;and visual sense considering fashion. Herein, tailor&#8208;made white webs with strong photothermal effect are proposed. With the embedding of cesium&#8211;tungsten bronze (CsxWO3) nanoparticles (NPs) as additive inside nylon nanofibers, these webs are capable of drawing both near&#8208;infrared (NIR) and ultraviolet (UV) light in sunlight for heating. Their exceptional photothermal conversion capability enables 2.5&#8211;10.5 &#176;C greater warmth than that of a commercial sweatshirt of six times greater thickness under different climates. Remarkably, this smart fabric can increase its photothermal conversion efficiency in a wet state. It is optimal for fast sweat or water evaporation at human comfort temperature (38.5 &#176;C) under sunlight, and its role in thermoregulation is equally important to avoid excess heat loss in wilderness survival. Obviously, this smart web with considerable merits of shape retention, softness, safety, breathability, washability, and on&#8208;demand coloration provides a revolutionary solution to realize energy&#8208;saving outdoor thermoregulation and simultaneously satisfy the needs of fashion and aesthetics.

         <title>Microfibrous Scaffolds Guide Stem Cell Lumenogenesis and Brain Organoid Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scaffold&#8208;based platform to increase the throughput, reproducibility, and geometric control of 3D organoids is presented. Melt electrowriting is used to generate fibrous scaffolds that guide the self&#8208;organization of pluripotent stem cells into a large array of suspended interconnected or discrete organoids. Tuning the geometry of the scaffold enables to control the shape and lumen formation of the emerging tissues.








Abstract
3D organoids are widely used as tractable in vitro models capable of elucidating aspects of human development and disease. However, the manual and low&#8208;throughput culture methods, coupled with a low reproducibility and geometric heterogeneity, restrict the scope and application of organoid research. Combining expertise from stem cell biology and bioengineering offers a promising approach to address some of these limitations. Here, melt electrospinning writing is used to generate tuneable grid scaffolds that can guide the self&#8208;organization of pluripotent stem cells into patterned arrays of embryoid bodies. Grid geometry is shown to be a key determinant of stem cell self&#8208;organization, guiding the position and size of emerging lumens via curvature&#8208;controlled tissue growth. Two distinct methods for culturing scaffold&#8208;grown embryoid bodies into either interconnected or spatially discrete cerebral organoids are reported. These scaffolds provide a high&#8208;throughput method to generate, culture, and analyze large numbers of organoids, substantially reducing the time investment and manual labor involved in conventional methods of organoid culture. It is anticipated that this methodological development will open up new opportunities for guiding pluripotent stem cell culture, studying lumenogenesis, and generating large numbers of uniform organoids for high&#8208;throughput screening.

Two distinct methods for culturing scaffold-grown embryoid bodies into either interconnected or spatially discrete cerebral organoids are reported. These scaffolds provide a high-throughput method to generate, culture, and analyze large numbers of organoids, substantially reducing the time investment and manual labor involved in conventional methods of organoid culture. It is anticipated that this methodological development will open up new opportunities for guiding pluripotent stem cell culture, studying lumenogenesis, and generating large numbers of uniform organoids for high-throughput screening.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Amphiphilic Cobalt Phthalocyanine Boosts Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic tetra&#8208;carboxyphenyl&#8208;substituted cobalt phthalocyanine is designed to adjust the hydrophilic/hydrophobic property of CoPc/carbon hybrid materials from a molecular perspective. The catalyst maintains effective contact between the active sites and the electrolyte, and achieves efficient CO2RR in both H&#8208;type cell and MEA device with exceptional selectivity and stability.








Abstract
Due to the easy accessibility, chemical stability, and structural tunability of the macrocyclic skeleton, cobalt phthalocyanines immobilized on carbon supports offer an ideal research model for advanced electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR). In this work, an amphiphilic cobalt phthalocyanine (TC&#8208;CoPc) is loaded on multiwalled carbon nanotubes to reveal the roles of hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties on catalytic efficiency. Surprisingly, the resultant electrode exhibits a CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 95% for CO2RR with turnover frequency (TOF) of 29.4 s&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 0.585&#160;V over long&#8208;term electrolysis in a H&#8208;type cell. In the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) device, the boosted transport of water vapor to the catalyst layer slows down carbonate crystallization and enhances the stability of the electrode, with FECO value of &gt;99% over 27 h at &#8722;0.25 A, representing the best selectivity and stability among reported molecular catalysts in MEA devices. The amphiphilic cobalt phthalocyanine, which decreases interfacial charge and mass transfer resistance and maintains effective contact between active sites and the electrolyte, highlights the exceptional CO2 conversion from a molecular perspective.

         <title>Bimetallic Organic Frameworks of High Piezovoltage for Sono&#8208;Piezo Dynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel piezoelectric Mn&#8211;Ti bimetallic organic framework (MT&#8208;MOF) of high piezovoltage is designed for new sono&#8208;piezoelectric dynamic therapy with significant antitumor efficiency in vitro and in vivo. Strikingly, the MT&#8208;MOF, which has a piezopotential of 2.9&#160;V, exciting charges under low&#8208;intensity ultrasound, not only causes ROS overproduction but also disrupts the polarization of the plasma and mitochondrial membranes inducing intense cytotoxicity.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials produce charges to directly act on cancer medium or promote the generation of&#160;reactive oxygen species (ROS) for novel tumor therapy triggered by sonography. Currently, piezoelectric sonosensitizers are mainly used to catalyze ROS generation by the band&#8208;tilting effect for sonodynamic therapy. However, it remains a challenge for piezoelectric sonosensitizers to produce high piezovoltages to overcome the bandgap barrier for direct charge generation. Herein, Mn&#8211;Ti bimetallic organic framework tetragonal nanosheets (MT&#8208;MOF TNS) are designed to produce high piezovoltages for novel sono&#8208;piezo (SP)&#8208;dynamic therapy (SPDT) with remarkable antitumor efficacy in vitro and in vivo. The MT&#8208;MOF TNS comprise non&#8208;centrosymmetric secondary building units of Mn&#8211;Ti&#8211;oxo cyclic octamers with charge heterogeneous components for piezoelectricity. The MT&#8208;MOF TNS promotes strong sonocavitation to induce piezoelectric effect with a high SP voltage (2.9&#160;V) in situ, to directly excite charges, which is validated by SP&#8208;excited luminescence spectrometry. The SP voltage and charges depolarize the mitochondrial and plasma membrane potentials and cause ROS overproduction and serious tumor cell damage. Importantly, MT&#8208;MOF TNS can be decorated with targeting molecules and chemotherapeutics for more severe tumor regression by combining SPDT with chemodynamic therapy and chemotherapy. This report develops a fascinating MT&#8208;MOF piezoelectric nano&#8208;semiconductor and provides an efficient SPDT strategy for tumor treatment.

         <title>Topological Flat Bands in 2D Breathing&#8208;Kagome Lattice Nb3TeCl7</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The experimental evidence of the nearly independent single topological flat band (FB) generated by the 2D Nb breathing&#8208;kagome layer&#160;in Nb3TeCl7 with identical on&#8208;site energy of Nb sites is reported. The possibility of modulating the bandwidth, energy position, and topology of the FB by altering the on&#8208;site energy over Nb sites in the 2D breathing&#8208;kagome frustrated geometry is disclosed.








Abstract
Flat bands&#160;(FBs) can appear in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) geometrically frustrated systems caused by quantum destructive interference (QDI). However, the scarcity of pure 2D frustrated crystal structures in natural materials makes FBs hard to be identified, let alone modulate FBs relating to electronic properties. Here, the experimental evidence of the complete electronic QDI induced FB contributed by the 2D breathing&#8208;kagome layers of Nb atoms in Nb3TeCl7 (NTC) is reported. An identical chemical state and 2D localization characteristics of the Nb breathing&#8208;kagome layers are experimentally confirmed, based on which NTC is demonstrated to be a superior concrete candidate for the breathing&#8208;kagome tight&#8208;binding model. Furthermore, it theoretically establishes the tunable roles of the on&#8208;site energy over Nb sites on bandwidth, energy position, and topology of FBs in NTC. This work opens an aveanue to manipulate FB characteristics in these 4d transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based breathing&#8208;kagome materials.

         <title>Mechanochromism and Strain&#8208;Induced Crystallization in Thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;Derived Stereoelastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semicrystalline, mechanochromic stereoelastomers possessing spiropyran mechanophores are synthesized via thiol&#8208;yne Michael addition polymerization. Tensile tests across two decades of strain rates reveal significant correlations between strain hardening, strain&#8208;induced crystallization, and mechanochromism, which exhibits a novel multiregime behavior. Spiropyran recovery kinetics after failure are controlled by strain&#8208;induced crystallization, resulting in record activation lifetimes.








Abstract
Most elastomers undergo strain&#8208;induced crystallization (SIC) under tension; as individual chains are held rigidly in a fixed position by an applied strain, their alignment along the strain field results in a shift from strain&#8208;hardening (SH) to SIC. A similar degree of stretching is associated with the tension necessary to accelerate mechanically coupled, covalent chemical responses of mechanophores in overstretched chains, raising the possibility of an interplay between the macroscopic response of SIC and the molecular response of mechanophore activation. Here, thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;derived stereoelastomers doped covalently with a dipropiolate&#8208;derivatized spiropyran (SP) mechanophore (0.25&#8211;0.38&#160;mol%) are reported. The material properties of SP&#8208;containing films are consistent with undoped controls, indicating that the SP is a reporter of the mechanical state of the polymer. Uniaxial tensile tests reveal correlations between mechanochromism and SIC, which are strain&#8208;rate&#8208;dependent. When mechanochromic films are stretched slowly to the point of mechanophore activation, the covalently tethered mechanophore remains trapped in a force&#8208;activated state, even after the applied stress is removed. Mechanophore reversion kinetics correlate with the applied strain rate, resulting in highly tunable decoloration rates. Because these polymers are not covalently crosslinked, they are recyclable by melt&#8208;pressing into new films, increasing their potential range of strain&#8208;sensing, morphology&#8208;sensing, and shape&#8208;memory applications.

Shape&#8208;programmable liquid&#8208;crystalline polyurethane&#8208;based multimode actuators triggered by light&#8208;driven molecular motors are prepared. The shape&#8208;programmable polymeric film presents superior mechanical properties and characteristic shape&#8208;memory effect. Furthermore, diverse modes of motions including bending, unwinding, and contracting with tunable actuation speed over a wide range are achieved.








Abstract
In recent years, light&#8208;driven soft actuators have been rapidly developed as enablers in the fabrication of artificial robots and biomimetic devices. However, it remains challenging to amplify molecular isomerization to multiple modes of macroscopic actuation with large amplitude and complex motions. Here, a strategy is reported to build a light&#8208;responsive liquid&#8208;crystalline polyurethane elastomer by phototriggered overcrowded alkene&#8208;based molecular motors. A trifunctional molecular motor modified with an ethylene glycol spacer on the rotor and stator functions as a crosslinker and unidirectional stirrer that amplifies molecular motion into macroscopic movement. The shape&#8208;programmable polymeric film presents superior mechanical properties and characteristic shape&#8208;memory effect. Furthermore, diverse modes of motions including bending, unwinding, and contracting with tunable actuation speed over a wide range are achieved. Such research is hoped to pave a new way for the design of advanced light&#8208;responsive soft actuators and robots.

         <title>Molecular Structure and Conformational Design of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Conjugated Polymers to Enable Predictable Optoelectronic Property</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing integrated experimental and computational methods, it is demonstrated that alterations in the chain conformation of donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated polymers do not consistently exhibit a direct correlation with shifts in optical absorption. Moreover, it is revealed that the combined effect of chain conformation and the alignment of molecular orbital energy between donor and acceptor units influence the ultimate optical bandgap of donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated polymers.








Abstract
Tuning the optoelectronic properties of donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated polymers (D&#8208;A CPs) is of great importance in designing various organic optoelectronic devices. However, there remains a critical challenge in precise control of bandgap through synthetic approach, since the chain conformation also affects molecular orbital energy levels. Here, D&#8208;A CPs with different acceptor units are explored that show an opposite trend in energy band gaps with the increasing length of oligothiophene donor units. By investigating their chain conformation and molecular orbital energy, it is found that the molecular orbital energy alignment between donor and acceptor units plays a crucial role in dictating the final optical bandgap of D&#8208;A CPs. For polymers with staggered orbital energy alignment, the higher HOMO with increasing oligothiophene length leads to a narrowing of the optical bandgap despite decreased chain rigidity. On the other hand, for polymers with sandwiched orbital energy alignment, the increased band gap with increasing oligothiophene length originates from the reduction of bandwidth due to more localized charge density distribution. Thus, this work provides a molecular understanding of the role of backbone building blocks on the chain conformation and bandgaps of D&#8208;A CPs for organic optoelectronic devices through the conformation design and segment orbital energy alignment.

         <title>Overcoming Water Diffusion Limitations in Hydrogels via Microtubular Graphene Networks for Soft Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates bioinspired microstructured thermoresponsive hydrogels for soft actuators with enhanced actuation performance and options for both light&#8208; and electrically controlled actuation. The poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hydrogels contain interconnected microtubular graphene networks for enhanced water transport, resulting in increased actuation dynamics and stresses without compromising the softness and mechanical stability of the hydrogel.








Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based soft actuators can operate in sensitive environments, bridging the gap of rigid machines interacting with soft matter. However, while stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels can undergo extreme reversible volume changes of up to &#8776;90%, water transport in hydrogel actuators is in general limited by their poroelastic behavior. For poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) the actuation performance is even further compromised by the formation of a dense skin layer. Here it is shown, that incorporating a bioinspired microtube graphene network into a PNIPAM matrix with a total porosity of only 5.4% dramatically enhances actuation dynamics by up to &#8776;400% and actuation stress by &#8776;4000% without sacrificing the mechanical stability, overcoming the water transport limitations. The graphene network provides both untethered light&#8208;controlled and electrically powered actuation. It is anticipated that the concept provides a versatile platform for enhancing the functionality of soft matter by combining responsive and 2D materials, paving the way toward designing soft intelligent matter.

         <title>A Bioinspired Bilevel Metamaterial for Multispectral Manipulation toward Visible, Multi&#8208;Wavelength Detection Lasers and Mid&#8208;Infrared Selective Radiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired bilevel metamaterial is proposed for multispectral manipulation with visible, multi&#8208;wavelength detection lasers and mid&#8208;infrared selective absorption for camouflage, motivated by the butterfly scales with broadband reflection splitting effect. This work not only widens the working wavebands compared to the conventional materials but also opens a bioinspired way to improve the multispectral performance of wave&#8208;functional metamaterials.








Abstract
Manipulation of the electromagnetic signature in multiple wavebands is necessary and effective in civil and industrial applications. However, the integration of multispectral requirements, particularly for the bands with comparable wavelengths, challenges the design and fabrication of current compatible metamaterials. Here, a bioinspired bilevel metamaterial is proposed for multispectral manipulation involving visible, multi&#8208;wavelength detection lasers and mid&#8208;infrared (MIR), along with radiative cooling. The metamaterial, consisting of dual&#8208;deck Pt disks and a SiO2 intermediate layer, is inspired by the broadband reflection splitting effect found in butterfly scales and achieves ultralow specular reflectance (average of 0.013) over the entire 0.8&#8211;1.6&#160;&#181;m with large scattering angles. Meanwhile, tunable visible reflection and selective dual absorption peaks in MIR can be simultaneously realized, providing structural color, effective radiative thermal dissipation at 5&#8211;8&#160;&#181;m and 10.6&#160;&#181;m laser absorption. The metamaterial is fabricated by a low&#8208;cost colloidal lithography method combined with two patterning processes. Multispectral manipulation performances are experimentally demonstrated and a significant apparent temperature drop (maximum of 15.7&#160;&#176;C) compared to the reference is observed under a thermal imager. This work achieves optical response in multiple wavebands and provides a valuable way to effectively design multifunctional metamaterials inspired by nature.

         <title>A High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Oxides&#8208;Based Memristor: Outstanding Resistive Switching Performance and Mechanisms in Atomic Structural Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resistive random&#8208;access memory based on high&#8208;entropy oxide exhibits excellent performance, such as low power consumption, long retention time, and excellent endurance. The excellent properties are due to the interactions among the five metal cations and the entropy stabilization effect. The switching behavior is induced by the migration of oxygen ions, leading to a structural transformation between spinel and rock salt.








Abstract
The application of high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) has attracted significant attention in recent years owing to their unique structural characteristics, such as excellent electrochemical properties and long&#8208;term cycling stability. However, the application of resistive random&#8208;access memory (RRAM) has not been extensively studied, and the switching mechanism of HEO&#8208;based RRAM has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this study, HEO (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni)3O4 with a spinel structure is epitaxially grown on a Nb:STO conductive substrate, and Pt metal is deposited as the top electrode. After the resistive&#8208;switching operation, some regions of the spinel structure are transformed into a rock&#8208;salt structure and analyzed using advanced transmission electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy. From the results of X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy, only specific elements would change their valence state, which results in excellent resistive&#8208;switching properties with a high on/off ratio on the order of 105, outstanding endurance (&gt;4550 cycles), long retention time (&gt;104 s), and high stability, which suggests that HEO is a promising RRAM material.

In this study, HEO (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with a spinel structure is epitaxially grown on a Nb:STO conductive substrate, and Pt metal is deposited as the top electrode. After the resistive-switching operation, some regions of the spinel structure are transformed into a rock-salt structure and analyzed using advanced transmission electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy. From the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy, only specific elements would change their valence state, which results in excellent resistive-switching properties with a high on/off ratio on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, outstanding endurance (&amp;gt;4550 cycles), long retention time (&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; s), and high stability, which suggests that HEO is a promising RRAM material.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Oscillation of Thermoplasmonic Nanocolloids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;oscillation is the periodic change of a system under a non&#8208;periodic stimulus. A new self&#8208;oscillator model is presented in which photoactive plasmonic nanoparticles display periodic clustering under non&#8208;periodic illumination. The surface temperature of nanoparticles and the number density of their clusters jointly oscillate at infrasonic/acoustic frequencies. Further mathematical extension of the model suggests the emergence of a thermoplasmonic attractor.








Abstract
Self&#8208;oscillation&#8212;the periodic change of a system under a non&#8208;periodic stimulus&#8212;is vital for creating low&#8208;maintenance autonomous devices in soft robotics technologies. Soft composites of macroscopic dimensions are often doped with plasmonic nanoparticles to enhance energy dissipation and generate periodic response. However, while it is still unknown whether a dispersion of photonic nanocrystals may respond to light as a soft actuator, a dynamic analysis of nanocolloids self&#8208;oscillating in a liquid is also lacking. This study presents a new self&#8208;oscillator model for illuminated colloidal systems. It predicts that the surface temperature of thermoplasmonic nanoparticles and the number density of their clusters jointly oscillate at frequencies ranging from infrasonic to acoustic values. New experiments with spontaneously clustering gold nanorods, where the photothermal effect alters the interplay of light (stimulus) with the disperse system on a macroscopic scale, strongly support the&#160;theory. These findings enlarge the current view on self&#8208;oscillation phenomena and anticipate the colloidal state of matter to be a suitable host for accommodating light&#8208;propelled machineries. In broad terms, a complex system behavior is observed, which goes from periodic solutions (Hopf&#8211;Poincar&#233;&#8211;Andronov bifurcation) to a new dynamic attractor driven by nanoparticle interactions, linking thermoplasmonics to nonlinearity and&#160;chaos.

         <title>Effective Modulation of Inflammation and Oxidative Stress for Enhanced Regeneration of Intervertebral Discs Using 3D Porous Hybrid Protein Nanoscaffold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effective modulation of inflammation requires sustainable and dynamic blockades of diverse inflammatory mediators. A 3D porous hybrid protein nanoscaffold&#8208;based therapeutic strategy is developed to inhibit pro&#8208;inflammatory reactive oxygen species, cf nucleic acids, and regulate epigenetics in immune cells. This strategy robustly suppresses inflammation in vivo, promotes tissue regeneration, and reduces pain signaling after intervertebral disc injuries.








Abstract
Degeneration of fibrocartilaginous tissues is often associated with complex pro&#8208;inflammatory factors. These include reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell&#8208;free nucleic acids (cf&#8208;NAs), and epigenetic changes in immune cells. To effectively control this complex inflammatory signaling, it developed an all&#8208;in&#8208;one nanoscaffold&#8208;based 3D porous hybrid protein (3D&#8208;PHP) self&#8208;therapeutic strategy for treating intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. The 3D&#8208;PHP nanoscaffold is synthesized by introducing a novel nanomaterial&#8208;templated protein assembly (NTPA) strategy. 3D&#8208;PHP nanoscaffolds that avoid covalent modification of proteins demonstrate inflammatory stimuli&#8208;responsive drug release, disc&#8208;mimetic stiffness, and excellent biodegradability. Enzyme&#8208;like 2D nanosheets incorporated into nanoscaffolds further enabled robust scavenging of ROS and cf&#8208;NAs, reducing inflammation and enhancing the survival of disc cells under inflammatory stress in vitro. Implantation of 3D&#8208;PHP nanoscaffolds loaded with bromodomain extraterminal inhibitor (BETi) into a rat nucleotomy disc injury model effectively suppressed inflammation in vivo, thus promoting restoration of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The resulting regeneration of disc tissue facilitated long&#8208;term pain reduction. Therefore, self&#8208;therapeutic and epigenetic modulator&#8208;encapsulated hybrid protein nanoscaffold shows great promise as a novel approach to restore dysregulated inflammatory signaling and treat degenerative fibrocartilaginous diseases, including disc injuries, providing hope and relief to patients worldwide.

         <title>High&#8208;Yield Synthesis of Sodium Chlorides of Unconventional Stoichiometries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis yield of 2D Na2Cl crystals with unconventional stoichiometries in a graphene membrane can be significantly improved by applying a negative potential. Such high content can substantially improve the physical performance of the abnormal Na2Cl crystals. These findings represent a step toward the potential applications of abnormal 2D crystal materials with unique properties.








Abstract
Abnormal salt crystals with unconventional stoichiometries, such as Na2Cl, Na3Cl, K2Cl, and CaCl crystals that have been explored in reduced graphene oxide membranes (rGOMs) or diamond anvil cells, hold great promise in applications due to their unique electronic, magnetic, and optical properties predicted in theory. However, the low content of these crystals, only &lt;1% in rGOM, limits their research interest and utility in applications. Here, a high&#8208;yield synthesis of 2D abnormal crystals with unconventional stoichiometries is reported, which is achieved by applying negative potential on rGOM. A more than tenfold increase in the abnormal Na2Cl crystals is obtained using a potential of &#8722;0.6&#160;V, resulting in an atomic content of 13.4&#160;&#177;&#160;4.7% for Na on rGOM. Direct observations by transmission electron microscopy and piezoresponse force microscopy demonstrates a unique piezoelectric behavior arising from 2D Na2Cl crystals with square structure. The output voltage increases from 0 to &#8776;180&#160;mV in the broad 0&#8211;150&#176; bending angle regime, which meets the voltage requirement of most nanodevices in realistic applications. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the applied negative potential of the graphene surface can strengthen the effect of the Na+&#8211;&#960; interaction and reduce the electrostatic repulsion between cations, making more Na2Cl crystals formed.

         <title>A Nano&#8208;Biohybrid&#8208;Based Bio&#8208;Solar Cell to Regulate the Electrical Signal Transmission to Living Cells for Biomedical Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nano&#8208;biohybrid&#8208;based bio&#8208;solar cell capable of absorbing a broad range of visible wavelengths and generating an amplified photocurrent density is developed to verify the possibility of its biomedical application. The electrophysiological signals of muscle cells at the neuromuscular junction are regulated precisely by motor neurons excited by the photocurrent of the bio&#8208;solar cell upon light irradiation.








Abstract
Bio&#8208;solar cells are studied as sustainable and biocompatible energy sources with significant potential for biomedical applications. However, they are composed of light&#8208;harvesting biomolecules with narrow absorption wavelengths and weak transient photocurrent generation. In this study, a nano&#8208;biohybrid&#8208;based bio&#8208;solar cell composed of bacteriorhodopsin, chlorophyllin, and Ni/TiO2 nanoparticles is developed to overcome the current limitations and verify the possibility of biomedical applications. Bacteriorhodopsin and chlorophyllin are introduced as light&#8208;harvesting biomolecules to broaden the absorption wavelength. As a photocatalyst, Ni/TiO2 nanoparticles are introduced to generate a photocurrent and amplify the photocurrent generated by the biomolecules. The developed bio&#8208;solar cell absorbs a broad range of visible wavelengths and generates an amplified stationary photocurrent density (152.6&#160;nA&#160;cm&#8722;2) with a long lifetime (up to 1&#160;month). Besides, the electrophysiological signals of muscle cells at neuromuscular junctions are precisely regulated by motor neurons excited by the photocurrent of the bio&#8208;solar cell, indicating that the bio&#8208;solar cell can control living cells by signal transmission through other types of living cells. The proposed nano&#8208;biohybrid&#8208;based bio&#8208;solar cell can be used as a sustainable and biocompatible energy source for the development of wearable and implantable biodevices and bioelectronic medicines for humans.

         <title>Inhabiting Inactive Transition by Coupling Function of Oxygen Vacancies and Fe&#9472;C Bonds achieving Long Cycle Life of an Iron&#8208;Based Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coupling effect of oxygen vacancies and Fe&#9472;C bonds increases the reaction energy barrier and restrains the irreversible structure reconstruction from FeOOH to &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3, endowing an Fe@Fe3O4(v)@Fe3C@C electrode with the coexistence of high capacity, excellent rate capability, and outstanding cycle stability.








Abstract
Fe&#8208;based battery&#8208;type anode materials with many faradaic reaction sites have higher capacities than carbon&#8208;based double&#8208;layer&#8208;type materials and can be used to develop aqueous supercapacitors with high energy density. However, as an insurmountable bottleneck, the severe capacity fading and poor cyclability derived from the inactive transition hinder their commercial application in asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). In this work, driven by the &#8220;oxygen pumping&#8221; mechanism, oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich Fe@Fe3O4(v)@Fe3C@C nanoparticles that consist of a unique &#8220;fruit with stone&#8221;&#8208;like structure are developed, and they exhibit enhanced specific capacity and fast charge/discharge capability. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the capacity attenuation in conventional iron&#8208;based anodes is greatly alleviated in the the Fe@Fe3O4(v)@Fe3C@C anode because the irreversible phase transition to the inactive &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 phase can be inhibited by a robust barrier formed by the coupling of oxygen vacancies and Fe&#9472;C bonds, which promotes cycle stability (93.5% capacity retention after 24&#160;000 cycles). An ASC fabricated using this Fe&#8208;based anode is also observed to have extraordinary durability, achieving capacity retention of 96.4% after 38&#160;000 cycles, and a high energy density of 127.6&#160;W&#160;h&#160;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 981&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Engineering and Characterization of an Artificial Drug&#8208;Carrying Vesicles Nanoplatform for Enhanced Specifically Targeted Therapy of Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>

ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@EAVs, which are constructed via a liposome extruder from HEK293T cells expressing ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1 peptides, can carry Doxorubicin (DOX) to penetrate blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and target inflamed brain tumors. It can improve the anticancer efficacy of DOX, significantly reducing side effects. Meanwhile, this work indicates that the nanoplatform may offer great promise for targeted glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) chemotherapy.








Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treatment is hindered by complex pathologies and the need to cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) during drug delivery. Although exosomes have great potential for GBM treatment, these alone cannot fully meet the therapeutic requirements, owing to their limitations in targeting and delivery. Herein, engineered artificial vesicles (EAVs), ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@EAVs, which are&#160;constructed using a liposome extruder from HEK293T cells expressing ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1 peptides, is developed. ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1 is a fusion peptide of Angiopep&#8208;2 fused to the N&#8208;terminus of TRP&#8208;PK1, to present Angiopep&#8208;2 on the EAVs. ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@EAVs have similar characteristics to the secreted exosomes, but a much higher yield. ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@EAVs have efficient BBB&#8208;penetration and GBM&#8208;targeting abilities in a mock BBB model in in vitro and orthotopic GBM mouse models in vivo. Doxorubicin loading EAVs (ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@DOX) do not alter the characteristics of the EAVs, which can cross the BBB, reach the GBM, and kill tumor cells in orthotopic GBM mouse models. These engineered drug&#8208;loaded artificial vesicles show better therapeutic effects on GBM than temozolomide in mice, with very few side effects. In conclusion, EAVs can be inserted into different targeting ligands and packed into different drugs, and they may serve as unique and efficient nanoplatforms for drug delivery and tumor promise therapy.

         <title>Photothermal&#8211;Magnetic Synergistic Effects in an Electrocatalyst for Efficient Water Splitting under Optical&#8211;Magnetic Fields</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the corresponding optical and magnetic design of Co3O4/CoFe2O4@NF, its resistance is reduced from 16 &#937; to 7&#160;&#937; under an optical&#8211;magnetic field (AM 1.5G, 100&#160;mT). Furthermore, spin polarization occurs inducing the parallel alignment of oxygen atoms and the formation of paramagnetic triplet oxygen, reducing the reaction energy barrier, and improving the kinetics of the OER reaction. The overpotential required to reach a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in the optical&#8211;magnetic field is only 172.4&#160;mV, achieving a &#916;&#951; of 76.51&#160;mV.








Abstract
The slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits water splitting, and external fields can help improve it. However, the effect of a single external field on the OER is limited and unsatisfactory. Furthermore, the mechanism by which external fields improve the OER is unclear, particularly in the presence of multiple fields. Herein, a strategy is proposed for enhancing the OER activity of a catalyst using the combined effect of an optical&#8211;magnetic field, and the mechanism of catalytic activity enhancement is studied. Under the optical&#8211;magnetic field, Co3O4 reduces the resistance by increasing the catalyst temperature. Meanwhile, CoFe2O4 further reduces the resistance via the negative magnetoresistance effect, thus decreasing the resistance from 16 to 7.0&#160;&#937;. Additionally, CoFe2O4 acts as a spin polarizer, and electron polarization results in a parallel arrangement of oxygen atoms, which increases the kinetics of the OER under the magnetic field. Benefiting from the optical and magnetic response design, Co3O4/CoFe2O4@Ni foam requires an overpotential of 172.4&#160;mV to reach a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 under an optical&#8211;magnetic field, which is significantly higher than those of recently reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Spin&#8208;State Modulation on Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual defect engineering strategy is developed to simultaneously create tensile strain and unsaturated coordination defects. These defects in a Ni&#8208;2,6&#8208;naphthalenedicarboxylic acid metal&#8211;organic framework (DD&#8208;Ni&#8208;NDA) are created to modulate the spin state of Ni active sites and further optimize the adsorption energy of OH* and OOH* intermediates for accelerating OER kinetics, ensuring fast OER kinetics and enhanced OER activity.








Abstract
Electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics are heavily correlated with hybridization of the transition metal d&#8208;orbital and oxygen intermediate p&#8208;orbital, which dictates the barriers of intermediate adsorption/desorption on the active sites of catalysts. Herein, a strategy is developed involving strain engineering and coordination regulation to enhance the hybridization of Ni 3d and O 2p orbitals, and the as&#8208;synthesized Ni&#8208;2,6&#8208;naphthalenedicarboxylic acid metal&#8211;organic framework (DD&#8208;Ni&#8208;NDA) nanosheets deliver a low OER overpotential of 260&#160;mV to reach 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. By integrating an alkaline anion exchange membrane electrolyzer and Pt/C electrode, 200 and 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 current densities are reached with cell voltages of 1.6 and 2.1&#160;V, respectively. When loaded on a BiVO4 photoanode, the nanosheet enables highly active solar&#8208;driven water oxygen. Structural characterizations together with theoretical calculations reveal that the spin state of the centre Ni atoms is regulated by the tensile strain and unsaturated coordination defects in DD&#8208;Ni&#8208;NDA, and such spin regulation facilitates spin&#8208;dependent charge transfer of the OER. Molecular orbital hybridization analysis reveals the mechanism of OH* and OOH* adsorption energy regulation by changes in the DD&#8208;Ni&#8208;NDA spin state, which provides a deeper understanding of the electronic structure design of catalysts for the OER.

These defects in a Ni-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid metal&#8211;organic framework (DD-Ni-NDA) are created to modulate the spin state of Ni active sites and further optimize the adsorption energy of OH* and OOH* intermediates for accelerating OER kinetics, ensuring fast OER kinetics and enhanced OER activity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics are heavily correlated with hybridization of the transition metal d-orbital and oxygen intermediate p-orbital, which dictates the barriers of intermediate adsorption/desorption on the active sites of catalysts. Herein, a strategy is developed involving strain engineering and coordination regulation to enhance the hybridization of Ni 3d and O 2p orbitals, and the as-synthesized Ni-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid metal&#8211;organic framework (DD-Ni-NDA) nanosheets deliver a low OER overpotential of 260&#160;mV to reach 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. By integrating an alkaline anion exchange membrane electrolyzer and Pt/C electrode, 200 and 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; current densities are reached with cell voltages of 1.6 and 2.1&#160;V, respectively. When loaded on a BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photoanode, the nanosheet enables highly active solar-driven water oxygen. Structural characterizations together with theoretical calculations reveal that the spin state of the centre Ni atoms is regulated by the tensile strain and unsaturated coordination defects in DD-Ni-NDA, and such spin regulation facilitates spin-dependent charge transfer of the OER. Molecular orbital hybridization analysis reveals the mechanism of OH* and OOH* adsorption energy regulation by changes in the DD-Ni-NDA spin state, which provides a deeper understanding of the electronic structure design of catalysts for the OER.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mold&#8208;Free Manufacturing of Highly Sensitive and Fast&#8208;Response Pressure Sensors Through High&#8208;Resolution 3D Printing and Conformal Oxidative Chemical Vapor Deposition Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paradigm&#8208;shifting mold&#8208;free manufacturing is demonstrated for high&#8208;sensitivity and ultrafast responsive sensors using sub&#8208;10&#160;&#181;m 3D&#8208;printing and conformal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymers. Much&#8208;enhanced sensing performance is achieved, compared to those manufactured with mold&#8208;based techniques, due to the high electrical conductivity of the sensing element, oxidative CVD&#160;poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene), and the benefits from the multiscale (from micrometer&#160;to millimeter) patterns.








Abstract
A new manufacturing paradigm is showcased to exclude conventional mold&#8208;dependent manufacturing of pressure sensors, which typically requires a series of complex and expensive patterning processes. This mold&#8208;free manufacturing leverages high&#8208;resolution 3D&#8208;printed multiscale microstructures as the substrate and a gas&#8208;phase conformal polymer coating technique to complete the mold&#8208;free sensing platform. The array of dome and spike structures with a controlled spike density of a 3D&#8208;printed substrate ensures a large contact surface with pressures applied and extended linearity in a wider pressure range. For uniform coating of sensing elements on the microstructured surface, oxidative chemical vapor deposition is employed to deposit a highly conformal and conductive sensing element, poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) at low temperatures (&lt;60&#160;&#176;C). The fabricated pressure sensor reacts sensitively to various ranges of pressures (up to 185&#160;kPa&#8722;1) depending on the density of the multiscale features and shows an ultrafast response time (&#8776;36&#160;&#181;s). The mechanism investigations through the finite element analysis identify the effect of the multiscale structure on the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit sensing performance. These unique findings are expected to be of significant relevance to technology that requires higher sensing capability, scalability, and facile adjustment of a sensor geometry in a cost&#8208;effective manufacturing manner.

         <title>Extreme Polarization Anisotropy in Resonant Third&#8208;Harmonic Generation from Aligned Carbon Nanotube Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macroscopic films of aligned and type&#8208;separated (semiconducting and metallic) carbon nanotubes are synthesized, and third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG) processes with extreme polarization anisotropy in the broad spectral range are studied, due to the 1D character of CNTs. The THG processes are enhanced by exciton resonance (S11, S22, and M11 excitons) in both films, revealing coupling between the excitons and nonlinear effects.








Abstract
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) possess extremely anisotropic electronic, thermal, and optical properties owing to their 1D character. While their linear optical properties have been extensively studied, nonlinear optical processes, such as harmonic generation for frequency conversion, remain largely unexplored in CNTs, particularly in macroscopic CNT assemblies. In this work, macroscopic films of aligned and type&#8208;separated (semiconducting and metallic) CNTs are synthesized and polarization&#8208;dependent third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG) from the films with fundamental wavelengths ranging from 1.5 to 2.5&#160;&#181;m is studied. Both films exhibited strongly wavelength&#8208;dependent, intense THG signals, enhanced through exciton resonances, and third&#8208;order nonlinear optical susceptibilities of 2.50&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;19&#160;m2&#160;V&#8722;2 (semiconducting CNTs) and 1.23&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;19&#160;m2&#160;V&#8722;2 (metallic CNTs), respectively are found, for 1.8&#160;&#181;m excitation. Further, through systematic polarization&#8208;dependent THG measurements, the values of all elements of the susceptibility tensor are determined, verifying the macroscopically 1D nature of the films. Finally, polarized THG imaging is performed to demonstrate the nonlinear anisotropy in the large&#8208;size CNT film with good alignment. These findings promise applications of aligned CNT films in mid&#8208;infrared frequency conversion, nonlinear optical switching, polarized pulsed lasers, polarized long&#8208;wave detection, and high&#8208;performance anisotropic nonlinear photonic devices.

         <title>Enhancing Photocatalytic&#8208;Transfer Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes Over Pd/C3N4 Through Dual Regulation of Nitrogen Defects and the Mott&#8211;Schottky Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Schottky catalyst&#160;of Pd nanoparticles supported on graphite&#8208;like C3N4 with nitrogen defects (Pd/DCN), &#160;containing a large number of cyano groups, is reported. The catalyst exhibits higher reactivity and selectivity in the selective transfer hydrogenation of alkynes under visible light.








Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of alkynes is an important reaction; however, the catalytic activity and selectivity in this reaction are generally conflicting. In this study, ultrafine Pd nanoparticles (NPs) loaded on a graphite&#8208;like C3N4 structure with nitrogen defects (Pd/DCN) are synthesized. The resulting Pd/DCN exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance in the transfer hydrogenation of alkynes with ammonia borane. The reaction rate and selectivity of Pd/DCN are superior to those of Pd/BCN (bulk C3N4 without nitrogen defects) under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The characterization results and density functional theory calculations show that the Mott&#8211;Schottky effect in Pd/DCN can change the electronic density of the Pd NPs, and thus enhances the hydrogenation selectivity toward phenylacetylene. After 1&#160;h, the hydrogenation selectivity of Pd/DCN reaches 95%, surpassing that of Pd/BCN (83%). Meanwhile, nitrogen defects in the supports improve the visible&#8208;light response and accelerate the transfer and separation of photogenerated charges to enhance the catalytic activity of Pd/DCN. Therefore, Pd/DCN exhibits higher efficiency under visible light, with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 2002 min&#8722;1. This TOF is five times that of Pd/DCN under dark conditions and 1.5 times that of Pd/BCN. This study provides new insights into the rational design of high&#8208;performance photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation catalysts.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Spectrum&#8211;Polarization Recombinant Optical Encryption with a Dielectric Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous&#8208;spectrum&#8211;polarization recombinant optical encryption with all&#8208;silicon metasurface is reported. The arbitrary and continuous combination of polarization and wavelength channels enables the dramatic increase of information capacity to 210 or more. The high transmittance and large operation bandwidth in mid&#8208;infrared further promise the high&#8208;capability encryption communication application in this indispensable atmosphere window.








Abstract
The Jones matrix, with eight degrees of freedom (DoFs), provides a general mathematical framework for the multifunctional design of metasurfaces. Theoretically, the maximum eight DoFs can be further extended in the spectrum dimension to endow unique encryption capabilities. However, the topology and intrinsic spectral responses of meta&#8208;atoms constrains the continuous engineering of polarization evolution over wavelength dimension. In this work, a forward evolution strategy to quickly establish the mapping relationships between the solutions of the dispersion Jones matrix and the spectral responses of meta&#8208;atoms is reported. Based on the eigenvector transformation method, arbitrary conjugate polarization channels over the continuous&#8208;spectrum dimension are successfully reconstructed. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a silicon metadevice is demonstrated for optical information encryption transmission. Remarkably, the arbitrary combination forms of polarization and wavelength dimension increase the information capacity (210), and the measured polarization contrasts of the conjugate polarization conversion are &gt;94% in the entire wavelength range (3&#8211;4&#160;&#181;m).

     alt="Continuous-Spectrum&#8211;Polarization Recombinant Optical Encryption with a Dielectric Metasurface"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous-spectrum&#8211;polarization recombinant optical encryption with all-silicon metasurface is reported. The arbitrary and continuous combination of polarization and wavelength channels enables the dramatic increase of information capacity to 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; or more. The high transmittance and large operation bandwidth in mid-infrared further promise the high-capability encryption communication application in this indispensable atmosphere window.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jones matrix, with eight degrees of freedom (DoFs), provides a general mathematical framework for the multifunctional design of metasurfaces. Theoretically, the maximum eight DoFs can be further extended in the spectrum dimension to endow unique encryption capabilities. However, the topology and intrinsic spectral responses of meta-atoms constrains the continuous engineering of polarization evolution over wavelength dimension. In this work, a forward evolution strategy to quickly establish the mapping relationships between the solutions of the dispersion Jones matrix and the spectral responses of meta-atoms is reported. Based on the eigenvector transformation method, arbitrary conjugate polarization channels over the continuous-spectrum dimension are successfully reconstructed. As a proof-of-concept, a silicon metadevice is demonstrated for optical information encryption transmission. Remarkably, the arbitrary combination forms of polarization and wavelength dimension increase the information capacity (2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;), and the measured polarization contrasts of the conjugate polarization conversion are &amp;gt;94% in the entire wavelength range (3&#8211;4&#160;&#181;m). It is believed that the proposed approach will benefit secure optical and quantum information technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Screen&#8208;printed flexible humidity sensors based on hexagonal tungsten oxide nanowires exhibit high sensitivity, good repeatability, and fast response in a wide relative humidity range, showing great potential in respiration rate monitoring, medicine packaging state monitoring, and non&#8208;contact measurements. Moreover, the sensitivity of the humidity sensors can be adjusted by altering the manufacturing parameters of the sensing layer and interdigital electrode.








Abstract
The utilization of printing techniques for the development of high&#8208;performance humidity sensors holds immense significance for various applications in the fields of the Internet of Things, agriculture, human healthcare, and storage environments. However, the long response time and low sensitivity of current printed humidity sensors limit their practical applications. Herein, a series of high&#8208;sensing&#8208;performance flexible resistive&#8208;type humidity sensors is fabricated by the screen&#8208;printing method, and hexagonal tungsten oxide (h&#8208;WO3) is employed as the humidity&#8208;sensing material due to its low cost, strong chemical adsorption ability, and excellent humidity&#8208;sensing ability. The as&#8208;prepared printed sensors exhibit high sensitivity, good repeatability, outstanding flexibility, low hysteresis, and fast response (1.5&#160;s) in a wide relative humidity (RH) range (11&#8211;95%&#160;RH). Furthermore, the sensitivity of humidity sensors can be easily adjusted by altering the manufacturing parameters of the sensing layer and interdigital electrode to meet the diverse requirements of specific applications. The printed flexible humidity sensors possess immense potential in various applications, including wearable devices, non&#8208;contact measurements, and packaging opening state monitoring.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Platelet Lysates Proteins into Microparticles by Unnatural Disulfide Bonds for Bottom&#8208;Up Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteins from human&#8208;derived platelet lysates (PLs) produce microparticles by forming unnatural disulfide bonds (&#8211;S&#8211;S&#8211;). In this study, protein&#8208;based microparticles are produced with defined surface topography and tunable size using a direct, simple, and low&#8208;cost methodology. These bioactive microstructures allow cell&#8208;guided microaggregates to form and have applications in bottom&#8208;up approaches.








Abstract
There is a demand to design microparticles holding surface topography while presenting inherent bioactive cues for applications in the biomedical and biotechnological fields. Using the pool of proteins present in human&#8208;derived platelet lysates (PLs), the production of protein&#8208;based microparticles via a simple and cost&#8208;effective method is reported, exploring the prone redox behavior of cysteine (Cy&#8208;SH) amino acid residues. The forced formation of new intermolecular disulfide bonds results in the precipitation of the proteins as spherical, pompom&#8208;like microparticles with adjustable sizes (15&#8211;50&#160;&#181;m in diameter) and surface topography consisting of grooves and ridges. These PL microparticles exhibit extraordinary cytocompatibility, allowing cell&#8208;guided microaggregates to form, while also working as injectable systems for cell support. Early studies also suggest that the surface topography provided by these PL microparticles can support osteogenic behavior. Consequently, these PL microparticles may find use to create live tissues via bottom&#8208;up procedures or injectable tissue&#8208;defect fillers, particularly for bone regeneration, with the prospect of working under xeno&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>An H2O&#8208;Initiated Crosslinking Strategy for Ultrafine&#8208;Nanoclusters&#8208;Reinforced High&#8208;Toughness Polymer&#8208;In&#8208;Plasticizer Solid Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel crosslinking strategy where metal&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;terminated polymers can be crosslinked by precisely controlling the content of H2O as an initiator is proposed. After incorporating a high concentration of plasticizers, the polymer&#8208;in&#8208;plasticizer solid electrolyte still maintains outstanding mechanical properties, thus demonstrating fast lithium&#8208;conduction kinetics and effective inhibition of lithium dendrites simultaneously.








Abstract
Incorporating plasticizers is an effective way to facilitate conduction of ions in solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). However, this conductivity enhancement often comes at the cost of reduced mechanical properties, which can make the electrolyte membrane more difficult to process and increase safety hazards. Here, a novel crosslinking strategy, wherein metal&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;terminated polymers can be crosslinked by precisely controlling the content of H2O as an initiator, is proposed. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, trimethylaluminum (TMA)&#8208;functionalized poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) is used to demonstrate that ultrafine Al&#8211;O nanoclusters can serve as nodes to crosslink PEO chains with a wide range of molecular weights from 10&#160;000 to 8&#160;000&#160;000&#160;g&#160;mol&#8722;1. The crosslinked polymer network can incorporate a high concentration of plasticizers, with a total weight percentage over 75%, while still maintaining excellent stretchability (4640%) and toughness (3.87&#160;&#215;&#160;104&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3). The resulting electrolyte demonstrates high ionic conductivity (1.41&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1), low interfacial resistance toward Li metal (48.1&#160;&#937;&#160;cm2), and a wide electrochemical window (&gt;4.8&#160;V vs Li+/Li) at 30&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, the LiFePO4/Li battery shows stable cycle performance with a capacity retention of 98.6% (146.3&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) over 1000 cycles at 1C (1C&#160;=&#160;170&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) at 30&#160;&#176;C.

The possibility of fabricating regenerated water&#8208;triggered shape&#8208;memory keratin fibers from wool and cellulose via wet&#8208;spinning in a more cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly manner is investigated.

Abstract
Biocompatible and biodegradable shape&#8208;memory polymers have gained popularity as smart materials, offering a wide range of applications and environmental benefits. Herein, the possibility of fabricating regenerated water&#8208;triggered shape&#8208;memory keratin fibers from wool and cellulose in a more effective and environmentally friendly manner is investigated. The regenerated keratin fibers exhibit comparable shape&#8208;memory performance to other hydration&#8208;responsive materials, with a shape&#8208;fixity ratio of 94.8&#160;&#177;&#160;2.15% and a shape&#8208;recovery rate of 81.4&#160;&#177;&#160;3.84%. Owing to their well&#8208;preserved secondary structure and cross&#8208;linking network, keratin fibers exhibit outstanding water&#8208;stability and wet stretchability, with a maximum tensile strain of 362&#160;&#177;&#160;15.9%. In this system, the reconfiguration of the protein secondary structure between &#945;&#8208;helix and &#946;&#8208;sheet is investigated as the fundamental actuation mechanism in response to hydration. This responsiveness is studied under force loading and unloading along the fiber axis. Hydrogen bonds act as the &#8220;switches&#8221; clicked by water molecules to trigger the shape&#8208;memory effect, while disulfide bonds and cellulose nanocrystals play the role of &#8220;net&#8208;points&#8221; to maintain the permanent shape of the material. Water&#8208;triggered shape&#8208;memory keratin fibers are manipulable and exhibit potential in the fabrication of textile actuators, which may be applied in smart apparel and programmable biomedical devices.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biocompatible and biodegradable shape-memory polymers have gained popularity as smart materials, offering a wide range of applications and environmental benefits. Herein, the possibility of fabricating regenerated water-triggered shape-memory keratin fibers from wool and cellulose in a more effective and environmentally friendly manner is investigated. The regenerated keratin fibers exhibit comparable shape-memory performance to other hydration-responsive materials, with a shape-fixity ratio of 94.8&#160;&#177;&#160;2.15% and a shape-recovery rate of 81.4&#160;&#177;&#160;3.84%. Owing to their well-preserved secondary structure and cross-linking network, keratin fibers exhibit outstanding water-stability and wet stretchability, with a maximum tensile strain of 362&#160;&#177;&#160;15.9%. In this system, the reconfiguration of the protein secondary structure between &#945;-helix and &#946;-sheet is investigated as the fundamental actuation mechanism in response to hydration. This responsiveness is studied under force loading and unloading along the fiber axis. Hydrogen bonds act as the &#8220;switches&#8221; clicked by water molecules to trigger the shape-memory effect, while disulfide bonds and cellulose nanocrystals play the role of &#8220;net-points&#8221; to maintain the permanent shape of the material. Water-triggered shape-memory keratin fibers are manipulable and exhibit potential in the fabrication of textile actuators, which may be applied in smart apparel and programmable biomedical devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Bioinspired Injectable, Adhesive, and Self&#8208;Healing Hydrogel with Dual Hybrid Network for Neural Regeneration after Spinal Cord Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hydrogel with a double&#8208;network architecture is created from dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)&#8208;grafted chitosan and a designer self&#8208;assembly peptide. Its strong tissue adhesion facilitates excellent integration in the host and demonstrates self&#8208;healing feature. The novel hydrogel demonstrates a strong capability of promoting exuberant neural regeneration after spinal cord injury and consequently promotes sensory and motor functions, particularly protecting the urinary system.








Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based regenerated scaffolds show promise as a platform for neural regeneration following spinal cord injury (SCI). Nevertheless, the persistent problem of poor mechanical strength and limited integration with the host tissue still exists. In this study, a bioinspired hydrogel with highly sophisticated features for neural regeneration after SCI is developed. The hydrogel is composed of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)&#8208;grafted chitosan and a designer peptide, offering a unique set of qualities such as being injectable, having self&#8208;healing abilities, and adhering to tissues. Compared to conventional hydrogels, this hydrogel ensures a significant promotion of immune response modulation and axon regrowth while featuring synapse formation of various neurotransmitters and myelin regeneration. Subsequently, functional recoveries are enhanced, including motor function, sensory function, and particularly bladder defect repair. These positive findings demonstrate that the hydrogel has great potential as a strategy for repairing SCI. Moreover, the versatility of this strategy goes beyond neural regeneration and holds promise for tissue regeneration in other contexts. Overall, this proposed hydrogel represents an innovative and multifaceted tool for engineering structures in the biomedical field.

         <title>A Polycrystalline Polymer Donor as Pre&#8208;Aggregate toward Ordered Molecular Aggregation for 19.3% Efficiency Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>

PM6 polycrystals are incubated through a vapor diffusion method and redissolved in chloroform to prepare PM6 pre&#8208;aggregates, which can increase the structural order of both the donors and the acceptors in photovoltaic blends upon solution casting, consequently delivering high performance for both thin and thick junction organic solar cells.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors are generally featured with low structure order in solid&#8208;state films, which leads to low charge&#8208;transport mobility and strong charge recombination in their photovoltaic devices. In this work, a &#8220;polycrystal&#8208;induced aggregation&#8221; strategy orders the polymer donor (PM6) and non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (L8&#8208;BO) molecules during solution casting with the assistance of PM6 polycrystals that are incubated through a vapor diffusion method, toward improved solar cell efficiency with either thin or thick photoactive layers. These PM6 polycrystals are redissolved in chloroform to prepare PM6 pre&#8208;aggregates (PM6&#8208;PA), and further incorporated into the conventional PM6:L8&#8208;BO blend solutions, which is found to prolong the molecular organization process and enhance the aggregation of both the PM6 and the L8&#8208;BO components. As the results, with the assistance of 10% PM6&#8208;PA, PM6:L8&#8208;BO solar cell devices obtain power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) from 18.0% and 16.2% to 19.3% and 17.2% with a 100 nm&#8208;thick and 300&#160;nm&#8208;thick photoactive layer, respectively.

A self&#8208;assembling dendrimer nanosystem is decorated with an antibody against programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) for delivering small interfering RNA to target 3&#8208;phosphoinositide&#8208;dependent protein kinase&#8208;1, generating simultaneous inhibition of glycolysis and programmed cell death 1 (PD&#8208;1)/PD&#8208;L1 interaction with blockage on tumor growth. This study highlights the potential of the dendrimer platform for elaborating combined and precision therapy.








Abstract
Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy affecting women, yet current therapeutic strategies remain ineffective for patients with late&#8208;stage or metastatic disease. Here an effective strategy is reported for treating metastatic breast cancer. Specifically, a self&#8208;assembling dendrimer nanosystem decorated with an antibody against programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) is established for delivering a small interfering RNA (siRNA) to target 3&#8208;phosphoinositide&#8208;dependent protein kinase&#8208;1 (PDK1), a kinase involved in cancer metabolism and metastasis. This nanosystem, named PPD, is designed to target PD&#8208;L1 for cancer&#8208;specific delivery of the siRNA to inhibit PDK1 and modulate cancer metabolism while promoting programmed cell death 1 (PD&#8208;1)/PD&#8208;L1 pathway&#8208;based immunotherapy. Indeed, PPD effectively generates simultaneous inhibition of PDK1&#8208;induced glycolysis and the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 pathway&#8208;related immune response, leading to potent inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis without any notable toxicity in tumor&#8208;bearing mouse models. Collectively, these results highlight the potential use of PPD as an effective and safe tumor&#8208;targeting therapy for breast cancer. This study constitutes a successful proof of principle exploiting the intrinsic features of the tumor microenvironment and metabolism alongside a unique self&#8208;assembling dendrimer platform to achieve specific tumor targeting and siRNA&#8208;based gene silencing in combined and precision cancer therapy.

         <title>Circular Reprocessing of Thermoset Polyurethane Foams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Foam&#8208;to&#8208;foam reprocessing of thermoset polyurethane is reported for circular recycling of polyurethane products. As carbamate exchange catalysts enable melt&#8208;reprocessing of thermoset polyurethanes, extrusion foaming and foam injection molding of polyurethane are demonstrated, and the potential scalability is assessed. The structure&#8211;processing&#8211;property relationship of the processes is investigated to achieve low&#8208;density foam with comparable mechanical properties to those of as&#8208;synthesized polyurethane foams.








Abstract
Thermoset polyurethane (PU) foams are widely used in industrial applications, but they cannot be recycled by conventional melt reprocessing because of their cross&#8208;linked structures. The introduction of carbamate exchange catalysts converts thermoset PU into covalent adaptable networks (CANs), which are amenable to reprocessing at elevated temperatures. However, this approach has produced solid PU films, which have fewer uses and lower commercial demand. In this work, simultaneous reprocessing and refoaming of thermoset PU foams is demonstrated by leveraging the melt&#8208;processability of PU CANs and allowing cell growth by gas generation in a twin&#8208;screw extruder. The optimal operating temperature of the refoaming process is determined through chemical, thermal, and structural analysis of PU foam extrudates. The foam&#8208;to&#8208;foam extrusion process produces controllable, continuous, and uniform foam structures, as characterized by cell diameter and cell number density. Low&#8208;density PU foams are obtained through a process simulating injection molding. The compression properties of reprocessed PU foam are compared with as&#8208;synthesized PU foam to demonstrate efficacy of the refoaming processes. These results demonstrate that PU foams can be prepared through recycling while maintaining microstructural and chemical integrity. In the future, this strategy may be applied to thermoset PU foams of various chemical compositions and shows promise for scalability.

         <title>2D&#8208;Layer&#8208;Structure Bi to Quasi&#8208;1D&#8208;Structure NiBi3: Structural Dimensionality Reduction to Superior Sodium and Potassium Ion Storage</title>

A structural dimensionality reduction strategy is proposed and developed by converting 2D&#8208;layer&#8208;structured Bi into a quasi&#8208;1D structured NiBi3 to improve the reaction kinetics and cycling stability for Na/K&#8208;ion storage. As a proof of concept, the quasi&#8208;1D NiBi3 with metallic conductivity and 3D Na/K&#8208;ion diffusion pathways delivers high&#8208;rate capability and superior cycling performance for Na/K storage.








Abstract
Layer&#8208;structured bismuth (Bi) is an attractive anode for Na&#8208;ion and K&#8208;ion batteries due to its large volumetric capacity and suitable redox potentials. However, the cycling stability and rate capability of the Bi anode are restricted by the large volume expansion and sluggish Na/K&#8208;storage kinetics. Herein, a structural dimensionality reduction strategy is proposed and developed by converting&#160;2D&#8208;layer&#8208;structured Bi into a quasi&#8208;1D structured NiBi3 with enhanced reaction kinetics and reversibility to realize high&#8208;rate and stable cycling performance for Na/K&#8208;ion storage. As a proof of concept, the quasi&#8208;1D intermetallic NiBi3 with low formation energy, metallic conductivity, and 3D Na/K&#8208;ion diffusion pathways delivers outstanding capacity retention of 94.1% (332 mAh g&#8722;1) after 15&#160;000 cycles for Na&#8208;ion storage, and high initial coulombic efficiency of 93.4% with improved capacity retention for K&#8208;ion storage. Moreover, investigations on the highly reversible Na/K&#8208;storage reaction mechanisms and cycling&#8208;driven morphology reconstruction further reveal the origins of the high reversibility and the accommodation to volume expansion. The finding of this work provides a new strategy for high&#8208;performance anode design by structural dimensionality manipulation and cycling&#8208;driven morphology reconstruction.

         <title>2D Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Embedded with Iodine for High&#8208;Performance Ammonium&#8208;Ion Hybrid Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework embedded with iodine (Cu&#8208;HHB/I2) is demonstrated as an electroactive cathode material for advanced NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors. Benefiting from excellent electrical conductivity, abundant Cu&#9472;O4 species, and adsorbed iodide at the Cu sites of the Cu&#8208;HHB/I2, an assembled NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors deliver a superior energy density (31.5 mWh cm&#8722;2) and record&#8208;long cycling lifetime (89.5% after 10&#160;000 cycles).








Abstract
Ammonium ions (NH4+) are emerging non&#8208;metallic charge carriers for advanced electrochemical energy storage devices, due to their low cost, elemental abundance, and environmental benignity. However, finding suitable electrode materials to achieve rapid diffusion kinetics for NH4+ storage remains a great challenge. Herein, a 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) for immobilizing iodine, as a high&#8208;performance cathode material for NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors, is reported. Cu&#8208;HHB (HHB = hexahydroxybenzene) MOF embedded with iodine (Cu&#8208;HHB/I2) features excellent electrical conductivity, highly porous structure, and rich accessible active sites of copper&#8208;bis(dihydroxy) (Cu&#9472;O4) and iodide species, resulting in a remarkable areal capacitance of 111.7 mF cm&#8722;2 at 0.4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that the Cu&#9472;O4 species in Cu&#8208;HHB play a critical role in binding polyiodide and suppressing its dissolution, as well as contributing to a large pseudocapacitance with adsorbed iodide. In combination with a porous MXene anode, the full NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors deliver an excellent energy density of 31.5 mWh cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term cycling stability with 89.5% capacitance retention after 10&#160;000 cycles, superior to those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors. This study sheds light on the material design for NH4+ storage, enabling the development of novel high&#8208;performance energy storage devices.

         <title>Power&#8208;Efficient Multisensory Reservoir Computing Based on Zr&#8208;Doped HfO2 Memcapacitive Synapse Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A memcapacitive&#8208;synapse&#8208;based physical reservoir computing (RC) system is reported. The device's intrinsic property matches the dynamics of multisensory information processing. A touchless user interface (TUI) for a virtual shopping system is demonstrated, benefitting from the robustness and versatility of such a device, which is of profound implication for energy&#8208;efficient human&#8722;computer interface and edge computing apparatus.








Abstract
Hardware implementation tailored to requirements in reservoir computing would facilitate lightweight and powerful temporal processing. Capacitive reservoirs would boost power efficiency due to their ultralow static power consumption but have not been experimentally exploited yet. Here, this work&#160;reports an oxide&#8208;based memcapacitive synapse (OMC) based on Zr&#8208;doped HfO2 (HZO) for a power&#8208;efficient and multisensory processing reservoir computing system. The nonlinearity and state richness required for reservoir computing could originate from the capacitively coupled polarization switching and charge trapping of hafnium&#8208;oxide&#8208;based devices. The power consumption (&#8776;113.4 fJ per spike) and temporal processing versatility outperform most resistive reservoirs. This&#160;system is verified by common benchmark tasks, and it exhibits high accuracy (&gt;94%) in recognizing multisensory information, including acoustic, electrophysiological, and mechanic modalities. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a touchless user interface for virtual shopping based on the&#160;OMC&#8208;based reservoir computing system is demonstrated, benefiting from its interference&#8208;robust acoustic and electrophysiological perception. These&#160;results shed light on the development of highly power&#8208;efficient human&#8211;machine interfaces and machine&#8208;learning platforms.

         <title>Generation of Terahertz Radiation via the Transverse Thermoelectric Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intense terahertz radiation generation via the transverse thermoelectric effect in layered conducting transition metal oxides is demonstrated . Ultrafast out&#8208;of&#8208;plane temperature gradients, induced by femtosecond laser pulses on thin films grown on off&#8208;cut substrates, launch in&#8208;plane thermoelectric currents leading to efficient THz emission. This approach offers a simple and promising avenue for versatile THz sources and integrable emitter elements.








Abstract
Terahertz (THz) radiation is a powerful tool with widespread applications ranging from imaging, sensing, and broadband communications to spectroscopy and nonlinear control of materials. Future progress in THz technology depends on the development of efficient, structurally simple THz emitters that can be implemented in advanced miniaturized devices. Here, it is shown how the natural electronic anisotropy of layered conducting transition metal oxides enables the generation of intense terahertz radiation via the transverse thermoelectric effect. In thin films grown on off&#8208;cut substrates, femtosecond laser pulses generate ultrafast out&#8208;of&#8208;plane temperature gradients, which in turn launch in&#8208;plane thermoelectric currents, thus allowing efficient emission of the resulting THz field out of the film structure. This scheme is demonstrated in experiments on thin films of the layered metals PdCoO2 and La1.84Sr0.16CuO4, and model calculations that elucidate the influence of the material parameters on the intensity and spectral characteristics of the emitted THz field are presented. Due to its simplicity, the method opens up a promising avenue for the development of highly versatile THz sources and integrable emitter elements.

         <title>Photoinduced Mechanical Cloaking of Diarylethene&#8208;Crosslinked Microgels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical cloaking in microgels: a diarylethene photoswitch is introduced as a co&#8208;crosslinker into PVCL microgels. Light&#8208;induced photoswitching of the diaryethene results in a phase&#8208;transition shift and thus changes the swelling status of microgels at a fixed temperature, rendering them differently reactive to mechanical force.








Abstract
The serial connection of multiple stimuli&#8208;responses in polymer architectures enables the logically conjunctive gating of functional material processes on demand. Here, a photoswitchable diarylethene (DAE) acts as a crosslinker in poly(N&#8208;vinylcaprolactam) microgels and allows the light&#8208;induced shift of the volume phase&#8208;transition temperature (VPTT). While swollen microgels below the VPTT are susceptible to force and undergo breakage&#8211;aggregation processes, collapsed microgels above the VPTT stay intact in mechanical fields induced by ultrasonication. Within a VPTT shift regime, photoswitching of the DAE transfers microgels from the swollen to the collapsed state and thereby gates their response to force as demonstrated by the light&#8208;gated activation of an embedded fluorogenic mechanophore. This photoinduced mechanical cloaking system operates on the polymer topology level and is thereby principally universally applicable.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Based Selective Emitters for Thermophotovoltaic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The superior oxidation resistance of Ir, having a low Gibbs energy of oxide formation, in an Ir/HfO2&#8208;based selective emitter at 1000&#160;&#176;C over 100&#160;h at 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6&#160;mbar is demonstrated in comparison to refractory W, in a W/HfO2 selective emitter. 6 layers of Ir are stable after annealing, whereas W layers vanish due to oxidation and sublimation.








Abstract
The long&#8208;term operation of refractory&#8208;metal&#8208;based metamaterials is crucial for applications such as thermophotovoltaics. The metamaterials based on refractory metals like W, Mo, Ta, Nb, and Re fail primarily by oxidation. Here, the use of the noble metal Ir is proposed, which is stable to oxidation and has optical properties comparable to gold. The thermal endurance of Ir in a 3&#8208;layer&#8208;system, consisting of HfO2/Ir/HfO2, by performing annealing experiments up to 1240&#160;&#176;C in a pressure range from 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6&#160;mbar to 1&#160;bar, is demonstrated. The Ir layer shows no oxidation in a vacuum and inert gas atmosphere. At temperatures above 1100&#160;&#176;C, the Ir layer starts to agglomerate due to the degradation of the confining HfO2 layers. An in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction experimental comparison between 1D multilayered Ir/HfO2 and W/HfO2 selective emitters annealed at 1000&#160;&#176;C, 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6&#160;mbar, over 100&#160;h, confirms oxidation stability of Ir while W multilayers gradually disappear. The results of this work show that W&#8208;based metamaterials are not long&#8208;term stable even at 1000&#160;&#176;C. However, the oxidation resistance of Ir can be leveraged for refractory plasmonic metamaterials, such as selective emitters in thermophotovoltaic systems with strong suppression of long wavelength radiation.

         <title>Customized Microenvironments Spontaneously Facilitate Coupled Engineering of Real&#8208;Life Large&#8208;Scale Clean Water Capture and Pollution Remediation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;one&#8208;stone&#8211;two&#8208;birds&#8221; strategy for the large&#8208;scale production of drinking water directly from contaminated seawater is proposed. The strategy is based on a novel coupling perspective (parallel reaction space) to achieve photocatalytic degradation of pollutants while capturing clean water. It is demonstrated that this evaporator (CCMs&#8208;x) is widely adaptable and persistent to multiple real&#8208;life scenarios with excellent scalability. This work makes it crucial to elucidate the photocatalytic mechanism and gain insight into the performance of catalytic materials at the microscopic level.








Abstract
Harnessing abundant renewable resources and pollutants on a large scale to address environmental challenges, while providing sustainable freshwater, is a significant endeavour. This study presents the design of fully functional solar vaporization devices (SVD) based on organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanocomposites (CCMs&#8208;x). These devices exhibit efficient photothermal properties that facilitate multitargeted interfacial reactions, enabling simultaneous catalysis of sewage and desalination. The localized interfacial heating generated by the photothermal effect of CCMs&#8208;x triggers surface&#8208;dominated catalysis and steam generation. The CCMs&#8208;x SVD achieves a solar water&#8208;vapor generation rate of 1.41&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 (90.8%), and it achieves over 95% removal of pollutants within 60&#160;min under one&#8208;sun for practical application. The exceptional photothermal conversion rate of wastewater for environmental remediation and water capture is attributed to customized microenvironments within the system. The integrated parallel reaction system in SVD ensures it is a real&#8208;life application in multiple scenarios such as municipal/medical wastewater and brine containing high concentrations. Additionally, the SVD exhibits long&#8208;term durability, antifouling functionality toward complex ionic contaminants. This study not only demonstrates a one&#8208;stone&#8211;two&#8208;birds strategy for large&#8208;scale direct production of potable water from polluted seawater, but also opens up exciting possibilities for parallel production of energy and water resources.

         <title>Giant Atomic Swirl in Graphene Bilayers with Biaxial Heterostrain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biaxial heterostrain in bilayer graphene leads to a new atomic lattice relaxation to minimize the stacking energy. Elastic energy is stored in solitons hosting topological states. This demonstrates that heterostrain can be an additional tuning parameter in moir&#233; materials opening new possibilities for moir&#233; engineering.








Abstract
The study of moir&#233; engineering started with the advent of van der Waals heterostructures, in which stacking 2D layers with different lattice constants leads to a moir&#233; pattern controlling their electronic properties. The field entered a new era when it&#160;was&#160;found that adjusting the twist between two graphene layers led to strongly&#8208;correlated&#8208;electron physics and topological effects associated with atomic relaxation. A twist is now routinely used to adjust the properties of 2D materials. This study investigates a new type of moir&#233; superlattice in bilayer graphene when one layer is biaxially strained with respect to the other&#8212;so&#8208;called biaxial heterostrain. Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements uncover spiraling electronic states associated with a novel symmetry&#8208;breaking atomic reconstruction at small biaxial heterostrain. Atomistic calculations using experimental parameters as inputs reveal that a giant atomic swirl forms around regions of aligned stacking to reduce the mechanical energy of the bilayer. Tight&#8208;binding calculations performed on the relaxed structure show that the observed electronic states decorate spiraling domain wall solitons as required by topology. This study establishes biaxial heterostrain as an important parameter to be harnessed for the next step of moir&#233; engineering in van der Waals&#160;multilayers.

         <dc:description>
The well&#8208;known concentration quenching phenomenon is intrinsically suppressed in sensitized luminescent systems by exploiting the competitive relationship between light emitters and quenchers in trapping excitation energies from sensitizers, thereby unlocking the full potential of sensitization strategy in enhancing photoexcitation efficiency of doped luminescent materials and providing a new approach to achieve high&#8208;purity sensitized luminescence.

The brightness of doped luminescent materials is usually limited by the ubiquitous concentration quenching phenomenon resulting in an intractable tradeoff between internal quantum efficiency and excitation efficiency. Here, an intrinsic suppression of concentration quenching in sensitized luminescent systems, by exploiting the competitive relationship between light emitters and quenchers in trapping excitation energies from sensitizers, is reported. Although Cr3+ sensitizers and trivalent lanthanide (Ln3+, Ln = Yb, Nd, and Er) emitters themselves are highly susceptible to concentration quenching, the unprecedentedly high&#8208;brightness luminescence of Cr3+&#8211;Ln3+ systems is demonstrated in the short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) range employing high concentrations of Cr3+, whereby a record photoelectric efficiency of 23% is achieved for SWIR phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes, which is about twice as high as those previously reported. The results underscore the beneficial role of emitters in terminating excitation energies, opening up a new dimension for developing efficient sensitized luminescent materials.

         <title>Tuning the Organ Tropism of Polymersome for Spleen&#8208;Selective Nanovaccine Delivery to Boost Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>

A well&#8208;designed polymersome library reveals specific organ selectivity to the liver and spleen. With the advanced tailoring of splenic immune responses, spleen targeting nanovaccine can effectively inhibit tumor growth and metastasis.








Abstract
The past few decades have witnessed explosive development in drug delivery systems. However, in vivo delivery suffers from non&#8208;specific distribution in non&#8208;targeted organs or tissues, which may cause undesired side effects and even genotoxicity. Here, a general strategy that enables tuning the tropism of polymersomes for liver&#8208; and spleen&#8208;selective delivery is reported. By using a library screening approach, spleen&#8208;targeted polymersome PH9&#8208;Aln&#8208;8020 and liver&#8208;targeted polymersome PA9&#8208;ZP3&#8208;5050 are identified accordingly. Meanwhile, the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence imaging allows for in vivo dynamic evaluation of their spatial and temporal accumulation in specific tissues. O ur findings indicate that both polymer composition and protein corona on the surface are essential to determine the in vivo fate of polymersomes and tendency for specific organs. Importantly, PH9&#8208;Aln&#8208;8020 is employed as a systemic nanocarrier to co&#8208;deliver the antigen and adjuvant, which remarkably boost splenic immune responses in acute myeloid leukemia, melanoma, and melanoma lung metastasis mouse models. This study may open a new frontier for polymersomes in organ&#8208;selective delivery and other biomedical applications.

         <title>Modulating the d&#8208;Band Center Enables Ultrafine Pt3Fe Alloy Nanoparticles for pH&#8208;Universal Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activated N&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon spheres supported&#160;ultrafine Pt3Fe alloy nanoparticles (Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A), as a highly&#8208;efficient electrocatalyst for pH&#8208;universal HER, are reported. Owing to the strong Pt 5d&#8211;Fe 3d orbital electronic interactions that intentionally modulate the d&#8208;band center of Pt 5d orbital, both the required energy barrier for H2O dissociation and adsorption energy for H* intermediates are reduced, thereby resulting in the enhanced HER activities of Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A in acidic, alkaline, and neutral conditions.








Abstract
By providing dual active sites to synergistically accelerate H2O dissociation and H+ reduction, ordered intermetallic alloys usually show extraordinary performance for pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, activated N&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon spheres supported intermetallic Pt3Fe alloys (Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A), as a highly&#8208;efficient electrocatalyst for pH&#8208;universal HER, are reported. The Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A exhibits low overpotentials (&#951;10) of 13, 29, and 48&#160;mV to deliver 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;m&#160;H2SO4, 1.0&#160;m&#160;KOH, and 1.0&#160;m phosphate buffered solution (PBS), respectively, as well as robust stability to maintain the overall catalytic performances. Theoretical studies reveal that the strong Pt 5d&#8211;Fe 3d orbital electronic interactions negatively shift the d&#8208;band center (&#949;d) of Pt 5d orbital, resulting in reduced H* adsorption energy of Pt sites and enhanced acidic HER activity. With Pt and Fe acting as co&#8208;adsorption sites for H* and *OH intermediates, respectively, a low energy barrier is required for Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A to dissociate H2O to afford H* intermediates, which greatly promotes the H* adsorption and H2 formation in alkaline and neutral conditions. The synthetic strategy is further extended to the synthesis of Pt3Co and Pt3Ni alloys with excellent HER activity in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes, demonstrating the great potential of these Pt&#8208;based alloys for practical applications.

         <title>A Bifunctional Catalyst for Green Ammonia Synthesis from Ubiquitous Air and Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional catalyst of CuCo2O4/Ni applying to plasma&#8208;electrocatalytic synthesis of NH3 from air and water is proposed, with which a record&#8208;high NH3 yield rate of 145.8&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and excellent FE of 96.8% can be obtained. Moreover, the reaction system is enlarged and the generated NH3 precipitates into MgNH4PO4&#183;6H2O solid to promote the practical application.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is essential for modern agriculture and industry, and, due to its high hydrogen density and no carbon emission, it is also expected to be the next&#8208;generation of &#8220;clean&#8221; energy carrier. Herein, directly from air and water, a plasma&#8208;electrocatalytic reaction system for NH3 production, which combines two steps of plasma&#8208;air&#8208;to&#8208;NOx&#8722; and electrochemical NOx&#8722; reduction reaction (eNOxRR) with a bifunctional catalyst, is successfully established. Especially, the bifunctional catalyst of CuCo2O4/Ni can simultaneously promote plasma&#8208;air&#8208;to&#8208;NOx&#8722; and eNOxRR processes. The easy adsorption and activation of O2 by CuCo2O4/Ni greatly improve the NOx&#8722; production rate at the first step. Further, CuCo2O4/Ni can also resolve the overbonding of the key intermediate of *NO, and thus reduce the energy barrier of the second step of eNOxRR. Finally, the &#8220;green&#8221; NH3 production achieves excellent FENH3 (96.8%) and record&#8208;high NH3 yield rate of 145.8&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 with large partial current density (1384.7&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2). Moreover, an enlarged self&#8208;made H&#8208;type electrolyzer improves the NH3 yield to 3.6&#160;g&#160;h&#8722;1, and the obtained NH3 is then rapidly converted to a solid of magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate, which favors the easy storage and transportation of NH3.

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Balanced Intra&#8208; and Interchain Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Polymers: Beyond 30% External Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer&#8208;featured non&#8208;conjugated polymers with largely enhanced thermally activated delayed fluorescence performance are demonstrated, in which a secondary phosphine oxide acceptor is introduced to balance intra&#8208; and interchain charge transfer for radiation facilitation and non&#8208;radiation suppression, resulting in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoluminescence and electroluminescence quantum efficiencies beyond 95% and 30%, respectively.








Abstract
Through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) is crucial for developing highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence polymers. The balance of intra&#8208; and interchain TSCT can markedly improve performance, but it is still a big challenge. In this work, an effective strategy for &#8220;intra&#8208; and interchain TSCT balance&#8221; is demonstrated by way of a series of non&#8208;conjugated copolymers containing a 9,9&#8208;dimethylacridine donor and triazine&#8208;phosphine oxide (PO)&#8208;based acceptors. Steady&#8208;state and transient emission spectra indicate that compared to the corresponding blends, the copolymers can indeed achieve balanced intra&#8208; and interchain TSCT by accurately optimizing the inductive and steric effects of the acceptors. The DPOT acceptor with the strongest electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and the second bigger steric hindrance endows its copolymers with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoluminescence and electroluminescence quantum efficiencies beyond 95% and 32%, respectively. This demonstrates that, compared to other congeners, the synergistic inductive and steric effects effectively enhance TSCT in DPOT&#8208;based copolymers for radiation, and suppress singlet and triplet quenching. The record&#8208;high efficiencies of its devices make this kind of copolymers hold the potential for low&#8208;cost, large&#8208;scale, and high&#8208;efficiency applications.

         <title>Reversible Crosslinking of Commodity Polymers via Photocontrolled Metal&#8211;Ligand Coordination for High&#8208;Performance and Recyclable Thermoset Plastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recyclable thermoset plastics are prepared using a commodity polyacrylonitrile and reversible crosslinker via reversible metal&#8211;ligand coordination. The thermosets are mechanically robust, and they are recyclable via reversible coordination upon light irradiation in a solvent and heating. This reversible coordination method enables the preparation of recyclable materials using other commodity polymers and polymer composites. The thermosets can be recycled from plastic waste.








Abstract
Thermoset plastics, highly desired for their stability, durability, and chemical resistance, are currently consumed in over 60 million tons annually across the globe, but they are difficult to recycle due to their crosslinked structures. The development of recyclable thermoset plastics is an important but challenging task. In this work, recyclable thermoset plastics are prepared by crosslinking a commodity polymer, polyacrylonitrile (PAN), with a small percentage of a Ru complex via nitrile&#8211;Ru coordination. PAN is obtained from industry and the Ru complex is synthesized in one step, which enables the production of recyclable thermoset plastics in an efficient way. In addition, the thermoset plastics exhibit impressive mechanical performance, boasting a Young's modulus of 6.3&#160;GPa and a tensile strength of 109.8&#160;MPa. Moreover, they can be de&#8208;crosslinked when exposed to both light and a solvent and can then be re&#8208;crosslinked upon heating. This reversible crosslinking mechanism enables the recycling of thermosets from a mixture of plastic waste. The preparation of recyclable thermosets from other commodity polymers such as poly(styrene&#8208;coacrylonitrile) (SAN) resins and polymer composites through reversible crosslinking is also demonstrated. This study shows that reversible crosslinking via metal&#8211;ligand coordination is a new strategy for designing recyclable thermosets using commodity polymers.

Hydrogel Soft Actuators
Hydrogel&#8208;based soft actuators can operate in sensitive environments, bridging the gap between rigid machines interacting with soft matter. In article number 2302816, Rainer Adelung, Fabian Sch&#252;tt, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that the incorporation of a bioinspired microtube graphene network into a PNIPAM matrix dramatically enhances actuation performance, thereby overcoming water&#8208;transport limitations in hydrogel soft actuators while providing options for both light&#8208; and electrically&#8208;controlled actuation.

Mechanical Microgel Cloaking
Concepts to control mechanical polymer degradation on demand are one possible pathway toward a sustainable polymer future. In article 2305845, Robert G&#246;stl and co&#8208;workers gate the mechanochemical degradation of microgels as prototypical material platform by light. The observed mechanical cloaking effect is caused by a photoinduced phase transition, hence operates on the polymer topology level, and might be universally applicable.

Resistive Switching
In article number 2302979, Wen&#8208;Wei Wu and co&#8208;workers systematically investigate the resistive&#8208;switching performance and mechanisms of high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO)&#8208;based memristors. The SET/RESET behavior is induced by the migration of oxygen ions, leading to a structural transformation between spinel and rock salt. This novel high&#8208;performance resistive random&#8208;access memory (RRAM) device paves a new avenue toward memristors and holds great potential for various applications.

         <title>Advances in In Vitro Models of Neuromuscular Junction: Focusing on Organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip, Organoids, and Biohybrid Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the advances in in vitro neuromuscular junction models with 2D and 3D cultures, from organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip and organoids to biohybrid robots, and introduces the related derivative techniques for functional analysis and stimulus methods, their application as disease models and for drug screening, and prospects for their future development and related challenges.








Abstract
The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a peripheral synaptic connection between presynaptic motor neurons and postsynaptic skeletal muscle fibers that enables muscle contraction and voluntary motor movement. Many traumatic, neurodegenerative, and neuroimmunological diseases are classically believed to mainly affect either the neuronal or the muscle side of the NMJ, and treatment options are lacking. Recent advances in novel techniques have helped develop in vitro physiological and pathophysiological models of the NMJ as well as enable precise control and evaluation of its functions. This paper reviews the recent developments in in vitro NMJ models with 2D or 3D cultures, from organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip and organoids to biohybrid robotics. Related derivative techniques are introduced for functional analysis of the NMJ, such as the patch&#8208;clamp technique, microelectrode arrays, calcium imaging, and stimulus methods, particularly optogenetic&#8208;mediated light stimulation, microelectrode&#8208;mediated electrical stimulation, and biochemical stimulation. Finally, the applications of the in vitro NMJ models as disease models or for drug screening related to suitable neuromuscular diseases are summarized and their future development trends and challenges are discussed.

         <title>Patterning Quantum Dots via Photolithography: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum dots (QDs) are used as promising materials for next&#8208;generation displays due to their excellent electrical/optical properties. Strategies for patterning QDs via photolithography (conventional photolithography, lift off process, and direct photolithography) are comprehensively reviewed. This review also discusses the prospects for patterned QDs in terms of their structural and physical properties.








Abstract
Pixelating patterns of red, green, and blue quantum dots (QDs) is a critical challenge for realizing high&#8208;end displays with bright and vivid images for virtual, augmented, and mixed reality. Since QDs must be processed from a solution, their patterning process is completely different from the conventional techniques used in the organic light&#8208;emitting diode and liquid crystal display industries. Although innovative QD patterning technologies are being developed, photopatterning based on the light&#8208;induced chemical conversion of QD films is considered one of the most promising methods for forming micrometer&#8208;scale QD patterns that satisfy the precision and fidelity required for commercialization. Moreover, the practical impact will be significant as it directly exploits mature photolithography technologies and facilities that are widely available in the semiconductor industry. This article reviews recent progress in the effort to form QD patterns via photolithography. The review begins with a general description of the photolithography process. Subsequently, different types of photolithographical methods applicable to QD patterning are introduced, followed by recent achievements using these methods in forming high&#8208;resolution QD patterns. The paper also discusses prospects for future research directions.

     alt="Patterning Quantum Dots via Photolithography: A Review"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantum dots (QDs) are used as promising materials for next-generation displays due to their excellent electrical/optical properties. Strategies for patterning QDs via photolithography (conventional photolithography, lift off process, and direct photolithography) are comprehensively reviewed. This review also discusses the prospects for patterned QDs in terms of their structural and physical properties.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Deficient Bioceramics: Combination of Diagnosis, Therapy, and Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fourth generation of bioceramics called colored/oxygen&#8208;deficient for biomedical applications are introduced in this review. The importance of this class of bioceramics can be defined through multifunctionality since they are regarded as the connection between the past and future. The microstructure, applications, potential challenges, future trends, and perspectives are discussed in detail.








Abstract
The journey of ceramics in medicine has been synchronized with an evolution from the first generation&#8212;alumina, zirconia, etc.&#8212;to the third &#8212;3D scaffolds. There is an up&#8208;and&#8208;coming member called oxygen&#8208;deficient or colored bioceramics, which have recently found their way through biomedical applications. The oxygen vacancy steers the light absorption toward visible and near infrared regions, making the colored bioceramics multifunctional&#8212;therapeutic, diagnostic, and regenerative. Oxygen&#8208;deficient bioceramics are capable of turning light into heat and reactive oxygen species for photothermal and photodynamic therapies, respectively, and concomitantly yield infrared and photoacoustic images. Different types of oxygen&#8208;deficient bioceramics have been recently developed through various synthesis routes. Some of them like TiO2&#8722;x, MoO3&#8722;x, and WOx have been more investigated for biomedical applications, whereas the rest have yet to be scrutinized. The most prominent advantage of these bioceramics over the other biomaterials is their multifunctionality endowed with a change in the microstructure. There are some challenges ahead of this category discussed at the end of the present review. By shedding light on this recently born bioceramics subcategory, it is believed that the field will undergo a big step further as these platforms are naturally multifunctional.

         <title>Mechanical Signal&#8208;Tailored Hydrogel Microspheres Recruit and Train Stem Cells for Precise Differentiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposed an enhanced endogenous regeneration strategy to direct stem cell differentiation via mechanotransduction. Microfluidic hydrogel microspheres with the independently tunable elastic modulus and ECM ligand density are fabricated and demonstrated to recruit intervertebral disc progenitor/stem cells and train them to differentiate into nucleus pulposus&#8208;like cells for repairing intervertebral disc degeneration.








Abstract
The aberrant mechanical microenvironment in degenerated tissues induces misdirection of cell fate, making it challenging to achieve efficient endogenous regeneration. Herein, a hydrogel microsphere&#8208;based synthetic niche with integrated cell recruitment and targeted cell differentiation properties via mechanotransduction is constructed . Through the incorporation of microfluidics and photo&#8208;polymerization strategies, fibronectin (Fn) modified methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) microspheres are prepared with the independently tunable elastic modulus (1&#8211;10Kpa) and ligand density (2 and 10&#160;&#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1), allowing a wide range of cytoskeleton modulation to trigger the corresponding mechanobiological signaling. The combination of the soft matrix (2Kpa) and low ligand density (2&#160;&#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1) can support the nucleus pulposus (NP)&#8208;like differentiation of intervertebral disc (IVD) progenitor/stem cells by translocating Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP), without the addition of inducible biochemical factors. Meanwhile, platelet&#8208;derived growth factor&#8208;BB (PDGF&#8208;BB) is loaded onto Fn&#8208;GelMA microspheres (PDGF@Fn&#8208;GelMA) via the heparin&#8208;binding domain of Fn to initiate endogenous cell recruitment. In in vivo experiments, hydrogel microsphere&#8208;niche maintained the IVD structure and stimulated matrix synthesis. Overall, this synthetic niche with cell recruiting and mechanical training capabilities offered a promising strategy for endogenous tissue regeneration.

         <title>Nanotargeted Delivery of Immune Therapeutics in Type 1 Diabetes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A targeted delivery platform for type 1 diabetes (T1D) treatment using high endothelial venule (HEV)&#8208;targeted nanoparticles is developed. The HEV&#8208;targeting nanoplatform delivers anti&#8208;CD3 antibodies simultaneously to pancreatic lymph nodes and pancreata, thereby suppressing effector T cells and prolonging the reversal of T1D in a nonobese diabetic mouse model.








Abstract
Immune therapeutics holds great promise in the treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Nonetheless, their progress is hampered by limited efficacy, equipoise, or issues of safety. To address this, a novel and specific nanodelivery platform for T1D that targets high endothelial venules (HEVs) presented in the pancreatic lymph nodes (PLNs) and pancreas is developed. Data indicate that the pancreata of nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice and patients with T1D are unique in their expression of newly formed HEVs. Anti&#8208;CD3 mAb is encapsulated in poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid)&#8211;poly(ethylene glycol) nanoparticles (NPs), the surfaces of which are conjugated with MECA79 mAb that recognizes HEVs. Targeted delivery of these NPs improves accumulation of anti&#8208;CD3 mAb in both the PLNs and pancreata of NOD mice. Treatment of hyperglycemic NOD mice with MECA79&#8208;anti&#8208;CD3&#8208;NPs results in significant reversal of T1D compared to those that are untreated, treated with empty NPs, or provided free anti&#8208;CD3. This effect is associated with a significant reduction of T effector cell populations in the PLNs and a decreased production of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine in the mice treated with MECA79&#8208;anti&#8208;CD3&#8208;NPs. In summary, HEV&#8208;targeted therapeutics may be used as a means by which immune therapeutics can be delivered to PLNs and pancreata to suppress autoimmune diabetes effectively.

         <title>Erasable, Rewritable, and Reprogrammable Dual Information Encryption Based on Photoluminescent Supramolecular Host&#8211;Guest Recognition and Hydrogel Shape Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular strategy is demonstrated to achieve multimodal, erasable, reprogrammable, and reusable information encryption by reversibly modulating the fluorescence of a well&#8208;designed self&#8208;inclusion supramolecular fluorescent ink immobilized in a polymer brush on a hydrogel surface through host&#8211;guest recognition. This supramolecular recognition is combined with the shape&#8208;memory effect of responsive hydrogel to achieve dual&#8208;encryption.








Abstract
Information encryption technologies are very important for security, health, commodity, and communications, etc. Novel information encryption mechanisms and materials are desired to achieve multimode and reprogrammable encryption. Here, a supramolecular strategy is demonstrated to achieve multimodal, erasable, reprogrammable, and reusable information encryption by reversibly modulating fluorescence. A butyl&#8208;naphthalimide with flexible ethylenediamine functionalized &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (N&#8208;CD) is utilized as a fluorescent responsive ink for printing or patterning information on polymer brushes with dangling adamantane group grafted on responsive hydrogels. The photoluminescent naphthalimide moiety is bonded to &#946;&#8208;CD and entrapped in the cavity. Its fluorescence is highly weakened in &#946;&#8208;CD cavity and recovers after being expelled from the cavity by a competing guest molecule to emit bright green photoluminescence under UV. Experiments and theoretical calculations suggest &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and ICT as the primary mechanism for the naphthalimides assembly and fluorescence, which can be quenched through insertion of conjugated molecules and recover by removing the insert. Such reversible quenching and recovering are used to achieve repeated writing, erasing, and re&#8208;writing of information. Supramolecular recognition and hydrogel shape memory are further combined to achieve reversible dual&#8208;encryption. This study provides a novel strategy to develop smart materials with improved information security for broad applications.

A butyl-naphthalimide with flexible ethylenediamine functionalized &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-cyclodextrin (N-CD) is utilized as a fluorescent responsive ink for printing or patterning information on polymer brushes with dangling adamantane group grafted on responsive hydrogels. The photoluminescent naphthalimide moiety is bonded to &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-CD and entrapped in the cavity. Its fluorescence is highly weakened in &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-CD cavity and recovers after being expelled from the cavity by a competing guest molecule to emit bright green photoluminescence under UV. Experiments and theoretical calculations suggest &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt; stacking and ICT as the primary mechanism for the naphthalimides assembly and fluorescence, which can be quenched through insertion of conjugated molecules and recover by removing the insert. Such reversible quenching and recovering are used to achieve repeated writing, erasing, and re-writing of information. Supramolecular recognition and hydrogel shape memory are further combined to achieve reversible dual-encryption. This study provides a novel strategy to develop smart materials with improved information security for broad applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast Subpicosecond Magnetization of a 2D Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first sub&#8208;ps (&#8776;600&#160;fs) magnetization process in a ferromagnetic quantum well is successfully demonstrated, which utilizes the high carrier coherency and a rapid photo&#8208;Demba field effect, using pump&#8208;and&#8208;probe measurements with an X&#8208;ray free&#8208;electron laser. This hopefully opens a new way to ultrafast magnetic storage and information processing.








Abstract
Strong spin&#8208;charge interactions in several ferromagnets are expected to lead to subpicosecond (sub&#8208;ps) magnetization of the magnetic materials through control of the carrier characteristics via electrical means, which is essential for ultrafast spin&#8208;based electronic devices. Thus far, ultrafast control of magnetization has been realized by optically pumping a large number of carriers into the d or f orbitals of a ferromagnet; however, it is extremely challenging to implement by electrical gating. This work demonstrates a new method for sub&#8208;ps magnetization manipulation called wavefunction engineering, in which only the spatial distribution (wavefunction) of s (or p) electrons is controlled and no change is required in the total carrier density. Using&#160;a ferromagnetic semiconductor (FMS) (In,Fe)As quantum well (QW), instant enhancement, as fast as 600&#160;fs, of the magnetization is observed upon irradiating a femtosecond (fs) laser pulse. Theoretical&#160;analysis shows that the instant enhancement of the magnetization is induced when the 2D electron wavefunctions (WFs) in the FMS QW are rapidly moved by a photo&#8208;Dember electric field formed by an asymmetric distribution of the photocarriers. Because this WF engineering method can be equivalently implemented by applying a gate electric field, these results open a new way to realize ultrafast magnetic storage and spin&#8208;based information processing in present electronic systems.

         <title>Organic Polarized Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic polarized light&#8208;emitting transistors (OPLETs), which integrate electroluminescence, current switching, and polarized emission into one device, are demonstrated with a degree of polarization of 0.97. The high polarization characteristics of the OPLETs are assigned to the intrinsic in&#8208;plane anisotropy of molecular properties. High&#8208;contrast optical imaging and modern anti&#8208;counterfeit security based on OPLETs are demonstrated, establishing a new direction for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Electrically driven polarized light&#8208;emitting sources are central to various applications including quantum computers, optical communication, and 3D displays, but serious challenges remain due to the inevitable incorporation of complex optical elements in conventional devices. Here, organic polarized light&#8208;emitting transistors (OPLETs), a kind of novel device that integrates the functions of organic field&#8208;effect transistors, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, and polarizers into one unique device, are demonstrated with a degree of polarization (DOP) as high as 0.97, which is comparable to completely linearly polarized light (DOP = 1). Under the modulation of gate voltage, robust and efficient polarization emission is proven, ascribed to the intrinsic in&#8208;plane anisotropy of the molecular transition dipole moment in organic semiconductors and the open&#8208;ended feature of OPLETs instead of other factors. As a result, high&#8208;contrast optical imaging and anti&#8208;counterfeiting security are successfully demonstrated based on OPLETs, establishing a new direction for photonic and electronic integration toward on&#8208;chip miniaturized optoelectronic applications.

         <title>A Nanodisc&#8208;Paved Biobridge Facilitates Stem Cell Membrane Fusogenicity for Intracerebral Shuttling and Bystander Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A membrane fusogenicity technology using toolkits of discoidal high&#8208;density lipoprotein (HDL)&#8208;containing biomimicking 4F peptides is designed to functionalize mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) through a lipid raft&#8208;mediated membrane fusion pathway. For Alzheimer's disease therapy, 4F&#8211;VBP (HDL) is assembled for MSC4F&#8211;VBP(HDL) fabrication. After systemic infusion, MSCs4F&#8211;VBP(HDL) recognize pathological vascular clues for efficient blood&#8211;brain barrier crossing, achieving bystander effects on neurons and microglia.








Abstract
Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies experience steadfast clinical advances but are still hindered by inefficient site&#8208;specific migration. An adaptable MSC membrane fusogenicity technology is conceptualized for lipid raft&#8208;mediated targeting ligand embedding by using toolkits of discoidal high&#8208;density lipoprotein (HDL)&#8208;containing biomimicking 4F peptides. According to the pathological clues of brain diseases, the vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 specialized VBP peptide is fused with 4F to assemble 4F&#8208;VBP (HDL), which acts as a biobridge and transfers VBP onto the living cell membrane via lipid rafts for surface engineering of MSCs in suspension. When compared with the membrane&#8208;modifying strategies of PEGylated phospholipids, 4F&#8208;VBP (HDL) provides a 3.86 higher linkage efficiency to obtain MSCs4F&#8211;VBP(HDL), which can recognize and adhere to the inflammatory endothelium for efficient blood&#8211;brain barrier crossing and brain accumulation. In APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the transcriptomic analysis reveals that systemic administration of MSCs4F&#8211;VBP(HDL) can activate pathways associated with neuronal activity and diminish neuroinflammation for rewiring AD brains. This customizable HDL&#8208;mediated membrane fusogenicity platform primes MSC inflammatory brain delivery, which can be expanded to other disease treatments by simply fusing 4F with relevant ligands for living cell engineering.

         <title>Trivalent Europium&#8208;Doped CsCl Quantum Dots for MA&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells with Inherent Bandgap through Lattice Strain Compensation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu3+&#8208;doped CsCl quantum dots are introduced in FAPbI3 PSCs to solve the key issues in CsxFA1&#8722;xPbI3 (Cs&#8211;FA) PSCs and simultaneously exert the talent of Cs&#8211;FA PSCs on stability, which maintains the optimal bandgap of FAPbI3 and offsets the Cs&#8208;induced local strain with a high power conversion efficiency of 24.13%.








Abstract
Cesium&#8211;formamidinium (Cs&#8211;FA) perovskites have garnered widespread interest owing to their excellent thermal&#8208; and photostability in achieving stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, Cs&#8211;FA perovskite typically suffers from Cs+ and FA+ mismatches, affecting the Cs&#8211;FA morphology and lattice distortion, resulting in an enlarged bandgap (Eg). In this work, &#8220;upgraded&#8221; CsCl, Eu3+&#8208;doped CsCl quantum dots, are&#160;developed to solve the key issues in Cs&#8211;FA PSCs and also exploit the advantage of Cs&#8208;FA PSCs on stability. The introduction of Eu3+ promotes the formation of high&#8208;quality Cs&#8211;FA films by adjusting the Pb&#8211;I cluster. CsCl:Eu3+ also offsets the local strain and lattice contraction induced by Cs+, which maintains the inherent Eg of FAPbI3 and decreases the trap density. Finally, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.13% is obtained with an excellent short&#8208;circuit current density of 26.10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 . The unencapsulated devices show excellent humidity stability and&#160;storage stability, and an initial PCE of 92.2% within 500&#160;h under continuous light illumination, and bias voltage conditions is achieved. This study provides a universal strategy to address the inherent issues of Cs&#8211;FA devices and maintain the stability of MA&#8208;free PSCs to satisfy future commercial criteria.

Finally, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.13% is obtained with an excellent short-circuit current density of 26.10&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; . The unencapsulated devices show excellent humidity stability and&#160;storage stability, and an initial PCE of 92.2% within 500&#160;h under continuous light illumination, and bias voltage conditions is achieved. This study provides a universal strategy to address the inherent issues of Cs&#8211;FA devices and maintain the stability of MA-free PSCs to satisfy future commercial criteria.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intense Hydrochromic Photon Upconversion from Lead&#8208;Free 0D Metal Halides For Water Detection and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new 0D lead&#8208;free metal halide upconversion smart material is developed and applied as a moisture sensor. It exhibits excellent repeatability and is particularly suitable for real&#8208;time and long&#8208;term water monitoring. Additionally, this upconversion smart material is applied to cipher text information encryption via a laser&#8208;based optical lighting method.








Abstract
Hydrochromic materials that change their luminescence color upon exposure to moisture have attracted considerable attention owing to their applications in sensing and information encryption. However, the existing materials lack high hydrochromic response and color tunability. This study reports the development of a new and bright 0D Cs3GdCl6 metal halide as the host for hydrochromic photon upconversion in the form of polycrystals (PCs) and nanocrystals. Lanthanides co&#8208;doped cesium gadolinium chloride metal halides exhibit upconversion luminescence (UCL) in the visible&#8211;infrared region upon 980&#160;nm laser excitation. In particular, PCs co&#8208;doped with Yb3+ and Er3+ exhibit hydrochromic UCL color change from green to red. These hydrochromic properties are quantitatively confirmed through the sensitive detection of water in tetrahydrofuran solvent via UCL color changes. This water&#8208;sensing probe exhibits excellent repeatability and is particularly suitable for real&#8208;time and long&#8208;term water monitoring. Furthermore, the hydrochromic UCL property is exploited for stimuli&#8208;responsive information encryption via cyphertexts. These findings will pave the way for the development of new hydrochromic upconverting materials for emerging applications, such as noncontact sensors, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and information encryption.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Error&#8208;Correction Learning Accelerates Experimental Discovery of Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine&#8208;learning model using error&#8208;correction learning with experimental feedback is developed to predict high&#8208;performance thermoelectric materials. Experimentally a new family of thermoelectric materials consisting of PbSe:SnSb is achieved, which exhibits large power factor at room temperature.








Abstract
The exploration of thermoelectric materials is challenging considering the large materials space, combined with added exponential degrees of freedom coming from doping and the diversity of synthetic pathways. Here, historical data is incorporated, and is updated using experimental feedback by employing error&#8208;correction learning (ECL). This is achieved by learning from prior datasets and then&#160;adapting the model to differences in synthesis and characterization that are otherwise difficult to parameterize. This strategy is thus applied to discovering thermoelectric materials, where synthesis is prioritized at temperatures &lt;300&#160;&#176;C. A previously unexplored chemical family of thermoelectric materials, PbSe:SnSb, is documented, finding that the best candidate in this chemical family, 2 wt% SnSb doped PbSe, exhibits a power factor more than 2&#215; that of PbSe. The investigations herein reveal that a closed&#8208;loop experimentation strategy reduces the required number of experiments to find an optimized material by a factor as high as 3&#215; compared to high&#8208;throughput searches powered by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art machine&#8208;learning (ML) models. It is also observed that this improvement is dependent on the accuracy of the ML model in a manner that exhibits diminishing returns: once a certain accuracy is reached, factors that are instead associated with experimental pathways begin to dominate trends.

         <title>Achieving All&#8208;Plateau and High&#8208;Capacity Sodium Insertion in Topological Graphitized Carbon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly cross&#8208;linked topological graphitized carbon is constructed through a two&#8208;step rapid thermal&#8208;annealing strategy. Evidence from advanced techniques indicates that the sodium ions' insertion and Na cluster formation occurred between curved topological graphite layers and in the topological cavity of adjacent graphite band entanglements, resulting in a single full low&#8208;voltage plateau capacity of 290&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Hard carbon anodes with all&#8208;plateau capacities below 0.1&#160;V are prerequisites to achieve high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium&#8208;ion storage, which holds promise for future sustainable energy technologies. However, challenges in removing defects and improving the insertion of sodium ions head off the development of hard carbon to achieve this goal. Herein, a highly cross&#8208;linked topological graphitized carbon using biomass corn cobs through a two&#8208;step rapid thermal&#8208;annealing strategy is reported. The topological graphitized carbon constructed with long&#8208;range graphene nanoribbons and cavities/tunnels provides a multidirectional insertion of sodium ions whilst eliminating defects to absorb sodium ions at the high voltage region. Evidence from advanced techniques including in situ XRD, in situ Raman, and in situ/ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicates that the sodium ions' insertion and Na cluster formation occurred between curved topological graphite layers and in the topological cavity of adjacent graphite band entanglements. The reported topological insertion mechanism enables outstanding battery performance with a single full low&#8208;voltage plateau capacity of 290&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, which is almost 97% of the total capacity.

         <title>Advancing In Situ Food Monitoring through a Smart Lab&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;Package System Demonstrated by the Detection of Salmonella in Whole Chicken</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of &#8220;Lab&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;Package&#8221;, a novel food packaging platform, consisting of a redesigned tray for sample localization, a membrane for reagent immobilization, and a Salmonella&#8208;specific sensor, is reported. Performance is substantiated with ready&#8208;to&#8208;eat chicken products, including ones that are contaminated using knives, gloves, and surfaces. Real&#8208;world use is also simulated using a handheld fluorescence scanner with smartphone connectivity.








Abstract
With food production shifting away from traditional farm&#8208;to&#8208;table approaches to efficient multistep supply chains, the incidence of food contamination has increased. Consequently, pathogen testing via inefficient culture&#8208;based methods has increased, despite its lack of real&#8208;time capabilities and need for centralized facilities. While in situ pathogen detection would address these limitations and enable individual product monitoring, accurate detection within unprocessed, packaged food products without user manipulation has proven elusive. Herein, &#8220;Lab&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;Package&#8221; is presented, a platform capable of sampling, concentrating, and detecting target pathogens within closed food packaging, without intervention. This system consists of a newly designed packaging tray and reagent&#8208;infused membrane that can be paired universally with diverse pathogen sensors. The inclined food packaging tray maximizes fluid localization onto the sensing interface, while the membrane acts as a reagent&#8208;immobilizing matrix and an antifouling barrier for the sensor. The platform is substantiated using a newly discovered Salmonella&#8208;responsive nucleic acid probe, which enables hands&#8208;free detection of 103 colony forming units (CFU) g&#8722;1 target pathogen in a packaged whole chicken. The platform remains effective when contamination is introduced with toolsand surfaces, ensuring widespread efficacy. Its real&#8208;world use for in situ detection is simulated using a handheld fluorescence scanner with smartphone connectivity.

         <title>Rationally Designing High&#8208;Performance Versatile Organic Memristors through Molecule&#8208;Mediated Ion Movements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalized effective strategy with a view to molecules with specific coordination&#8208;groups&#8208;regulating ions, and regulating device functions through modulation of the molecule distribution is implemented. This well&#8208;known delicate coordination reaction is introduced into a generalized robust polymer framework, leading to modulation of the tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) molecule distribution and domain separation inside the polymer framework, and then to regulation of the formed shape of the Ag conductive filaments (CFs). The work inspires novel strategies in rationally designing high&#8208;performance and multifunctional memory devices and is promising to lead broad interest in special molecule&#8208;mediated ion memristors.








Abstract
Organic memory has attracted tremendous attention for next&#8208;generation electronic elements for the molecules&#8217; striking ease of structural design. However, due to them being hardly controllable and their low ion transport, it is always essential and challenge to effectively control their random migration, pathway, and duration. There are very few effective strategies, and specific platforms with a view to molecules with specific coordination&#8208;groups&#8208;regulating ions have been rarely reported. In this work, as a generalized rational design strategy, the well&#8208;known tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) is introduced with multiple coordination groups and small plane structure into a stable polymers framework to modulate Ag migration and then achieve high&#8208;performance devices with ideal productivity, low operation voltage and power, stable switching cycles, and state retention. Raman mapping demonstrates&#160;that the migrated Ag can specially coordinate with the embedded TCNQ molecules. Notably, the TCNQ molecule distribution can be modulated inside the polymer framework and regulate the memristive behaviors through controlling the formed Ag conductive filaments (CFs) as demonstrated by Raman mapping, in situ conductive atomic force microscopy (C&#8208;AFM), X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and depth&#8208;profiling X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Thus the controllable molecule&#8208;mediated Ag movements show its potential in rationally designing high&#8208;performance devices and versatile functions and is enlightening in constructing memristors with molecule&#8208;mediated ion movements.

         <title>Direct Observation of Atomic Step&#8208;Assisted Stabilization of&#160;Polar Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ atomic&#8208;scale electron microscopy combined with first&#8208;principles calculations discovers a hitherto unknown stabilization mechanism of polar oxide surfaces. The dynamic motion of atomic steps activated at a high temperature converts the LaAlO3 (001) polar surface to a nonpolar (015) vicinal surface via step reconstruction involving cation vacancy formation, which completely cancels the electric fields along all radial directions.








Abstract
Polar surfaces are intrinsically unstable and thus highly reactive due to the uncompensated surface charges. The charge compensation is accompanied by various surface reconstructions, establishing novel functionality for their applications. The present&#160;in situ atomic&#8208;scale electron microscopy study directly shows that the atomic step and step&#8208;assisted reconstruction play central roles in the charge compensation of polar oxide surfaces. The&#160;flat (LaO)+&#8208;terminated LaAlO3 (001) polar surface, when annealed at high temperature in vacuum, transits to the (015) vicinal surface via the dynamic motion and interaction of atomic steps. While the (015) vicinal surface possesses zero polarization along the surface normal, a thermodynamic ground state is achieved when the in&#8208;plane polarization is fully compensated via the reconstruction of step&#8208;edge atoms; the step&#8208;edge La atoms are displaced from their ordinary atomic sites toward the adjacent Al step&#8208;edge sites, resulting in the formation of negatively charged La vacancies at the corresponding step edges. As confirmed by first&#8208;principles calculations, the observed step reconstruction of (015) vicinal surface can completely cancel both out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane electric fields. This hitherto unknown mechanism reveals the central role of step reconstruction in stabilizing a polar surface, providing valuable insights for understanding the novel charge compensation mechanism accompanied by the step reconstruction.

         <title>A Quasi&#8208;2D Polypyrrole Film with Band&#8208;Like Transport Behavior and High Charge&#8208;Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first band&#8208;like transport behavior in polypyrrole (PPy) is reported. Utilizing an air/H2SO4&#8208;interface&#8208;assisted approach, a quasi&#8208;2D polypyrrole (q2DPPy) film is synthesized, formed by a layered assembly of fully extended quinoidal PPy chains. Terahertz time&#8208;domain spectroscopy at various temperatures reveals unprecedented high charge&#8208;carrier mobility up to &#8776;107.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, attributed to the efficient band&#8208;like short&#8208;range transport in q2DPPy.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D (q2D) conjugated polymers (CPs) are polymers that consist of linear CP chains assembled through non&#8208;covalent interactions to form a layered structure. In this work, the synthesis of a novel crystalline q2D polypyrrole (q2DPPy) film at the air/H2SO4 (95%) interface is reported. The unique interfacial environment facilitates chain extension, prevents disorder, and results in a crystalline, layered assembly of protonated quinoidal chains with a fully extended conformation in its crystalline domains. This unique structure features highly delocalized &#960;&#8208;electron systems within the extended chains, which is responsible for the low effective mass and narrow electronic bandgap. Thus, the temperature&#8208;dependent charge&#8208;transport properties of q2DPPy are investigated using the van der Pauw (vdP) method and terahertz time&#8208;domain spectroscopy (THz&#8208;TDS). The vdP method reveals that the q2DPPy film exhibits a semiconducting behavior with a thermally activated hopping mechanism in long&#8208;range transport between the electrodes. Conversely, THz&#8208;TDS reveals a band&#8208;like transport, indicating intrinsic charge transport up to a record short&#8208;range high THz mobility of &#8776;107.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1.

         <title>Triiodide Attacks the Organic Cation in Hybrid Lead Halide Perovskites: Mechanism and Suppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triiodide is formed from thermally stressed lead halide perovskites. It hydrogen bonds strongly with organic cations in these materials, and it induces, catalytically, their deprotonation leading to perovskite decomposition. A simple thiol applied to the perovskite surface interrupts the catalytic cycle, and when applied at the perovskite&#8211;hole&#8208;transport material interface, creates a surface dipole that facilitates hole injection.








Abstract
Molecular I2 can be produced from iodide&#8208;based lead perovskites under thermal stress; triiodide, I3&#8722;, is formed from this I2 and I&#8722;. Triiodide attacks protic cation MA+&#8208; or FA+&#8208;based lead halide perovskites (MA+, methylammonium; FA+, formamidinium) as explicated through solution&#8208;based nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies: triiodide has strong hydrogen&#8208;bonding affinity for MA+ or FA+, which leads to their deprotonation and perovskite decomposition. Triiodide is a catalyst for this decomposition that can be obviated through perovskite surface treatment with thiol reducing agents. In contrast to methods using thiol incorporation into perovskite precursor solutions, no penetration of the thiol into the bulk perovskite is observed, yet its surface application stabilizes the perovskite against triiodide&#8208;mediated thermal stress. Thiol applied to the interface between FAPbI3 and Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD (&#8220;Spiro&#8221;) prevents oxidized iodine species penetration into Spiro and thus preserves its hole&#8208;transport efficacy. Surface&#8208;applied thiol affects the perovskite work function; it ameliorates hole injection into the Spiro overlayer, thus improving device performance. It helps to increase interfacial adhesion (&#8220;wetting&#8221;): fewer voids are observed at the Spiro/perovskite interface if thiols are applied. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) incorporating interfacial thiol treatment maintain over 80% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 300&#160;h of 85&#160;&#176;C thermal stress.

         <title>A Transformable Mucoadhesive Microgel Network for Noninvasive Multimodal Imaging And Radioprotection of a Large Area of the Gastrointestinal Tract</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mucoadhesive microgel (Bi&#8208;GLUE) integrating high mucoadhesion and flowability is developed as a novel gastrointestinal (GI) modulation platform, which can cover large&#8208;area GI tracts through oral administration. The contrast&#8208;loaded Bi&#8208;GLUE achieves multimodal, large&#8208;area GI imaging that traditional contrasts cannot fulfill. Moreover, the Bi&#8208;GLUE offers a new GI&#8208;radioprotection strategy by constructing an intracorporal radiation&#8208;attenuating shield in the GI lumen.








Abstract
The lack of noninvasive imaging and modulation of a large area of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract constrain the diagnosis and treatment of many GI&#8208;related diseases. Recent advances use novel mucoadhesive materials to coat a part of the GI tract and then modulate its functions. High mucoadhesion is the key factor of the partial coating, but also the limitation for not spreading and covering the lower GI tract. Here, a bismuth&#8211;pectin organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid complex is screened and engineered into a transformable microgel network (Bi&#8208;GLUE) with high flowability and mucoadhesion, such that it&#160;can quickly transit through and coat a large area of the GI tract. In murine and porcine models, Bi&#8208;GLUE delivers contrast agents to achieve real&#8208;time, large&#8208;area GI&#8208;tract imaging under X&#8208;ray or magnetic resonance &#160;modalities and to facilitate the non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis. Moreover, Bi&#8208;GLUE, like an intracorporal radiation shield, decreases the radiotoxicity in a whole&#8208;abdomen irradiation rat model. This transformable microgel network offers a new direction that can modulate a large area of the GI tract and may have broad applications for GI&#8208;related conditions.

         <title>Surface Engineering of Fluorinated Graphene Nanosheets Enables Ultrafast Lithium/Sodium/Potassium Primary Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient surface engineering strategy combining surface defluorination and nitrogen doping enables fluorinated graphene nanosheets to construct conductive nanolayers and fast ion channels. Based on this, the DFG&#8208;N materials developed in this work achieve record&#8208;fast discharge rates and ultrahigh power densities without sacrificing energy density in both lithium/sodium/potassium primary batteries, proving promising for commercial applications.








Abstract
Fluorinated carbon (CFx) is considered as a promising cathode material for lithium/sodium/potassium primary batteries with superior theoretical energy density. However, achieving high energy and power densities simultaneously remains a considerable challenge due to the strong covalency of the C&#8211;F bond in the highly fluorinated CFx. Herein, an efficient surface engineering strategy combining surface defluorination and nitrogen doping enables fluorinated graphene nanosheets (DFG&#8208;N) to possess controllable conductive nanolayers and reasonably regulated C&#8211;F bonds. The DFG&#8208;N delivers an unprecedented dual performance for lithium primary batteries with a power density of 77456&#160;W kg&#8722;1 and an energy density of 1067&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at an ultrafast rate of 50 C, which is the highest level reported to date. The DFG&#8208;N also achieves a record power density of 15 256 and 17 881&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 10 C for sodium and potassium primary batteries, respectively. The characterization results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the excellent performance of DFG&#8208;N is attributed to surface engineering strategies that remarkably improve electronic and ionic conductivity without sacrificing the high fluorine content. This work provides a compelling strategy for developing advanced ultrafast primary batteries that combine ultrahigh energy density and power density.

         <title>Tuning Ligands Ratio Allows for Controlling Gold Nanocluster Conformation and Activating a Nonantimicrobial Thiol Fragrance for Effective Treatment of MRSA&#8208;Induced Keratitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adjusting the feed ratio of two thiol ligands with different steric hindrances, the conformation of the gold nanocluster is transformed from Au25(SR)18 to Au23(SR)16, while simultaneously converting both inactive thiol ligands into a membrane&#8208;active antibacterial nanomedicine for the effective treatment of refractory bacterial keratitis caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus.








Abstract
Bacterial keratitis is a serious ocular disease that affects millions of people worldwide each year, among which &#8776;25% are caused by Staphylococcus aureus. With the spread of bacterial resistance, refractory keratitis caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA) affects &#8776;120&#160;000&#8211;190&#160;000 people annually and is a significant cause of infectious blindness. Atomically precise gold nanoclusters (GNCs) recently emerged as promising antibacterial agents; although how the GNC structure and capping ligands control the antibacterial properties remains largely unexplored. In this study, by adjusting the ratio of a &#8220;bulky&#8221; thiol fragrance to a linear zwitterionic ligand, the GNC conformation is transformed from Au25(SR)18 to Au23(SR)16 species, simultaneously converting both inactive thiol ligands into potent antibacterial nanomaterials. Surprisingly, mixed&#8208;ligand capped Au23(SR)16 GNCs exhibit superior antibacterial potency compared to their monoligand counterparts. The optimal GNC is highly potent against MRSA, showing &gt;1024&#8208;fold lower minimum inhibitory concentration than the corresponding free ligands. Moreover, it displays excellent potency in treating MRSA&#8208;induced keratitis in mice with greatly accelerated corneal recovery (by approximately ninefold). Thus, this study establishes a feasible method to synthesize antibacterial GNCs by adjusting the ligand ratio to control GNC conformation and active non&#8208;antibacterial ligands, thereby greatly increasing the repertoires for combating multidrug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections.

         <title>Adipose Mesenchymal Stem Cell Derived Exosomes Promote Keratinocytes and Fibroblasts Embedded in Collagen/Platelet&#8208;Rich Plasma Scaffold and Accelerate Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation and application of an exosome/cell&#8208;loaded COL/PRP scaffold for wound healing are assessed. The scaffold is applied on the dorsum wound of the mouse, wherein it promotes wound healing by reducing the level of inflammation, triggering proliferation of cells embedded in the scaffold, and promoting angiogenesis.








Abstract
Engineered skin substitutes derived from human skin significantly reduce inflammatory reactions mediated by foreign/artificial materials and are consequently easier to use for clinical application. Type I collagen is a main component of the extracellular matrix during wound healing and has excellent biocompatibility, and platelet&#8208;rich plasma can be used as the initiator of the healing cascade. Adipose mesenchymal stem cell derived exosomes are crucial for tissue repair and play key roles in enhancing cell regeneration, promoting angiogenesis, regulating inflammation, and remodeling extracellular matrix. Herein, Type I collagen and platelet&#8208;rich plasma, which provide natural supports for keratinocyte and fibroblast adhesion, migration, and proliferation, are mixed to form a stable 3D scaffold. Adipose mesenchymal stem cell derived exosomes are added to the scaffold to improve the performance of the engineered skin. The physicochemical properties of this cellular scaffold are analyzed, and the repair effect is evaluated in a full&#8208;thickness skin defect mouse model. The cellular scaffold reduces the level of inflammation and promotes cell proliferation and angiogenesis to accelerate wound healing. Proteomic analysis shows that exosomes exhibit excellent anti&#8208;inflammatory and proangiogenic effects in collagen/platelet&#8208;rich plasma scaffolds. The proposed method provides a new therapeutic strategy and theoretical basis for tissue regeneration and wound repair.

         <title>Supramolecular Liquid Crystal Carbon Dots for Solvent&#8208;Free Direct Ink Writing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first case of solvent&#8208;free direct ink writing (DIW) of carbon dots is demonstrated via liquid crystallization, giving rise to highly luminescent fluorescent patterns in three primary colors of blue, green, and red, respectively, due to the significantly limited aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effect, and promising technological utility in DIW&#8208;based advanced manufacturing.

Recent years have witnessed the major advances of nanolights with extensive exploration of nano&#8208;luminescent materials like carbon dots (CDs). However, solvent&#8208;free processing of these materials remains a formidable challenge, impeding endeavors to develop advanced manufacturing techniques. Herein, in response to this challenge, liquid crystallization is demonstrated as a versatile and robust approach by deliberately anchoring flexible alkyl chains on the CDs surface. Alkyl chain grafting on the CDs surface is observed to substantially depress the common aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect, and results in a shift of self&#8208;assembly structure from the crystalline phase to smectic liquid crystalline phase. The liquid&#8208;crystalline phase&#8208;transition temperature is ready to adjust by varying the alkyl chain length, endowing low&#8208;temperature (&lt;50&#160;&#176;C) melt&#8208;processing capabilities. Consequently, the first case of direct ink writing (DIW) with liquid crystal (LC) carbon dots is demonstrated, giving rise to highly emissive objects with blue, green and red fluorescence, respectively. Another unexpected finding is that DIW with the LC inks dramatically outperforms DIW with isotropic inks, further highlighting the significance of the LC processing. The approach reported herein not only exhibits a fundamental advance by imparting LC functions to CDs, but also promises technological utility in DIW&#8208;based advanced manufacturing.

         <title>Enhanced Multiwavelength Response of Flexible Synaptic Transistors for Human Sunburned Skin Simulation and Neuromorphic Computation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible organic synaptic transistors with enhanced multiwavelength light&#8208;response properties are prepared by introducing alumina oxide (AlOX ) nanoparticles. Multiwavelength optical synaptic plasticity, sunburned skin simulation, a learning efficiency model, neural network computing, and &#8220;deer&#8221; picture learning memory functions are successfully simulated.








Abstract
In biological species, optogenetics and bioimaging work together to regulate the function of neurons. Similarly, the light&#8208;controlled artificial synaptic system not only enhances computational speed but also simulates complex synaptic functions. However, reported synaptic properties are mainly limited to mimicking simple biological functions and single&#8208;wavelength responses. Therefore, the development of flexible synaptic devices with multiwavelength optical signal response and multifunctional simulation remains a challenge. Here, flexible organic light&#8208;stimulated synaptic transistors (LSSTs) enabled by alumina oxide (AlOX), with a simple fabrication process, are reported. By embedding AlOX nanoparticles, the excitons separation efficiency is improved, allowing for multiple wavelength responses. Optimized LSSTs can respond to multiple optical and electrical signals in a highly synaptic manner. Multiwavelength optical synaptic plasticity, electrical synaptic plasticity, sunburned skin simulation, learning efficiency model controlled by photoelectric cooperative stimulation, neural network computing, &#8220;deer&#8221; picture learning and memory functions are successfully proposed, which promote the development for future artificial intelligent systems. Furthermore, as prepared flexible transistors exhibit mechanical flexibility with bending radius down to 2.5&#160;mm and improved photosynaptic plasticity, which facilitating development of neuromorphic computing and multifunction integration systems at the device&#8208;level.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Like Li&#8208;Ion Conduction in Oxides Enabling Anomalously Stable Charge Transport across the Li/Electrolyte Interface in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D liquid&#8208;like Li&#8208;ion conduction is unveiled, which features a low activation energy (0.2 eV) and short mean residence time (&lt;1&#160;ps) of Li ions on interstitial sites, caused by the Li&#8211;O polyhedra distortion and the Li&#8208;ion correlation. High Li&#8208;ion conductivities (1.2&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C) and anomalously stable charge transport across Li/LiTa2PO8 without interfacial modifications are thereby induced.








Abstract
The softness of sulfur sublattice and rotational PS4 tetrahedra in thiophosphates result in liquid&#8208;like ionic conduction, leading to enhanced ionic conductivities and stable electrode/thiophosphate interfacial ionic transport. However, the existence of liquid&#8208;like ionic conduction in rigid oxides remains unclear, and modifications are deemed necessary to achieve stable Li/oxide solid electrolyte interfacial charge transport. In this study, by combining the neutron diffraction survey, geometrical analysis, bond valence site energy analysis, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulation, 1D liquid&#8208;like Li&#8208;ion conduction is discovered in LiTa2PO8 and its derivatives, wherein Li&#8208;ion migration channels are connected by four&#8208; or five&#8208;fold oxygen&#8208;coordinated interstitial sites. This conduction features a low activation energy (0.2&#160;eV) and short mean residence time (&lt;1&#160;ps) of Li ions on the interstitial sites, originating from the Li&#8211;O polyhedral distortion and Li&#8208;ion correlation, which are controlled by doping strategies. The liquid&#8208;like conduction enables a high ionic conductivity (1.2&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C), and a 700&#160;h anomalously stable cycling under 0.2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for Li/LiTa2PO8/Li cells without interfacial modifications. These findings provide principles for the future discovery and design of improved solid electrolytes that do not require modifications to the Li/solid electrolyte interface to achieve stable ionic transport.

Natural light enabling spin&#8208;wave tunability in Co60Al40 alloyed film is investigated. A reversible shift of the critical angle (from 81&#176; in the dark to 83&#176; under illumination) of the body spin&#8208;wave is achieved successfully. It can be understood by an effective photoelectron&#8208;doping&#8208;induced change of the surface magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, the spin wave is modulated stably, confirming a non&#8208;volatile, reversible switching behavior








Abstract
Spin waves are considered to be an alternative carrier with great promise for information sensing. The feasible excitation and low&#8208;power manipulation of spin waves still remain a challenge. In this regard, natural light enablings spin&#8208;wave tunability in Co60Al40&#8208;alloyed film is investigated. A reversible shift of the critical angle (from 81&#176; in the dark to 83&#176; under illumination) of the body spin&#8208;wave is achieved successfully Meanwhile, an eye&#8208;catching shift (817&#160;Oe) of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) field is obtained optically, leading to changes in magnetic anisotropy. Based on the modified Puszkarski's surface inhomogeneity model, the control of spin&#8208;wave resonance (SWR) by sunlight can be understood by an effective photoelectron&#8208;doping&#8208;induced change of the surface magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, the body spin wave is modulated stably with natural light illumination, confirming a non&#8208;volatile, reversible switching behavior. This work has both practical and theoretical importance for developing future sunlight&#8208;tunable magnonics/spintronics devices.

         <title>Intrinsically Stretchable and Efficient Fully &#928;&#8208;Conjugated Polymer via Internal Plasticization for Flexible Deep&#8208;Blue Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with CIEy = 0.08</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal internal plasticization strategy is proposed to construct intrinsically stretchable and efficient fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers for the flexible deep&#8208;blue polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs). The introduction of pendant phenyl&#8208;ester plasticizers in polyfluorenes can simultaneously obtain excellent intrinsic stretchability, robust deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence, and comparable charge&#8208;transport behavior. Stable deep&#8208;blue PLEDs based on stretchable layers are also fabricated with a CIE of (0.15, 0.08).








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable polymeric semiconductors are essential to flexible polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) owing to their excellent strain tolerance capacity under long&#8208;time deformation operation. Obtaining intrinsic stretchability, robust emission properties, and excellent charge&#8208;transport behavior simultaneously from fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (FCPs) is difficult, particularly for applications in deep&#8208;blue PLEDs. Herein, an internal plasticization strategy is proposed to introduce a phenyl&#8208;ester plasticizer into polyfluorenes (PF&#8208;MC4, PF&#8208;MC6, and PF&#8208;MC8) for narrowband deep&#8208;blue flexible PLEDs. Compared with controlled poly[4&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl]&#8208;co&#8208;[5&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl] (PODPFs) (2.5%), the freestanding PF&#8208;MC8 thin film shows a fracture strain of &gt;25%. The three stretchable films exhibit stable and efficient deep&#8208;blue emission (PLQY &gt; 50%) because of the encapsulation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone via pendant phenyl&#8208;ester plasticizers. The PF&#8208;MC8&#8208;based PLEDs show deep&#8208;blue emission, which corresponds to CIE and EQE values of (0.16, 0.10) and 1.06%, respectively. Finally, the narrowband deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence (FWHM of &#8776;25&#160;nm; CIE coordinates: (0.15, 0.08)) and performance of the transferred PLEDs based on the PF&#8208;MC8 stretchable film are independent of the tensile ratio (up to 45%); however, they show a maximum brightness of 1976&#160;cd m&#8722;2 at a ratio of 35%. Therefore, internal plasticization is a promising approach for designing intrinsically stretchable FCPs for flexible electronics.

     alt="Intrinsically Stretchable and Efficient Fully &#928;-Conjugated Polymer via Internal Plasticization for Flexible Deep-Blue Polymer Light-Emitting Diodes with CIEy = 0.08"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A universal internal plasticization strategy is proposed to construct intrinsically stretchable and efficient fully &#960;-conjugated polymers for the flexible deep-blue polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs). The introduction of pendant phenyl-ester plasticizers in polyfluorenes can simultaneously obtain excellent intrinsic stretchability, robust deep-blue electroluminescence, and comparable charge-transport behavior. Stable deep-blue PLEDs based on stretchable layers are also fabricated with a CIE of (0.15, 0.08).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrinsically stretchable polymeric semiconductors are essential to flexible polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) owing to their excellent strain tolerance capacity under long-time deformation operation. Obtaining intrinsic stretchability, robust emission properties, and excellent charge-transport behavior simultaneously from fully &#960;-conjugated polymers (FCPs) is difficult, particularly for applications in deep-blue PLEDs. Herein, an internal plasticization strategy is proposed to introduce a phenyl-ester plasticizer into polyfluorenes (PF-MC4, PF-MC6, and PF-MC8) for narrowband deep-blue flexible PLEDs. Compared with controlled poly[4-(octyloxy)-9,9-diphenylfluoren-2,7-diyl]-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-[5-(octyloxy)-9,9-diphenylfluoren-2,7-diyl] (PODPFs) (2.5%), the freestanding PF-MC8 thin film shows a fracture strain of &amp;gt;25%. The three stretchable films exhibit stable and efficient deep-blue emission (PLQY &amp;gt; 50%) because of the encapsulation of &#960;-conjugated backbone via pendant phenyl-ester plasticizers. The PF-MC8-based PLEDs show deep-blue emission, which corresponds to CIE and EQE values of (0.16, 0.10) and 1.06%, respectively. Finally, the narrowband deep-blue electroluminescence (FWHM of &#8776;25&#160;nm; CIE coordinates: (0.15, 0.08)) and performance of the transferred PLEDs based on the PF-MC8 stretchable film are independent of the tensile ratio (up to 45%); however, they show a maximum brightness of 1976&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a ratio of 35%. Therefore, internal plasticization is a promising approach for designing intrinsically stretchable FCPs for flexible electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D&#8208;Heterojunction Based on Embedded Perovskite Micro&#8208;Sized Single Crystals for Fast Photomultiplier Photodetectors with Broad/Narrowband Dual&#8208;Mode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for creating a vertical fast photomultiplier photodetector based on a 3D heterostructure of embedded perovskite microsized single crystals with a dual mode of voltage&#8208;controlled broad/narrowband switching is reported. The additional radial interface and charge separation in the 3D heterostructure effectively reduce carrier quenching and accelerate the carrier response of the high&#8208;performance multifunctional photodetectors.








Abstract
A fast photomultiplier photodetector with a broad/narrowband dual mode is implemented using a new 3D heterostructure based on embedded perovskite micro&#8208;sized single crystals. Because the single&#8208;crystal size is smaller than the electrode size, the active layer can be divided into a perovskite microcrystalline part for charge transport and a polymer&#8208;embedded part for charge storage. This induces an additional radial interface in the 3D heterojunction structure, and allows a photogenerated built&#8208;in electric field in the radial direction, especially when the energy levels between the perovskite and embedding polymer are similar. This type of heterojunction has a small radial capacitance that can effectively reduce carrier quenching and accelerate the carrier response. By controlling the applied bias direction, up to 300&#8211;1000% external quantum efficiency (EQE) and microsecond response can be achieved not only in the wide range of ultraviolet to visible light from 320 to 550&#160;nm, but also in the narrow&#8208;band response with a full width at half minimum (FWHM) of 20&#160;nm. This shows great potential for applications in integrated multifunctional photodetectors.

         <title>Non&#8208;Blinking Luminescence from Charged Single Graphene Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;blinking luminescence from charged single graphene quantum dots (GQDs) is observed. This is attributed to the singly charged trion maintaining photon emission, including radiative recombination and non&#8208;radiative Auger recombination. This phenomenon can be explained in terms of the different energy levels in the GQDs caused by various oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups.








Abstract
Photoluminescence blinking behavior from single quantum dots under steady illumination is an important but controversial topic. Its occurrence has impeded the use of single quantum dots in bioimaging. Different mechanisms have been proposed to account for it, although controversial, the most important of which is the non&#8208;radiative Auger recombination mechanism whereby photocharging of quantum dots can lead to the blinking phenomenon. Here, the singly charged trion, which maintains photon emission, including radiative recombination and non&#8208;radiative Auger recombination, leads to fluorescence non&#8208;blinking which is observed in photocharged single graphene quantum dots (GQDs). This phenomenon can be explained in terms of different energy levels in the GQDs, caused by various oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups in the single GQDs. The suppressed blinking is due to the filling of trap sites owing to a Coulomb blockade. These results provide a profound understanding of the special optical properties of GQDs, affording a reference for further in&#8208;depth research.

         <title>Magnetization Control of Zero&#8208;Field Intrinsic Superconducting Diode Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zero&#8208;field SDE is demonstrated in Fe/Pt&#8208;inserted non&#8208;centrosymmetric Nb/V/Ta superconducting artificial superlattices with the magnetic toroidal moment. The periodic insertion of Fe with Pt into the superlattices increases the nonreciprocity of the critical current in the absence of a magnetic field. These findings can be utilized to realize non&#8208;volatile memories and logic circuits with ultralow power consumption.








Abstract
The superconducting diode effect (SDE), which causes a superconducting state in one direction and a normal&#8208;conducting state in another, has significant potential for developing ultralow power consumption circuits and non&#8208;volatile memory. However, the practical control of the SDE necessities the precise tuning of current, temperature, magnetic field, or magnetism. Therefore, the mechanisms of the SDE must be understood to develop novel materials and devices capable of realizing the SDE under more controlled and robust conditions. This study demonstrates an intrinsic zero&#8208;field SDE with an efficiency of up to 40% in Fe/Pt&#8208;inserted non&#8208;centrosymmetric Nb/V/Ta superconducting artificial superlattices. The polarity and magnitude of the zero&#8208;field SDE are controllable by the direction of magnetization, indicating that the effective exchange field acts on Cooper pairs. Furthermore, the first&#8208;principles calculation indicates that the SDE can be enhanced by an asymmetric configuration of proximity induced magnetic moments in superconducting layers, which induces a magnetic toroidal moment. This study has important implications regarding the development of novel materials and devices that can effectively control the SDE. Moreover, the magnetization control of the SDE is expected to aid in the designing of superconducting quantum devices and establishing a material platform for topological superconductors.

         <dc:description>
Fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting hydrogel coating for long&#8208;term biointerfacing: Fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting polymer hydrogel coating on conventional metallic bioelectrodes is fabricated through the engineering of nanocrystalline domains at the interface, enabling long&#8208;term electrocardiogram recording and electrical pacing without failure.








Abstract
Because of their distinct electrochemical and mechanical properties, conducting polymer hydrogels have been widely exploited as soft, wet, and conducting coatings for conventional metallic electrodes, providing mechanically compliant interfaces and mitigating foreign body responses. However, the long&#8208;term viability of these hydrogel coatings is hindered by concerns regarding fatigue crack propagation and/or delamination caused by repetitive volumetric expansion/shrinkage during long&#8208;term electrical interfacing. This study reports a general yet reliable approach to achieving a fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting polymer hydrogel coating on conventional metallic bioelectrodes by engineering nanocrystalline domains at the interface between the hydrogel and metallic substrates. It demonstrates the efficacy of this robust, biocompatible, and fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting hydrogel coating in cardiac pacing, showcasing its ability to effectively reduce the pacing threshold voltage and enhance the long&#8208;term reliability of electric stimulation. This study findings highlight the potential of its approach as a promising design and fabrication strategy for the next generation of seamless bioelectronic&#160;interfaces.

         <title>A Flexible Tough Hydrovoltaic Coating for Wearable Sensing Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible tough hydrovoltaic coating with a strong structural binding effect is developed for the simultaneous achievement of good electricity generation (open&#8208;circuit voltage &#8776;3.18 V) and highly sensitive ion&#8208;sensing ability. Based on skin&#8208;tight and non&#8208;contact device structures, wearable multifunctional self&#8208;powered sensing directly using sweat is demonstrated.








Abstract
The lack of a strong binding mechanism between nanomaterials severely restricts the advantages of the evaporation&#8208;driven hydrovoltaic effect in wearable sensing electronics. It is a challenging task to observably improve the mechanical toughness and flexibility of hydrovoltaic devices to match the wearable demand without abandoning the nanostructures and surface function. Here, a flexible tough polyacrylonitrile/alumina (PAN/Al2O3) hydrovoltaic coating with both good electricity generation (open&#8208;circuit voltage, Voc&#160;&#8776;&#160;3.18&#160;V) and sensitive ion sensing (2285&#160;V&#160;M&#8722;1 for NaCl solutions in 10&#8722;4 to 10&#8722;3&#160;m) capabilities is developed. The porous nanostructure composed of Al2O3 nanoparticles is firmly locked by the strong binding effect of PAN, giving a critical binding force 4 times that of Al2O3 film to easily deal with 9.92&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1 strong water&#8208;flow impact. Finally, skin&#8208;tight and non&#8208;contact device structures are proposed to achieve wearable multifunctional self&#8208;powered sensing directly using sweat. The flexible tough PAN/Al2O3 hydrovoltaic coating breaks through the mechanical brittleness limitation and broadens the applications of the evaporation&#8208;induced hydrovoltaic effect in self&#8208;powered wearable sensing electronics.

         <title>Integrating Enrichment, Reduction, and Oxidation Sites in One System for Artificial Photosynthetic Diluted CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;in&#8208;one photocatalytic system of CO2 enrichment, CO2 reduction, and H2O oxidation sites is designed for diluted CO2 reduction, and the [Emim]BF4@Zn&#8208;Salen&#8208;COF shows excellent visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven and natural&#8208;sunlight&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activity under diluted CO2 (15%) atmosphere.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthetic diluted CO2 reduction directly driven by natural sunlight is a challenging, but promising way to realize carbon&#8208;resources recycling utilization. Herein, a three&#8208;in&#8208;one photocatalytic system of CO2 enrichment, CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation sites is designed for diluted CO2 reduction. A Zn&#8208;Salen&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Zn&#8208;S&#8208;COF) with oxidation and reductive sites is synthesized; then, ionic liquids (ILs) are loaded into the pores. As a result, [Emim]BF4@Zn&#8208;S&#8208;COF shows a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion rate of 105.88&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under diluted CO2 (15%) atmosphere, even superior than most photocatalysts in high concentrations CO2. Moreover, natural sunlight driven diluted CO2 reduction rate also reaches 126.51&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 in 5&#160;h. Further experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the triazine ring in the Zn&#8208;S&#8208;COF promotes the activity of H2O oxidation and CO2 reduction sites, and the loaded ILs provide an enriched CO2 atmosphere, realizing the efficient photocatalytic activity in diluted CO2 reduction.

         <title>Ultrahigh Permeability at High Frequencies via A Magnetic&#8208;Heterogeneous Nanocrystallization Mechanism in an Iron&#8208;Based Amorphous Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising Fe75.5Co0.5Mo0.5Cu1Nb1.5Si13B8 nanocrystalline&#8211;amorphous composite alloy is developed by a unique magnetic&#8208;heterogeneous nanocrystallization mechanism and it shows an exceptionally high permeability up to 36&#160;000 at high frequency of 100 kHz. The exceptional soft magnetic properties are shown to be closely related to its low anisotropy and unique spin rotation mechanism under alternating magnetic fields in the nanocrystalline alloy.








Abstract
The prevalence of wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) semiconductors allows modern electronic devices to operate at much higher frequencies. However, development of soft magnetic materials with high&#8208;frequency properties matching the WBG&#8208;based devices remains challenging. Here, a promising nanocrystalline&#8211;amorphous composite alloy with a normal composition Fe75.5Co0.5Mo0.5Cu1Nb1.5Si13B8 in atomic percent is reported, which is producible under industrial conditions, and which shows an exceptionally high permeability at high frequencies up to 36&#160;000 at 100&#160;kHz, an increase of 44% compared with commercial FeSiBCuNb nanocrystalline alloy (25&#160;000&#160;&#177;&#160;2000 at 100&#160;kHz), outperforming all existing nanocrystalline alloy systems and commercial soft magnetic materials. The alloy is obtained by a unique magnetic&#8208;heterogeneous nanocrystallization mechanism in an iron&#8208;based amorphous alloy, which is different from the traditional strategy of nanocrystallization by doping nonmagnetic elements (e.g., Cu and Nb). The induced magnetic inhomogeneity by adding Co atoms locally promotes the formation of highly ordered structures acting as the nuclei of nanocrystals, and Mo atoms agglomerate around the interfaces of the nanocrystals, inhibiting nanocrystal growth, resulting in an ultrafine nanocrystalline&#8211;amorphous dual&#8208;phase structure in the alloy. The exceptional soft magnetic properties are shown to be closely related to the low magnetic anisotropy and the unique spin rotation mechanism under alternating magnetic fields.

         <title>Regulating the Lithium Ions&#8217; Local Coordination Environment through Designing a COF with Single Atomic Co Site to Achieve Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

Synergistic effects of Co&#9472;N coordination and a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano&#8208;group can adsorb the electron from the donor (Co) at a maximum and create an electron&#8208;rich environment, hence further regulating the Li+ local coordination environment and achieving uniform Li&#8208;nucleation behavior.








Abstract
The detrimental growth of lithium dendrites and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) inhibit the practical application of lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Herein, atomically dispersed cobalt coordinate conjugated bipyridine&#8208;rich covalent organic framework (sp2c&#8208;COF) is explored as an artificial SEI on the surface of the Li&#8208;metal anode to resolve these issues. The single Co atoms confined in the structure of COF enhance the number of active sites and promote electron transfer to the&#160;COF. The synergistic effects of the Co&#9472;N coordination and strong electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano&#8208;group can adsorb the electron from the donor (Co) at a maximum and create an electron&#8208;rich environment, hence further regulating the Li+ local coordination environment and achieving uniform Li&#8208;nucleation behavior. Furthermore, in situ technology and density functional theory calculations reveal the mechanism of the sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;Co inducing Li uniform deposition and promoting Li+ rapid migration. Based on these advantages, the sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;Co modified Li anode exhibits a low Li&#8208;nucleation barrier of 8&#160;mV, and excellent cycling stability of 6000&#160;h.

The synergistic effects of the Co&#9472;N coordination and strong electron-withdrawing cyano-group can adsorb the electron from the donor (Co) at a maximum and create an electron-rich environment, hence further regulating the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; local coordination environment and achieving uniform Li-nucleation behavior. Furthermore, in situ technology and density functional theory calculations reveal the mechanism of the sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;c-COF-Co inducing Li uniform deposition and promoting Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; rapid migration. Based on these advantages, the sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;c-COF-Co modified Li anode exhibits a low Li-nucleation barrier of 8&#160;mV, and excellent cycling stability of 6000&#160;h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Following oral administration in mice, &#946;&#8208;glucans&#8208;functionalized zinc&#8211;doxorubicin nanoparticles (&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD NPs) target and transpass intestinal M cells, overcome the epithelial barrier, and undergo phagocytosis by macrophages (&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981;). As hitchhiking cellular vehicles, &#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981; pass through the lymphatic system, enter systemic circulation, and then spontaneously target a primary tumor and metastatic lesions, functioning like &#8220;precision&#8208;guided stealth missiles&#8221;, improving the effectiveness of antitumor therapy.








Abstract
The prognosis in cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with current treatment modalities is poor owing to the highly desmoplastic tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, a &#946;&#8208;glucans&#8208;functionalized zinc&#8211;doxorubicin nanoparticle system (&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD NPs) that can be orally administered, is developed for targeted PDAC therapy. Following oral administration in PDAC&#8208;bearing mice, &#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD NPs actively target/transpass microfold cells, overcome the intestinal epithelial barrier, and then undergo subsequent phagocytosis by endogenous macrophages (&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981;). As hitchhiking cellular vehicles, &#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981; transits through the intestinal lymphatic system and enters systemic circulation, ultimately accumulating in the tumor tissue as a result of the tumor&#8208;homing and &#8220;stealth&#8221; properties that are conferred by endogenous M&#981;. Meanwhile, the M&#981; that hitchhikes&#160;&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD NPs&#160;is activated to produce matrix metalloproteinases, destroying the desmoplastic stromal barrier, and differentiates toward the M1&#8208;like phenotype, modulating the TME and recruiting effector T cells, ultimately inducing apoptosis of the tumor cells. The combination of &#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981;&#160;and immune checkpoint blockade effectively inhibits the growth of the primary tumor and suppresses the development of metastasis. It thus represents an appealing approach to targeted PDAC therapy.

         <title>Tailoring the Weight of Surface and Intralayer Edge States to Control LUMO Energies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rolling transfer of Langmuir layers of amphiphilic C60 derivatives is shown to enable the production of films with highly defined morphology. The resulting systematically tuned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies enable the establishment of a practical model that functionally relates the LUMO energies to a morphological descriptor. This allows prediction of the range of experimentally accessible LUMO energies.








Abstract
The energies of the frontier molecular orbitals determine the optoelectronic properties in organic films, which are crucial for their application, and strongly depend on the morphology and supramolecular structure. The impact of the latter two properties on the electronic energy levels relies primarily on nearest&#8208;neighbor interactions, which are difficult to study due to their nanoscale nature and heterogeneity. Here,&#160;an automated method is presented for fabricating thin films with a tailored ratio of surface to bulk sites and a controlled extension of domain edges, both of which are used to control nearest&#8208;neighbor interactions. This method uses a Langmuir&#8211;Schaefer&#8208;type rolling transfer of Langmuir layers (rtLL) to minimize flow during the deposition of rigid Langmuir layers composed of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. Using UV&#8211;vis absorption spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy, it is shown that the rtLL method advances the deposition of multi&#8208;Langmuir layers and enables the production of films with defined morphology. The variation in nearest&#8208;neighbor interactions is thus achieved and the resulting systematically tuned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies (determined via square&#8208;wave voltammetry) enable the establishment of a model that functionally relates the LUMO energies to a morphological descriptor, allowing for the prediction of the range of accessible LUMO energies.

         <title>Soft&#8211;Rigid Heterostructures with Functional Cation Vacancies for Fast&#8208;Charging and High&#8208;Capacity Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of a soft&#8211;rigid Co9S8@MoS2 heterostructure is proposed and realized in sodium&#8208;ion batteries, which is confirmed by electrochemical tests and theoretical calculations. The synergy of heterostructure and functional cation vacancies can effectively lower the mechanical stress, decrease Na+&#8208;diffusion barriers and maintain structural stability, resulting in high rate capacity and remarkable cycling performance.








Abstract
Optimizing charge transfer and alleviating volume expansion in electrode materials are critical to maximize electrochemical performance for energy&#8208;storage systems. Herein, an atomically thin soft&#8211;rigid Co9S8@MoS2 core&#8211;shell heterostructure with dual cation vacancies at the atomic interface is constructed as a promising anode for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The dual cation vacancies involving VCo and VMo in the heterostructure and the soft MoS2 shell afford ionic pathways for rapid charge transfer, as well as the rigid Co9S8 core acting as the dominant active component and resisting structural deformation during charge&#8211;discharge. Electrochemical testing and theoretical calculations demonstrate both excellent Na+&#8208;transfer kinetics and pseudocapacitive behavior. Consequently, the soft&#8211;rigid heterostructure delivers extraordinary sodium&#8208;storage performance (389.7&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles at 5.0 A g&#8722;1), superior to those of the single&#8208;phase counterparts: the assembled Na3V2(PO4)3||d&#8208;Co9S8@MoS2/S&#8208;Gr full cell achieves an energy density of 235.5&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 0.5 C. This finding opens up a unique strategy of soft&#8211;rigid heterostructure and broadens the horizons of material design in energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Diode&#8208;Like Heterojunction for Improving Electricity Generation from Water Droplets by Capillary Infiltration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the continuous power generation from water droplets by capillary infiltration, an Al2O3/PVDF based hydrovoltaic electricity generator with an ion&#8208;diode&#8208;like heterojunction is developed. With a drop of water, this device can generate a peak short&#8208;circuit current density of 160 &#181;A cm&#8722;2, an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.7 V, and an accumulated charge of 60 mC cm&#8722;2 in 1000 s.








Abstract
Water&#8208;droplet&#8208;based electricity generators are emerging hydrovoltaic technologies that harvest energy from water circulation through strong interactions between water and nanomaterials. However, such devices exhibit poor current performance owing to their unclear driving force (evaporation or infiltration) and undesirable reverse diffusion current. Herein, a water&#8208;droplet&#8208;based hydrovoltaic electricity generator induced by capillary infiltration with an asymmetric structure composed of a diode&#8208;like heterojunction formed by negatively and positively charged materials is fabricated. This device can generate current densities of 160 and 450&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2 at room temperature and 65 &#176;C, respectively. The heterojunction achieves a rectification ratio of 12, which effectively suppresses the reverse current caused by concentration differences. This results in an improved charge accumulation of &#8776;60 mC cm&#8722;2 in 1000 s, which is three times the value observed in the control device. When the area of the device is increased to 6 cm2, the current increases linearly to 1&#160;mA, thus demonstrating the scale&#8208;up potential of the generator. It has been proven that the streaming potential originates from&#160;capillary infiltration, and the presence of ion rectification.

     alt="Ion-Diode-Like Heterojunction for Improving Electricity Generation from Water Droplets by Capillary Infiltration"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve the continuous power generation from water droplets by capillary infiltration, an Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/PVDF based hydrovoltaic electricity generator with an ion-diode-like heterojunction is developed. With a drop of water, this device can generate a peak short-circuit current density of 160 &#181;A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, an open-circuit voltage of 0.7 V, and an accumulated charge of 60 mC cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 1000 s.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water-droplet-based electricity generators are emerging hydrovoltaic technologies that harvest energy from water circulation through strong interactions between water and nanomaterials. However, such devices exhibit poor current performance owing to their unclear driving force (evaporation or infiltration) and undesirable reverse diffusion current. Herein, a water-droplet-based hydrovoltaic electricity generator induced by capillary infiltration with an asymmetric structure composed of a diode-like heterojunction formed by negatively and positively charged materials is fabricated. This device can generate current densities of 160 and 450&#160;&#181;A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature and 65 &#176;C, respectively. The heterojunction achieves a rectification ratio of 12, which effectively suppresses the reverse current caused by concentration differences. This results in an improved charge accumulation of &#8776;60 mC cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 1000 s, which is three times the value observed in the control device. When the area of the device is increased to 6 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the current increases linearly to 1&#160;mA, thus demonstrating the scale-up potential of the generator. It has been proven that the streaming potential originates from&#160;capillary infiltration, and the presence of ion rectification. The proposed method of constructing ion-diode-like structures provides a new strategy for improving generator performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Restraining Interfacial Cu2+ by using Amorphous SnO2 as Sacrificial Protection Boosts CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by corrosion science, a sacrificial protection strategy is proposed to stabilize interfacial crystalline CuO through embedding of active amorphous SnO2 to enhance the electrocatalytic performance for CO2 electroreduction to formate. The high active interface can significantly lower the energy barrier of the limited step (*CO2 &#8594; *HCOO) of the carbon dioxide reduction and enhance its selectivity and activity for formate. 








Abstract
The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formate is of great interest in the field of electrochemical energy. Cu&#8208;based material is an appealing electrocatalyst for the CO2RR. However, retaining Cu2+ under the high cathodic potential of CO2RR remains a great challenge, leading to low electrocatalytic selectivity, activity, and stability. Herein, inspired by corrosion science, a sacrificial protection strategy to stabilize interfacial crystalline CuO through embedding of active amorphous SnO2 (c&#8208;CuO/a&#8208;SnO2) is reported, which greatly boosts the electrocatalytic sensitivity, activity, and stability for CO2RR to formate. The as&#8208;made hybrid catalyst can achieve superior high selectivity for CO2RR to formate with a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 96.7%, and a superhigh current density of over 1 A cm&#8722;2 that far outperforms industrial benchmarks (FE &gt; 90%, current density &gt; 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X&#8208;ray diffractionexperimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the broadened s&#8208;orbital in interfacial a&#8208;SnO2 offers the lower orbital for extra electrons than Cu2+, which can effectively retain nearby Cu2+, and the high active interface significantly lowers the energy barrier of the limited step (*CO2 &#8594; *HCOO) and enhances the selectivity and activity for CO2RR to formate.

         <title>Skin Thermal Management for Subcutaneous Photoelectric Conversion Reaching 500&#160;mW</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A subcutaneous power supply device utilizing second near&#8208;infrared light is proposed with the synergistic combination of photovoltaic cells and a thermoelectric generator. Skin thermal management is used to turn photothermal toxicity into a favorable factor for photoelectric conversion. In in vivo experiment, its output power can be higher than 500&#160;mW with a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 9.4%.








Abstract
Despite possessing higher tissue transmittance and maximum permissible exposure power density for skin relative to other electromagnetic waves, second near&#8208;infrared light (1000&#8211;1350&#160;nm) is scarcely applicable to subcutaneous photoelectric conversion, owing to the companion photothermal effect. Here, skin thermal management is conceived to utmostly utilize the photothermal effect of a photovoltaic cell, which not only improves the photoelectric conversion efficiency but also eliminates skin hyperthermia. In vivo, the output power can be higher than 500&#160;mW with a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 9.4%. This output power is promising to recharge all the clinically applied implantable devices via wireless power transmission, that is, clinical pacemakers (6&#8211;200&#160;&#181;W), drug pumps (0.5&#8211;2&#160;mW), cochlear (5&#8211;40&#160;mW), and wireless endo&#8208;photo cameras (&#8776;100&#160;mW).

         <title>Folding Double&#8208;Stranded DNA into Designed Shapes with Triplex&#8208;Forming Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double&#8208;stranded DNA is cooperatively compacted into designed shapes by triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotides, which bridge multiple normal or reverse Hoogsteen recognition domains. Hoogsteen&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly is highly programmable, methodologically straightforward, and yields large uniquely addressable nanostructures at low&#8208;cost. Moreover, the presented &#8220;triplex origami&#8221; method enables unprecedented spatial control over dsDNA templates not achievable by other artificial methodologies.








Abstract
The compaction and organization of genomic DNA is a central mechanism in eukaryotic cells, but engineered architectural control over double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) is notably challenging. Here, long dsDNA templates are folded into designed shapes via triplex&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly. Triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) bind purines in dsDNA via normal or reverse Hoogsteen interactions. In the triplex origami methodology, these non&#8208;canonical interactions are programmed to compact dsDNA (linear or plasmid) into well&#8208;defined objects, which demonstrate a variety of structural features: hollow and raster&#8208;filled, single&#8208; and multi&#8208;layered, with custom curvatures and geometries, and featuring lattice&#8208;free, square&#8208;, or honeycomb&#8208;pleated internal arrangements. Surprisingly, the length of integrated and free&#8208;standing dsDNA loops can be modulated with near&#8208;perfect efficiency; from hundreds down to only six bp (2&#160;nm). The inherent rigidity of dsDNA promotes structural robustness and non&#8208;periodic structures of almost 25.000&#160;nt are therefore formed with fewer unique starting materials, compared to other DNA&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly methods. Densely triplexed structures also resist degradation by DNase I. Triplex&#8208;mediated dsDNA folding is methodologically straightforward and orthogonal to Watson&#8208;Crick&#8208;based methods. Moreover, it enables unprecedented spatial control over dsDNA templates.

         <title>Conversion of Dielectric Surface Effect into Volume Effect for High Output Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conversion of the dielectric surface effect into a volume effect is proposed for a high output energy of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). In this work, the physics mechanism of thick dielectric films used in TENGs is identified and a new approach to promote the output and durability of TENGs is provided.








Abstract
Improving the output energy and durability of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) remains a considerable challenge for their practical applications. Owing to the interface effect of triboelectrification and electrostatic induction, thinner films with higher dielectric constants yield a higher output; however, they are not durable for practical applications. Herein, the dielectric surface effect is changed into a volume effect by adopting a millimeter&#8208;thick dielectric film with an inner porous network structure so that charges can hop in the surface state of the network. Charge migration inside the dielectric film is the key factor affecting the output of the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)&#160;with a thick film, based on which each working stage follows the energy&#8208;maximization principle in the voltage&#8211;charge plot. The maximum peak and average power densities of the TENG with polyurethane foam film in 1&#160;mm thickness reach 40.9 and 20.7&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;Hz&#8722;1, respectively, under environmental conditions, and the output charge density is 5.14&#160;times that of TENGs with a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) film of the same thickness. Superdurability is achieved in the rotary&#8208;mode TENG&#160;after 200&#160;000 operation cycles. This study identifies the physical mechanism of the thick dielectric film used in TENGs and provides a new approach to promote the output and durability of TENGs.

The maximum peak and average power densities of the TENG with polyurethane foam film in 1&#160;mm thickness reach 40.9 and 20.7&#160;W&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;Hz&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, under environmental conditions, and the output charge density is 5.14&#160;times that of TENGs with a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) film of the same thickness. Superdurability is achieved in the rotary-mode TENG&#160;after 200&#160;000 operation cycles. This study identifies the physical mechanism of the thick dielectric film used in TENGs and provides a new approach to promote the output and durability of TENGs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Porous, Ultrathin PtAgBiTe Nanosheets for Direct Hydrazine Hydrate Fuel Cell Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous, ultrathin PtAgBiTe polycrystalline nanosheets with widths beyond 700 nm are synthesized via a visible&#8208;light&#8208;photoinduced Bi2Te3&#8208;nanosheet&#8208;mediated route, and are employed as anode electrocatalysts for hydrazine hydrate oxidation reaction and actual direct hydrazine hydrate fuel cells. The peak power densities of the PtAgBiTe polycrystalline nanosheets in actual hydrazine&#8211;O2/air fuel cell devices are 532.9/315.9 mW cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Ultrathin 2D&#160;nanomaterials have attracted extensive attention due to their fascinating applications in sustainable and clean&#8208;energy&#8208;related devices, but obtaining ultrathin 2D multimetallic polycrystalline structures with large lateral dimensions remains a challenge. In this study, ultrathin 2D porous PtAgBiTe and PtBiTe polycrystalline nanosheets (PNSs) are obtained via a visible&#8208;light&#8208;photoinduced Bi2Te3&#8208;nanosheet&#8208;mediated route. The PtAgBiTe PNSs are assembled by sub&#8208;5&#160;nm grains with widths beyond 700&#160;nm. Strain and ligand effects originating from the porous, curly polycrystalline structure endow the PtAgBiTe PNSs with robust hydrazine hydrate oxidation reaction activity. Theoretical research demonstrates that the modified Pt activates the N&#8211;H bonds in N2H4 during the reaction, and strong hybridization between Pt&#8208;5d and N&#8208;2p facilitates dehydrogenation while reducing energy consumption. The peak power densities of the PtAgBiTe PNSs in actual hydrazine&#8208;O2/air fuel cell devices are boosted to 532.9/315.9&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, while those of the commercial Pt/C are 394.7/157.9&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This work provides a strategy not only for preparing ultrathin multimetallic PNSs but also for finding promising electrocatalysts for actual hydrazine fuel cells.

         <title>Implantable, Biodegradable, and Wireless Triboelectric Devices for Cancer Therapy through Disrupting Microtubule and Actins Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An implantable, biodegradable, and wireless triboelectric device is developed for cancer therapy. The significantly enhanced tumor therapeutic effects against a broad&#8208;spectrum of tumors through cell and animal experiments are demonstrated.








Abstract
Electric&#8208;field&#8208;based stimulation is emerging as a new cancer therapeutic modality through interfering with cell mitosis. To address its limitations of complicated wire connections, bulky devices, and coarse spatial resolution, an improved and alternative method is proposed for wirelessly delivering electrical stimulation into tumor tissues through designing an implantable, biodegradable, and wirelessly controlled therapeutic triboelectric nanogenerator (ET&#8208;TENG). With the excitation of ultrasound (US) to the ET&#8208;TENG, the implanted ET&#8208;TENG can generate an alternating current voltage and concurrently release the loaded anti&#8208;mitotic drugs into tumor tissues, which synergistically disrupts the assembly of microtubules and filament actins, induces cell cycle arrest, and finally enhances cell death. With the assistance of US, the device can be completely degraded after the therapy, getting free of a secondary surgical extraction. The device can not only work around those unresectable tumors, but also provides a new application of wireless electric field in cancer therapy.

         <title>Mechanoluminescence and Photoluminescence Heterojunction for Superior Multimode Sensing Platform of Friction, Force, Pressure, and Temperature in Fibers and 3D&#8208;Printed Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a multifunctional sensing platform in the form of photo&#8208;/mechano&#8208;luminescent powder, fibers, and 3D&#8208;printed polymers for optical detection of pressure, temperature, force, and friction is reported. The combination of 3D&#8208;printing with fiber spinning demonstrates the possibility of mass production of mechanoluminescence&#8208;active mechanical and optoelectronic parts integrated with scientific and industrial tools and apparatus.








Abstract
Endowing a single material with various types of luminescence, that is, exhibiting a simultaneous optical response to different stimuli, is vital in various fields. A photoluminescence (PL)&#8208; and mechanoluminescence (ML)&#8208;based multifunctional sensing platform is built by combining heterojunctioned ZnS/CaZnOS:Mn2+ mechano&#8208;photonic materials using a 3D&#8208;printing technique and fiber spinning. ML&#8208;active particles are embedded in micrometer&#8208;sized cellulose fibers for flexible optical devices capable of emitting light driven by mechanical force. Individually modified 3D&#8208;printed hard units that exhibit intense ML in response to mechanical deformation, such as impact and friction, are also fabricated. Importantly, they also allow low&#8208;pressure sensing up to &#8776;100&#160;bar, a range previously inaccessible by any other optical sensing technique. Moreover, the developed optical manometer based on the PL of the materials demonstrates a superior high&#8208;pressure sensitivity of &#8776;6.20&#160;nm&#160;GPa&#8722;1. Using this sensing platform, four modes of temperature detection can be achieved: excitation&#8208;band spectral shifts, emission&#8208;band spectral shifts, bandwidth broadening, and lifetime shortening. This work supports the possibility of mass production of ML&#8208;active mechanical and optoelectronic parts integrated with scientific and industrial tools and apparatus.

         <title>Unlocking High&#8208;Performance Ammonium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Activation of In&#8208;Layer Channels for Enhanced Ion Storage and Migration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study proposes an electrochemical phase transformation approach for the in situ synthesis of layered VOPO4&#183;2H2O (E&#8208;VOPO) for ammonium&#8208;ion batteries. The in&#8208;layer channels provide additional NH4+ storage sites and rapid cross&#8208;layer migration pathways. The E&#8208;VOPO shows exceptional NH4+ storage performance with increased capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability. The resulting full cell operates stably for 12&#160;500 charge&#8211;discharge cycles.








Abstract
Ammonium&#8208;ion batteries, leveraging non&#8208;metallic ammonium ions, have arisen as a promising electrochemical energy storage system; however, their advancement has been hindered by the scarcity of high&#8208;performance ammonium&#8208;ion storage materials. In this study, an electrochemical phase transformation approach is proposed for the in situ synthesis of layered VOPO4&#183;2H2O (E&#8208;VOPO) with predominant growth on the (200) plane, corresponding to the tetragonal channels on the (001) layers. The findings reveal that these tetragonal in&#8208;layer channels not only furnish NH4+ storage sites but also enhance transfer kinetics by providing rapid cross&#8208;layer migration pathways. This crucial aspect has been largely overlooked in previous studies. The E&#8208;VOPO electrode exhibits exceptional ammonium&#8208;ion storage performance, including significantly increased specific capacity, enhanced rate capability, and robust cycling stability. The resulting full cell can be stably operated for 12&#160;500 charge&#8211;discharge cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1 for over 70 days. The proposed approach offers a new strategy for meticulously engineering electrode materials with facilitated ion storage and migration, thereby paving the way for developing more efficient and sustainable energy storage systems.

         <title>Indirect Electrocatalysis S&#9472;N/S&#9472;S Bond Construction by Robust Polyoxometalate Based Foams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of di&#8208;copper&#8208;substituted phosphotungstate based foams (PW10Cu2@CMC) with tunable loadings (17 to 44 wt%) is fabricated, which can be successfully applied in indirect electrocatalytic syntheses of sulfenamides and disulfides.








Abstract
Indirect electrocatalytic conversion of cheap organic raw materials via the activation of S&#9472;H and N&#9472;H bonds into the value&#8208;added S&#9472;N/S&#9472;S bonds chemicals for industrial rubber production is a promising strategy to realize the atomic economic reaction, during which the kinetic inhibition that is associated with the electron transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface in traditional direct electrocatalysis can be eliminated to achieve higher performance. In this work, a series of di&#8208;copper&#8208;substituted phosphotungstatebased foams (PW10Cu2@CMC) are fabricated with tunable loadings (17 to 44&#160;wt%), which can be successfully applied in indirect electrocatalytic syntheses of sulfenamides and disulfides. Specifically, the optimal PW10Cu2@CMC (44&#160;wt%) exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for the construction of S&#9472;N/S&#9472;S bonds (yields up to 99%) coupling with the efficient production of H2 (&#8776;50&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1). Remarkably, it enables the scale&#8208;up production (&#8776;14.4&#160;g in a batch experiment) and the obtained products can serve as rubber vulcanization accelerators with superior properties to traditional industrial rubber additives in real industrial processes. This powerful catalysis system that can simultaneously produce rubber vulcanization accelerator and H2 may inaugurate a new electrocatalytic avenue to explore polyoxometalate&#8208;based foam catalysts in electrocatalysis field.

DNA Nanotechnology
DNA nanotechnology, so far, has almost exclusively relied on Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing. In article number 2302497, Minke A. D. Nijenhuis, Kurt V. Gothelf, and co&#8208;workers introduce a triplex origami methodology. They demonstrate that triplex DNA, formed by Hoogsteen interactions, also possesses remarkable potential for nanoscale engineering. Triplex origami enables unprecedented large&#8208;scale architectural control over double&#8208;stranded DNA templates, folding and compacting them into sheets, bundles, and even custom potted flower shapes.

Tissue Regeneration
In article number 2300180, Hao Chen, Wenguo Cui, Yuhui Zhang, and co&#8208;workers propose a hydrogel&#8208;microsphere&#8208;based synthetic niche with cell recruiting and targeted cell differentiation properties via mechanotransduction. The microsphere niche guides the fate of endogenous stem cells in the aberrant mechanical microenvironment, offering an effective strategy for enhancing the endogenous regeneration of degenerated tissues.

Polar Oxide Surfaces
In article number 2303051, Jaekwang Lee, Sang Ho Oh, and co&#8208;workers discover a hitherto unknown stabilization mechanism of polar oxide surfaces using in situ atomic&#8208;scale electron microscopy combined with atomic simulation. The dynamic motion of atomic steps, activated at a high temperature, converts the LaAlO3 (001) polar surface to a nonpolar (015) vicinal surface via a step reconstruction involving cation vacancy formation, which completely cancels the electric fields along all radial directions.

Superconducting Diode Effect
Magnetization control of the superconducting diode effect (SDE), which causes a superconducting state in one direction and a normal&#8208;conducting state in another, has significant potential for developing ultralow power consumption circuits and non&#8208;volatile memory. In article number 2304083, Hideki Narita, Teruo Ono, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate an intrinsic zero&#8208;field SDE with an efficiency of up to 40% in Fe/Pt&#8208;inserted non&#8208;centrosymmetric Nb/V/Ta superconducting artificial superlattices.

         <title>Porosity as a Design Element for Developing Catalytic Molecular Materials for Electrochemical and Photochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular materials catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), that feature permanent porosity as a design feature, are showcased. Selected examples provide insights into how different approaches to this overall design strategy can augment their electrocatalytic and/or photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity.








Abstract
The catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) using sustainable energy inputs is a promising strategy for upcycling of atmospheric carbon into value&#8208;added chemical products. This goal has inspired the development of catalysts for selective and efficient CO2 conversion using electrochemical and photochemical methods. Among the diverse array of catalyst systems designed for this purpose, 2D and 3D platforms that feature porosity offer the potential to combine carbon capture and conversion. Included are covalent organic frameworks (COFs), metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), porous molecular cages, and other hybrid molecular materials developed to increase active site exposure, stability, and water compatibility while maintaining precise molecular tunability. This mini&#8208;review showcases catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) that incorporate well&#8208;defined molecular elements integrated into porous materials structures. Selected examples provide insights into how different approaches to this overall design strategy can augment their electrocatalytic and/or photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity.

         <title>Sorption&#8208;Based Atmospheric Water Harvesting: Materials, Components, Systems, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is great potential for air humidity not only to provide water for drinking and agriculture, but also to be used for energy/fuel production, energy conservation, and humidity/thermal management. Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) technology makes this possible even in dry regions. The purpose of this paper is to review comprehensively the materials, designs, components, and application of SAWH.








Abstract
Freshwater scarcity is a global challenge posing threats to the lives and daily activities of humankind such that two&#8208;thirds of the global population currently experience water shortages. Atmospheric water, irrespective of geographical location, is considered as an alternative water source. Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) has recently emerged as an efficient strategy for decentralized water production. SAWH thus opens up a self&#8208;sustaining source of freshwater that can potentially support the global population for various applications. In this review, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of SAWH, considering its operation principle, thermodynamic analysis, energy assessment, materials, components, different designs, productivity improvement, scale&#8208;up, and application for drinking water, is first extensively explored. Thereafter, the practical integration and potential application of SAWH, beyond drinking water, for wide range of utilities in agriculture, fuel/electricity production, thermal management in building services, electronic devices, and textile are comprehensively discussed. The various strategies to reduce human reliance on natural water resources by integrating SAWH into existing technologies, particularly in underdeveloped countries, in order to satisfy the interconnected needs for food, energy, and water are also examined. This study further highlights the urgent need and future research directions to intensify the design and development of hybrid&#8208;SAWH systems for sustainability and diverse applications.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Redox Bicatalysis Batteries for Energy Storage and Chemical Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review article, the fundamentals and design principles of metal&#8208;redox bicatalysis battery (constructed by redox bifunctional catalyst cathode and metal anode) are summarized and proposed, and the effects of device structure and compositions are deeply discussed for energy storage and chemical production, which provides a design paradigm for new types of energy storage and conversion devices.








Abstract
New types of electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices based on redox electrocatalytic reactions possess great potential in renewable energy to maximize energy utilization and balance environmental issues. The typical device is the metal&#8208;redox bicatalysis battery, where the cathode is redox bifunctional catalyst&#160;(named as redox bicatalyst) with gas, solid, liquid as active reactants while anode is metal, driven by cathodic redox electrocatalytic reactions during charge/discharge processes, which promotes the energy storage and chemical production.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New types of electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices based on redox electrocatalytic reactions possess great potential in renewable energy to maximize energy utilization and balance environmental issues. The typical device is the metal-redox bicatalysis battery, where the cathode is redox bifunctional catalyst&#160;(named as redox bicatalyst) with gas, solid, liquid as active reactants while anode is metal, driven by cathodic redox electrocatalytic reactions during charge/discharge processes, which promotes the energy storage and chemical production. In this system, the metal anode, redox-bicatalyst cathode, electrolytes, and the redox electrochemical reactions can be modified and adjusted to achieve the optimal energy conversion and utilization. Therefore, the deep understanding of the electrochemical system is conducive to designing new devices to meet the demand among various applications, including energy storage and conversion. In this review, the authors clarify the fundamentals and design principles of the rechargeable/reversible metal-redox bicatalysis batteries and how each part affects the devices in energy conversion and chemical production. The authors summarize the electrocatalytic reduction/oxidation reactions, the reported systems relied on redox reactions, and the corresponding redox bicatalysts. Finally, a perspective of the key challenges and the possible new types of metal-redox bicatalysis batteries for efficient energy utilization and chemical production are given.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Meet Polymers: From Synthesis Strategies to Healthcare Applications</title>

Hybridizing metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with flexible polymers leads to unique properties wherein the incorporation of suitable polymers enhances the MOF performance. This review highlights the recent advances in the preparation of MOF&#8211;polymer nanomaterials, and discusses their applications in anticancer therapy, anti&#8208;bacteria treatment, imaging, protection from oxidative stress and inflammation, and environmental remediation. Insights from the current research and design principles are revealed for addressing future challenges.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been at the forefront of nanotechnological research for the past decade owing to their high porosity, high surface area, diverse configurations, and controllable chemical structures. They are a rapidly developing class of nanomaterials that are predominantly applied in batteries, supercapacitors, electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, sensors, drug delivery, gas separation, adsorption, and storage. However, the limited functions and unsatisfactory performance of MOFs resulting from their low chemical and mechanical stability hamper further development. Hybridizing MOFs with polymers is an excellent solution to these problems, because polymers&#8212;which are soft, flexible, malleable, and processable&#8212;can induce unique properties in the hybrids based on those of the two disparate components while retaining their individuality. This review highlights recent advances in the preparation of MOF&#8211;polymer nanomaterials. Furthermore, several applications wherein the incorporation of polymers enhances the MOF performance are discussed, such as anticancer therapy, bacterial elimination, imaging, therapeutics, protection from oxidative stress and inflammation, and environmental remediation. Finally, insights from the focus of existing research and design principles for mitigating future challenges are presented.

         <title>Catalyst Development for High&#8208;Temperature Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (HT&#8208;PEMFC) Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review outlines catalyst advancements for high&#8208;temperature polymer electrolyte fuel
cells operating at elevated temperatures (160&#8208;180 &#176;C). These cells utilize reformate/air gasses and employ phosphoric acid within the polybenzimidazole polymer matrix as a proton&#8208;conducting medium. Catalysts employed are platinum or platinum&#8208;alloyed nanoparticles immobilized on a carbon support.








Abstract
A constant increase in global emission standard is causing fuel cell (FC) technology to gain importance. Over the last two decades, a great deal of research has been focused on developing more active catalysts to boost the performance of high&#8208;temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFC), as well as their durability. Due to material degradation at high&#8208;temperature conditions, catalyst design becomes challenging. Two main approaches are suggested: (i) alloying platinum (Pt) with low&#8208;cost transition metals to reduce Pt usage, and (ii) developing novel catalyst support that anchor metal particles more efficiently while inhibiting corrosion phenomena. In this comprehensive review, the most recent platinum group metal (PGM) and platinum group metal free (PGM&#8208;free) catalyst development is detailed, as well as the development of alternative carbon (C) supports for HT&#8208;PEMFCs.
