         <title>Robust Nanoscale Anode Protective Layers toward Fast&#8208;Charge High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin (&#8776;84&#160;nm) and robust protective layer is constructed by reactive molecular brushes (GO&#8208;g&#8208;PSSAg). Benefiting from the in situ reaction between PSSAg side&#8208;chains and Li metal, the modified Li anode integrates abundant Li&#8208;ion conducting PSSLi chains, robust GO backbones, and Li&#8211;Ag solid solution, thereby enabling molecular&#8208;level homogeneous and fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion, remarkable mechanical strength and homogeneous Li deposition.








Abstract
Mechanically stable and structurally homogeneous lithium&#8211;electrolyte interfacial layers are crucial in stabilizing lithium (Li) anodes for practical Li metal batteries. Herein, an ultrathin (&#8776;84&#160;nm) and robust artificial protective layer is constructed with reactive two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molecular brushes as building blocks. The artificial protective layer can in situ react with underlying Li metal to produce a nanoscale poly(lithium styrenesulfonate)&#8208;grafted graphene oxide (GO&#8208;g&#8208;PSSLi) layer on the outermost surface and an infinite Li&#8211;Ag solid solution in the anode. The nanoscale GO&#8208;g&#8208;PSSLi layer well integrates a large number of single Li&#8208;ion conducting PSSLi chains and 2D robust GO backbones, thereby enabling molecular&#8208;level homogeneous and fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion as well as remarkable mechanical strength. Meanwhile, the simultaneously formed Li&#8211;Ag solid solution is beneficial for rapid Li transport in the anode to reduce the Li nucleation barrier and facilitate homogeneous deposition of Li. With such artificial protective layers, a prototype pouch cell with a thin Li metal anode (50&#160;&#181;m) and a high&#8208;loading cathode (21.6&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) delivers an impressive cycle life of over 350 cycles with 69% capacity retention under harsh conditions. Remarkably, ultrahigh charging power density of 456&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1 and energy density of 325&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 can be simultaneously achieved in an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Organic Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence Based on Biomass Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance ultralong biomass room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) doped systems with phosphorescence quantum up to 32.8%, lifetime up to 4.65 s, and multi&#8208;stimulus response through multiple interactions between host biomass macrocycle and guest is reported. The RTP performance of biomass macrocycle doped systems far exceeds biomass systems ever reported and compares favorably with highly effective polymer systems.








Abstract
The pursuit of sustainable, high&#8208;performance organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (OURTP) materials with stimulus&#8208;responsive properties presents a significant and enticing yet formidable challenge. Herein, an efficient strategy to confining boric acid&#8208;based compounds into biomass macrocycle &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin through multiple interactions is developed, enabling the construction of high&#8208;performance and multicolor OURTP doped systems. The synergistic effects of strong hydrogen bonding, C&#9472;O&#9472;B covalent cross&#8208;linking, and host&#8211;guest encapsulation significantly suppress non&#8208;radiative transition, culminating in an extraordinary lifetime and excellent phosphorescence quantum yield of 4.65 s and 32.8%, respectively, which are far superior to reported biomass RTP materials. Additionally, merging biomass macrocycle with phosphors contributes to multiple stimulus responses, overcoming the inherent limitations of degradation and recycling of organic RTP compounds, and dynamically modulating RTP signals through multiple&#8208;stimulus responses, achieving the integration of multifunctional dynamic data processing techniques. This work will provide a direction for new environmentally friendly and potentially commercially available stimulus&#8208;responsive OURTP materials.

         <title>Reactive Plasma Deposition of ITO as an Efficient Buffer Layer for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the use of reactive plasma deposition (RPD) to fabricate indium tin oxide (ITO) buffer layers for wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells. The RPD&#8208;ITO devices exhibit enhanced thermal stability, reduced recombination losses, and improved efficiency. A four&#8208;terminal tandem cell achieves a high power conversion efficiency of 29.03%, showcasing the potential of RPD for advanced photovoltaics.








Abstract
In this study, the potential of reactive plasma deposition (RPD) is demonstrated for fabricating indium tin oxide (ITO) as an efficient buffer layer in inverted wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This method results in a certified efficiency of 21.33% for wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs, demonstrating superior thermal stability and operational stability. The optimized devices achieve an impressive open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.252&#160;V with a bandgap of 1.67&#160;eV, resulting in a remarkably low voltage deficit of 0.418&#160;V, attributed to improved electron extraction, reduced interface defects, and suppressed surface recombination. The cells maintain over 90% of their initial efficiency after 1023&#160;h of thermal aging at 88&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, by integrating a highly efficient semi&#8208;transparent PSC with a CIGS bottom cell, a four&#8208;terminal tandem configuration is achieved with a total efficiency of 29.03%, representing one of the most efficient perovskite/CIGS tandem solar cells reported to date. This study provides valuable insights into the potential of RPD for improving the performance and scalability of inverted wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs.

         <title>Current&#8208;Driven Magnetization Switching for Superconducting Diode Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The superconducting magnetization diode effect in stacking superconductors with ferromagnetic materials heterostructures, enabling robust magnetization readout through superconductivity with an ideally infinite on/off ratio, is demonstrated. Combining spin&#8211;orbit torque for current&#8208;driven magnetization switching, this work bridges superconductivity and spintronics, offering scalable, energy&#8208;efficient memory solutions with simplified design and improved performance.









Abstract
Stacking superconductors (SC) with ferromagnetic materials (FM) significantly impact superconductivity, enabling the emergence of spin&#8208;triplet states and topological superconductivity. The tuning of superconductivity in SC&#8208;FM heterostructure is also reflected in the recently discovered superconducting diode effect, characterized by nonreciprocal electric transport when time and inversion symmetries are broken. Notably, in SC&#8208;FM systems, a time reversal operation reverses both current and magnetization, leading to the conceptualization of superconducting magnetization diode effect (SMDE). In this variant, while the current direction remains fixed, the critical currents shall be different when reversing the magnetization. Here, the existence of SMDE in SC&#8208;FM heterostructures is demonstrated. SMDE uniquely maps magnetization states onto superconductivity by setting the read current between two critical currents for the positive and negative magnetization directions, respectively. Thus, the magnetization states can be read by measuring the superconductivity, while the writing process is accomplished by manipulating magnetization states through current&#8208;driven spin&#8211;orbit torque to switch the superconductivity. The proposed superconducting diode magnetoresistance in SC&#8208;FM heterostructures with an ideally infinite on/off ratio resolves the limitations of tunneling magnetoresistance in the magnetic tunneling junctions, thereby contributing to the advancement of superconducting spintronics.

         <title>Rapid Drying Principle for High&#8208;speed, Pinhole&#8208;Less, Uniform Wet Deposition Protocols of Water&#8208;Dispersed 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;speed and inexpensive deposition techniques are crucial for the practical application of 2D materials. Rapid drying principle deriving hot dipping and air knife sweeping deposition protocols achieves film uniformity, scalability, and tunable thickness simultaneously by suppressing time for secondary flows. The large&#8208;area extendibility, pinhole&#8208;less feature, and m2&#160;min&#8722;1&#8208;level deposition speed offer unprecedented processes for 2D materials&#8208;based nanodevices more cheaply.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;High-speed and inexpensive deposition techniques are crucial for the practical application of 2D materials. Rapid drying principle deriving hot dipping and air knife sweeping deposition protocols achieves film uniformity, scalability, and tunable thickness simultaneously by suppressing time for secondary flows. The large-area extendibility, pinhole-less feature, and m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;-level deposition speed offer unprecedented processes for 2D materials-based nanodevices more cheaply.

         <title>Ordering&#8208;Structured Antiferroelectric Composite Ceramics for Energy Storage Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the layered architecture of natural nacre and with the guidance of phase&#8208;filed simulations, a strategy of controlling the morphology and ordering of Al2O3 fillers in Pb&#8208;based AFE composite ceramics is proposed, aiming to improve its breakdown strength. Significantly improved Eb of 570&#160;kV cm&#8722;1 and ultrahigh Wrec of 13.2 J cm&#8722;3 are achieved in composite ceramics with parallel&#8208;aligned Al2O3 plates.








Abstract
Dielectric capacitors possessing high power density and ultrashort discharge time are valuable for high&#8208;power energy storage applications. However, achieving high energy storage density remains challenging due to the limited breakdown strength of dielectric ceramics. In this study, inspired by the layered architecture of natural nacre and with the guidance of phase&#8208;field simulations, a strategy of constructing a nacre&#8208;like layered structure is proposed to improve the breakdown strength and energy storage density of the ceramics. This unique structure is formed by controlling the morphology and ordering of high&#8208;voltage&#8208;resistant fillers in a ceramic matrix. The (Pb0.98La0.02)(Zr0.7Sn0.3)0.995O3&#8208;Al2O3 antiferroelectric composite ceramics, containing 5vol% parallel&#8208;aligned Al2O3 plates, demonstrate a remarkable enhancement in breakdown strength from 390 to 570&#160;kV cm&#8722;1. Of particular importance is that an ultrahigh recoverable energy storage density of up to 13.2 J cm&#8722;3 is achieved, representing a 50% enhancement compared to the pure ceramic (8.7 J cm&#8722;3). The parallel&#8208;aligned Al2O3 plates are strongly bound together with the ceramic matrix, effectively blocking charge migration and controlling the breakdown path, thus greatly enhancing the voltage endurance of the composite ceramics. This work provides an innovative approach to designing high&#8208;performance composite ceramics for next&#8208;generation energy storage applications.

         <title>2D Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Composite Membranes for Nanofluidic Ionic Photoelectric Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully conjugated 2D hexaimino&#8208;substituted triphenylene&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (2D&#8208;HATP&#8208;cMOF) based composite membrane is reported for nanofluidic photoelectric conversion. Owing to the intrinsic advantage of multiple charge transport pathways, and open framework with nano&#8208;spaced, high&#8208;density pores, the 2D&#8208;HATP&#8208;cMOF&#8208;based composite membrane possesses fast photoelectric response, successful ion pump phenomenon, and efficient photoelectric energy conversion.








Abstract
Nanofluidic photoelectric conversion system based on photo&#8208;excitable 2D materials can directly transduce light stimuli into an ion&#8208;transport&#8208;mediated electric signal, showing potential for mimicking the retina's function with a more favorable human&#8211;robot interactions. However, the current membranes suffer from low generation efficiency of charge carriers due to the mixed microstructure and limited charge transport ability caused by the large interlayer spacing and monotonous pathway. Here, a fully conjugated 2D hexaimino&#8208;substituted triphenylene&#8208;based&#160;metal&#8211;organic framework (2D&#8208;HATP&#8208;cMOF) based composite membrane with high conductivity for photoelectric conversion is presented. The extended &#960;&#8208;d conjugation within the ab plane and the favorable transport pathway through &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of the c&#8208;MOF maximize the generation and transfer of charge carrier and greatly accelerate the ion transport. As a result, the 2D&#8208;HATP&#8208;cMOF&#8208;based composite membrane possesses ultrafast photoelectric response, superior to other reported 2D systems like graphene oxide (GO), transition metal carbides, carbonitrides and nitrides (MXene), and MoS2, which require at least 10 s. A successful ion pump phenomenon, that is active transport from low concentration to high concentration as an important way of information transmission in organisms, is realized based on the efficient photoelectric conversion capability. This work demonstrates the great promise of 2D c&#8208;MOF in ionic photoelectric conversion.

         <title>2D AgTiPS6: a Cross&#8208;Stacked In&#8208;Plane Anisotropic Semiconductor for Broadband and Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AgTiPS6 atomic layers, the 2D in&#8208;plane anisotropic material with cross&#8208;stacked motifs, are discovered and added to the 2D material family. They feature a thick monolayer, strong stability, and inherent anisotropy. As an in&#8208;plane anisotropic 2D semiconductor, AgTiPS6&#8208;based photodetectors demonstrate excellent photoresponse across a broad range from visible to mid&#8208;infrared, as well as high in&#8208;plane electrical (&#8776;5.44) and optoelectrical (&#8776;2.44) anisotropies. 








Abstract
2D anisotropic materials, typically consisting of 1D distorted chains arranged in parallel or anti&#8208;parallel patterns, are gaining attention for their potential in anisotropic electronic and optoelectronic devices. 2D anisotropic materials with cross&#8208;stacked interconnected 1D chains will show improved anisotropy and stability. Nonetheless, to date, no 2D anisotropic materials featuring cross&#8208;stacked motifs have been experimentally realized. This work identifies AgTiPS6 atomic layers, the 2D in&#8208;plane anisotropic material with cross&#8208;stacked structural motifs, as an n&#8208;type semiconductor with a 1.0&#160;eV band gap. Significantly, the unique cross&#8208;stacked configuration of 2D AgTiPS6 results in a significant in&#8208;plane anisotropy, with electrical and optoelectrical anisotropies measuring 5.44 and 2.44, respectively, as well as an axially orientation selectivity. Meanwhile, a broadband response from visible (Vis, 405&#160;nm) to middle infrared (MIR, 10.6&#160;&#181;m) is achieved in the AgTiPS6&#8208;based photodetector, with the photoresponse above the bandgap attributed to photothermoelectric effect. Furthermore, 2D AgTiPS6 has demonstrated environmental stability exceeding 12 months and a laser damage threshold exceeding 10&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2, attributed to its extra&#8208;thick monolayer (1.32&#160;nm). This work introduces a novel in&#8208;plane anisotropic material, expanding the repertoire of 2D anisotropic materials and offering potential for the development of anisotropic electronic and optoelectronic devices.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the development trend, solvation structures, interfacial chemistry, and latest progress of lithium salts are discussed from the perspectives of coordination chemistry and structural design, hoping to provide inspiration for the on&#8208;demand design/customization of lithium salts, thereby promoting the development of high&#8208;performance batteries.








Abstract
Lithium batteries, favored for their high energy density and long lifespan, are staples in electric vehicles, portable electronics, and aerospace. A key component, Li salts, aids lithium ion migration and electrode protection, significantly impacting battery performance. Developing an ideal Li salt, balancing stability, solubility, dissociation, solvation, and eco&#8208;friendliness, remains challenging. Given the scarcity of relevant reviews, it is endeavored here to present a novel perspective on Li salt chemistry, offering a concise roadmap for future designs and innovations. It is delved into the trends, opportunities, design principles, and evaluation methodologies related to Li salt chemistry, with a particular emphasis on organic anionic compositions. Furthermore, the latest and most representative organic Li salts from their intrinsic structure and coordination chemistry, highlighting their unique features and contributions are organized and presented. Finally, a visionary outlook is articulated for this field, exploring avenues, such as customizing Li salts for specific applications, synthesizing Li salts on demand, and discussing the potential of F&#8208;free Li salts alongside with their electrochemical window challenges.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium batteries, favored for their high energy density and long lifespan, are staples in electric vehicles, portable electronics, and aerospace. A key component, Li salts, aids lithium ion migration and electrode protection, significantly impacting battery performance. Developing an ideal Li salt, balancing stability, solubility, dissociation, solvation, and eco-friendliness, remains challenging. Given the scarcity of relevant reviews, it is endeavored here to present a novel perspective on Li salt chemistry, offering a concise roadmap for future designs and innovations. It is delved into the trends, opportunities, design principles, and evaluation methodologies related to Li salt chemistry, with a particular emphasis on organic anionic compositions. Furthermore, the latest and most representative organic Li salts from their intrinsic structure and coordination chemistry, highlighting their unique features and contributions are organized and presented. Finally, a visionary outlook is articulated for this field, exploring avenues, such as customizing Li salts for specific applications, synthesizing Li salts on demand, and discussing the potential of F-free Li salts alongside with their electrochemical window challenges. Here it is served as a strategic compass, addressing the shortcomings of existing reviews and guiding the design of functionalized Li salts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Printed Microscopic Universal Gradient Interface for Super Stretchable Strain&#8208;Insensitive Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stretchable bioelectronics conforming to dynamic body surfaces enable high&#8208;fidelity physiological monitoring but often suffer from motion artifacts. All&#8208;printed strain&#8208;insensitive bioelectronics are presented using a universal gradient interface (UGI) created via aerosol&#8208;based multi&#8208;materials printing (AMMP). The UGI minimizes local strain changes under 180% stretch, supporting artifact&#8208;free sensors for health monitoring and advancing wearable and implantable bioelectronics for personalized healthcare.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics capable of conforming to nonplanar and dynamic human body surfaces are central for creating implantable and on&#8208;skin devices for high&#8208;fidelity monitoring of diverse physiological signals. While various strategies have been developed to produce stretchable devices, the signals collected from such devices are often highly sensitive to local strain, resulting in inevitable convolution with surface strain&#8208;induced motion artifacts that are difficult to distinguish from intrinsic physiological signals. Here all&#8208;printed super stretchable strain&#8208;insensitive bioelectronics using a unique universal gradient interface (UGI) are reported to bridge the gap between soft biomaterials and stiff electronic materials. Leveraging a versatile aerosol&#8208;based multi&#8208;materials printing&#160;technique that allows precise spatial control over the local stiffnesses with submicron resolution, the UGI enables strain&#8208;insensitive electronic devices with negligible resistivity changes under a 180% uniaxial stretch ratio. Various stretchable devices are directly printed on the UGI for on&#8208;skin health monitoring with high signal quality and near&#8208;perfect immunity to motion artifacts, including semiconductor&#8208;based photodetectors for sensing blood oxygen saturation levels and metal&#8208;based temperature sensors. The concept in this work will significantly simplify the fabrication and accelerate the development of a broad range of wearable and implantable bioelectronics for real&#8208;time health monitoring and personalized therapeutics.

         <title>A DNA Nanopatch&#8208;Bacteriophage System Targeting Streptococcus Gallolyticus for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Treatment and Colorectal Cancer Prevention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, this work constructs a novel DNA nanopatch (DNPs)&#8208;modified bacteriophages (P&#8208;Sg) therapeutic platform (DNPs@P) for precise, gut&#8208;targeted therapy that potently reduces inflammation and prevents the colonic inflammation&#8208;to&#8208;carcinoma transition. To protect DNPs@P from the harsh gastrointestinal environment, this work encapsulates them with an enteric polymer acrylic resin (L100&#8208;55) (DNPs@P&#8208;L). Upon oral administration, the L100&#8208;55, ensures their safe passage through the stomach and release in the intestine. Then P&#8208;Sg target and lyse pathogenic bacteria at inflammatory sites, delivering DNPs precisely to affected regions, which can scavenge ROS in the inflammatory site.








Abstract
Persistent inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) increases Streptococcus gallolyticus (Sg) colonization, increasing the risk of colorectal cancer progression via the Sg&#8208;activated cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) pathway and &#946;&#8208;catenin upregulation. This study presents Sg&#8208;specific bacteriophages modified with DNA nanopatches (DNPs@P) designed to treat IBD and prevent Sg&#8208;induced malignancy. The DNPs are composed of DNA origami nanosheets and phage capture strands. The DNPs scavenge reactive oxygen species, enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of the phages while targeting and lysing pathogenic bacteria. Coating with an enteric polymer, DNPs@P ensures effective delivery in the gastrointestinal tract. These findings demonstrate significant restoration of colonic length, reduced inflammation, and improved gut microbiota diversity compared with current clinical treatments. Additionally, DNPs@P effectively prevents colonic tumourigenesis in mouse models. This approach presents a promising strategy for treating gastrointestinal diseases by remodeling the gut microenvironment, addressing a critical gap in current therapies.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Descriptor Tailoring: Rational Solvent Molecule Tuning Enables High&#8208;Voltage Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;descriptor approach is developed to design high&#8208;voltage electrolytes, combining Mulliken charge and Laplacian bond order to identify ideal solvents. Acetonitrile (AN) stabilizes meta&#8208;stable transition metal atoms and mitigates lattice oxygen instability at the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface. This strategy enables precise control of interfacial stability, advancing high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries with a versatile and adaptive framework.








Abstract
Electrolyte engineering to enhance the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface stability is widely recognized as a promising strategy for achieving high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which are currently hindered by the meta&#8208;stable surface of lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides. Despite significant progress in electrolyte development, clear design guidelines for high&#8208;voltage electrolytes remain lacking, making solvent selection unpredictable. Here, a dual&#8208;descriptor tailoring concept based on Mulliken charge (adsorption) and Laplacian bond order (antioxidation) to identify ideal solvent molecules for high&#8208;voltage electrolytes is proposed. This concept stabilizes meta&#8208;stable transition metal atoms in surface tetrahedral interstices through interactions between bottom solvent molecules and cathode dangling bonds. Acetonitrile (AN) is eventually selected as a promising bottom solvent that interacts strongly with unstable surface bonds, improving interfacial stability. Consequently, the prepared 0.6 Ah graphite||LCO pouch cell using AN&#8208;based electrolyte maintained a remarkable 80% capacity retention after 900 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.92% at high cut&#8208;off voltage. This work revisits the interfacial stability mechanism across different electrolyte classes, where strong solvent adsorption mitigates the instability of the meta&#8208;stable Co spin state, reduces surface band overlap, and alleviates the instability of lattice oxygen at the interface. This dual&#8208;descriptor&#8208;guided design opens a new avenue for high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;ion batteries is believed.

         <title>Machine Learning in Polymer Research</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial intelligence (AI) has permeated every aspect of science, including polymer research. Researchers from both fields need to collaborate to understand the challenges and opportunities of each domain. This review is therefore written by mathematicians and polymer chemists to highlight the key research questions polymer chemists aim to address and how machine learning can assist in answering them.








Abstract
Machine learning is increasingly being applied in polymer chemistry to link chemical structures to macroscopic properties of polymers and to identify chemical patterns in the polymer structures that help improve specific properties. To facilitate this, a chemical dataset needs to be translated into machine readable descriptors. However, limited and inadequately curated datasets, broad molecular weight distributions, and irregular polymer configurations pose significant challenges. Most off the shelf mathematical models often need refinement for specific applications. Addressing these challenges demand a close collaboration between chemists and mathematicians as chemists must formulate research questions in mathematical terms while mathematicians are required to refine models for specific applications. This review unites both disciplines to address dataset curation hurdles and highlight advances in polymer synthesis and modeling that enhance data availability. It then surveys ML approaches used to predict solid&#8208;state properties, solution behavior, composite performance, and emerging applications such as drug delivery and the polymer&#8211;biology interface. A perspective of the field is concluded and the importance of FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) data and the integration of polymer theory and data are discussed, and the thoughts on the machine&#8211;human interface are shared.

Covalent peptide assembly leverages robust covalent bonds and dynamic non&#8208;covalent interactions to provide enhanced stability and introduce diverse functionalities. Nevertheless, it remains significantly challenging to achieve modular control over the structural diversity and functional complexity while elucidating how specific amino acid sequences contribute to these processes. Here, the systematic encoding of peptide derivative characteristics is demonstrated through amino acid modularity to enable precise control over both the structural diversity and functional complexity in covalent peptide assemblies. By systematically screening single amino acid substitutions in pentapeptides using tyrosine crosslinking, a diverse library of peptide constructs is developed. Each construct is tailored to exhibit distinct properties, including charge repulsion, aggregation&#8208;induced quenching, disassembly behavior, and redox responsiveness. The strategic manipulation of sequence composition, both in individual assemblies and combinatorial systems, enables programmable control over the structural diversity and functional complexity. This approach yields various module&#8208;specific functions, including frustrated growth, hierarchical hollow architecture formation, affinity enrichment, stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior, and fluorescence signal amplification. This work establishes a framework for the design of modular peptide materials with programmable functionalities, advancing the development of next&#8208;generation multicomponent peptide assembly technologies characterized by unprecedented complexity and adaptability.

         <title>Activating Halogen Circulation Enables Efficient and Stable Wide&#8208;Bandgap Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a halide&#8208;healing halogen circulation strategy to suppress Br&#8722;/I&#8722; ion migration in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites. Consequently, perovskite solar cells achieve an impressive 23.25% efficiency with a minimal open&#8208;circuit voltage loss of 0.39 V in a 1.67 eV bandgap device. A tandem solar cell further demonstrates a high Voc of 1.99 V and an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 33.2%.








Abstract
Developing strategies to manage ion&#8208;migration&#8208;induced phase segregation in wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites is crucial for achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite&#8208;silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs). However, maintaining continuous suppression of phase segregation from the film crystallization process to device operation remains a significant challenge. The present study demonstrates an efficient strategy of activating halogen circulation in WBG perovskite by using halogen circulation agents (HCA) of N&#8208;halosuccinimide molecules as the sustainable stabilizers, in order to achieve dynamic halogen equilibrium within the precursor solution and perovskite film, which blocks the migration path of Br&#8722;/I&#8722; ions both in crystallization and aging of WBG perovskites. Attempts on in situ dynamic monitoring of halide migration visually verified the enhanced stability by activated halogen circulation in both WBG films and devices. Consequently, present work achieves a champion efficiency up to 23.25% with a low Voc loss of 0.39&#160;V in the 1.67&#8208;eV&#8208;bandgap device, and the HCA&#8208;based devices can maintain 88% and 93% of their initial efficiencies over 1000&#160;h under continuous illumination and 2500&#160;h at 85 &#176;C in N2 atmosphere, respectively. As a proof of concept, the perovskite/silicon monolithic TSCs are fabricated to demonstrate a high Voc of 1.99&#160;V and a high power conversion efficiency of 33.2%.

         <title>Weak Near&#8208;Infrared Light Visualization Enabled by Smart Multifunctional Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart NIR&#8208;to&#8208;visible photon upconversion (UC) device with integrated photodetection (PD) and electroluminescence functionalities is developed. The device continuously monitors incident light intensity through its PD function and compensates for UC emission under low light conditions to achieve clear visualization of weak NIR light.








Abstract
Visualizing weak NIR&#160;light is critical for sensing, imaging, and communication, but remains challenging due to inefficient detection and upconversion (UC) mechanisms. A smart NIR&#8208;to&#8208;visible photon&#8208;UC organic optoelectronic device is reported that integrates photodetection, light&#8208;emitting diode (LED), and photovoltaic capabilities to enable clear visualization of weak NIR light. The programmable device has continuous photodetection monitoring of the incident NIR intensity. When the incident intensity falls below a preset threshold, the LED function is automatically triggered to compensate for the UC emission, amplifying the visualization. The smart multifunctional device uses a carefully designed ternary bulk heterojunction sensitizer doped with rubrene:DBP as the emitter. It demonstrates high UC efficiency (&gt;1.5%) for upconversion from 808 to 608&#160;nm, allowing NIR visualization without external power under strong illumination. It also shows excellent NIR photodetection with photoresponsivity of 0.35&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 at 800&#160;nm and specific detectivity reaching 10&#185;2&#8211;10&#185;3 Jones, enabling sensitive detection under low&#8208;light conditions. It also exhibits a low turn&#8208;on voltage (0.9 V) and luminance exceeding 1200&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 at 5 V, ensuring energy&#8208;efficient light compensation. Furthermore, it achieves &gt;10% power conversion efficiency, enabling sustainable self&#8208;powered operation. This multifunctional, high&#8208;performance system offers great potential in sensing, energy harvesting, and display technologies.

         <title>A Genetically Encoded Endogenous Antibody Recruitment Strategy for Innate Immune&#8208;Mediated Killing of Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antibody&#8208;recruiting molecules (ARMs) can redirect endogenous antibodies to target cancer cells and induce killing; however, currently, they are limited by low antibody affinity. This study presents a novel ARM strategy using lipid nanoparticles to deliver mRNA encoding the common allergen Der p 2, fused to a membrane anchor, enabling high&#8208;affinity antibody recruitment. In mice, this approach reduces pulmonary metastasis, with neutrophils as key effector cells. This mRNA LNP strategy offers promise for cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Antibody&#8208;recruiting molecules (ARMs) are bivalent molecules that contain a cell&#8208;binding domain and an antibody&#8208;binding domain. ARMs are designed to redirect circulating endogenous antibodies from the bloodstream to the surface of cancer cells and thereby trigger innate immune&#8208;mediated killing of the latter. The current generation of clinically explored ARMs relies on synthetic small molecule haptens. However, their effectiveness is restricted by the low affinity of the available repertoire of endogenous anti&#8208;hapten antibodies. Utilizing endogenous high&#8208;affinity allergen&#8208;specific antibodies could potentially circumvent this issue. In this study, a genetically encoded antibody&#8208;recruiting strategy that utilizes lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to deliver mRNA encoding the house dust mite allergen Der p 2, fused to a cell membrane anchor, to induce cell surface display and enable the recruitment of anti&#8208;Der p 2 antibodies, is presented. Der p 2 mRNA LNP&#8208;treated cancer cells cause greatly reduced pulmonary tumor burden in Der p 2 immunized mice, compared to untreated cells or nonimmunized mice. Reduced tumor growth is dependent on circulating antibodies, and neutrophils are identified as a key immune cell subset recognizing and eliminating Der p 2&#8208;displaying cancer cells. These findings emphasize the effectiveness of mRNA LNPs as a powerful tool for generating a genetically encoded ARM strategy, with potential applications in cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Anisotropic Electrical Transport in Mechanically Responsive Silver&#8208;Coated Microparticle&#8208;Gel Composites for Flowable Semiconducting Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stimuli&#8208;responsive soft semiconducting composite is prepared with silver microspheres dispersed in a viscoelastic copolymer gel. With an electric field arcing parallel to the applied flow rate, an enhanced electrical signal is detected due to microstructural particle alignment in the same direction that promotes electron transport.








Abstract
Soft materials with reversible electrical and mechanical properties are critical for the development of advanced bioelectronics that can distinguish between different rates of applied strain and eliminate performance degradation over many cycles. However, the current paradigm in mechano&#8208;electronic devices involves measuring changes in electrical current based on the accumulation of strain within a conductive material that alters the geometry through which electrons flow. Attempts have been made to incorporate soft materials like liquid metals and concentrated solutions of conjugated polymers and salts to overcome materials degradation but are limited in their ability to detect changes in the rate of the applied strain. Herein, the anisotropic electrical performance of a soft semiconducting composite prepared with silver&#8208;coated microspheres dispersed within a swollen copolymer gel is demonstrated. This composite exhibits an electrical response proportional to the magnitude of the applied shear force to enable a rate&#8208;of&#8208;strain dependent conductivity. Furthermore, a 100&#8208;fold increase in the conductivity of the composite is observed when the electric field is oriented parallel to the flow direction. This improvement in the electrical response can be attributed to the enhanced alignment of microspheres in viscoelastic media and can be leveraged in the development of mechanically responsive electronic devices.

         <title>Osteomimix: A Multidimensional Biomimetic Cascade Strategy for Bone Defect Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multidimensional biomimetic cascade strategy for bone regeneration is developed by emulating the biomineralization cascade, hierarchical structure, and biological functions of bone tissue. The resulting composite, named &#8220;Osteomimix&#8221;, exhibits spontaneous in situ biomimetic mineralization in a cell&#8208;free way, while fosters vascularized bone formation in a cell&#8208;dependent way.








Abstract
Despite advancements in biomimetic mineralization techniques, the repair of large&#8208;scale bone defects remains a significant challenge. Inspired by the bone formation process, a multidimensional biomimetic cascade strategy is developed by replicating the biomineralization cascade, emulating the hierarchical structure of bone, and biomimicking its biological functions for efficient bone regeneration. This strategy involves the photocrosslinking of sodium methacrylate carboxymethyl cellulose&#8208;stabilized amorphous magnesium&#8208;calcium phosphate with methacrylate&#8208;modified type I collagen to create a self&#8208;mineralizing hydrogel. The hydrogel is then integrated with either naturally derived or synthetic oriented bulk scaffolds. The resulting composite, named Osteomimix, provides excellent mechanical support and can be customized for irregular bone defects using CAD/CAM technology. Through in vitro and in vivo studies, this work finds that Osteomimix exhibits spontaneous in situ biomimetic mineralization in a cell&#8208;free environment, while modulating immune responses and promoting vascularized bone formation in a cell&#8208;dependent manner. Built on bone&#8208;specific insights, this strategy achieves biomimicry across temporal, spatial, and functional dimensions, facilitating the seamless integration of artificial constructs with the natural tissue repair dynamics.

         <title>Rational Design of Methylated Triazine&#8208;Based Linear Conjugated Polymers for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction with Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of porous methylated triazine&#8208;based linear conjugated polymers is developed for successful photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) with water (H2O) vapor, in the absence of any additional photosensitizer, sacrificial agents or cocatalysts. The key lies in the generation of methylated triazine linkages through a facile condensation reaction between benzamidine and acetic anhydride, which impedes the formation of conventional triazine&#8208;based frameworks.








Abstract
The development of semiconducting conjugated polymers for photoredox catalysis holds great promise for sustainable utilization of solar energy. Herein a new family of porous methylated triazine&#8208;based linear conjugated polymers is reported that enable efficient photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) with water (H2O) vapor, in the absence of any additional photosensitizer, sacrificial agents or cocatalysts. It is demonstrated that the key lies in the generation of methylated triazine linkages through a facile condensation reaction between benzamidine and acetic anhydride, which impedes the formation of conventional triazine&#8208;based frameworks. It is also shown that regulating conjugated linear backbones with different lengths of electron&#8208;donated benzyl units provides a facile means to modulate their optical properties and the exciton dissociation, thereby affording more long&#8208;lived photogenerated charge carriers and boosting charge separation and transfer. A high&#8208;performance carbon monoxide (CO) production rate of 218.9 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 is achieved with &#8776; 100% CO selectivity, which is accompanied by exceptional H2O oxidation to oxygen (O2). It anticipates this new study will advance synthetic approaches toward polymeric semiconductors and facilitate new possibilities for triazine&#8208;based conjugated polymers with promising potential in artificial photocatalysis.

         <title>Atomic Layer Deposition Stabilizes Nanocrystals, Enabling Reliably High&#8208;Performance Quantum Dot LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al&#8322;O&#8323; on ZnMgO nanocrystals eliminates aging&#8208;induced performance variability in quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QD&#8208;LEDs). This scalable passivation strategy suppresses nanocrystal ripening and passivates surface traps, achieving reproducible 17% external quantum efficiency, a tenfold increase in device operational stability, and consistent performance sustained over 39 weeks.








Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QD&#8208;LEDs) with stable high efficiencies are crucial for next&#8208;generation displays. However, uncontrollable aging, where efficiency initially increases during storage (positive aging) but is entirely lost upon extended aging (negative aging), hinders further device development. It is uncovered that it is chemical changes to nanocrystal (NC)&#8208;based electron transport layer (ETL) that give rise to positive aging, their drift in structure and morphology leading to transiently improved charge injection balance. Using grazing&#8208;incidence small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, it is found that ZnMgO NCs undergo size&#8208;focusing ripening during aging, improving size uniformity and creating a smoother energy landscape. Electron&#8208;only device measurements reveal a sevenfold reduction in trap states, indicating enhanced surface passivation of ZnMgO. These insights, combined with density functional theory calculations of ZnMgO surface binding, inspire an atomic layer deposition (ALD) strategy with Al&#8322;O&#8323; to permanently suppress surface traps and inhibit NC growth, effectively eliminating aging&#8208;induced efficiency loss. This ALD&#8208;engineered ZnMgO ETL enables reproducible external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 17% across 30 batches of LEDs with a T60 of 60 h at an initial luminance of 4500 cd m&#8722;2, representing a 1.6&#8208;fold increase in EQE and a tenfold improvement in operating stability compared to control devices.

         <title>&#8220;Pumping&#8221; Trace Cu Impurity out of Zn Foil for Sustainable Aqueous Battery Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper exists as trace impurity in commercial Zn foil and generally gets ignored in terms of its potential for regulating Zn electrodeposition. Herein, it is demonstrated how trace amount of internal Cu atoms can be readily &#8220;pumped&#8221; out, in one step, to get concentrated on Zn foil surface and to further suppress dendritic Zn electrodeposition as a sustainable aqueous battery interface.









Abstract
Dendritic zinc (Zn) electrodeposition presents a significant obstacle to the large&#8208;scale development of rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries. To mitigate this challenge, various interfacial strategies have been employed. However, these approaches often involve the incorporation of foreign materials onto Zn anode surface, resulting in increased material costs and processing complexities, not to mention the compromised interface endurability due to structural and compositional heterogeneity. Realizing that Cu atoms typically exist as trace impurities in commercial Zn, a novel approach is demonstrated that leverages these Cu impurities to create a Cu&#8208;rich surface for effective modulation of Zn electrodeposition. By simply heating commercially available Zn foil with a naturally oxidized surface, not only the internal Cu atoms are thermally activated to become diffusible, their diffusion is also navigated toward the surface via&#160;oxygen attraction. The resulting Cu&#8208;rich surface effectively regulates Zn electrodeposition, comparable to conventional interfacial strategies, yet exhibits superior cycling durability. 3D in situ microscopy confirms that this Cu&#8208;rich surface enables dendrite&#8208;free, compact, and (101)&#8208;oriented Zn electrodeposition, contrasting with the traditional (002)&#8208;oriented dendrite&#8208;suppression mechanism. By transforming trace Cu impurity within Zn foil into a Cu&#8208;rich surface, this work demonstrates a straightforward, cost&#8208;effective and efficient method for controlling Zn electrodeposition.

Realizing that Cu atoms typically exist as trace impurities in commercial Zn, a novel approach is demonstrated that leverages these Cu impurities to create a Cu-rich surface for effective modulation of Zn electrodeposition. By simply heating commercially available Zn foil with a naturally oxidized surface, not only the internal Cu atoms are thermally activated to become diffusible, their diffusion is also navigated toward the surface via&#160;oxygen attraction. The resulting Cu-rich surface effectively regulates Zn electrodeposition, comparable to conventional interfacial strategies, yet exhibits superior cycling durability. 3D in situ microscopy confirms that this Cu-rich surface enables dendrite-free, compact, and (101)-oriented Zn electrodeposition, contrasting with the traditional (002)-oriented dendrite-suppression mechanism. By transforming trace Cu impurity within Zn foil into a Cu-rich surface, this work demonstrates a straightforward, cost-effective and efficient method for controlling Zn electrodeposition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functional Biomaterials Derived from Protein Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation and Liquid&#8208;to&#8208;Solid Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein can undergo liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition to form liquid condensates and solid aggregates. These phase transitions can be influenced by post&#8208;translational modifications, mutations, and various environmental factors. Effective modulation of protein phase behavior offers promising applications in drug discovery, delivery, and fabrication of multifunctional protein&#8208;based liquid and solid materials.








Abstract
Protein phase transitions play a vital role in both cellular functions and pathogenesis. Dispersed proteins can undergo liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation to form condensates, a process that is reversible and highly regulated within cells. The formation and physicochemical properties of these condensates, such as composition, viscosity, and multiphase miscibility, are precisely modulated to fulfill specific biological functions. However, protein condensates can undergo a further liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid state, forming &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich aggregates that may disrupt cellular function and lead to diseases. While this phenomenon is crucial for biological processes and has significant implications for neurodegenerative diseases, the phase behavior of naturally derived or engineered proteins and polypeptides also presents opportunities for developing high&#8208;performance, multifunctional materials at various scales. Additionally, the unique molecular recruitment capabilities of condensates inspire innovative advancements in biomaterial design for applications in drug discovery, delivery, and biosynthesis. This work highlights recent progress in understanding the mechanisms underlying protein phase behavior, particularly how it responds to internal molecular changes and external physical stimuli. Furthermore, the fabrication of multifunctional materials derived from diverse protein sources through controlled phase transitions is demonstrated.

         <title>Zwitterionic Photosensitizer&#8208;Assembled Nanocluster Produces Efficient Photogenerated Radicals via Autoionization for Superior Antibacterial Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a simple self&#8208;assembly strategy to construct Type I photosensitizer nanocluster. Facile intermolecular photoinduced electron transfer within nanocluster forms photosensitizer radical cation and anion via autoionization. These radicals engage in cascade photoredox to generate efficient reactive oxygen species, achieving 97.6% antibacterial efficacy against MRSA that surpasses the efficacy of commercial antibiotic Vancomycin by 8.8&#8208;fold.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) holds significant promise for antibacterial treatment, with its potential markedly amplified when using Type I photosensitizers (PSs). However, developing Type I PSs remains a significant challenge due to a lack of reliable design strategy. Herein, a Type I PS nanocluster is developed via self&#8208;assembly of zwitterionic small molecule (C3TH) for superior antibacterial PDT in vivo. Mechanism studies demonstrate that unique cross&#8208;arranged C3TH within nanocluster not only shortens intermolecular distance but also inhibits intermolecular electronic&#8208;vibrational coupling, thus facilitating intermolecular photoinduced electron transfer to form PS radical cation and anion via autoionization reaction. Subsequently, these highly oxidizing or reducing PS radicals engage in cascade photoredox to generate efficient &#183;OH and O2&#8254;&#183;. As a result, C3TH nanoclusters achieve a 97.6% antibacterial efficacy against MRSA at an ultralow dose, surpassing the efficacy of the commercial antibiotic Vancomycin by more than 8.8&#8208;fold. These findings deepen the understanding of Type I PDT, providing a novel strategy for developing Type I PSs.

         <title>Rare&#8208;Earth Oxychlorides as Promoters of Ruthenium Toward High&#8208;Performance Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysts for Alkaline Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lamellar rare&#8208;earth oxychlorides (REOCl) are innovatively used as promoters for ruthenium (Ru)&#160;as alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalysts. The [RE2O2] and [Cl] layers act as the negative and positive charge transfer channels, respectively, which endows Ru surface with a high density of electrons, thus accelerating the hydroxyl peeling process.








Abstract
Developing efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline environments is vital for hydrogen production, owing to the extra water dissociation and hydroxyl desorption steps. Here, rare&#8208;earth oxychlorides (REOCl) are proposed as innovative promoters for ruthenium as HER electrocatalyst in alkali. The lamellar structure of REOCl with weakly bond [Cl] layers can facilitate the formation of an internal electric field that enhances interphase charge transfer. Taking ruthenium/ neodymium oxychloride (Ru/NdOCl) composites as a case study, sub &#8776;4&#160;nm Ru nanoparticles are successfully embedded into NdOCl crystals through a rapid self&#8208;exothermic process, and the highly&#8208;coupled Ru&#8722;Cl/O&#8722;Nd interfaces are observed as metallic Ru particles with the edge of the NdOCl lamellar layers, where the [Nd2O2] and [Cl] layers act as the negative and positive charge transfer channels, respectively. The enhanced charge transfer between REOCl and Ru makes the highly&#8208;coupled Ru/REOCl catalysts show better electrocatalytic activity than both the benchmark Pt and Ru catalysts in alkaline electrolyte. This work will encourage more novel promoters for electrocatalysis and other emerging technologies.

         <title>A Rolling Light&#8208;Driven Pneumatic Soft Actuator Based on Liquid&#8211;Gas Phase Change</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8211;gas phase&#8208;changing pneumatic actuator driven by optical light is introduced. By precisely controlling the light spot using a magnifying glass, the fiber actuator rolls on a horizontal plane in daylight. With an annular design, the actuator achieved vertical crawling under a fixed visible light source. It also demonstrates promising potential for load propulsion in forward movement. 








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven wireless actuators provide obvious advantages for remote control. However, traditional double&#8208;layer actuators are restricted to the thin film deformation mode when undertaking complex tasks. Here, an actuator is proposed that employs thermal strain and local photothermal effects induced by low boiling point liquids to generate asymmetry along the fiber axis, thereby causing elastic deformation of the fiber. Under continuous irradiation, the sustained elastic deformation results in dynamic frustration within the fiber, creating torque around its axis. Based on this principle, the fiber actuator fabricated in this study enables rolling translation, while the ring actuator achieves simultaneous rolling and lifting motion for object manipulation. Continuous rolling under light eliminates the need for complex light manipulation. This new movement method offers an insight for various application scenarios.

         <title>Photoinduced Cleavage of Respiratory Syncytial Virus by Chiral Vanadium Trioxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strongly chiral V2O3 NPs with optical responsiveness achieve targeted and precise cleavage of the RSV pre&#8208;fusion protein through photoinduction, thereby inhibiting respiratory syncytial virus.








Abstract
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) poses a significant threat to the health of infants, children, and the elderly, and as of now there is a lack of effective therapeutic drugs. To tackle this challenge, chiral vanadium trioxide nanoparticles (V2O3 NPs) with a particle size of 2.56 &#177; 0.34 nm are successfully synthesized, exhibiting a g&#8208;factor value of 0.048 at 874 nm in terms of circular dichroism. Under 808 nm light irradiation, these chiral V2O3 NPs demonstrated selective cleavage of the RSV pre&#8208;fusion protein (RSV protein), effectively blocking its conformational rearrangement and preventing RSV infection both in vitro and in vivo. Experimental analysis revealed that the chiral V2O3 NPs specifically bind to the functional domain spanning from aspartate200 (D200) to asparagine208 (N208) in the primary sequence of the RSV protein. Notably, L&#8208;V2O3 NPs exhibited a higher affinity, which is 4.06 times that of D&#8208;V2O3 NPs and 13.55 times that of DL&#8208;V2O3 NPs. The precise cutting site is located between amino acid residues leucine204 (L204) and proline205 (P205), attributed to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by photoinduced nanoparticles. In addition, L&#8208;V2O3 NPs inhibited RSV infection by 99.6% in nasal epithelial cells and 99.2% in Vero cells. In the RSV&#8208;infected mouse model, intranasal administration of L&#8208;V&#8322;O&#8323; NPs effectively controlled the viral load in the lungs of mice, reducing it by 92.43%. The hematoxylin and eosin staining of mouse organs and serum biochemical indicators are similar to those of the wild&#8208;type group, indicating the biosafety of L&#8208;V&#8322;O&#8323; NPs. The findings suggest that chiral nanoparticles hold great potential in controlling RSV and provide new directions and ideas for drug development against viruses.

To tackle this challenge, chiral vanadium trioxide nanoparticles (V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NPs) with a particle size of 2.56 &#177; 0.34 nm are successfully synthesized, exhibiting a &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;-factor value of 0.048 at 874 nm in terms of circular dichroism. Under 808 nm light irradiation, these chiral V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NPs demonstrated selective cleavage of the RSV pre-fusion protein (RSV protein), effectively blocking its conformational rearrangement and preventing RSV infection both in vitro and in vivo. Experimental analysis revealed that the chiral V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NPs specifically bind to the functional domain spanning from aspartate&lt;sub&gt;200&lt;/sub&gt; (D&lt;sub&gt;200&lt;/sub&gt;) to asparagine&lt;sub&gt;208&lt;/sub&gt; (N&lt;sub&gt;208&lt;/sub&gt;) in the primary sequence of the RSV protein. Notably, &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;-V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NPs exhibited a higher affinity, which is 4.06 times that of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;-V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NPs and 13.55 times that of &lt;i&gt;DL&lt;/i&gt;-V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NPs. The precise cutting site is located between amino acid residues leucine&lt;sub&gt;204&lt;/sub&gt; (L&lt;sub&gt;204&lt;/sub&gt;) and proline&lt;sub&gt;205&lt;/sub&gt; (P&lt;sub&gt;205&lt;/sub&gt;), attributed to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by photoinduced nanoparticles. In addition, &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;-V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NPs inhibited RSV infection by 99.6% in nasal epithelial cells and 99.2% in Vero cells. In the RSV-infected mouse model, intranasal administration of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;-V&#8322;O&#8323; NPs effectively controlled the viral load in the lungs of mice, reducing it by 92.43%. The hematoxylin and eosin staining of mouse organs and serum biochemical indicators are similar to those of the wild-type group, indicating the biosafety of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;-V&#8322;O&#8323; NPs. The findings suggest that chiral nanoparticles hold great potential in controlling RSV and provide new directions and ideas for drug development against viruses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modular Design of Lipopeptide&#8208;Based Organ&#8208;Specific Targeting (POST) Lipid Nanoparticles for Highly Efficient RNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a library of lipopeptide&#8208;based organ&#8208;specific targeting (POST) lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). The POST LNPs, screened in vitro and in vivo, demonstrate high efficiency and specificity in delivering mRNA and siRNA to the lung, liver, and spleen, respectively. Structure&#8208;activity relationship analysis indicates that various lipid systems prefer specific lipopeptide structures for enhanced RNA delivery efficacy.









Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with highly efficient and specific extrahepatic targeting abilities are promising in gene delivery, and the lipopeptides (LPs) with excellent designability and functionality are expected to empower the construction of functional LNPs. This study aims to develop highly efficient ionizable components that accurately match different targeting lipid systems through the modular design of LPs. Based on this, a lipopeptide&#8208;based organ&#8208;specific targeting (POST) LNP screening strategy is constructed, in which lysine&#8208;histidine&#8208;based lipopeptides (KH&#8208;LPs) are designed as highly efficient ionizable components. The optimal KH&#8208;LP LNP screened in vitro shows excellent siRNA/mRNA transfecting ability in various hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cell lines. Compared to the classic LNPs, the POST LNPs screened in vivo achieve even higher (or at least comparable) efficiency and specificity in delivering mRNA and siRNA to the lung, liver, and spleen, respectively. The structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) proves that the modular regulation of LP structures can accurately provide the optimal ionizable components for different targeting lipid systems, demonstrating the potential of this strategy in developing efficient and selective targeting systems, which is expected to open up more possibilities for gene therapy.

         <title>An Integrated Modular Vaccination System for Spatiotemporally Separated Perioperative Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatiotemporal segmentation immunotherapy strategy uses modular microneedles to modulate paradoxical postoperative immunization microenvironments. The modular microneedles load a personalized antitumor vaccine and demonstrate broad antitumor activities in postoperative immunotherapy, reducing recurrence and the incidence of perioperative wound complications.








Abstract
The perioperative period is crucial for determining postoperative tumor recurrence and metastasis. Various factors in postoperative lesions can diminish the therapeutic effect of conventional chemoradiotherapy, while emerging immunotherapy is restricted. The combination use of inflammatory inhibitors during treatment is also controversial. Here, a modular microneedle prepared from engineered keratin proteins is reported, which spatially and temporally differentiates the microenvironment of immune cell activation required for immunotherapy from that of wound healing. The recombinant keratin&#8208;84&#8208;T&#8208;based needle root layer, mainly retained in the epidermis, facilitated dendritic cell recruitment to achieve maximum antigen presentation of loaded vaccines. Meanwhile, the recombinant keratin&#8208;81&#8208;1A&#945;&#8208;based needle tip layer, located within the dermis, rapidly mitigated inflammatory&#160;responses while promoting tissue repair and regeneration. Unlike simply mixing immunotherapy and wound&#160;treatment, this spatiotemporal segmentation approach maximized the efficacy of immune therapeutics while promoting wound healing, making it suitable for application throughout the perioperative period.

         <title>Thermal Transport in Chalcogenide&#8208;Based Phase Change Materials: A Journey from Fundamental Physics to Device Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) are transforming reconfigurable photonics with their electrically tunable optical properties. This review examines the thermal challenges of scaling PCM devices to larger volumes beyond storage&#8208;class applications, emphasizing thermal transport mechanisms, material properties, and design strategies. By integrating fundamental science and device engineering, it offers valuable insights for advancing reliable and scalable PCM&#8208;based photonic systems.








Abstract
Advancements in nanofabrication processes have propelled nonvolatile phase change materials (PCMs) beyond storage&#8208;class applications. They are now making headway in fields such as photonic integrated circuits (PIC), free&#8208;space optics, and plasmonics. This shift is owed to their distinct electrical, optical, and thermal properties between their different atomic structures, which can be reversibly switched through thermal stimuli. However, the reliability of PCM&#8208;based optical components is not yet on par with that of storage&#8208;class devices. This is in part due to the challenges in maintaining a uniform temperature distribution across the PCM volume during phase transformation, which is essential to mitigate stress and element segregation as the device size exceeds a few micrometers. Understanding thermal transport in PCM&#8208;based devices is thus crucial as it dictates not only the durability but also the performance and power consumption of these devices. This article reviews recent advances in the development of PCM&#8208;based photonic devices from a thermal transport perspective and explores potential avenues to enhance device reliability. The aim is to provide insights into how PCM&#8208;based technologies can evolve beyond storage&#8208;class applications, maintain their functionality, and achieve longer&#160;lifetimes.

         <title>Interpretable Radiomics Model Predicts Nanomedicine Tumor Accumulation Using Routine Medical Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The therapeutic potential of cancer nanomedicine depends on effective patient stratification. This study introduces a novel &#8220;virtual biopsy&#8221; method using a radiomics&#8208;based model and routine medical imaging to predict nanomedicine accumulation in tumors. By identifying imaging features associated with biological barriers to drug delivery, the model facilitates more accurate patient stratification and personalized treatment planning, thus advancing precision medicine.








Abstract
Accurately predicting nanomedicine accumulation is critical for guiding patient stratification and optimizing treatment strategies in the context of precision medicine. However, non&#8208;invasive prediction of nanomedicine accumulation remains challenging, primarily due to the complexity of identifying relevant imaging features that predict accumulation. Here, a novel non&#8208;invasive method is proposed that utilizes standard&#8208;of&#8208;care medical imaging modalities, including computed tomography and ultrasound, combined with a radiomics&#8208;based model to predict nanomedicine accumulation in tumor. The model is validated using a test dataset consisting of seven tumor xenografts in mice and three sizes of gold nanoparticles, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.851. The median accumulation levels of tumors predicted as &#8220;high accumulators&#8221; are 2.69 times greater than those predicted as &#8220;low accumulators&#8221;. Analysis of this machine&#8208;learning&#8208;driven interpretable radiomics model revealed imaging features that are strongly correlated with dense stroma, a recognized biological barrier to effective nanomedicine delivery. Radiomics&#8208;based prediction of tumor accumulation holds promise for stratifying patient and enabling precise tailoring of nanomedicine treatment strategies.

     alt="Interpretable Radiomics Model Predicts Nanomedicine Tumor Accumulation Using Routine Medical Imaging"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The therapeutic potential of cancer nanomedicine depends on effective patient stratification. This study introduces a novel &#8220;virtual biopsy&#8221; method using a radiomics-based model and routine medical imaging to predict nanomedicine accumulation in tumors. By identifying imaging features associated with biological barriers to drug delivery, the model facilitates more accurate patient stratification and personalized treatment planning, thus advancing precision medicine.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accurately predicting nanomedicine accumulation is critical for guiding patient stratification and optimizing treatment strategies in the context of precision medicine. However, non-invasive prediction of nanomedicine accumulation remains challenging, primarily due to the complexity of identifying relevant imaging features that predict accumulation. Here, a novel non-invasive method is proposed that utilizes standard-of-care medical imaging modalities, including computed tomography and ultrasound, combined with a radiomics-based model to predict nanomedicine accumulation in tumor. The model is validated using a test dataset consisting of seven tumor xenografts in mice and three sizes of gold nanoparticles, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.851. The median accumulation levels of tumors predicted as &#8220;high accumulators&#8221; are 2.69 times greater than those predicted as &#8220;low accumulators&#8221;. Analysis of this machine-learning-driven interpretable radiomics model revealed imaging features that are strongly correlated with dense stroma, a recognized biological barrier to effective nanomedicine delivery. Radiomics-based prediction of tumor accumulation holds promise for stratifying patient and enabling precise tailoring of nanomedicine treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Wave Pumped Self&#8208;Assembled Colloidal Topological Lasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled colloidal topological laser with CW room&#8208;temperature pumping is presented, featuring extensive wavelength tunability, ultra&#8208;high polarization, and good temporal stability. Precise control over a single NPL layer thickness allows excellent performance in semiconductor lasers, advancing solution&#8208;processed systems for display technology and modern communication.








Abstract
The field of optoelectronic integrated circuits is actively developing reliable and efficient room&#8208;temperature continuous&#8208;wave (CW) lasers. CW&#8208;pumped lasers combine the economical and simple manufacturing processes of colloidal semiconductor lasers with the efficient and stable output of continuous pumping, enabling them to significantly impact the field of semiconductor lasers. However, development is still severely challenged by limitations such as gain materials and cavity structures. Consequently, as a compromise, most colloidal semiconductor lasers proposed to date have relied on another pulsed laser as the pumping source. In this study, a self&#8208;assembled colloidal topological laser is proposed that benefits from CW pumping at room temperature. By utilizing an interfacial self&#8208;assembly strategy, nanoplatelets (NPLs) are managed to control the collective orientation (face&#8208;down or edge&#8208;up), achieving controlled polarization of amplified spontaneous emission for the first time. Furthermore, precise control over the thickness of a single NPL layer is demonstrated, which enables the laser system to offer extensive wavelength tunability (over 50&#160;nm), ultra&#8208;high polarization (over 95%), and good temporal stability. These metrics signify the optimal performance level of colloidal semiconductor lasers, marking a new era in solution processing systems for the optoelectronic integrated circuit field.

         <title>A Covalent Organic Framework as Photocatalyst for Smart Conversion Between Photooxidation and Photoreduction and H2O2 Production in Full pH Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart covalent organic framework (Por&#8208;HQ&#8208;COF) possessing environment&#8208;initiated switchable photocatalytic reduction and oxidation and H2O2 production, is constructed by engineering at a molecular level and the local phenol&#8208;quinone structure of the skeletal building blocks. As a smart photocatalyst, Por&#8208;HQ&#8208;COF based on phenol&#8208;quinone transformation can convert into Por&#8208;BQ&#8208;COF intelligently with a trigger, and vice versa.








Abstract
Developing multifunctional photocatalysts with intelligent self&#8208;adjusting is of great significance in the photocatalytic process. Herein, a smart covalent organic framework (Por&#8208;HQ&#8208;COF) with a phenol&#8208;quinone conversion structure with pH changes is constructed for photooxidation,&#160;photoreduction, and H2O2 production. As a smart photocatalyst, Por&#8208;HQ&#8208;COF can convert into Por&#8208;BQ&#8208;COF intelligently with a trigger including solution pH, and vice versa. The reconstruction of phenol&#8208;quinone conversion not only significantly alters the morphologies and the specific surface areas of the COF, but also leads to an entirely change in the band energy and charge distribution to influence photoelectric properties. As a result, under acidic conditions, Por&#8208;BQ&#8208;COF converts into Por&#8208;HQ&#8208;COF automatically and can photoreduce high concentration Cr(VI) to Cr(III) efficiently. Under neutral conditions, the superoxide anions (&#183;O2&#8722;) initiate the Por&#8208;HQ&#8208;COF reconstruction into Por&#8208;BQ&#8208;COF to accelerate photooxidation to degrade high&#8208;concentration TC. Under alkaline conditions, Por&#8208;HQ&#8208;COF converts into Por&#8208;BQ&#8208;COF, can effectively photosynthesize H2O2 (1525 &#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 at &#955; &gt; 420 nm) in the absence of any sacrificial reagents, and reveal the strong alkalinity lower the energy barrier of hydrogen extraction from H2O and clarify active sites for H2O2 production. This work provides a new strategy for developing smart photocatalysts and fulfill the application across the full pH environment.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Accessible Iron Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Durable and Temperature&#8208;Adaptive Laminated Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
F&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts with high density of accessible sites (D&#8208;Fe&#8208;N/C) is fabricated by a cascade capturing strategy. Systematic structural and electrochemical characterizations demonstrate that the high active site density and site utilization enable D&#8208;Fe&#8208;N/C showcases excellent ORR performance, which is further verified in laminated zinc&#8208;air batteries with remarkable durability and temperature&#8208;adaptive.








Abstract
Designing single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with high density of accessible sites by improving metal loading and sites utilization is a promising strategy to boost the catalytic activity, but remains challenging. Herein, a high site density (SD) iron SAC (D&#8208;Fe&#8208;N/C) with 11.8 wt.% Fe&#8208;loading is reported. The in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy technique attests that the accessible active SD and site utilization of D&#8208;Fe&#8208;N/C reach as high as 1.01 &#215; 1021 site g&#8722;1 and 79.8%, respectively. Therefore, D&#8208;Fe&#8208;N/C demonstrates superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in terms of a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.918 V and turnover frequency of 0.41 e site&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. The excellent ORR property of D&#8208;Fe&#8208;N/C is also demonstrated in the liquid zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs), which exhibit a high peak power density of 306.1 mW cm&#8722;2 and an ultra&#8208;long cycling stability over 1200 h. Moreover, solid&#8208;state laminated ZABs prepared by presetting an air flow layer show a high specific capacity of 818.8 mA h g&#8722;1, an excellent cycling stability of 520 h, and a wide temperature&#8208;adaptive from &#8722;40 to 60 &#176;C. This work not only offers possibilities by improving metal&#8208;loading and catalytic site utilization for exploring efficient SACs, but also provides strategies for device structure design toward advanced ZABs.

         <title>Hierarchical Carbon&#8208;Based Electrocatalyst with Functional Separation Properties for Efficient pH Universal Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate into value&#8208;added NH3 not only facilitates wastewater denitrification but also promotes nitrogen circulation. The hierarchical carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free electrocatalyst with multi&#8208;topological defect&#8208;induced active sites in graphene sheets/outside carbon layer and the pristine carbon nanotubes as the conductive core achieves high activity and durability for electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate in a wide pH range.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (eNO3&#8722;RR) to ammonia (NH3) across varying pH is of great significance for the treatment of practical wastewater containing nitrate. However, developing highly active and stable catalysts that function effectively in a wide pH range remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a hierarchical carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free electrocatalyst (C&#8208;MFEC) of winged carbon coaxial nanocables (W&#8208;CCNs, in situ generated graphene nanosheets and outside carbon layer with abundant topological defects from pristine carbon nanotubes, CNTs), is prepared through moderate oxidation of CNTs and the subsequent introduction of topological defects. The W&#8208;CCNs feature functional separation properties, with an inner core of pristine CNTs that facilitates efficient charge transfer, while the outer shell is composed of in situ generated graphene nanosheets and carbon layers enriched with topological defects characterized by distinct carbon atom configurations, which play a crucial role in promoting the adsorption of NO3&#8722;, the dissociation of water, and the N&#9472;H bond formation. This innovative design enables the C&#8208;MFEC to exhibit outstanding performance for eNO3&#8722;RR, operating efficiently with the NH3 yield rates of 49.5, 75.3, and 88.1&#160;g h&#8722;1 gcat.&#8722;1 in acidic, neutral, and alkaline media, respectively. Such performance metrics not only outshine C&#8208;MFECs but also rival or surpass those of certain metal&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Tuning Absorption State and Intermolecular Potential of Organic Semiconductors for Narrowband Ultraviolet Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Narrowband response of organic semiconductors determines the band selectivity and anti&#8208;interference in the photodetection process. For constructing strong anti&#8208;interference photodetectors, a general strategy is developed to achieve narrowband ultraviolet&#8208;responsive organic semiconductors by tuning the absorption state and intermolecular potential of organic semiconductor.








Abstract
Narrowband response of organic semiconductors determines the band selectivity and anti&#8208;interference of the organic photodetectors, which are pursued for a long time but have not yet been resolved in the UV band. Herein, a feasible strategy is developed to realize narrowband UV response by tuning the absorption state and intermolecular potential of organic semiconductors. The as&#8208;designed non&#8208;Donor&#8208;Acceptor molecule, 2,5&#8208;diphenylthieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (2,5&#8208;DPTT), exhibits narrowband absorption by fully suppressing the charge transfer state absorption. Simultaneously, the intermolecular potential is significantly enhanced (to &#8776;90 KJ mol&#8722;1) by modulating the molecular planarity. Consequently, the UV photodetector based on 2,5&#8208;DPTT achieves excellent narrowband response at 310 nm wavelength and a record&#8208;breaking photosensitivity (P = 1.21 &#215; 106) in the deep UV range. In the demonstration application of flame alarm, the flame detector based on 2,5&#8208;DPTT single crystal exhibits excellent anti&#8208;interference capability. This work provides the inspiration for designing narrowband responsive organic semiconductors and building up multifunctional optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Carbon Surface Chemistry: Benchmark for the Analysis of Oxygen Functionalities on Carbon Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reliable benchmark for qualitative and quantitative analysis of oxygen functional groups on carbon surface is established by in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations. And the dynamic evolution of carbon surface reveals the special flame&#8208;retardant effect and anchor metal ability of oxygen functionalities on carbon materials. These findings strengthen the understanding of carbon surface chemistry from an atomic perspective.








Abstract
The explicit roles of the hardly avoidable oxygen species on carbon materials in various fields remain contentious due to the limitations of characterization techniques, which lead to a lack of fundamental understanding of carbon surface chemistry. This study delves exhaustively into the comprehension of the features of different oxygen&#8208;modified carbons through the dynamic evolution of surficial oxygen functional groups. Significant differences of thermal stability and electronic properties among various oxygen species are elucidated via in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, providing a reliable benchmark for identifying oxygen functional groups on carbon materials. The chemical properties of the carbon materials are simultaneously investigated to show the influence of the oxygen functional groups on carbon structures, redox stability, and scalable metal adsorption. These findings not only consider the common misconception that oxygen species produced under various conditions possess identical properties but also raise awareness of understanding carbon surface chemistry in the atomic level.

         <title>Broadband THz Modulation via Solid&#8208;State Organic Electrochemical Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel organic electrochemical device achieving over 90% reversible THz modulation via a conducting polymer is developed. The device demonstrates stability under repeated and continuous voltage switching and can operate in either depletion or accumulation modes. This device introduces a new option for future THz wireless sensing and communications, and application scope for organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors.








Abstract
The sub&#8208;Terahertz and Terahertz bands play a critical role&#160;in next&#8208;generation wireless communication and sensing technologies, thanks to the large amount of available bandwidth in this spectral regime. While long&#8208;wavelength (microwave to mm&#8208;Wave) and short&#8208;wavelength (near&#8208;infrared to ultraviolet) devices are well&#8208;established and studied, the sub&#8208;THz to THz regime remains relatively underexplored and underutilized. Traditional approaches used in the aforementioned spectral regions are more difficult to replicate in the THz band, leading to the need for the development of novel devices and structures that can manipulate THz radiation effectively. Herein a novel organic, solid&#8208;state electrochemical device is presented, capable of achieving modulation depths of over 90% from &#8776;500&#160;nm of a conducting polymer that switches conductivity over a large dynamic range upon application of an electronically controllable external bias. The stability of such devices under long&#8208;term, repeated voltage switching, as well as continuous biasing at a single voltage, is also explored. Switching stabilities and long&#8208;term bias stabilities are achieved over two days for both use cases. Additionally, both depletion mode (always &#8220;ON&#8221;) and accumulation mode (always &#8220;OFF&#8221;) operation are demonstrated. These results suggest applications of organic electrochemical THz modulators in large area and flexible implementations.

         <title>Colloidal Ink Engineering for Slot&#8208;Die Processes to Realize Highly Efficient and Robust Perovskite Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is presented for fabricating high&#8208;efficiency, highly stable perovskite solar cells, and minimodules using a slot&#8208;die process based on colloidal inks. By incorporating the antisolvents toluene and chlorobenzene as modulator solvents, a colloidal ink system is formulated with superior rheological properties compared to conventional precursor inks. This colloidal strategy achieves devices with a maximum efficiency of 21.32% and remarkable long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a promising alternative to silicon solar cells, but challenges remain in developing perovskite inks and processes suitable for large&#8208;scale production. This study introduces a novel approach using colloidal inks incorporating toluene and chlorobenzene as co&#8208;antisolvents for PSC fabrication via slot&#8208;die process. It is found that colloidal inks that are strategically engineered can significantly improve the rheological properties of perovskite inks, leading to enhanced wettability and high&#8208;quality film formation. The formation of large colloids such as &#945; cubic perovskite, &#948; hexagonal perovskite and transition intermediate phases promotes heterogeneous nucleation and lowers activation energy for crystallization, resulting in superior crystal growth and improved film morphology. Notably, the co&#8208;solvent enhances the FA&#8208;PbI3 binding energy and weakens the dimethyl sulfoxide coordination, which is more thermodynamically favorable for perovskite crystallization. This colloidal strategy yields devices with a maximum efficiency of 21.32% and remarkable long&#8208;term stability, retaining 77% of initial efficiency over 10115 h. The study demonstrates the scalability of this approach, achieving 20.26% efficiency in lab&#8208;scale minimodules and 19.15% in larger convergence minimodules. These findings provide an understanding of the complex relationship between ink composition, rheological properties, film quality, crystallization kinetics, and device performance.

         <title>Stretchable and Permeable Liquid Metal Micromeshes Featuring Strain&#8208;Insensitive Resistance Through In Situ Structural Transformations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stretchable and permeable liquid metal micromeshes are presented, characterized by strain&#8208;insensitive resistance for potential applications in textile electronics. These micromeshes are produced by spin&#8208;coating liquid metal onto microfiber textiles and then subjecting them to several stretching cycles. The considerable transformation in their microstructure alters the deformation mode during stretching, thereby effectively minimizing fluctuations in resistance.








Abstract
Gallium&#8208;based liquid metals hold promises for applications in stretchable electronics and beyond. However, these materials often encounter notable resistance increases during stretching and have negligible permeability to gases and liquids. This study presents an in situ structural transformation mechanism to create stretchable and permeable liquid metal micromeshes with strain&#8208;insensitive resistance. These micromeshes are fabricated by spin&#8208;coating liquid metal onto microfiber textiles and subjecting them to several stretching cycles. Consequently, the micromeshes transform from a smooth finish to wrinkled textures due to the growth in their oxide nanoskins. The distinct microstructure alters the stretching&#8208;relaxing mode to folding&#8208;unfolding, thereby minimizing fluctuations in resistance. The practical significance of this development is demonstrated through the fabrication of wearable heaters and LED matrices using transformed liquid metal micromeshes. Moreover, when integrated into Janus textiles featuring unidirectional water transport, these micromesh conductors act as sensing electrodes capable of acquiring high&#8208;fidelity biopotentials, even during intense sweating. These advancements highlight the capability of ambient air as a powerful reactive environment for tailoring the properties of microscale liquid metals.

However, these materials often encounter notable resistance increases during stretching and have negligible permeability to gases and liquids. This study presents an in situ structural transformation mechanism to create stretchable and permeable liquid metal micromeshes with strain-insensitive resistance. These micromeshes are fabricated by spin-coating liquid metal onto microfiber textiles and subjecting them to several stretching cycles. Consequently, the micromeshes transform from a smooth finish to wrinkled textures due to the growth in their oxide nanoskins. The distinct microstructure alters the stretching-relaxing mode to folding-unfolding, thereby minimizing fluctuations in resistance. The practical significance of this development is demonstrated through the fabrication of wearable heaters and LED matrices using transformed liquid metal micromeshes. Moreover, when integrated into Janus textiles featuring unidirectional water transport, these micromesh conductors act as sensing electrodes capable of acquiring high-fidelity biopotentials, even during intense sweating. These advancements highlight the capability of ambient air as a powerful reactive environment for tailoring the properties of microscale liquid metals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Hermitian Boundary in a Surface Selective Reconstructed Magnetic Weyl Semimetal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study is the first to propose that the surface reconstruction of a Weyl semimetal creates a Hermitian bulk&#8208;non&#8208;Hermitian boundary system. The non&#8208;Hermitian effects arising from the surface reconstruction are manifested by the emergence of non&#8208;topological surface Fermi arcs (NTSFAs) and the broadening of both topological surface Fermi arcs (SFAs) and NTSFAs. These effects are demonstrated through angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements in a surface&#8208;reconstructed Weyl semimetal NdAlSi.








Abstract
Non&#8208;Hermitian physics, studying systems described by non&#8208;Hermitian Hamiltonians, reveals unique phenomena not present in Hermitian systems. Unlike Hermitian systems, non&#8208;Hermitian systems have complex eigenvalues, making their effects less directly observable. Recently, significant efforts have been devoted to incorporating the non&#8208;Hermitian effects into condensed matter physics. However, progress is hindered by the absence of a viable experimental approach. Here, the discovery of the surface&#8208;selectively spontaneous reconstructed Weyl semimetal NdAlSi provides a feasible experimental platform for studying non&#8208;Hermitian physics. Utilizing angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements, surface&#8208;projected density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements, it is demonstrated that surface reconstruction in NdAlSi alters surface Fermi arc (SFA) connectivity and generates new isolated non&#8208;topological SFAs (NTSFAs) by introducing non&#8208;Hermitian terms. The surface&#8208;selective spontaneous reconstructed Weyl semimetal NdAlSi can be viewed as a Hermitian bulk &#8211; non&#8208;Hermitian boundary system. The isolated non&#8208;topological SFAs on the reconstructed surface act as a loss mechanism and open boundary condition (OBC) for the topological electrons and bulk states, serving as non&#8208;Hermitian boundary states. This discovery provides a good experimental platform for exploring new physical phenomena and potential applications based on boundary non&#8208;Hermitian effects, extending beyond purely mathematical concepts. Furthermore, it provides important enlightenment for constructing topological photonic crystals with surface reconstruction and studying their topological&#160;properties.

         <title>Hopping&#8208;Phase Ion Bridge Enables Fast Li+ Transport in Functional Garnet&#8208;Type Solid&#8208;State Battery at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hopping phase ion bridge (HPIB) is introduced into the interface between polyvinylidene fluoride and functionalized Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12; high&#8208;throughput ion transporter (HTIT&#8208;37) is constructed. The self&#8208;adsorption of HPIB at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface effectively enhances the interfacial Li+ transport kinetics and suppresses the formation of lithium dendrites. It provides a more valuable option for the next generation of high energy density solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
Composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) containing Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) is widely regarded as leading candidate for high energy density solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries due to its exceptional ionic conductivity and environmental stability. However, Li2CO3 and LiOH layers at LLZTO surface greatly hinder Li+ transport between LLZTO&#8208;polymer and the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface. Herein, the surface of LLZTO is boronized to obtain functionalized LLZTO, and its conversion mechanism is clarified. By dissolving the crystal structure of cellulose to obtain hopping&#8208;phase ion bridge (HPIB), which release the Li+ transport activity of its oxygen&#8208;containing polar functional group (&#9472;OH, &#9472;O&#9472;). Therefore, a high&#8208;throughput ion transporter (HTIT&#8208;37) with high ion transfer number (0.86) is prepared by introducing the HPIB into functionalized LLZTO and polyvinylidene fluoride interface by intermolecular hydrogen bond interaction, and it is demonstrated that the HPIB acts as a &#8220;highway&#8221; for the Li+ across this heterogeneous interface. Moreover, the HPIB is found to self&#8208;adsorb on the SEI surface, leading to fast Li+ transport kinetics at anode&#8211;CPE interface. Thus, the lifespan of Li|HTIT&#8208;37|Li is over 8000 h, and the critical current density exceeds 2.3 mA cm&#8722;2. The LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2|Li and Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2|Li battery remains stable with the HPIB&#8208;enhanced electrode process, proving the application potential of LLZTO&#8208;based CPE in high energy density SSLMB.

         <title>Data Readout Techniques for DNA&#8208;Based Information Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a universal genetic material, DNA can inherently encode and transmit information. Various DNA data storage systems are reported as attractive alternatives to current digital data storage media. This review provides a detailed analysis of the characteristics and evolution of readout techniques of DNA storage systems, and discusses challenges and opportunities in readout techniques of DNA data storage systems.








Abstract
DNA is a natural chemical substrate that carries genetic information, which also serves as a powerful toolkit for storing digital data. Compared to traditional&#160;storage media, DNA molecules offer higher storage density, longer lifespan, and lower maintenance energy consumption. In DNA storage process, data readout is a critical step that bridges the gap between DNA molecular/structures with stored digital information. With the continued development of strategies in DNA data storage technology, the readout techniques have evolved. However, there is a lack of systematic introduction and discussion on the readout techniques for reported DNA data storage systems, especially the correlation between the design of the data storage system and the corresponding selection of readout techniques. This review first introduces two main categories of DNA data storage units (i.e., sequence and structure) and their corresponding readout techniques (i.e., sequencing and nonsequencing methods), and then reviewed representative examples of notable advancements in DNA data storage technology, focusing on data storage unit design, and readout technique selection. It also introduces emerging approaches to assist data readout techniques, such as implementation of microfluidic and fluorescent probes. Finally, the paper discusses the limitations, challenges, and potential of DNA data readout approaches.

         <title>Exceptional Cooling Capacity of LiGd0.1Yb0.9F4 at Sub&#8208;Kelvin Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;free LiYb0.9Gd0.1F4 represents prominent &#8722;&#916;Sm values among the representative sub&#8208;Kelvin&#8208;temperature refrigerants throughout the whole temperature range from 0.1 to 1 K, demonstrating an exceptional specific cooling capacity of 46.943 mJ cm&#8722;3 T&#8722;1 at 300 mK in a self&#8208;built two&#8208;stage adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator.








Abstract
Adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration, which utilizes the magnetocaloric effect of magnetic refrigerants, stands as the sole cooling technology capable of achieving sub&#8208;Kelvin temperatures efficiently and reliably without relying on scarce 3He resources or gravity. However, current sub&#8208;Kelvin magnetic refrigerants encounter challenges such as structural instability in vacuum or under mild heating, along with small magnetic entropy change (&#8722;&#916;Sm) values, which significantly limit their practical applications. Here a water&#8208;free magnetic refrigerant, LiGd0.1Yb0.9F4 is reported, prepared by introducing Li&#8314; ions to reduce the dipolar interactions between Gd3+ ions and/or Yb3+ ions. Notably, this refrigerant possesses a magnetic ordering temperature of 85 mK, while its experimental &#8722;&#916;Sm reaches up to 136 mJ cm&#8722;3 K&#8722;1 (0.68 K and 2 T), more than three times the theoretical value of CrK(SO4)2&#183;12H2O. Significantly, this refrigerant not only cools the test sample to temperatures as low as 160 mK but also achieves a specific cooling capacity of 46.943 mJ cm&#8722;3 T&#8722;1 at 300 mK. Remarkably, the specific cooling capacity at 300 mK is more than double that of commercial CrK(SO4)2&#183;12H2O, representing one of the most notable values reported among all known magnetic refrigerants operating at sub&#8208;Kelvin temperatures.

         <title>Rapid, Sensitive Detection of Protein Biomarkers in Minimally&#8208;Processed Blood Products with a Monolithic Sandwich Immunoassay Reagent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8216;Instant FLISA&#8217; (fluorophore&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay) biosensor enables rapid quantification of protein biomarkers at picomolar concentrations within 15&#160;min in undiluted serum and plasma. This is achieved with the &#8216;monolithic dual&#8208;antibody clamp&#8217; reagent that tightly binds to the target molecule and produces a fluorescence signal which is detected with an optical fiber probe.








Abstract
For more than fifty years, the enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) serves as the gold standard for protein biomarker detection. However, conventional ELISA requires considerable sample preparation including reagent addition, incubation, and washing steps, limiting its usefulness at the point&#8208;of&#8208;care. In this work, the &#8220;instant ELISA&#8221; (fluorophore&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay) biosensor that can measure protein biomarkers in the picomolar range within 15&#160;min in undiluted plasma or serum with no sample preparation is described. The sensor leverages a synthetic reagent termed the &#8220;monolithic dual&#8208;antibody clamp&#8221; (MDAC) which preserves the specificity, sensitivity, and generalizability of an ELISA, but produces a fluorescence signal as two surface&#8208;tethered antibodies form a &#8220;sandwich&#8221; by binding to two distinct epitopes on the target. As exemplars, picomolar quantification of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;) and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)&#8208;1, the latter of which is a useful prognostic indicator of cytokine release syndrome in patient plasma samples during chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy are demonstrated.

         <title>Ultrafast and Universal Synthetic Route for Nanostructured Transition Metal Oxides Directly Grown on Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal method for synthesizing nanostructured transition metal oxides (NTMOs) through induced solidification of microdroplets enables rapid production in air within a minute. This method allows precise control of alignment for various applications, including gas sensors and PUFs, and supports doping, reduction, and chalcogenization while preserving morphology.









Abstract
Nanostructured transition metal oxides (NTMOs) have consistently piqued scientific interest for several decades due to their remarkable versatility across various fields. More recently, they have gained significant attention as materials employed for energy storage/harvesting devices as well as electronic devices. However, mass production of high&#8208;quality NTMOs in a well&#8208;controlled manner still remains challenging. Here, a universal, ultrafast, and solvent&#8208;free method is presented for producing highly crystalline NTMOs directly onto target substrates. The findings reveal that the growth mechanism involves the solidification of condensed liquid&#8208;phase TMO microdroplets onto the substrate under an oxygen&#8208;rich ambient condition. This enables a continuous process under ambient air conditions, allowing for processing within just a few tens of seconds per sample. Finally, it is confirmed that the method can be extended to the synthesis of various NTMOs and their related compounds.

         <title>Lyotropic Liquid Crystal Mediated Assembly of Donor Polymers Enhances Efficiency and Stability of Blade&#8208;Coated Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals the concentration&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly of conjugated polymers, uncovering lyotropic liquid crystalline phases in several donor polymers. The extent of this self&#8208;assembly process, determined by the solvent drying dynamics during blade coating, gives distinct film morphologies that significantly impact the device efficiency and stability, offering a framework for optimizing performance through precise control of coating conditions and polymer assembly.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers can undergo complex, concentration&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly during solution processing, yet little is known about its impact on film morphology and device performance of organic solar cells. Herein, lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) mediated assembly across multiple conjugated polymers is reported, which generally gives rise to improved device performance of blade&#8208;coated non&#8208;fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells. Using D18 as a model system, the formation mechanism of LLC is unveiled employing solution X&#8208;ray scattering and microscopic imaging tools: D18 first aggregates into semicrystalline nanofibers, then assemble into achiral nematic LLC which goes through symmetry breaking to yield a chiral twist&#8208;bent LLC. The assembly pathway is driven by increasing solution concentration &#8211; a common driving force during evaporative assembly relevant to scalable manufacturing. This assembly pathway can be largely modulated by coating regimes to give 1) lyotropic liquid crystalline assembly in the evaporation regime and 2) random fiber aggregation pathway in the Landau&#8211;Levich regime. The chiral liquid crystalline assembly pathway resulted in films with crystallinity 2.63 times that of films from the random fiber aggregation pathway, significantly enhancing the T80 lifetime by 50&#8208;fold. The generality of LLC&#8208;mediated assembly and enhanced device performance is further validated using polythiophene and quinoxaline&#8208;based donor polymers.

         <title>A Functionalized 3D&#8208;Printed Ti6Al4V &#8220;Cell Climbing Frame&#8221; Inspired by Marine Sponges to Recruit and Rejuvenate Autologous BMSCs in Osteoporotic Bone Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by marine sponges, the E7 peptide and EXOs&#8208;functionalized &#8220;Cell Climbing Frame&#8221; with a hierarchical porous structure specifically recruits and rejuvenates autologous BMSCs, and enhances cellular proliferation and osteogenic differentiation by down&#8208;regulating senescent&#8208;related genes and decreasing SASP factor release, thereby promoting the repair of osteoporotic bone defects and achieving robust multi&#8208;stage osseointegration.








Abstract
Osteoporosis, characterized by low bone mass and high fracture risk, challenges orthopedic implant design. Conventional 3D&#8208;printed Ti6Al4V scaffolds are mechanically robust but suffer from poor bone regeneration in osteoporotic patients due to stress shielding and cellular senescence. In this study, a functionalized 3D&#8208;printed Ti6Al4V &#8220;Cell Climbing Frame&#8221; is developed, aiming to adapt to the mechanical microenvironment of osteoporosis, effectively recruit and support the adhesion and growth of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), while rejuvenating senescent cells for improved bone regeneration. Inspired by marine sponges, the processing accuracy limitations of selective laser melting (SLM) technology is broke through innovatively constructing a hierarchical porous structure with macropores and micropores nested within each other. Results demonstrate that the unique hierarchical porous scaffold reduces the elastic modulus, facilitates blood penetration, and enhances cell adhesion and growth. Further surface functionalization with E7 peptides and exosomes promotes the attraction and rejuvenation of BMSCs and boosts migration, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation in vitro. In vivo, the functionalized &#8220;Cell Climbing Frame&#8221; accelerates bone repair in osteoporotic rats, while delaying surrounding bone loss, enabling robust multi&#8208;stage osseointegration. This innovation advances 3D&#8208;printed regenerative implants for osteoporotic bone repair.

     alt="A Functionalized 3D-Printed Ti6Al4V &#8220;Cell Climbing Frame&#8221; Inspired by Marine Sponges to Recruit and Rejuvenate Autologous BMSCs in Osteoporotic Bone Repair"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by marine sponges, the E7 peptide and EXOs-functionalized &#8220;Cell Climbing Frame&#8221; with a hierarchical porous structure specifically recruits and rejuvenates autologous BMSCs, and enhances cellular proliferation and osteogenic differentiation by down-regulating senescent-related genes and decreasing SASP factor release, thereby promoting the repair of osteoporotic bone defects and achieving robust multi-stage osseointegration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osteoporosis, characterized by low bone mass and high fracture risk, challenges orthopedic implant design. Conventional 3D-printed Ti6Al4V scaffolds are mechanically robust but suffer from poor bone regeneration in osteoporotic patients due to stress shielding and cellular senescence. In this study, a functionalized 3D-printed Ti6Al4V &#8220;Cell Climbing Frame&#8221; is developed, aiming to adapt to the mechanical microenvironment of osteoporosis, effectively recruit and support the adhesion and growth of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), while rejuvenating senescent cells for improved bone regeneration. Inspired by marine sponges, the processing accuracy limitations of selective laser melting (SLM) technology is broke through innovatively constructing a hierarchical porous structure with macropores and micropores nested within each other. Results demonstrate that the unique hierarchical porous scaffold reduces the elastic modulus, facilitates blood penetration, and enhances cell adhesion and growth. Further surface functionalization with E7 peptides and exosomes promotes the attraction and rejuvenation of BMSCs and boosts migration, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation in vitro. In vivo, the functionalized &#8220;Cell Climbing Frame&#8221; accelerates bone repair in osteoporotic rats, while delaying surrounding bone loss, enabling robust multi-stage osseointegration. This innovation advances 3D-printed regenerative implants for osteoporotic bone repair.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Traditional aqueous electrolytes have a limited electrochemical stability window due to the decomposition voltage of water (&#8776;1.23&#160;V). &#8220;Water&#8208;in&#8208;Salt&#8221; (WIS) electrolytes are developed, which expand the stability window of aqueous electrolytes from 1.23 to 3&#160;V and sparked a global surge of research in aqueous batteries. This breakthrough revealed novel aspects of solvation structure, ion transport mechanisms, and interfacial properties in WIS electrolytes, marking the start of a new era in solution chemistry that extends beyond traditional dilute electrolytes and has implications across electrolyte research. In this review, the current mechanistic understanding of WIS electrolytes and their derivative designs, focusing on the construction of solvation structures is presented. The insights gained and limitations encountered in bulk solvation structure engineering is further discussed. Finally, future directions beyond WIS for advancing aqueous electrolyte design is proposed.

         <title>Unifying Electrochemically&#8208;Driven Multistep Phase Transformations of Rutile TiO2 to Rocksalt Nanograins for Reversible Li+ and Na+ Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals the insight reason for the Li+ and Na+ storage performance of the rutile phase, which is determined by the electrochemically driven formed rocksalt nanograins. Importantly, the electrochemically in situ formed rocksalt phase has open diffusion channels for rapid Li+ or Na+ (de)intercalations through a solid&#8208;solution mechanism, which determines the pseudocapacitive, &#8220;mirror&#8208;like&#8221; cyclic voltammetry curves and excellent rate capabilities.








Abstract
Rutile titanium dioxide (TiO2(R)) lacks octahedral vacancies, which is not suitable for Li+ and Na+ intercalation via reversible two&#8208;phase transformations, but it displays promising electrochemical properties. The origins of these electrochemical performances remain largely unclear. Herein, the Li+ and Na+ storage mechanisms of TiO2(R) with grain sizes ranging from 10 to 100 nm are systematically investigated. Through revealing the electrochemically&#8208;driven atom rearrangements, nanosize effect and kinetics analysis of TiO2(R) nanograins during repeated cycling with Li+ or Na+, a unified mechanism of electrochemically&#8208;driven multistep rutile&#8208;to&#8208;rocksalt phase transformations is demonstrated. Importantly, the electrochemically in situ formed rocksalt phase has open diffusion channels for rapid Li+ or Na+ (de)intercalation through a solid&#8208;solution mechanism, which determines the pseudocapacitive, &#8220;mirror&#8208;like&#8221; cyclic voltammetry curves and excellent rate capabilities. Whereas, the nanosize effect determines the different Li+ and Na+ storage capacities because of their distinct reaction depths. Remarkably, the TiO2(R)&#8208;10 nm anode in situ turns into rocksalt nanograins after 30 cycles with Na+, which delivers a reversible capacity of &#8776;200 mAh g&#8722;1, high&#8208;rate capability of 97 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1 and long&#8208;term cycling stability over 3000 cycles. The findings provide deep insights into the in situ phase evolutions with boosted electrochemical Li+ or Na+ storage performance.

         <title>Local Chemical Enhancement and Gating of Organic Coordinated Ionic&#8208;Electronic Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Record ion mobility and conductivities are revealed within a nanoscopic interfacial superhighway of an organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor. Fast ion transport can be controlled by hydrophobicity of molecules local to this channel, effectively gating ion access to the superhighway. This mechanism is used in a novel chemical sensing device which detects the dynamics of a local, buried chemical reaction.








Abstract
Superior properties in organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) over inorganic counterparts have inspired intense interest in biosensing, soft&#8208;robotics, neuromorphic computing, and smart medicine. However, slow ion transport relative to charge transport in these materials is a limiting factor. Here, it is demonstrated that hydrophilic molecules local to an interfacial OMIEC nanochannel can accelerate ion transport with ion mobilities surpassing electrophoretic transport by more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, ion access to this interfacial channel can be gated through local surface energy. This mechanism is applied in a novel sensing device, which electronically detects and characterizes chemical reaction dynamics local to the buried channel. The ability to enhance ion transport at the nanoscale in OMIECs as well as govern ion transport through local chemical signaling enables new functionalities for printable, stretchable, and biocompatible mixed conduction devices.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature Resistance Photoluminescence Carbonized Polymer Dots Through Equilibrium Bi&#8208;Confinement Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, bi&#8208;confinement effects arising from a highly cross&#8208;linked polymer network and rigid Al&#8322;O&#8323; matrix are exploited to achieve ultra&#8208;stable carbonized polymer dots (CPDs). The obtained CPDs@Al2O3 composite demonstrates exceptional long&#8208;term stability in various solvents and high photoluminescence emission thermotolerance up to 500&#160;K for 150&#160;h, representing the best performance of carbon dots under harsh conditions reported to date.








Abstract
Carbon dots are emerging luminescent nanomaterials that have drawn considerable attention due to their abundance, environmental friendliness, and customizable optical properties. However, their susceptibility to temperature&#8208;induced vibrational exciton changes and the tendency to thermal quenching of emission have hindered their practical applications. Here, a method is reported for achieving high&#8208;temperature photoluminescence carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) through a bi&#8208;confinement approach that involves a highly cross&#8208;linked polymer network and a rigid Al2O3 matrix. As the temperature increased from 303 to 500&#160;K, the fluorescence and phosphorescence emission intensities of CPDs@Al2O3 remained virtually unchanged, with the emission duration exceeding 150&#160;h at 500&#160;K. Additionally, CPDs@Al2O3 composites with different degrees of carbonization exhibit dynamic excitation&#8208;dependent photoluminescence properties, which can be patterned for multiple information encryption application. This work provides a concept for designing stable and luminous CPDs under harsh conditions, thus expanding their potential application range.

         <title>Soft&#8208;Actuated Cuff Electrodes with Minimal Contact for Bidirectional Peripheral Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft&#8208;actuated cuff electrodes (SACE) for bidirectional peripheral interfaces enable minimal and secure contact to the nerve through fluid injection&#8208;based soft actuation. A 3D bent structure can grasp and securely contact the nerves with only a little pressure (&lt;1.21 gram&#8208;force). The SACE can achieve negligible damage to the nerve during recording of sensory and motor feedback signals with superior SNR and neuromodulation for long&#8208;term studies.








Abstract
Neural interfaces with embedded electrical functions, such as cuff electrodes, are essential for monitoring and stimulating peripheral nerves. Still, several challenges remain with cuff electrodes because sutured devices can damage the nerve by high pressure and the secured contact of electrodes with the nerve is hard to accomplish, which however is essential in maintaining electrical performance. Here, a sutureless soft&#8208;actuated cuff electrodes (SACE) that can envelop the nerve conveniently by creating a bent shape controlled upon fluid injection, is introduced. Moreover, fluid injection protrudes part of the device where electrodes are formed, thereby achieving minimized, soft but secure contact between the electrodes and the nerve. In vivo results demonstrate the successful recording and stimulation of peripheral nerves over time up to 6 weeks. While securing contact with the nerve, the implanted electrodes can preserve the nerve intact with no reduction in blood flow, thereby indicating only minimal compressive force applied to the nerve. The SACE is expected to be a promising tool for recording and stimulation of peripheral nerves toward bidirectional neuroprostheses.

A robust photo&#8208;/electrothermal icephobic surface with dynamic phase&#8208;transition micro&#8208;nanostructures has been developed through laser microfabrication and surface engineering. The engineered surface demonstrates highly efficient, long&#8208;term stable anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing performance, as well as exceptional superhydrophobicity. A key breakthrough is the resolution of the mechanical interlocking issue, a common challenge for the practical application of superhydrophobic surfaces in anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing.








Abstract
Photothermal superhydrophobic surfaces present a promising energy&#8208;saving solution for anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing, offering effective icing delay and photothermal de&#8208;icing capabilities. However, a significant challenge in their practical application is the mechanical interlocking of micro&#8208;nanostructures with ice formed from condensed water vapor, leading to meltwater retention and compromised functionality post&#8208;de&#8208;icing. Here, a robust photo&#8208;/electrothermal icephobic surface with dynamic phase&#8208;transition micro&#8208;nanostructures are demonstrated through laser microfabrication and surface engineering. The engineered surface exhibits ultra&#8208;efficient, long&#8208;term stable anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing performance and excellent superhydrophobicity, demonstrating an icing delay of &#8776; 1250 s, photothermal de&#8208;icing in 8 s, water contact angle of 165&#176;, and sliding angle of 0.2&#176;. Furthermore, the surface maintains efficient anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing ability and water repellency after 400 linear abrasion cycles under 0.93&#160;MPa. Remarkably, under simulated natural icing conditions, where water vapor freezes within the micro&#8208;nanostructures causing mechanical interlocking, the surface remains entirely non&#8208;wetted after photo&#8208;/electrothermal de&#8208;icing, maintaining superhydrophobicity and effectiveness for continued anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing. This exceptional performance is attributed to the designed phase&#8208;transition micro&#8208;nanostructures that liquefy during de&#8208;icing, significantly reducing interactions with water molecules, as quantitatively validated by molecular dynamics simulations. This work provides new perspectives and methodologies for designing and creating innovative, high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing surfaces.

         <title>Scalable Multistep Roll&#8208;to&#8208;Roll Printing of Multifunctional and Robust Reentrant Microcavity Surfaces via a Wetting&#8208;Induced Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multifunctionality of reentrant microcavity geometries for different materials is investigated, and a novel and efficient method for fabricating such geometry is proposed by analyzing capillary fluid behavior. This approach addresses the limitations of existing methods to provide a cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;throughput solution for generating multifunctional reentrant surfaces, which is expected to be utilized in various fields.








Abstract
Owing to their unique structural robustness, interconnected reentrant structures offer multifunctionality for various applications. a scalable multistep roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll&#160;printing method is proposed for fabricating reentrant microcavity surfaces, coined as wetting&#8208;induced interconnected reentrant geometry (WING) process. The key to the proposed WING process is a highly reproducible reentrant structure formation controlled by the capillary action during contact between prefabricated microcavity structure and spray&#8208;coated ultraviolet&#8208;curable resins. It demonstrates the superior liquid repellency of the WING structures, which maintain large contact angles even with low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids, and their robust capability to retain solid particles and liquids under external forces. In addition, the scalable and continuous fabrication approach addresses the limitations of existing methods, providing a cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;throughput solution for creating multifunctional reentrant surfaces for anti&#8208;icing, biofouling prevention, and particle capture.

         <title>Tailorable Fluorescent Perovskite Quantum Dots for Multiform Manufacturing via Two&#8208;Step Thiol&#8208;Ene Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel UV&#8208;induced two&#8208;step thiol&#8208;ene &#8220;click chemistry&#8221; is introduced for the tailorable fluorescent perovskite quantum dots (T&#8208;PQDs). A protective shell is formed around the PQDs in the first step, while chemical cross&#8208;linking between PQD and thiol&#8208;ene polymer occurs in the second step. The T&#8208;PQDs offer high efficiency, stability, and processability, facilitating their multiform manufacturing for a wide range of applications.








Abstract
In practical applications, fluorescent perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) must exhibit high efficiency, stability, and processibility. So far, it remains a challenge to synthesize PQDs with stable dispersibility in tailorable monomers both before and after photocuring. In this work, a novel strategy of UV&#8208;induced two&#8208;step thiol&#8208;ene &#8220;click chemistry&#8221; is proposed to prepare PQDs with these attributes. The first step aims to epitaxially grow a shell around the PQD core to ensure stable dispersibility in a thiol&#8208;ene monomer solution. The second step is to achieve stable dispersibility in the photocured thiol&#8208;ene matrixes for multiform manufacturing processes. The tailorable PQDs (T&#8208;PQDs) not only have the highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) to &#8776;100% for green emission and over 96% for red emission, but also exhibit remarkable stability under severe conditions, including &#8220;double 85&#8221; aging, water exposure, and mechanical stress. Moreover, their exceptional processability allows for various processing techniques, including slot&#8208;die coating, inkjet printing, direct&#8208;laser writing, UV&#8208;light 3D printing, nanoimprinting, and spin coating. The high efficiency and stability of T&#8208;PQDs facilitate their multiform manufacturing for a wide range of applications.

         <title>Multiscale Manufacturing of Recyclable Polyimide Composite Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitigating embodied emissions is becoming increasingly crucial as the energy supply shifts toward more sustainable sources. A recycling strategy is guided by molecular simulation to reach recycling of high&#8208;performance polyimide&#8208;based aerogels. The recyclable composites can be fabricated using various manufacturing techniques to produce fibers (1D), membranes (2D), and complex structures (3D). The unique combination facilitates the sustainable utilization of outstanding aerogel composites in protective clothing, electric mobility, consumer goods, and aeronautics.








Abstract
Mitigating embodied emissions is becoming increasingly crucial as the energy supply shifts toward more sustainable sources. Bio&#8208;based materials present a potentially more sustainable alternative to synthetic polymers; however, it often do not yet match the performance of synthetic materials. Given the ongoing reliance on high&#8208;performance, high&#8208;environmental&#8208;impact materials, it is essential to ensure their complete recyclability. Aerogels, recognized by IUPAC as one of the top ten emerging technologies, are witnessing rapid market growth in thermal insulation and thermal protection applications. In certain applications, synthetic and composite aerogels exhibit superior performance, particularly under high temperatures. Here, molecular simulation tools are employed to elucidate the interaction forces between polymers and solvents, develop a recycling strategy for polyimide&#8208;based aerogels, and demonstrate their application in thermal protection for firefighter textiles and thermal runaway protection for Li&#8208;ion battery packs. These composites are engineered for disassembly, allowing for the complete recovery of starting materials without any degradation of components after multiple recycling cycles. The recyclable composites can be fabricated using various manufacturing techniques to produce fibers (1D), membranes (2D), and complex structures (3D). This unique combination of outstanding performance and excellent recyclability facilitates the sustainable utilization of aerogels in protective clothing, electric mobility, consumer goods, and aeronautics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitigating embodied emissions is becoming increasingly crucial as the energy supply shifts toward more sustainable sources. Bio-based materials present a potentially more sustainable alternative to synthetic polymers; however, it often do not yet match the performance of synthetic materials. Given the ongoing reliance on high-performance, high-environmental-impact materials, it is essential to ensure their complete recyclability. Aerogels, recognized by IUPAC as one of the top ten emerging technologies, are witnessing rapid market growth in thermal insulation and thermal protection applications. In certain applications, synthetic and composite aerogels exhibit superior performance, particularly under high temperatures. Here, molecular simulation tools are employed to elucidate the interaction forces between polymers and solvents, develop a recycling strategy for polyimide-based aerogels, and demonstrate their application in thermal protection for firefighter textiles and thermal runaway protection for Li-ion battery packs. These composites are engineered for disassembly, allowing for the complete recovery of starting materials without any degradation of components after multiple recycling cycles. The recyclable composites can be fabricated using various manufacturing techniques to produce fibers (1D), membranes (2D), and complex structures (3D).

         <title>Stretchable Multimodal Photonic Sensor for Wearable Multiparameter Health Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stretchable multimodal photonic sensor capable of simultaneously detecting and discriminating strain deformations, temperature, and sweat pH is developed for on&#8208;skin health monitoring. By integrating multiple sensing mechanisms in a single hydrogel&#8208;coated PDMS optical fiber (HPOF) at distinct wavelengths, the device achieves simultaneous monitoring of heartbeat, respiration, body temperature, and sweat pH of a person in real&#8208;time with negligible crosstalk.








Abstract
Stretchable sensors that can conformally interface with the skins for wearable and real&#8208;time monitoring of skin deformations, temperature, and sweat biomarkers offer critical insights for early disease prediction and diagnosis. Integration of multiple modalities in a single stretchable sensor to simultaneously detect these stimuli would provide a more comprehensive understanding of human physiology, which, however, has yet to be achieved. Here, this work reports, for the first time, a stretchable multimodal photonic sensor capable of simultaneously detecting and discriminating strain deformations, temperature, and sweat pH. The multimodal sensing abilities are enabled by realization of multiple sensing mechanisms in a hydrogel&#8208;coated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) optical fiber (HPOF), featured with high flexibility, stretchability, and biocompatibility. The integrated mechanisms are designed to operate at distinct wavelengths to facilitate stimuli decoupling and employ a ratiometric detection strategy for improved robustness and accuracy. To simplify sensor interrogation, spectrally&#8208;resolved multiband emissions are generated upon the excitation of a single&#8208;wavelength laser, utilizing upconversion luminescence (UCL) and radiative energy transfer (RET) processes. As proof of concept, this work demonstrates the feasibility of simultaneous monitoring of the heartbeat, respiration, body temperature, and sweat pH of a person in real&#8208;time, with only a single sensor.

         <title>An Adaptive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Discriminates Xylene Isomers by Shape&#8208;Responsive Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A shape&#8208;responsive MOF is employed to discern subtle shape differences among xylene isomers. The adsorbent deforms adaptively to match the shapes of isomer molecules, translating these diverse shapes into characteristic deformation energies. With &#8220;adaptive fitting&#8221; mechanism, where deformation energy scales with the mismatch between molecular shape and pore geometry, the adsorbent energetically favors PX over other isomers, thereby achieving energy&#8208;sieving of xylene isomers.









Abstract
The separation of xylene isomers, especially para&#8208;xylene, is a crucial but challenging process in the chemical industry due to their similar molecular dimensions. Here, a flexible metal&#8211;organic framework, Ni(ina)2, (ina = isonicotinic acid) is employed to effectively discriminate xylene isomers. The adsorbent with adaptive deformation accommodates the shapes of isomer molecules, thereby translating their subtle shape differences into characteristic framework deformation energies. Through a combination of multiple local flexibility behaviors, Ni(ina)2 exhibits guest&#8208;specific structural transformations that energetically favor para&#8208;xylene over other isomers. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, in situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and theoretical investigations validate this &#8220;adaptive fitting&#8221; mechanism, where the degree of structural deformation scales with the mismatch between the molecular shape and pore geometry. As a result, Ni(ina)2 achieves exceptional para&#8208;xylene selectivity in both liquid and vapor phase separations, maintaining a high para&#8208;xylene purity and productivity. This work demonstrates a novel strategy of exploiting framework flexibility to address challenging molecular separations and provides fresh insights into the design of selective adsorbents.

Polymorphing Hydrogels &#8211; Sculpting with Light
Polymorphing hydrogels can be reshaped on demand by shining light on specific areas. These hydrogels incorporate photo&#8208;reactive DNA cross&#8208;links, whose lengths are reversibly controlled by UV or visible light. Under UV illumination, the cross&#8208;links shorten, causing the hydrogel to contract, while exposure to visible light restores their original length. The image symbolizes this process by depicting a &#8220;VIS&#8221;ible man and &#8220;UV&#8221;men working together to sculpt the material. More details can be found in article number 2414648 by Eunjin Choi, Yeongjae Choi, and co&#8208;workers.

Organic Electronics
Record ion mobility and conductivities are revealed within a nanoscopic interfacial superhighway of an organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor. Fast ion transport can be controlled by hydrophobicity of molecules local to this channel, effectively gating ion access to the superhighway. This mechanism is used in a novel chemical sensing device which detects the dynamics of a local, buried chemical reaction. More details can be found in article number 2406281 by Tamanna Khan, Terry McAfee, Thomas J. Ferron, Awwad Alotaibi, and Brian A. Collins.

Abstract
The efficient mitigation of harmful nitrogen oxides (NOx) under ambient conditions remains a challenging task. Selective adsorption offers a viable solution for the capture of low&#8208;concentration NOx from the polluted stream at low temperatures. This review summarizes recent progress in the development of NO2 adsorbents, delves into the understanding of adsorption mechanisms, and discusses the criteria for evaluating their performance. First, the present NO2 adsorbents are categorized according to their distinct characteristics. This review then provides insights into the mechanisms of adsorption, highlighting the interaction between active sites and NO2, drawing from both experimental and theoretical research. The performance of these adsorbents is also assessed, focusing on their capacity, reusability, stability and selectivity. Finally, perspectives are proposed to address the significant challenges and explore potential advancements for NO2 adsorbents, aiming to enhance their suitability for diverse practical application scenarios.

         <title>Hierarchically Promoted Light Harvesting and Management in Photothermal Solar Steam Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the critical role of multi&#8208;scale hierarchical structures, from molecular to macro levels, in optimizing light harvesting and photothermal efficiency in solar steam generation (SSG) systems. By tailoring materials and structures to enhance light absorption, manage thermal properties, and support effective water transport, these integrated designs advance solar&#8208;thermal desalination as a sustainable solution to water scarcity.








Abstract
Solar steam generation (SSG) presents a promising approach to addressing the global water crisis. Central to SSG is solar photothermal conversion that requires efficient light harvesting and management. Hierarchical structures with multi&#8208;scale light management are therefore crucial for SSG. At the molecular and sub&#8208;nanoscale levels, materials are fine&#8208;tuned for broadband light absorption. Advancing to the nano&#8208; and microscale, structures are tailored to enhance light harvesting through internal reflections, scattering, and diverse confinement effects. At the macroscopic level, light capture is optimized through rationally designed device geometries, configurations, and arrangements of solar absorber materials. While the performance of SSG relies on various factors including heat transport, physicochemical interactions at the water/air and material/water interfaces, salt dynamics, etc., efficient light capture and utilization holds a predominant role because sunlight is the sole energy source. This review focuses on the critical, yet often underestimated, role of hierarchical light harvesting/management at different dimensional scales in SSG. By correlating light management with the structure&#8208;property relationships, the recent advances in SSG are discussed, shedding light on the current challenges and possible future trends and opportunities in this domain.

         <title>Linking Nanoscopic Insights to Millimetric&#8208;Devices in Formamidinium&#8208;Rich Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review sheds light on the most detrimental nanoscopic phase impurities in FA&#8208;rich perovskite PVs and further, highlights research directions that can mitigate their formation in the final films. The objective is to provide fundamental guidelines for engineering state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art FA&#8208;rich perovskite absorbers pairing exceptional performance and prolonged device stability.








Abstract
Halide&#8208;perovskite semiconductors have a high potential for use in single&#8208;junction and tandem solar cells. Despite their unprecedented rise in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for photovoltaic (PV) applications, it remains unclear whether perovskite solar modules can reach a sufficient operational lifetime. In order to make perovskite solar cells (PSCs) commercially viable, a fundamental understanding of the relationship between their nanostructure, optoelectronic properties, device efficiency, and long&#8208;term operational stability/reliability needs to be established. In this review, the phase instabilities in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art formamidinium (FA)&#8208;rich perovskite absorbers is discussed. Furthermore, the concerted efforts are summarized in this prospect, covering aspects from fundamental research to device engineering. Subsequently, a critical analysis of the dictating impact of the nanoscale landscape of perovskite materials on their resulting intrinsic stability is provided. Finally, the remaining challenges in the field are assessed and future research directions are proposed for improving the operational lifetimes of perovskite devices. It is believed that these approaches, which bridge nanoscale structural properties to working solar cell devices, will be critical to assessing the realization of a bankable PSC product.

         <title>Recent Progress and Challenges of Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Cathode Materials for Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review explores the potential of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based (LRM) cathodes in next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, addressing their challenges, and degradation mechanisms, and proposing strategies for improvement and future research directions.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based (LRM) cathode materials, characterized by their high specific capacity (&gt;250 mAh g&#8722;&#185;) and cost&#8208;effectiveness, represent promising candidates for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, their commercial application is hindered by rapid capacity degradation and voltage fading, which can be attributed to transition metal migration, lattice oxygen release, and the toxicity of Mn ions to the anode solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Recently, the application of LRM cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) has garnered significant interest, as this approach eliminates the liquid electrolyte, thereby suppressing transition metal crosstalk and solid&#8211;liquid interfacial side reactions. This review first examines the historical development, crystal structure, and mechanisms underlying the high capacity of LRM cathode materials. It then introduces the current challenges facing LRM cathode and the associated degradation mechanisms and proposes solutions to these issues. Additionally, it summarizes recent research on LRM materials in ASSBs and suggests strategies for improvement. Finally, the review discusses future research directions for LRM cathode materials, including optimized material design, bulk doping, surface coating, developing novel solid electrolytes, and interface engineering. This review aims to provide further insights and new perspectives on applying LRM cathode materials in ASSBs.

         <title>Advanced Ruthenium&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for NOx Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review offers an in&#8208;depth overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in the Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts for NOx reduction to NH3, covering the mechanism, design, and applications. Additionally, the review presents the primary challenges relevant to relatively high cost, complex reaction mechanism, and serious hydrogen evolution, as well as the critical perspectives on the fronter of this exciting research area.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is widely recognized as a crucial raw material for nitrogen&#8208;based fertilizer production and eco&#8208;friendly hydrogen&#8208;rich fuels. Currently, the Haber&#8211;Bosch process still dominates the worldwide industrial NH3 production, which consumes substantial energy and contributes to enormous CO2 emission. As an alternative NH3 synthesis route, electrocatalytic reduction of NOx species (NO3&#8722;, NO2&#8722;, and NO) to NH3 has gained considerable attention due to its advantages such as flexibility, low power consumption, sustainability, and environmental friendliness. This review timely summarizes an updated and critical survey of mechanism, design, and application of Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts for NOx reduction. First, the reason why the Ru&#8208;based catalysts are good choice for NOx reduction to NH3 is presented. Second, the reaction mechanism of NOx over Ru&#8208;based materials is succinctly summarized. Third, several typical in situ characterization techniques, theoretical calculations, and kinetics analysis are examined. Subsequently, the construction of each classification of the Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts according to the size of particles and compositions is critically reviewed. Apart from these, examples are given on the applications in the production of valuable chemicals and Zn&#8722;NOx batteries. Finally, this review concludes with a summary highlighting the main practical challenges relevant to selectivity and efficiency in the broad range of NOx concentrations and the high currents, as well as the critical perspectives on the fronter of this exciting research area.

It is crucial to gain a deep understanding of tumor&#8208;targeted catalytic materials to enhance targeting precision and therapeutic outcomes. This review focuses on recent advances in these materials and their role in improving catalytic immunotherapy, paving the way for next&#8208;generation cancer therapy.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy holds significant promise for improving cancer treatment efficacy; however, the low response rate remains a considerable challenge. To overcome this limitation, advanced catalytic materials offer potential in augmenting catalytic immunotherapy by modulating the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) through precise biochemical reactions. Achieving optimal targeting precision and therapeutic efficacy necessitates a thorough understanding of the properties and underlying mechanisms of tumor&#8208;targeted catalytic materials. This review provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of recent advancements in tumor&#8208;targeted catalytic materials and their critical role in enhancing catalytic immunotherapy. It highlights the types of catalytic reactions, the construction strategies of catalytic materials, and their fundamental mechanisms for tumor targeting, including passive, bioactive, stimuli&#8208;responsive, and biomimetic targeting approaches. Furthermore, this review outlines various tumor&#8208;specific targeting strategies, encompassing tumor tissue, tumor cell, exogenous stimuli&#8208;responsive, TME&#8208;responsive, and cellular TME targeting strategies. Finally, the discussion addresses the challenges and future perspectives for transitioning catalytic materials into clinical applications, offering insights that pave the way for next&#8208;generation cancer therapies and provide substantial benefits to patients in clinical settings.

         <title>Enhancing Membrane Materials for Efficient Li Recycling and Recovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article systematically explores the recent advances in the membrane processes for lithium cycling and recovery, offering the first correlation between these technologies and technology readiness levels, unveiling the fundamentals for the lithium separation, and providing insights into the future design of membrane materials from both academic and industrial perspectives.








Abstract
Rapid uptake of lithium&#8208;centric technology, e.g., electric vehicles and large&#8208;scale energy storage, is increasing the demand for efficient technologies for lithium extraction from aqueous sources. Among various lithium&#8208;extraction technologies, membrane processes hold great promise due to energy efficiency and flexible operation in a continuous process with potential commercial viability. However, membrane separators face challenges such as the extraction efficiency due to the limited selectivity toward lithium relative to other species. Low selectivity can be ascribed to the uncontrollable selective channels and inefficient exclusion functions. However, recent selectivity enhancements for other membrane applications, such as in gas separation and energy storage, suggest that this may also be possible for lithium extraction. This review article focuses on the innovations in the membrane chemistries based on rational design following separation principles and unveiling the theories behind enhanced selectivity. Furthermore, recent progress in membrane&#8208;based lithium extraction technologies is summarized with the emphasis on inorganic, organic, and composite materials. The challenges and opportunities for developing the next generation of selective membranes for lithium recovery are also pointed out.

         <title>Electrical Spin State Manipulation in All&#8208;Magnet Heterojunctions Using a Ferromagnetic Spin Source</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrical manipulation of spins by spin Hall current from heavy metals facilitates the implementation of multifunctional spintronic devices. This work reports direct evidence of spin current generation in ferromagnets via observation of efficient current&#8208;induced switching of noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn in Mn3Sn/ferromagnet structure. The further realization of field&#8208;free switching suggests the ferromagnets could function as more versatile spin sources.








Abstract
The ability to electrically manipulate spin states in magnetic materials is essential for the advancement of energy&#8208;efficient spintronic device, which is typically achieved in systems composed of a spin source and a magnetic target, where the magnetic state of the target is altered by a charge current. While theories suggest that ferromagnets could function as more versatile spin sources, direct experimental studies involving only the spin source and target layers have been lacking. Here electrical manipulation of spin states in noncolinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn using ferromagnets (Ni, Fe, NiFe, CoFeB) as the spin sources is reported. Both field&#8208;free switching and switching with an assistive field are achieved in Mn3Sn/ferromagnet bilayers, where the switching polarity correlates with the sign of anomalous Hall effect of the ferromagnets. The experimental findings can be accounted for by the presence of spin currents arising from spin&#8208;dependent scattering within the ferromagnets. This finding provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of spin&#8208;conversion in ferromagnets, offering an alternative spin source for novel technological applications.

         <title>A Novel Matrix&#8208;Free Hyperfluorescent System Based on Anti&#8208;Quenching TADF Host for High Color Purity MR&#8208;TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes an advanced design concept for matrix&#8208;free hyperfluorescent systems, utilizing anti&#8208;quenching TADF materials as hosts to overcome aggregation&#8208;induced challenges in traditional MR&#8208;TADF emitters by regulating the energy transfer process. Importantly, this strategy avoids complex chemical modifications of MR&#8208;TADF emitters, making them universal and low&#8208;cost, which will greatly promote the commercialization of hyperfluorescent OLEDs.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on hyperfluorescent system have attracted widespread attention due to their ability to simultaneously achieve improvements in efficiency, lifetime, and color purity by combining the advantages of high exciton utilization sensitizers and high&#8208;color purity emitters. Traditional hyperfluorescent systems typically involve three or four components and are severely sensitive to the doping concentration (&#8776;0.5 wt%) of a terminal emitter, which inevitably causes high costs and difficulties in reproducibility. Here, a novel design concept for a matrix&#8208;free hyperfluorescent (MFHF) system that employs a combination of an anti&#8208;quenching TADF host and a high color purity MR&#8208;TADF emitter is proposed. This strategy allows traditional concentration&#8208;sensitive MR&#8208;TADF emitters to significantly improve exciton utilization and reduce exciton lifetime at high doping levels, without the need for complex molecular modifications. The OLEDs with binary emissive layer achieve pure&#8208;green emission, a maximum external quantum efficiency of over 30%, and a high maximum power efficiency of 145&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1. The approach offers a straightforward and universal method to achieve anti&#8208;quenching matrix&#8208;free hyperfluorescent OLEDs with high color purity, making them promising for commercial applications in low&#8208;cost ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition (UHD) displays.

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zn&#8208;SPAN Batteries with Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;life of Zn&#8208;sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) battery is developed by a tandem catalytic electrolyte containing water and tetraglyme (G4) with iodine (I2) additives. The G4&#8211;I2 synergy activates efficient I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox couple in SPAN, reducing activation energy, and accelerating Zn&#8208;ion kinetics. Additionally, it stabilizes the Zn anode by forming an organic&#8211;inorganic interphase that inducing the generation of the predominant (002) plane.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;sulfur batteries are a high&#8208;capacity and cost&#8208;effective energy storage technology. However, the performance is plagued by the dissolution of intermediate polysulfides formed during conversion. Here, this issue is addressed by developing aqueous rechargeable Zn&#8208;sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries using tandem catalytic systems, containing water and tetraglyme (G4) with iodine (I2) additives. Mechanistic study and experiments reveal that the fully conjugated molecular configurations circumvent the formation of soluble polysulfides and enable reversible co&#8208;storage of H+/Zn2+ with multiple redox&#8208;active centers. The reduced I2 by G4 activates I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox couple in SPAN, reducing activation energy, and accelerating Zn&#8208;ion transfer kinetics. Additionally, it stabilizes the Zn anode by forming an organic&#8211;inorganic interphase that induces the generation of the predominant (002) plane. The as&#8208;assembled Zn&#8208;SPAN batteries exhibit excellent performances, with a high capacity of 1260.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, a high&#8208;rate performance (409.3 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1), and a long cycling stability (81.8% capacity remained over 800 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1). This work takes a crucial step forward in organosulfur compounds accompanied by multi&#8208;electron transfer for the high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Layered Deep&#8208;UV Optical Crystal KZn&#8322;BO&#8323;Br&#8322; as a High&#8208;&#954; Dielectric for 2D Electronic Devices</title>

         <dc:description>
This study introduces AZBX (AZn&#8322;BO&#8323;X&#8322;) as a quasi&#8208;vdW layered dielectric for 2D semiconductor devices, offering a wide bandgap (&#8776;5.6 eV) and high dielectric constant (&#954;&#160;=&#160;13.5). KZBB/MoS&#8322; FETs demonstrate excellent performance, including steep subthreshold swing, high on/off ratio, minimal hysteresis, and low leakage, highlighting AZBX's potential for advanced 2D electronics.









Abstract
The development of dielectrics with atomic planes and van der Waals (vdW) interfaces is essential for enhancing the performance of 2D devices. However, vdW dielectrics often have smaller bandgaps compared to traditional 3D dielectrics, limiting their options. This study introduces AZBX (AZn&#8322;BO&#8323;X&#8322;, where A&#160;=&#160;K or Rb, X&#160;=&#160;Cl or Br), a nonlinear deep&#8208;ultraviolet optical crystal, as a quasi&#8208;vdW layered dielectric ideal for 2D electronic devices. Focusing on KZBB, it's excellent dielectric properties, including a wide bandgap, high dielectric constant (high&#8208;&#954;), and smooth interfaces are demonstrated. When used as the top gate dielectric in a KZBB/MoS&#8322; field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) with MoS&#8322; channels and graphene contacts, the device exhibits outstanding performance, with a steep subthreshold swing (&#8776; 73&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1), high on/off ratio (&#8776; 10&#8311;), negligible hysteresis (0&#8211;8 mV), and stable, low leakage current (&#8776;10&#8315;&#8311; A&#160;cm&#8722;2) before breakdown. This work expands the 2D material and dielectric landscape and highlights the strong potential of AZBX as high&#8208;performance dielectrics.

         <title>Highly Efficient Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids via Electrocatalytic C&#8208;N Coupling Reaction Over an Atomically Dispersed Iron Loaded Defective TiO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient electrocatalytic synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acids with a high glyoxylic acid conversion of &#8776;100% and a glycine selectivity of 80.2% is achieved with an atomically dispersed Fe loaded defective TiO2 monolithic electrocatalyst. This work provides an efficient electrocatalyst for the C&#8208;N coupling synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acids.








Abstract
The synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acids via the electrocatalytic C&#8208;N coupling attracted extensive attention owing to the mild reaction conditions, controllable reaction parameters, and atom economy. However, the &#945;&#8208;amino acid yield remains unsatisfying. Herein, the efficient electrocatalytic synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acids is achieved with an atomically dispersed Fe loaded defective TiO2 monolithic electrocatalyst (adFe&#8208;TiOx/Ti). The desired electrocatalyst composition for the hydrogenation of oxime is screened. The prepared adFe&#8208;TiOx/Ti exhibited a high glyoxylic acid conversion of &#8776;100% and a glycine selectivity of 80.2%. The electrochemical experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrated that atomically dispersed Fe (adFe) sites and oxygen vacancies (OVs) enhanced the adsorption of glyoxylic acid (GA), glyoxylic oxime (GO), and nitrate (NO3&#8722;). adFe sites further promote the step of H2NO* &#8594; H2NOH* in the conversion of NO3&#8722; to hydroxylamine (NH2OH) and the step of NH&#8208;CH2&#8208;COOH* &#8594; NH2&#8208;CH2&#8208;COOH* in the reduction of GO to glycine. The coupling pathway and the critical intermediate are revealed by synchrotron radiation Fourier transform infrared (SR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopy and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS). Additionally, six other &#945;&#8208;amino acids are successfully synthesized by the adFe&#8208;TiOx/Ti, showcasing its versatility in the electrosynthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acids. This work provides an efficient electrocatalyst for the C&#8208;N coupling synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acids.

         <title>Conjugation Chemistry Markedly Impacts Toxicity and Biodistribution of Targeted Nanoparticles, Mediated by Complement Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugation chemistries are a critical technology in nanomedicine, enabling precise functionalization of nanoparticle surfaces (e.g., via attachment of targeting moieties). This work investigates how conjugation chemistry impacts nanoparticle&#8208;induced complement activation. The results demonstrate that modern conjugation chemistries, although bio&#8208;orthogonal, are not innocuous and must be chosen with opsonins like complement in mind.









Abstract
Conjugation chemistries are a major enabling technology for the development of drug delivery systems, from antibody&#8208;drug conjugates to antibody&#8208;targeted lipid nanoparticles inspired by the success of the COVID&#8208;19 vaccine. However, here it is shown that for antibody&#8208;targeted nanoparticles, the most popular conjugation chemistries directly participate in the activation of the complement cascade of plasma proteins. Their activation of complement leads to large changes in the biodistribution of nanoparticles (up to 140&#8208;fold increased uptake into phagocytes of the lungs) and multiple toxicities, including a 50% drop in platelet count. It is founded that the mechanism of complement activation varies dramatically between different conjugation chemistries. Dibenzocyclooctyne, a commonly used click&#8208;chemistry, caused aggregation of conjugated antibodies, but only on the surface of nanoparticles (not in bulk solution). By contrast, thiol&#8208;maleimide chemistry do not activate complement via its effects on antibodies, but rather because free maleimide bonded to albumin in plasma, and clustered albumin is then attacked by complement. Using these mechanistic insights, solutions are engineered that reduced the activation of complement for each class of conjugation chemistry. These results highlight that while conjugation chemistry is essential for the future of nanomedicine, it is not innocuous and must be designed with opsonins like complement in mind.

Their activation of complement leads to large changes in the biodistribution of nanoparticles (up to 140-fold increased uptake into phagocytes of the lungs) and multiple toxicities, including a 50% drop in platelet count. It is founded that the mechanism of complement activation varies dramatically between different conjugation chemistries. Dibenzocyclooctyne, a commonly used click-chemistry, caused aggregation of conjugated antibodies, but only on the surface of nanoparticles (not in bulk solution). By contrast, thiol-maleimide chemistry do not activate complement via its effects on antibodies, but rather because free maleimide bonded to albumin in plasma, and clustered albumin is then attacked by complement. Using these mechanistic insights, solutions are engineered that reduced the activation of complement for each class of conjugation chemistry. These results highlight that while conjugation chemistry is essential for the future of nanomedicine, it is not innocuous and must be designed with opsonins like complement in mind.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Matrix Viscoelasticity Controls Differentiation of Human Blood Vessel Organoids into Arterioles and Promotes Neovascularization in Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method for differentiating arterioles in human blood vessel organoids is presented. Matrix viscoelasticity for hBVO vessel sprouting is manipulated by synthesizing dynamic and non&#8208;dynamic hydrogels. Dynamic hydrogels stimulate angiogenesis in hBVOs, generate unique smooth muscle cells, and facilitate the formation of arterioles that contribute to neovascularization following a myocardial infarction.








Abstract
Stem cell&#8208;derived blood vessel organoids are embedded in extracellular matrices to stimulate vessel sprouting. Although vascular organoids in 3D collagen I&#8208;Matrigel gels are currently available, they are primarily capillaries composed of endothelial cells (ECs), pericytes, and mesenchymal stem&#8208;like cells, which necessitate mature arteriole differentiation for neovascularization. In this context, the hypothesis that matrix viscoelasticity regulates vascular development is investigated in 3D cultures by encapsulating blood vessel organoids within viscoelastic gelatin/&#946;&#8208;CD assembly dynamic hydrogels or methacryloyl gelatin non&#8208;dynamic hydrogels. The vascular organoids within the dynamic hydrogel demonstrate enhanced angiogenesis and differentiation into arterioles containing smooth muscle cells. The dynamic hydrogel mechanical microenvironment promotes vascular patterning and arteriolar differentiation by elevating notch receptor 3 signaling in mesenchymal stem cells and downregulating platelet&#8208;derived growth factor B expression in ECs. Transplantation of vascular organoids in vivo, along with the dynamic hydrogel, leads to the reassembly of arterioles and restoration of cardiac function in infarcted hearts. These findings indicate that the viscoelastic properties of the matrix play a crucial role in controlling the vascular organization and differentiation processes, suggesting an exciting potential for its application in regenerative medicine.

         <title>Chiton&#8208;Inspired Composites Synergizing Strength and Toughness Through Sinusoidal Interlocking Interfaces for Protective Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiton Lepidozona coreanica wisely uses the sinusoidal interlocking interface to make up for the short board of the cross&#8208;lamellar structures. Inspired by this, a chiton&#8208;inspired composite integrating cross&#8208;lamellar architecture and sinusoidal interlocking interface is proposed. The chiton&#8208;inspired composite has the high strength and toughness under quasi&#8208;static and impact loads, and has promising application prospects in the field of protection.








Abstract
Introducing biological structures into materials design is expected to develop strong and tough structural materials. However, multiple interfaces are introduced simultaneously. They are always the weakest part of load transfer, becoming a critical vulnerability and failure&#8208;prone area. Here, it is the first found that the chiton achieves superior mechanical properties just by incorporating a unique sinusoidal interlocking interface into cross&#8208;lamellar architecture. These special interlocking interfaces make the chiton shell achieve damage delocalization and increase the resistance to crack initiation and propagation. Meanwhile, this &#8220;pre&#8208;engineered&#8221; path significantly increases the travel path of the cracks and balances the strength and toughness under quasi&#8208;static and impact loading. Inspired by this, a novel chiton&#8208;inspired composite is proposed. Through coupling the cross&#8208;lamellar structures and sinusoidal interlocking interfaces, its strength and toughness are increased by 88% and 107% under quasi&#8208;static loading, as well as by 17.8% and 52.4% under impact loading, respectively. These unusual interfaces make up the weak point of cross&#8208;lamellar structures and provide insights into the longer evolution of structural materials.

         <title>Lysosome&#8208;Targeting Protein Degradation Through Endocytosis Pathway Triggered by Polyvalent Nano&#8208;Chimera for AD Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work achieves the polyvalent binding between receptors and ligands through the regulation of ligand density in nano&#8208;system that functioned with precise drug delivery, thereby successfully triggers the lysosome&#8208;targeting protein degradation through endocytosis pathway. Ultimately, the nano&#8208;degrader realizes Alzheimer's disease therapy by modulating the targeted pathological membrane proteins on the damaged blood&#8208;brain barrier.








Abstract
The excessive up&#8208;regulation of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a well&#8208;known pathological marker, drives the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Although lysosome&#8208;targeting protein degradation has emerged as an effective therapeutic modality, the limited lysosome&#8208;sorting efficacy greatly hindered the degradation efficiency of target proteins. Herein, a lysosome&#8208;shuttle&#8208;like nano&#8208;chimera (endoTAC) is proposed based on polyvalent receptor binding mode for enhanced RAGE degradation as well as precise drug delivery. The endoTAC shows a high affinity to RAGE and enhances RAGE degradation due to its polyvalent&#8208;interaction with RAGE. Additionally, endoTAC features increased accumulation in diseased brain and shows promise as a precise brain delivery system. After loading with simvastatin, the SV@endoTAC proves to successfully reverse pathological features both in vitro and in vivo. The work proposes that the combination of a lysosome&#8208;targeting chimera and an effective drug delivery system can be promising in Alzheimer's disease therapy.

         <title>1D Flat Bands in Phosphorene Nanoribbons with Pentagonal Nature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic flat bands are conducive to the emergence of strongly interacting phases of matter. In this work, by reducing dimensionality into 1D, it is experimentally constructed ideal flat bands, derived from 1D zigzag and Lieb lattices, in two phases of phosphorene nanoribbons with a pentagonal nature, by providing direct evidence via the ARPES measurements and atomically resolved STS mapping.








Abstract
Materials with flat bands can serve as a promising platform to investigate strongly interacting phenomena. However, experimental realization of ideal flat bands is mostly limited to artificial lattices or moir&#233; systems. Here, a general way is reported to construct 1D flat bands in phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs) with a pentagonal nature: penta&#8208;hexa&#8208;PNRs and penta&#8208;dodeca&#8208;PNRs, wherein the corresponding 1D flat bands are directly verified by using angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy. It is confirmed that the observed 1D flat bands originate from the electronic 1D zigzag and Lieb lattices, respectively, as revealed by the combination of bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, tight&#8208;binding models, and first&#8208;principles calculations. The study demonstrates a general way to construct 1D flat bands in 1D solid materials system, which provides a robust platform to explore strongly interacting phases of matter.

         <title>Thermal Annealing for High Performance and Memory Behavior in n&#8208;Type Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal annealing of the n&#8208;type mixed conductor has a profound effect on its crystallinity, enhancing electronic mobility and decreasing water uptake during electrochemical charging. This new microstructure imparts an &#8220;ionic memory&#8221; behavior to the material.

N&#8208;type organic mixed ionic electronic conductors (n&#8208;OMIECs) struggle to match the performance of p&#8208;type counterparts, particularly in bioelectronics' flagship device, the organic electrochemical transistor. Enhancing n&#8208;type transistor performance typically necessitates the synthesis of new materials. More sustainable post&#8208;synthetic treatments, known to improve organic devices in dry and oxygen&#8208;free conditions, are not applied to n&#8208;OMIECs. This study introduces thermal annealing to enhance n&#8208;OMIECs' electron mobility without sacrificing their ability to take up ionic charges. Annealing increases the crystallinity of p(gNDI&#8208;gT2), the first designed n&#8208;OMIEC, enhancing its transistor performance to compete with new&#8208;generation NDI&#8208;based materials. Annealing reduces passive and in operando electrolyte uptake without compromising the device threshold voltage, keeping the device power demand low. The microstructure obtained by annealing, combined with the film's strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption and reduced water swelling, enables the creation of a device that retains photocurrent generated upon frequency&#8208;dependent light training. This leads to a microscale, water&#8208;compatible memory device that emulates the learning process of biological neurons triggered by light. This simple device can be implemented in artificial neural networks and face recognition platforms and achieve vector&#8208;matrix multiplication when fabricated in an array form, showcasing the potential for innovative applications in bioelectronics.

         <title>Single&#8208;Cell Isolation Chip Integrated with Multicolor Barcode Array for High&#8208;Throughput Single&#8208;Cell Exosome Profiling in Tissue Samples</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a high&#8208;throughput single&#8208;cell exosome quantification and phenotyping platform using a gentle and efficient photothermal&#8208;driven chip. It achieves &#8776;97% single&#8208;cell isolation efficiency in 5 min, enabling precise exosome analysis of breast cancer cell lines and clinical tissues at the single&#8208;cell level, revealing unique exosome secretion characteristics of subgroups, and providing valuable insights for single&#8208;cell exosome analysis in cancer research.








Abstract
Exosomes, functional biomarkers involved in cancer progression, have gained widespread attention for promoting tumor formation, growth, and metastasis. Current bulk exosome detections in bodily fluids enable cancer functional analysis, but average secretion levels from cell populations, losing parent cell information and ignoring exosome heterogeneity from diverse cell subgroups, necessitating an effective platform for analyzing single&#8208;cell exosome functional heterogeneity. Here, a high&#8208;throughput platform is presented, capable of efficient single&#8208;cell isolation and multi&#8208;color exosome phenotype analysis, as well as quantifying trace exosomes secreted by single cells. Photothermal&#8208;driven single&#8208;cell chips achieve significant single&#8208;cell isolation efficiency (&#8776;97%) within 5 min, facilitating the ultra&#8208;high throughput single&#8208;cell exosome analysis. By conducting mass spectrometry and protein interaction of breast cancer exosome phenotypic proteins, key exosome phenotypes are identified. Tens of thousands of single cells from breast cancer cell lines, and clinical tissues are analyzed, revealing various subgroup differences. The study finds more CD44 and EGFR co&#8208;expressing exosome subgroups in breast cancer cell lines, while immune&#8208;evasion PD&#8208;L1 high&#8208;phenotype exosome subgroups are primarily presented in complex tumor microenvironments, especially in HER2&#8208;positive tissues. This platform offers powerful single&#8208;cell isolation, exosome quantification, and phenotypic analysis capabilities, making it a powerful tool for advancing single&#8208;cell exosome analysis in cancer research.

         <title>Dimethylamine Bismuth Iodide: A Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Enabling Ultra&#8208;Sensitive UVC Photodetection with Low Operating Voltage and High Detectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable lead&#8208;free perovskite, dimethylamine bismuth iodide (DMABI), demonstrates exceptional UVC photodetection. The device exhibits ultralow dark current, high on/off ratio, superior detectivity, and low operating voltage. With high responsivity and external quantum efficiency, DMABI emerges as a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost deep UV photodetectors, outperforming existing materials in key performance metrics.








Abstract
Ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors (PDs) are essential for various applications, but traditional materials face challenges in cost, fabrication, and performance. This study introduces dimethylamine bismuth iodide (DMABI) as a promising lead&#8208;free perovskite for UV PDs, particularly in the UVC region. DMABI demonstrates exceptional device parameters, including an ultralow dark current of 0.12 pA at 0.05&#160;V, a high on/off ratio of 7.1 &#215; 104, and a peak detectivity of 3.18 &#215; 1013 Jones. The unique structure of DMABI, with isolated octahedral units, ensures minimal connectivity, significantly reducing dark current. When exposed to high&#8208;energy UV light, carriers gain sufficient energy to hop between octahedrally coordinated bismuth centres, resulting in substantial photocurrent. The small size of the organic cation facilitates efficient charge transfer, contributing to high responsivity (1.46 A&#160;W&#8722;1) and external quantum efficiency (up to 717%). These results establish DMABI as a superior, low&#8208;cost candidate for UV photodetection, addressing limitations of existing materials. The study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms driving these characteristics and highlights potential for future advancements in UV PD technology.

         <title>Large Area Near&#8208;Field Thermophotovoltaics for Low Temperature Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;field thermophotovoltaics promise high output power from low temperature thermal sources, but demonstrating large area devices has proven challenging. Here a novel epitaxial co&#8208;designed emitter&#8208;cell device fabricated with scalable processes demonstrates 1.2 mW from a 460&#160;&#176;C heat source, a greater than 20&#8208;fold enhancement over the far&#8208;field. Modeling of various cell changes offers a pathway to even higher power.








Abstract
Thermophotovoltaics, devices that convert thermal infrared photons to electricity, offer a key pathway for a variety of critical renewable energy technologies including thermal energy storage, waste heat recovery, and direct solar&#8208;thermal power generation. However, conventional far&#8208;field devices struggle to generate reasonable powers at lower temperatures. Near&#8208;field thermophotovoltaics provide a pathway to substantially higher powers by leveraging photon tunneling effects. Here a large area near&#8208;field thermophotovoltaic device is presented, created with an epitaxial co&#8208;fabrication approach, that consists of a self&#8208;supported 0.28 cm2 emitter&#8208;cell pair with a 150&#160;nm gap. The device generates 1.22&#160;mW at 460&#160;&#176;C, a 25&#8208;fold increase over the same cell measured in a far&#8208;field configuration. Furthermore, the near&#8208;field device demonstrates short circuit current densities greater than the far&#8208;field photocurrent limit at all the temperatures tested, confirming the role of photon tunneling effects in the performance enhancement. Modeling suggests several practical directions for cell improvements and further increases in power density. These results highlight the promise of near&#8208;field thermophotovoltaics, especially for low temperature applications.

         <title>High Defect Tolerance Breaking the Design Limitation of Full&#8208;Spectrum Multimodal Luminescence Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A grossite&#8208;type fast ionic conductor CaGa4O7, with a high defect tolerance structure, is used to develop single&#8208;component multimodal luminescence materials. Almost all luminescent modes and full&#8208;spectrum emissions are realized by doping this single host. A series of dynamic anti&#8208;counterfeiting devices and digital information encryption technology with temporal and spatial resolution are proposed to show the visualized optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting application.








Abstract
With the development of optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting and the increasing demand for high&#8208;level information encryption, multimodal luminescence (MML) materials attract much attention. However, the discovery of these multifunctional materials is very accidental, and the versatile host suitable for developing such materials remains unclear. Here, a grossite&#8208;type fast ionic conductor CaGa4O7, characterized by layered and tunnel structure with excellent defect tolerance, is found to meet the needs of various luminescent processes. Almost all luminescent modes, including down/up&#8208;conversion luminescence (DCL/UCL), long persistent luminescence (LPL), mechanoluminescence (ML), and X&#8208;ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL), are realized in this single host. Full&#8208;spectrum (from violet to near&#8208;infrared) photoluminescence and ML as well as multicolor XEOL are achieved by simply changing the doped luminescent center. A series of anti&#8208;counterfeiting devices, including the quasi&#8208;dynamic display of famous paintings, digital information encryption, and multi&#8208;color handwritten signatures, are designed to show the encryption of information in temporal and spatial dimensions. This study clarifies the importance of defect tolerance of the host for the development of MML materials, and provides a unique insight into the cross&#8208;field applications of special functional materials, which is a new strategy to accelerate the development of novel MML materials.

Almost all luminescent modes and full-spectrum emissions are realized by doping this single host. A series of dynamic anti-counterfeiting devices and digital information encryption technology with temporal and spatial resolution are proposed to show the visualized optical anti-counterfeiting application.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the development of optical anti-counterfeiting and the increasing demand for high-level information encryption, multimodal luminescence (MML) materials attract much attention. However, the discovery of these multifunctional materials is very accidental, and the versatile host suitable for developing such materials remains unclear. Here, a grossite-type fast ionic conductor CaGa&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, characterized by layered and tunnel structure with excellent defect tolerance, is found to meet the needs of various luminescent processes. Almost all luminescent modes, including down/up-conversion luminescence (DCL/UCL), long persistent luminescence (LPL), mechanoluminescence (ML), and X-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL), are realized in this single host. Full-spectrum (from violet to near-infrared) photoluminescence and ML as well as multicolor XEOL are achieved by simply changing the doped luminescent center. A series of anti-counterfeiting devices, including the quasi-dynamic display of famous paintings, digital information encryption, and multi-color handwritten signatures, are designed to show the encryption of information in temporal and spatial dimensions. This study clarifies the importance of defect tolerance of the host for the development of MML materials, and provides a unique insight into the cross-field applications of special functional materials, which is a new strategy to accelerate the development of novel MML materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium Metal Batteries Achieved by Synergistically Enhanced Screening Li+ Desolvation Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the basis of pore sieving effect toward Li+ desolvation, the intentionally&#8208;introduced polar electron&#8208;donated chemical groups on metal&#8211;organic frameworks is developed to further boost Li+ desolvation and Li0 diffusion kinetics under low temperature, achieving uniform lithium distribution without dendrite formation. As a result, the high capacity&#8208;retention ratio of 97% is stabilized under negative/positive ratio of 3.3 and lower temperature surroundings.








Abstract
Lithium metal anode is desired by high capacity and low potential toward higher energy density than commercial graphite anode. However, the low&#8208;temperature Li metal batteries suffer from dendrite formation and dead Li resulting from uneven Li behaviors of flux with huge desolvation/diffusion barriers, thus leading to short&#160;lifespan and safety concern. Herein, differing from electrolyte engineering, a strategy of delocalizing electrons with generating rich active sites to regulate Li+ desolvation/diffusion behaviors are demonstrated via decorating polar chemical groups on porous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). As comprehensively indicated by theoretical simulations, electrochemical analysis, in situ spectroscopies, electron microscope, and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry, the sieving kinetics of desolvation is not merely relied on pore size morphology but also significantly affected by the &#9472;NH2 polar chemical groups,&#160;reducing energy barriers for realizing non&#8208;dendritic and smooth Li metal plating. Consequently, the optimal cells stabilize for&#160;long lifespan of 2000 h and higher average Coulombic efficiency, much better than the&#8208;state&#8208;of&#8208;art reports. Under a lower negative/positive ratio of 3.3, the full cells with NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 deliver a high capacity&#8208;retention of 97.0% at 0.33 C even under &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, showing the great potential of this kind of polar groups on boosting Li+ desolvation kinetics at room&#8208; and low&#8208;temperatures.

         <title>Ru&#8208;OV Site&#8208;Mediated Product Selectivity Switch for Overall Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving high selectivity in overall CO2 photoreduction is crucial for advancing carbon neutrality and sustainable energy development. This study innovatively establishes dual&#8208;functional active sites comprised of adjacent Ru single atoms and oxygen vacancies, stabilizing pivotal intermediates while enhancing local mass transport, thereby achieving the selective overall CO2 photoreduction to CH4.








Abstract
The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) represents a sustainable route for directly converting greenhouse gases into chemicals but poses a significant challenge in achieving high selectivity due to thermodynamic and kinetic limitations during the reaction process. This work establishes Ru&#8208;OV active sites on the surface of TiO2 by anchoring coordination unsaturated Ru single&#8208;atoms, which stabilize crucial reaction intermediates and facilitate local mass transfer to achieve dual optimization of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the overall photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Combining operando spectroscopy with density functional theory (DFT)&#160;calculations indicates that oxygen vacancies (OV) inhibits the desorption of *CO, whereas Ru facilitates proton extraction. This configuration not only lowers the overall activation energy barrier but has also been engineered to serve as a selectivity switch, changing the reaction route to produce CH4 instead of CO. Consequently, the Ru&#8208;OV/TiO2 exhibits a 195.4&#8208;fold improvement in the CH4 yield compared to TiO2, accompanied by an increase in selectivity to 81%.

         <title>Mechanism of Hot&#8208;Carrier Photoluminescence in Sn&#8208;Based Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic illustrating the two dominant processes in tin&#8208;iodide perovskites at the band edge: 1) Filling of carriers at the band edge extrema as they cool. 2) Cooling of carriers emitting a longitudinal optical (LO) phonon. The inset shows the dephasing of a longitudinal optical phonon studied by impulsive vibrational spectroscopy in this work.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have shown exceptionally slow hot&#8208;carrier cooling, which has been attributed to various physical mechanisms without reaching a consensus. Here, experiment and theory are combined to unveil the carrier cooling process in formamidinium (FA) and caesium (Cs) tin triiodide thin films. Through impulsive vibrational spectroscopy and molecular dynamics, much shorter phonon dephasing times of the hybrid perovskite, which accounts for the larger blueshift in the photoluminescence seen at high excitation density for FASnI3 compared to CsSnI3 is reported. Density functional theory investigations reveal that the largest contribution to the blueshift is accounted by a giant, dynamic band&#8208;filling effect in Sn&#8208;based perovskites, which in turn can explain the cooling disparity with the Pb&#8208;based counterparts. Several years after the first experimental observations, here a deeper understanding of the cooling mechanism of these materials is provided. Design principles for hot&#8208;carrier materials, which may be useful for future implementations of hot&#8208;carrier solar cells are further provided.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Vitrimer Nanocomposites: Photo&#8208;Thermal Repair, Reinforcement, and Conductivity at Low Volume Fractions Through a Percolative Voronoi&#8208;Inspired Microstructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils MXene&#8208;vitrimer nanocomposites with a distinct biphasic Voronoi&#8208;inspired microstructure, where a percolative MXene minor&#8208;phase spans throughout a vitrimer major&#8208;phase. Fabricated via a streamlined three&#8208;step process of precipitation polymerization, MXene aqueous coating, and melt&#8208;pressing, these nanocomposites deliver photo&#8208;thermal repairability, mechanical reinforcement, and conductivity at low loadings, achieving greatly diminished percolation thresholds and multifunctionality for advanced smart materials and sustainable composites.








Abstract
An innovative process to multifunctional vitrimer nanocomposites with a percolative MXene minor phase is reported, marking a significant advancement in creating stimuli&#8208;repairable, reinforced, sustainable, and conductive nanocomposites at diminished loadings. This achievement arises from a Voronoi&#8208;inspired biphasic morphological design via a straight&#8208;forward three&#8208;step process involving ambient&#8208;condition precipitation polymerization of micron&#8208;sized prepolymer powders, aqueous powder&#8208;coating with 2D MXene (Ti3C2Tz), and melt&#8208;pressing of MXene&#8208;coated powders into crosslinked films. Due to the formation of MXene&#8208;rich boundaries between thiourethane vitrimer domains in a pervasive low&#8208;volume fraction conductive network, a low percolation threshold (&#8776;0.19&#160;vol.%) and conductive polymeric nanocomposites (&#8776;350 S&#160;m&#8722;1) are achieved. The embedded MXene skeleton mechanically bolsters the vitrimer at intermediate loadings, enhancing the modulus and toughness by 300% and 50%, respectively, without mechanical detriment compared to the neat vitrimer. The vitrimer's dynamic&#8208;covalent bonds and MXene's photo&#8208;thermal conversion properties enable repair in minutes through short&#8208;term thermal treatments for full macroscopic mechanical restoration or in seconds under 785&#160;nm light for rapid localized surface repair. This versatile fabrication method to nanocoated pre&#8208;vitrimer powders and morphologically complex nanocomposites is compatible with classic composite manufacturing, and when coupled with the material's exceptional properties, holds immense potential for revolutionizing advanced composites and inspiring next&#8208;generation smart materials.

This versatile fabrication method to nanocoated pre-vitrimer powders and morphologically complex nanocomposites is compatible with classic composite manufacturing, and when coupled with the material's exceptional properties, holds immense potential for revolutionizing advanced composites and inspiring next-generation smart materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Nano&#8208;Regulator Unleashes Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunity by Overcoming Dendritic Cell Tolerance and T Cell Exhaustion in Tumor&#8208;Draining Lymph Nodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel nano&#8208;regulator (DNR) engineered to reprogram dendritic cells (DCs) within tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs), significantly enhancing anti&#8208;tumor immunity. The DNR employs a dual TLR activation strategy, simultaneously mitigating immune checkpoint suppression. This targeted approach directly addresses DC tolerance and T cell exhaustion, effectively restoring robust anti&#8208;tumor responses.








Abstract
Lymph nodes are crucial immune foci as the primary target for cancer immunotherapy. However, the anti&#8208;tumor functions of tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) are critically suppressed by tumors. Here, a novel spatiotemporal nano&#8208;regulator is presented, designed to modulate the dendritic cells (DCs) in TDLNs, establishing a supportive niche for immune surveillance. The DC&#8208;mediated nano&#8208;regulator (DNR) is established by the self&#8208;assembly of an imidazoquinoline (IMDQ) prodrug, inhibitory immune checkpoint (ICP) siRNA, and mannan (a TLR4 agonist). This unique design leverages the spatiotemporal activation of TLR4 and TLR7/8, thereby optimizing DC maturation and cytokine production. This further promotes efficient T cell priming. Simultaneously, the ICP&#8208;targeting siRNA mitigates the tolerogenic effects induced by tumor&#8208;derived factors and TLR activation, preventing T cell exhaustion. In essence, DNR facilitates potent remodeling of TDLNs and the tumor microenvironment, activating the anti&#8208;tumor immunity cascade. When combined with vaccines, DNR greatly promotes tumor regression and the establishment of long&#8208;term immunological memory.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Gold Nanoaggregates for NIR LED&#8208;Driven Sustained Mild Photothermal Therapy Achieving Complete Tumor Eradication and Immune Enhancement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustained mild photothermal therapy (smPTT) is presented, utilizing gold nanoparticle aggregates (AuNAs) with an impressive photothermal efficiency of up to 92.8%. This strategy employs low&#8208;power LED irradiation to achieve complete tumor eradication while enhancing safety and immune responses. The findings indicate that this approach has significant potential for improving cancer treatment outcomes and expanding the applicability of photothermal therapy.








Abstract
For millennia, humans have harnessed thermal energy to treat cancer. However, delivering energy to tumor tissues in traditional hyperthermia remains a significant challenge. Nanotechnology has revolutionized this approach, enabling nanomaterials to target tumors precisely and act as internal heat sources. Nanomaterial&#8208;based photothermal therapy employs nano&#8208;photothermal agents to absorb near&#8208;infrared light and convert it into heat, offering non&#8208;invasive, highly controllable, and specific treatment for solid tumors. Nonetheless, achieving complete tumor eradication, preventing recurrence, and ensuring safety continue to be major concerns. To address these issues, sustained mild photothermal therapy (smPTT) is proposed, utilizing gold nanoaggregates (AuNAs) with a high photothermal conversion efficiency (92.8%) in combination with a single irradiation of low&#8208;power (&#8764;0.1 W&#160;cm&#8722;2) sustained LED light. This method achieved complete tumor eradication in animal models, with no recurrence over long&#8208;term (&gt;180 days) monitoring. This strategy provides superior therapeutic effects compared to mild photothermal therapy and higher safety than high&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy. Additionally, it induces a strong immune response and immune memory, crucial for preventing tumor recurrence and metastasis. This novel approach to photothermal therapy may significantly impact clinical applications for shallow tumor treatment and offer new avenues for immunotherapy.

         <title>Suspending Light&#8208;Absorbing Nanoparticles in Silica Aerogel Enables Numerous Superblacks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Numerous superblacks are fabricated via generally suspending individual light&#8208;absorbing nanoparticles in man&#8208;made solid smoke.








Abstract
Current strategies for constructing sparse nanostructures for fabricating superblacks are only suitable for a few light&#8208;absorbing materials, severely limiting their applications. Herein, ultra&#8208;low reflective silica aerogels with ultra&#8208;high light transparency are used as solid smokes to individually or simultaneously suspend at least 100 species of light&#8208;absorbing nanoparticles with a volume fraction as low as 0.005%, for creating &gt; 100 superblacks in practice and one billion superblacks in theory if taken permutation and combination among these 0D, 1D, or 2D nanoparticles into account. Depending on the composition of suspended nanoparticles and the structure of solid smoke, the resulting mechanically robust superblacks with supplementary properties including magnetism, full&#8208;spectrum absorption, high thermal stability, and excellent mechanical strength, are first observed. The wide choice of metallic or semiconductive LNs allows as&#8208;made superblacks to glitter in different catalytic reactions, and the resulting superblacks have been on&#8208;demand modified for endowing the self&#8208;cleaning performance in some contaminable environments. Benefiting from the superblack feature and porous network, these superblack monoliths have shown high&#8208;efficiency solar&#8208;heat conversion in some emerging light harvesting and managing fields. This powerful synthetic strategy for superblacks is expected to inspire researchers to conduct in&#8208;depth investigations on super&#8208;black optics, functional materials, etc.

         <title>Living Porous Ceramics for Bacteria&#8208;Regulated Gas Sensing and Carbon Capture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous ceramics colonized by bacteria can achieve self&#8208;regulated, programmable carbon capture and gas&#8208;sensing functions. The porosity of the ceramic scaffold enables autonomous nutrient transport through capillary forces, enabling microbial growth without external energy. Using wild&#8208;type cyanobacteria and engineered&#160;E. coli, living porous ceramics are created to capture CO2 directly from the air and convert toxic gases into human&#8208;detectable benign scents.








Abstract
Microorganisms hosted in abiotic structures have led to engineered living materials that can grow, sense, and adapt in ways that mimic biological systems. Although porous structures should favor colonization by microorganisms, they have not yet been exploited as abiotic scaffolds for the development of living materials. Here, porous ceramics are reported that are colonized by bacteria to form an engineered living material with self&#8208;regulated and genetically programmable carbon capture and gas&#8208;sensing functionalities. The carbon capture capability is achieved using wild&#8208;type photosynthetic cyanobacteria, whereas the gas&#8208;sensing function is generated utilizing genetically engineered E. coli. Hierarchical porous clay is used as a ceramic scaffold and evaluated in terms of bacterial growth, water uptake, and mechanical properties. Using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art chemical analysis techniques, the ability of the living porous ceramics are demonstrated to capture CO2 directly from the air and to metabolically turn minute amounts of toxic gas into a benign scent detectable by humans.

Further, self&#8208;detoxifying protective fibers are prepared using Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH&#8208;OH as a catalytic component.








Abstract
Developing materials capable of rapidly decontaminating nerve and blister agents directly under ambient conditions are crucial for practical applications. In this work, Mg3Al1&#8208;xZrx&#8208;LDH with different Zr4+ doping contents and corresponding OH&#8722; intercalated materials Mg3Al1&#8208;xZrx&#8208;LDH&#8208;OH are synthesized. First, they are used for the decontamination of nerve agents under ambient conditions, showing that increasing the Zr4+ doping amount accelerates the decontamination rate of diethyl cyanophosphonate (DECP) and soman (GD), with the half&#8208;life of DECP and GD being 3&#8211;5 times shorter with Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH (the highest Zr4+ doping content) compared to Mg3Al1&#8208;LDH. Notably, the intercalation of OH&#8722; in Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH further greatly enhances the catalytic activity for DECP and GD, the reaction half&#8208;life of DECP and GD with Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH&#8208;OH being 18&#160;s and &lt;15&#160;s, respectively, which is the shortest recorded so far. Additionally, under ambient conditions, Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH&#8208;OH exhibits superior detoxification performance for mustard gas (HD) compared to Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH, with 92.8% of HD being removed within 6&#160;h. Mechanistic studies reveal that Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH&#8208;OH efficiently decontaminates nerve and blister agents utilizing the synergistic effect of Lewis acid&#8208;base sites (Zr4+ and laminate OH groups) and interlayer OH&#8722;. To extend the practical applications of the materials, PVA@(PAN/LDH&#8208;OH) self&#8208;detoxifying fiber loaded with Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH&#8208;OH is prepared.

         <title>Enhance Photo&#8208;Stability of Up&#8208;Scalable Organic Solar Cells: Suppressing Radical Generation in Polymer Donors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic solar cells with a wide thickness range fabricated by doctor&#8208;blade with non&#8208;halogenated solvents in air show strong losses in short&#8208;circuit current density under photo&#8208;thermal stress. Suppressing radical generation in polymer donors processed in air by increasing the crystallinity in unit thickness is critical for enhancing photo&#8208;stability of up&#8208;scalable organic solar cells.








Abstract
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single&#8208;junction organic solar cells (OSCs) has been promoted above 20%. Device up&#8208;scaling draws more and more research attentions. Besides the high PCE for devices with up&#8208;scalable fabrication methods and conditions, achieving high stability simultaneously is essential for pushing industrialization of this technology. Here, the stability of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSCs blade&#8208;coated in air with non&#8208;halogenated solvents in a wide thickness range is thoroughly investigated. The losses in short&#8208;circuit current density under photo&#8208;thermal stress strongly depend on processing conditions. Devices with less crystalline phases in unit thickness show faster generation of trap states and hence strongly reduced charge collection efficiency. Through in&#8208;depth photo&#8208;chemical, photo&#8208;physical, and morphological characterizations during ageing, faster generation of radicals in PM6 for active layers with more amorphous structures is identified as the cause for device degradation. Increasing the crystallinity of active layer films for suppressing radical generation in polymer donors is critical to enhance the photo&#8208;thermal stability of devices processed in air with a wide thickness range.

         <title>Multifunctional Microneedle Patches Loaded With Engineered Nitric Oxide&#8208;Releasing Nanocarriers for Targeted and Synergistic Chronic Wound Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes a multifunctional microneedle (MN) patch loaded with engineered nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing nanocarriers that encapsulate an antibacterial agent and are immobilized with Concanavalin A (Con A) and NO molecules for targeted and synergistic treatment of chronic wounds.








Abstract
Chronic wounds impose significant physical and mental burdens on patients. Nano&#8208;based formulations offer a promising strategy for chronic wound healing due to their non&#8208;invasive nature and enhanced biofilms penetration, but they often lack targeting capability or fail to achieve long&#8208;term and synergistic effects. In this work, a multifunctional microneedle (MN) patch loaded with engineered nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing nanocarriers are presented that encapsulate an antibacterial agent and are immobilized with Concanavalin A (Con A) and NO molecules for targeted and synergistic treatment of chronic wounds. With the assistance of MNs, the nanoparticles (NPs) can directly cross bacterial biofilms and be efficiently delivered to wound tissues, where they target harmful bacteria through the specific recognition between Con A and polysaccharides on bacterial surfaces, followed by the release of the encapsulated antimicrobial agent, thereby achieving effective antibacterial effect. Moreover, the NPs generate NO in a sustained manner as they dissociate in the wound tissue, which exerts potent anti&#8208;inflammatory action and benefits tissue regeneration, further promoting chronic wounds closure. Consequently, this work provides a novel MN patch loaded with engineered NPs designed for accelerating chronic wound healing through targeted and synergistic therapy.

         <title>Thiol Carbazole Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers as Tunable Carrier Injecting Interlayers for Organic Transistors and Complementary Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiol&#8208;based carbazole self&#8208;assembled monolayers are synthesized and used to tune the work function of gold electrodes from 4.52 to 5.48 eV, making them suitable for application as hole or electron injecting contacts in organic thin&#8208;film transistors. Using these thiol&#8208;based monolayers, p/n&#8208;channel organic transistors and complementary inverters are demonstrated.








Abstract
The significant contact resistance at the metal&#8208;semiconductor interface is a well&#8208;documented issue for organic thin&#8208;film transistors (OTFTs) that hinders device and circuit performance. Here, this issue is tackled by developing three new thiol carbazole&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) molecules, namely tBu&#8208;2SCz, 2SCz, and Br&#8208;2SCz, and utilizing them as carrier&#8208;selective injection interlayers. The SAMs alter the work function of gold electrodes by more than 1 eV, making them suitable for use in hole and electron&#8208;transporting OTFTs. Scanning tunneling microscopy analysis indicates that 2SCz and Br&#8208;2SCz form highly ordered molecular rows, resulting in work function values of 4.86 and 5.48 eV, respectively. The latter value is higher than gold electrodes modified by the commonly used pentafluorobenzenethiol (&#8776;5.33 eV), making Br&#8208;2SCz promising for hole injection. Conversely, tBu&#8208;2SCz appears disordered with a lower work function of 4.52 eV, making it more suitable for electron injection. These intriguing properties are leveraged to demonstrate hole&#8208; and electron&#8208;transporting OTFTs with improved operating characteristics. All&#8208;organic complementary inverters are finally demonstrated by integrating p&#8208; and n&#8208;channel OTFTs, showcasing the potential of this simple yet powerful contact work function engineering approach. The present study highlights the versatility of thiol carbazole SAMs as carrier injecting interlayers for OTFTs and integrated circuits.

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Multiexciton Dynamics Governs Scintillation From Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum&#8208;confined nano scintillators are gaining interest in radiation detection. Understanding the nanoscale scintillation mechanism and key material parameters is crucial. These open questions are addressed by studying the scintillation of CsPbBr3 quantum dots. Increasing the particle size increases the energy deposition, the (multi&#8208;)exciton population, and the emission yield, resulting in maximized scintillation efficiency and timing. A validated theoretical model for the scintillation yield and kinetics is developed, providing fundamental guidance for the rational design of nanoscale scintillators.








Abstract
The recent emergence of quantum&#8208;confined nanomaterials in the field of radiation detection, in particular lead halide perovskite nanocrystals, offers scalability and performance advantages over conventional materials. This development raises fundamental questions about the mechanism of scintillation itself at the nanoscale and the role of particle size, arguably the most defining parameter of quantum dots. Understanding this is crucial for the design and optimization of future nanotechnology scintillators. In this work, these open questions are addressed by theoretically and experimentally studying the size&#8208;dependent scintillation of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals using a combination of Monte Carlo simulations, spectroscopic, and radiometric techniques. The results show that the simultaneous effects of size&#8208;dependent energy deposition, (multi&#8208;)exciton population, and light emission under ionizing excitation, typical of confined particles, combine to maximize the scintillation efficiency and time performance of larger nanocrystals due to greater stopping power and reduced Auger decay. The agreement between theory and experiment produces a fully validated descriptive model that predicts the scintillation yield and kinetics of nanocrystals without free parameters, providing fundamental guidance for the rational design of nanoscale scintillators.

         <title>A Mitochondrion&#8208;Targeting Piezoelectric Nanosystem for the Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction via Autophagy Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the study proposes a mitochondrion&#8208;targeted piezoelectric nanosystem that can promote mitophagy and ameliorate hyperglycemia in diabetic mice through ultrasound&#8208;assisted electric current generation and long&#8208;acting glucagon&#8208;like peptide&#8208;1 receptor agonists (GLP&#8208;1RAs) release, respectively. The findings reveal that this nanosystem can be employed for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.








Abstract
Mitochondrial damage caused by external stimuli, such as high glucose levels and inflammation, results in excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Existing antioxidants can only scavenge ROS and cannot address the root cause of ROS production, namely, abnormal mitochondria. To overcome this limitation, the study develops a piezoelectric synergistic drug&#8208;loaded nanosystem (BaTCG nanosystem) that targets mitochondria. The BaTCG nanosystem is delivered to mitochondria via triphenylphosphine modification, and generates current under the stimulation of ultrasound, thereby promoting mitochondrial autophagy and restoring mitochondrial&#160; homeostasis. In a model of diabetes&#8208;related erectile dysfunction (ED), the BaTCG nanosystem, through the current induced by the piezoelectric effect, not only promoted mitophagy, thereby reducing ROS production, but also released long&#8208;acting glucagon&#8208;like peptide&#8208;1 receptor agonists (GLP&#8208;1RAs) to effectively reduce blood glucose levels and mitochondrial damage. Each component of this nanosystem functions individually as well as synergistically, thus facilitating corpus cavernosum repair and restoring erectile function. In conclusion, the findings offer a novel therapeutic strategy for diabetes&#8208;related ED and a target for the treatment of diabetes&#8208;related conditions with functionalized nanoparticles to regulate mitophagy.

         <title>Functionalized Nanozyme Microcapsules Targeting Deafness Prevention via Mitochondrial Homeostasis Remodeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalized nanozyme microcapsules are established to protect cisplatin&#8208;induced hearing loss via mitochondrial homeostasis remodeling. The synergy between the manganese porphyrin and polymer dots results in excellent antioxidant properties. The developed microcapsules reprogram the energy supply mechanism and inhibit the oligomerization of BAX in mitochondria to prevent the leakage of mitochondrial DNA and cytochrome c.








Abstract
Mitochondrial dysfunction, which is the primary mechanism underlying cisplatin&#8208;induced hearing loss, can potentially be mitigated by modulating the redox balance and reprogramming the energy metabolism to remodel mitochondrial homeostasis. Herein, N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine&#8211;derived carbonized polymer dots (NAC CPDs) are embedded into manganese porphyrin&#8211;doped metal&#8211;organic frameworks and encapsulated using a polydopamine (PDA) coating and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel to afford functionalized nanozyme microcapsules. Owing to their injectability and adhesion properties, these microcapsules exhibit the advantages of prolonged retention in the middle ear and sustained release in the inner ear. The synergy between the manganese porphyrin and polymer dots results in excellent antioxidant properties. The developed nanozymes activate the PI3K&#8208;AKT pathway, reprogramming the energy supply mechanism, and inhibiting the oligomerization of BAX in mitochondria to prevent the leakage of mitochondrial DNA and cytochrome c. Therapeutic efficacy and related mechanisms are validated in vivo. Thus, this study on mitochondrial homeostasis remodeling by nanozyme microcapsules opens a new chapter in the treatment of hearing loss.

         <title>Xolography for 3D Printing in Microgravity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Xolography can 3D print versatile plastic and hydrogel parts in microgravity and a variety of resins can be processed independent from viscosity and flow properties. Just like on Earth, complex geometries, smooth surfaces and feature resolution down to 20&#160;&#181;m can be achieved during 20&#160;s microgravity phases in a parabolic flight experiment.








Abstract
Xolography is a volumetric 3D printing technique utilizing intersecting light beams within a volume of photopolymer for a spatially controlled photopolymerization. Unlike layer&#8208;based methods, Xolography creates structures continuously within a closed photopolymer vat, eliminating the prevalent need for support structures and allowing full geometrical freedom at high printing speeds. The volumetric working principle does not rely on gravity, making Xolography an outstanding technology for additive manufacturing under microgravity conditions as illustrated in a set of experiments during a parabolic flight campaign. The microgravity environment obviates the need for rheology control of resins, enabling the use of low&#8208;viscosity formulations (e.g., 11&#160;mPa&#160;s) while maintaining the fast and precise 3D printing of acrylic polymer resins and hydrogels. Xolography's speed and reliability facilitate rapid iterations of a print task between Earth's gravity and microgravity conditions. This capability positions Xolography as an ideal tool for material research and manufacturing in space, offering significant cost and efficiency advantages over traditional methods.

         <title>Self&#8208;Selective (220) Directional Grown Copper Current Collector Design for Cycling&#8208;Stable Anode&#8208;Less Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;selective, preferentially Li salt&#8208;adsorbing and inorganic interphase&#8208;catalyzing copper current collector (CuCC) design is developed by incorporating Li salt into CuCC fabrication process to self&#8208;select out its salt&#8208;philic facet growth. This self&#8208;selected Cu(220) facet&#8208;dominant CuCC exhibits high selectivity and catalyzation ability for Li salt adsorption, decomposition, and inorganic interphase formation over other facets, reducing the electrode degradation speed by 33&#8211;42%.









Abstract
Anode&#8208;less lithium metal batteries (ALLMB) are promising candidates for energy storage applications owing to high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and safety characteristics. However, the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on anode copper current collector (CuCC) leads to poor reversibility of uneven lithium deposition/stripping. Though the well&#8208;known knowledge of lithium salt&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich SEI (iSEI) benefiting uniform lithium deposition, how to design a lithium salt&#8208;philic CuCC with undiscovered salt&#8208;philic facet that favors lithium salt adsorption and catalyzing salt decomposition into iSEI, remains unexplored yet. Here, a self&#8208;selective and iSEI&#8208;catalyzing CuCC design is developed by using lithium salt as surface&#8208;controlling agent in CuCC electrodeposition process, self&#8208;selecting out and guiding unidirectional Cu(220) facet growth as the most salt&#8208;philic facets of CuCC. This self&#8208;selected Cu(220) facet promotes the salt adsorption and formation of salt decomposition&#8208;derived iSEI in battery, thus improving the lithium plating/stripping coulombic efficiency from 99.25% to 99.50% (stable within 400 cycles), and the capacity decay rate of ALLMB is also reduced by 42.4% within 100 cycles. Practical mass&#8208;productivity of this self&#8208;selective CuCC for 350 Wh kg&#8722;1 pouch&#8208;cell fabrication is also demonstrated, providing a new self&#8208;selective current collector design strategy for improving selectivity and catalyzation of desired chemical reaction, important for high&#8208;selectivity electrochemical reaction system construction.

&lt;p&gt;A self-selective, preferentially Li salt-adsorbing and inorganic interphase-catalyzing copper current collector (CuCC) design is developed by incorporating Li salt into CuCC fabrication process to self-select out its salt-philic facet growth. This self-selected Cu(220) facet-dominant CuCC exhibits high selectivity and catalyzation ability for Li salt adsorption, decomposition, and inorganic interphase formation over other facets, reducing the electrode degradation speed by 33&#8211;42%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anode-less lithium metal batteries (ALLMB) are promising candidates for energy storage applications owing to high-energy-density and safety characteristics. However, the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on anode copper current collector (CuCC) leads to poor reversibility of uneven lithium deposition/stripping. Though the well-known knowledge of lithium salt-derived inorganic-rich SEI (iSEI) benefiting uniform lithium deposition, how to design a lithium salt-philic CuCC with undiscovered salt-philic facet that favors lithium salt adsorption and catalyzing salt decomposition into iSEI, remains unexplored yet. Here, a self-selective and iSEI-catalyzing CuCC design is developed by using lithium salt as surface-controlling agent in CuCC electrodeposition process, self-selecting out and guiding unidirectional Cu(220) facet growth as the most salt-philic facets of CuCC. This self-selected Cu(220) facet promotes the salt adsorption and formation of salt decomposition-derived iSEI in battery, thus improving the lithium plating/stripping coulombic efficiency from 99.25% to 99.50% (stable within 400 cycles), and the capacity decay rate of ALLMB is also reduced by 42.4% within 100 cycles. Practical mass-productivity of this self-selective CuCC for 350 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; pouch-cell fabrication is also demonstrated, providing a new self-selective current collector design strategy for improving selectivity and catalyzation of desired chemical reaction, important for high-selectivity electrochemical reaction system construction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature Diffusion Enabled Epitaxy of the Ti&#8211;O System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thin&#8208;film epitaxy of the Ti&#8211;O system at ultra&#8208;high temperatures realizes an unconventional growth mode. Above 1000&#160;&#176;C, oxygen diffusion from the substrates governs the growth dynamics and the resulting growth phase diagram appears to be against basic thermodynamics. The growth temperature selectively stabilizes the oxidation state of the Ti&#8211;O system, which demonstrates a novel self&#8208;regulated growth of epitaxial oxides.








Abstract
High temperatures promote kinetic processes that can drive crystal synthesis toward ideal thermodynamic conditions, thereby realizing samples of superior quality. While accessing very high temperatures in thin&#8208;film epitaxy is becoming increasingly accessible through laser&#8208;based heating methods, demonstrations of such utility are still emerging. The study realizes a novel self&#8208;regulated growth mode in the Ti&#8211;O system by relying on thermally activated diffusion of oxygen from an oxide substrate. The controlled diffusion enables oxidation state selectivity of single&#8208;phase films with superior crystallinity to conventional approaches as evidenced by structural and electronic measurements. The diffusion&#8208;enabled epitaxy is potentially of wide use in the growth of transition metal oxides, opening up new opportunities for ultra&#8208;high purity epitaxial platforms based on d&#8208;orbital&#160;systems.

Pt0.8Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2 high&#8208;entropy intermetallic (HEI) nanoparticles (NPs) are supported in nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon farmwork and demonstrated as an efficient catalyst for electrochemical nitrate reduction in ammonia synthesis. The multi&#8208;sites of the HEI NPs synergistic for a tandem reduction mechanism, where the Pt&#8208;Fe/Co/Ni/Cu bridging sites offer optimal adsorption for key NOx while the Pt sites facilitate the generation of *H species.









Abstract
The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3
&#8722;RR) for ammonia (NH3) synthesis represents a significant technological advancement, yet it involves a cascade of elementary reactions alongside various intermediates. Thus, the development of multi&#8208;site catalysts for enhancing NO3
&#8722;RR and understanding the associated reaction mechanisms for NH3 synthesis is vital. Herein, a versatile approach is presented to construct platinum based high&#8208;entropy intermetallic (HEI) library for NH3 synthesis. The HEI nanoparticles (NPs) are uniformly supported on a 2D nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon (N&#8208;mC) framework, featured with adjustable compositions (up to eight elements) and a high degree of atomic order (over 90%). Guided by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations and atomic structural analysis, a quinary Pt0.8Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2 HEI NPs based N&#8208;mC catalyst is designed, which demonstrates a large ammonia Faradaic efffciency (&gt;97%) and a remarkable recyclability (&gt;20 cycles) under both acidic and basic conditions. The combined in situ experimental analysis and further DFT calculation suggests that the well&#8208;defined multi&#8208;sites nature of the HEI NPs cooperate for a tandem reduction mechanism, in which the Pt&#8208;X (X represents the other four transition elements) bridging sites offer optimal adsorption for key nitrogen&#8211;oxygen species while the Pt sites facilitate the generation and adsorption of *H species.

         <title>Polyphenol Mediated Assembly: Tailored Nano&#8208;Dredger Unblocks Axonal Autophagosomes Retrograde Transport Traffic Jam for Accelerated Alzheimer's Waste Clearance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Customized Nano&#8208;dredger based on the complex interaction between polyphenol Lithospermic acid B (LA) and various substances, including siRNA, lipid nanovacuoles (LIP), &#949;&#8208;polylysine (&#949;PLL), achieves efficient brain&#8208;neuron targeting, enhances the operability and patency of axonal autophagosome retrograde transport and autolysosomal fusion&#8208;degradation process, thereby decreasing Alzheimer's disease (AD)&#8208;related neuronal waste burden (aberrant accumulated protein/aging organelle) and achieving neuroprotection.








Abstract
Clear&#8208;cut evidence has linked defective autophagy to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies underscore a unique hurdle in AD neuronal autophagy: impaired retrograde axonal transport of autophagosomes, potent enough to induce autophagic stress and neurodegeneration. Nonetheless, pertinent therapy is unavailable. Here, a novel combinational therapy composed of siROCK2 and lithospermic acid B (LA) is introduced, tailored to dredge blocked axonal autophagy by multi&#8208;mitigating microtubule disruption, ATP depletion, oxidative stress, and autophagy initiation impediments in AD. Leveraging the recent discovery of multi&#8208;interactions between polyphenol LA and siRNA, &#949;&#8208;Poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine, and anionic lipid nanovacuoles, LA and siROCK2 are successfully co&#8208;loaded into a fresh nano&#8208;drug delivery system, LIP@PL&#8208;LA/siRC, via a ratio&#8208;flexible and straightforward fabrication process. Further modification with the TPL peptide onto LIP@PL&#8208;LA/siRC creates a brain&#8208;neuron targeted, biocompatible, and pluripotent nanomedicine, named &#8220;Nano&#8208;dredger&#8221; (T&#8208;LIP@PL&#8208;LA/siRC). Nano&#8208;dredger efficiently accelerates axonal retrograde transport and lysosomal degradation of autophagosomes, thereby facilitating the clearance of neurotoxic proteins, improving neuronal complexity, and alleviating memory defects in 3&#215;Tg&#8208;AD transgenic mice. This study provides a fresh and flexible polyphenol/siRNA co&#8208;delivery paradigm and furnishes conceptual proof that dredging axonal autophagy represents a promising AD therapeutic avenue.

         <title>Reviving Zn Dendrites to Electroactive Zn2+ by Ion Sieve Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional methods, including dendrite suppression and dendrite regulation, fail under demanding performance conditions due to Zn2&#8314; diffusion limitations and concentration gradients. Here, conventional Zn0 dendrite growth suppression strategies are shifted by introducing proactive dendrite&#8208;digesting chemistry via an ion sieve interface. This work provides unique insights into achieving reversible aqueous Zn metal batteries.








Abstract
Zn0 dendrite formation during repeated plating/stripping processes limits the practical use of Zn&#8208;metal anodes in reliable and affordable energy storage. Traditional methods, including dendrite suppression and dendrite regulation, fail under demanding performance conditions due to Zn2+ diffusion limitations and concentration gradients. Here, using an in situ pre&#8208;zincation approach, a Li2ZnxTi3&#8208;xO8 (LZTO, 0&lt;x&lt;3) layer with uniform ion channels is introduced. This layer acts as an ionic sieve, reviving Zn0 dendrite into Zn2+ through redox reactions and enhancing Zn2+ diffusion kinetics. Experiment and simulation results reveal that Zn2+ migrates along the (111) crystal plane of LZTO through the successive replacement of Zn atoms in tetrahedral positions, with a high transference number of 0.796. LZTO@Zn performs better in coin cells at high currents (e.g., 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and operates at higher Zn utilization (300&#160;h at 56.98%&#160;Zn utilization), with four times the lifespan at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C and six times longer in alkaline electrolytes compared to bare Zn. Pouch cells with LZTO@Zn anodes operate in a low N/P ratio (6.9) and lean electrolyte (E/C is 20&#160;&#181;L mA h&#8722;1), achieving enhanced cycling stability. The findings indicate the significance of ion sieves with ordered ion channels in mitigating Zn0 dendrites and promoting rapid Zn2+ transport.

This work provides unique insights into achieving reversible aqueous Zn metal batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zn&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; dendrite formation during repeated plating/stripping processes limits the practical use of Zn-metal anodes in reliable and affordable energy storage. Traditional methods, including dendrite suppression and dendrite regulation, fail under demanding performance conditions due to Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion limitations and concentration gradients. Here, using an in situ pre-zincation approach, a Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; (LZTO, 0&amp;lt;x&amp;lt;3) layer with uniform ion channels is introduced. This layer acts as an ionic sieve, reviving Zn&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; dendrite into Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; through redox reactions and enhancing Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion kinetics. Experiment and simulation results reveal that Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; migrates along the (111) crystal plane of LZTO through the successive replacement of Zn atoms in tetrahedral positions, with a high transference number of 0.796. LZTO@Zn performs better in coin cells at high currents (e.g., 50&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and operates at higher Zn utilization (300&#160;h at 56.98%&#160;Zn utilization), with four times the lifespan at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C and six times longer in alkaline electrolytes compared to bare Zn. Pouch cells with LZTO@Zn anodes operate in a low N/P ratio (6.9) and lean electrolyte (E/C is 20&#160;&#181;L mA h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), achieving enhanced cycling stability. The findings indicate the significance of ion sieves with ordered ion channels in mitigating Zn&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; dendrites and promoting rapid Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inverse Size&#8208;Scaling Ferroelectricity in Centrosymmetric Insulating Perovskite Oxide DyScO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In centrosymmetric DyScO3, nanoscale thickness gradient&#8208;induced nonpolar&#8208;polar transition is observed by atomically&#8208;resolved electron microscopy. Driven by surface charge transfer, the asymmetric Dy&#8208;Dy split and ferrodistortive octahedral order break the inversion symmetry. The inverse size&#8208;scaling ferroelectricity, prevailing in many perovskites with alternatively charged AOn+ and BO2n&#8722; (n &#8800; 0) layers, opens up a new era for novel ferroelectric study at low dimension.








Abstract
The breaking of inversion symmetry dictates the emergence of electric polarization, whose topological states in superlattices and bulks have received tremendous attention for their intriguing physics brought for novel device design. However, as for substrate oxides such as LaAlO3, KTaO3, RScO3 (R = rare earth element), their centrosymmetric trivial attributes make their functionality poorly explored. Here, the discovery of nanoscale thickness gradient&#8208;induced nonpolar&#8208;to&#8208;polar phase transition in band insulator DyScO3 is reported by using atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy. As the free&#8208;standing specimen reduces to a critical thickness &#8776;5 nm, its inversion symmetry is spontaneously broken by surface charge transfer, which gives rise to asymmetric Dy atomic displacements and ferrodistortive octahedral order, as substantiated by the first&#8208;principles calculations. Apart from the observation of migratable polar vortex structures, the switchable electric polarization by applied electric field is demonstrated by the piezoresponse force microscopy experiments. Given the decisive role of critical size in generating ferroelectricity, a concept of &#8220;inverse size&#8208;scaling ferroelectric&#8221; is proposed to define a class of such materials. Distinct from the proper and improper ferroelectrics, the findings offer a new platform to explore novel low&#8208;dimensional ferroelectrics and device applications in the future.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Antifouling Liquid&#8208;Like Surfaces for Sustainable Viscous Water&#8208;in&#8208;Oil Emulsions Separation and Oil Recovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel slippery surface is introduced for the enduring separation of viscous water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions through the meticulous construction of a robust, chemically cross&#8208;linked network embedding soft nanomicelles, complemented by the integration of the corrosion&#8208;resistant polystyrene. Ultimately, the coating exhibits outstanding anti&#8208;oil&#8208;adhesion properties (even viscous crude oil), and chemical and mechanical stability, preventing membrane fouling and enabling efficient sustainable high&#8208;viscosity emulsion separation.









Abstract
The demand for efficient separation techniques in industries dealing with high viscosity emulsions has surged due to their widespread applications in various scenarios, including emulsion&#8208;based drug delivery systems, the removal of emulsified impurities in formulations and oil spill remediation. However, membrane fouling is a major challenge for conventional separation methods, leading to decreased efficiency and increased maintenance costs. Herein, a novel approach is reported by constructing liquid&#8208;like surfaces with double anti&#8208;fouling structure, incorporating soft nanomicelles within a rigid, chemically cross&#8208;linked network for both anti&#8208;membrane&#8208;fouling and effective viscous water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsion separation. The coating significantly outperforms perfluorinated and commercial polytetrafluoroethylene (PVDF) membranes, effectively preventing the adhesion of viscous oils like crude oil and pump oil, and alleviating severe membrane fouling. For high&#8208;viscosity emulsions (97.3 cP and 52.8 cP), it maintains over 99% separation efficiency after 3&#160;h continuous use. Even after 15&#160;h immersion in strong acids, alkalis, salts, or organic solvents, its separation efficiency remains above 95%. In addition, thanks to the anti&#8208;membrane&#8208;fouling ability, this work achieved 6&#160;h continuous emulsion separation performance for the first time, demonstrating unparalleled long&#8208;term stability. Overall, this study offers valuable insights into the development of innovative coatings for efficient and eco&#8208;friendly separation of high&#8208;viscosity emulsions.

         <title>Sign&#8208;Switchable Poisson's Ratio Design for Bimodal Strain&#8208;to&#8208;Electrical Signal Transducing Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective and universal strategy for constructing hybrid materials with sign&#8208;switchable Poisson's ratio is developed, enabling the material to switch between negative and positive Poisson's ratios. Upon integrating a pre&#8208;stretched silver nanowires film onto its surface, the device can switch its strain&#8208;resistance response between strain&#8208;insensitive and strain&#8208;dependent states due to the varying deformation characteristics.








Abstract
Stretchable electronic devices that conduct strain&#8208;related electronic performances have drawn extensive attention, functioning as mechanical sensors, actuators, and stretchable conductors. Although strain&#8208;insensitive or strain&#8208;responsive nature is well&#8208;achieved separately, it remains challenging to combine these two characteristics in one single device, which will offer versatile adaptability in various working situations. Herein, a hybrid material with sign&#8208;switchable Poisson's ratio (SSPR) is developed by combining a phase&#8208;change gel based reentrantreentrant honeycomb pattern and a polydimethylsiloxane film. The phase&#8208;change gel featuring thermally&#8208;regulated Young's modulus enables the hybrid material to switch between negative and positive Poisson's ratios. After integrating with a pre&#8208;stretched silver nanowires film, the obtained stretchable device performs bimodal strain&#8208;to&#8208;electrical signal transducing (Bi&#8208;SET) functions, in which the SSPR&#8208;dominated strain&#8208;resistance response switches between strain&#8208;dependent and strain&#8208;insensitive behaviors. As a proof of concept, a mode&#8208;switchable grasping system is constructed using a Bi&#8208;SET device&#8208;based controller, enabling the adaptation of grasping behaviors to various target objects.

         <title>Optically Pumped and Electrically Switchable Microlaser Array Based on Elliptic Deformation and Q&#8208;Attenuation of Organic Droplet Oscillators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically pumped and electrically Q&#8208;switchable minute laser oscillators are invented. The oscillator is made from a robust self&#8208;standing organic droplet that deforms into a prolate spheroid under an electric field. The deformation induces the attenuation of the quality factor, leading to a halt of the laser emission. An array of droplet lasers is also demonstrated as a prototype laser display.








Abstract
Conventional laser panel displays are developed through the mass integration of electrically pumped lasers or through the incorporation of a beam steering system with an array of optically pumped lasers. Here a novel configuration of a laser panel display consisting of a non&#8208;steered pumping beam and an array of electrically Q&#8208;switchable lasers is reported. The laser oscillator consists of a robust, self&#8208;standing, and deformable minute droplet that emits laser through Whispering&#8208;Gallery Mode resonance when optically pumped. The laser oscillation is electrically switchable during optical pumping by applying a vertical electric field to the droplet. Electromagnetic and fluid dynamics simulations reveal the deformation of the droplet into a prolate spheroid under the electric field and associated attenuation of quality factor (Q&#8208;factor), leading to the halt of the laser oscillation. A 2 &#215; 3 array of droplets is fabricated by inkjet printing as a prototype of a laser panel display, and it successfully achieves the pixel&#8208;selective switching of the oscillation.

A 2 &#215; 3 array of droplets is fabricated by inkjet printing as a prototype of a laser panel display, and it successfully achieves the pixel-selective switching of the oscillation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A New Generation of Multimilliwatt&#8208;Class Colloidal Quantum&#8208;Dot Lasers at Full Colors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The full&#8208;color QD lasers relevant for practical implementations are achieved. These QD lasers feature the simultaneous metrics of low threshold, long operating duration, and multimilliwatt output power under quasi&#8208;steady&#8208;state pumping. To the best of the available knowledge, the multimilliwatt output power has never been realized in QD lasers before. These results open the door to practical QD lasers.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are attractive gain materials owing to the wide range of accessible colors. However, the existing QD lasers struggle to combine technologically relevant metrics of low threshold and long operating duration with considerable output powers. Here a new class of full&#8208;color QD lasers are reported, featuring low threshold, uninterrupted operation for dozens of hours, and multimilliwatt output under quasi&#8208;steady&#8208;state pumping, by coupling the high&#8208;gain QDs with a double&#8208;clad pumping scheme. Corroborated by the comprehensive transient spectroscopy and numerical simulation, it is demonstrated that the ternary QDs with specially designed fine nanostructure enable the low gain threshold, giant gain coefficient, long gain lifetime, and excellent resistance against intense photoexcitation. Meanwhile, the double&#8208;clad QD&#8208;fiber design allows for record&#8208;long light&#8208;gain interaction, high conversion efficiency, and sustained device operation. As such, the QD lasers with multimilliwatt output powers, unobserved in QD lasers to date, have been realized. Further, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application for generating vortex beams with various topological charges is demonstrated. This work represents significant progress toward practical lasers based on QDs.

         <title>Efficient Gate&#8208;Tunable Hot&#8208;Carrier Photocurrent from Perovskite Multiple Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hot carrier devices with low&#8208;dimensional semiconductor heterostructures are promising for enhancing photon&#8208;to&#8208;current conversion beyond the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit. This study presents a 2D Van der Waals heterostructure device made of 2D perovskite quantum wells and few&#8208;layer MoS&#8322;. The device shows efficient gate&#8208;tunable hot&#8208;hole photocurrent and high external quantum efficiency.








Abstract
Hot&#8208;carrier relaxation above the bandgap results in significant energy losses, making the extraction of hot carriers a critical challenge for efficient hot&#8208;carrier photocurrent generation in devices. In this study, we observe long&#8208;lived hot carriers in the metal&#8208;halide perovskite multiple quantum wells, (BA)2(MA)n&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (n = 3), and demonstrate effective hot&#8208;hole photocurrent generation using 2D&#160;MoS&#8322; as an extraction layer. A high external quantum efficiency of short&#8208;circuit hot&#8208;carrier photocurrent of up to 35.4% is achieved. Further enhancement in photocurrent efficiency and open&#8208;circuit photovoltage is achieved when a gate electric field is applied, resulting in an external quantum efficiency of up to 61.9%. Evidence of hot&#8208;hole extraction is validated through operando transient reflection measurements on the working devices, with studies that depend on wavelength, carrier density, and gate voltage. DFT calculations on the heterostructure devices under different bias voltages further elucidate the mechanism of hot&#8208;hole extraction enhancement. These findings underscore the potential of perovskite multiple quantum wells as long&#8208;lived hot&#8208;carrier generators and highlight the role of 2D transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors as efficient hot&#8208;carrier extraction electrodes for low&#8208;power optoelectronics.

         <title>In&#8208;Plane Adaptive Heteroepitaxy of 2D Cesium Bismuth Halides with Engineered Bandgaps on c&#8208;Sapphire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D Cs2Bi3X9 (X = Br, Cl, I) perovskite crystals with variable lattice constants and engineered bandgaps are synthesized via adaptive heteroepitaxy on c&#8208;sapphire substrates. Photodetectors based on these epitaxial crystals exhibit significantly improved photodetection performance, indicating the effectiveness of epitaxial growth strategy for high&#8208;quality crystals. This work advances the integration of multicomponent 2D materials on dielectric substrates for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
The heteroepitaxy of 2D materials with engineered bandgaps are crucial to broaden the spectral response for their integrated optoelectronic devices. However, it is a challenge to achieve the high&#8208;oriented epitaxy and integration of multicomponent 2D materials with varying lattice constants on the same substrate due to the limitation of lattice matching. Here, in&#8208;plane adaptive heteroepitaxy of a series of high&#8208;oriented 2D cesium bismuth halide (Cs3Bi2X9, X = I, Br, Cl) single crystals with varying lattice constants from 8.41 to 7.71 &#197; is achieved on c&#8208;plane sapphire with distinct lattice constant of 4.76 &#197; at a low temperature of 160&#160;&#176;C in an air ambient, benefiting from tolerable interfacial strain by switching compressive stress to tensile stress during a 30&#176; rotation of crystal orientation. First&#8208;principles calculation demonstrates that those are all thermodynamically stable phases, deriving from multiple minima of interfacial energy between single crystals and sapphire substrate. The detectivity of Cs3Bi2I9 photodetector reaches up to 3.7 &#215; 1012 Jones, deriving from high single&#8208;crystal quality. This work provides a promising experimental strategy and basic theory to boost the heteroepitaxy and integration of 2D single crystals with varying lattice constants on low&#8208;cost dielectric substrate, paving the way for their applications in integrated optoelectronics.

         <title>Manipulation of Unconventional Spin Polarization in Non&#8208;Collinear Exchange&#8208;Spring Magnetic Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel exchange&#8208;spring magnetic structure is formed by the coupling of perpendicular CoTb and in&#8208;plane Co films. When a spin current with the y&#8208;polarization flows through this exchange&#8208;spring (x&#8208;z plane) structure, the interaction between the y&#8208;spin and the local exchange field gives rise to unconventional x&#8208; and z&#8208; spin polarizations, enabling field&#8208;free spin&#8208;orbit torque driven perpendicular magnetization switching.








Abstract
Manipulating the polarization of spin current is essential for understanding the mechanism of charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion and achieving efficient electrically driven magnetization switching. Here, a novel exchange&#8208;spring magnetic structure is introduced formed by the coupling of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) CoTb and in&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) Co films. When a spin current with the polarization along the y&#8208;direction flows through this exchange&#8208;spring (x&#8208;z plane) structure, the interaction between the y&#8208;spin and the local exchange field with a non&#8208;collinear spatial distribution gives rise to substantial unconventional spin polarizations in the x&#8208; and z&#8208;directions, enabling field&#8208;free spin&#8208;orbit torque driven perpendicular magnetization switching at room temperature. More importantly, the polarization directions of this unconventional spin current can be reversed depending on whether the interfacial exchange coupling is ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic. This work establishes a platform to explore emergent mechanisms for manipulating unconventional spin polarization with rich non&#8208;collinear magnetic exchange spin structures.

         <title>Efficient Targeted Regulation of the Interfaces and Bulk in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells With a [closo&#8208;B12H12]2&#8722;&#8208;based Derivative</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;treatment involving the incorporation of a novel solution&#8208;processable [closo&#8208;B12H12]2&#8208; derivative, (TBA)2[B12H11(OCH2CH2)2OH] (TBA2B), is proposed to simultaneously optimize the interfaces and bulk of inverted perovskite solar cells. TBA2B enhances the power conversion efficiency to 25.59% while improving the stability, thereby providing valuable insights for the design of efficient [closo&#8208;B12H12]2&#8208;&#8208;based interface materials and modification mechanisms.








Abstract
The performance and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is adversely affected by the recombination loss, ion migration, and residual stress arising from issues within the bulk and at the cathode interface. Using simple post&#8208;treatment with a novel solution&#8208;processable derivative of the dodecahydro&#8208;closo&#8208;dodecaborate anion ([closo&#8208;B12H12]2&#8722;)&#8212;(TBA)2[B12H11(OCH2CH2)2OH] (TBA2B)&#8212;it is simultaneously address these issues. In inverted PSCs, the cationic and anionic components of TBA2B uniquely self&#8208;separate by positioning themselves precisely to perform their specific modification functions. The majority of [B12H11(OCH2CH2)2OH]2&#8208; anions reside at the (6,6)&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/Ag interface, which enhances the electrical and physical contact. Additionally, a substantial fraction of tetrabutylammonium&#160;cations diffuse into the perovskite/PCBM heterojunction, enabling comprehensive control over the trap passivation, stress release, ion migration elimination, and grain boundary reinforcement through the in situ formation of 1D TBAPbI3 on the surface of the perovskite crystals. The TBA2B devices exhibit high power conversion efficiency of 25.59% and open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.199&#160;V, performance that is among the highest achieved with a solution&#8208;processed perovskite/PCBM heterojunction. Furthermore, TBA2B significantly enhances the device's stability. This study provides crucial insights into the design of efficient and solution processable [closo&#8208;B12H12]2&#8722;&#8208;based interface materials, and offers a comprehensive understanding of the underlying modification mechanisms.

         <title>Interfacial Metal&#8208;Solvent Chelation for Direct Regeneration of LiFePO4 Cathode Black Mass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address interfacial challenges in spent LiFePO4&#160;(LFP) black mass, such as structural deterioration and residual impurities, a metal&#8208;solvent chelation strategy leveraging the strong chelation of the Acac&#8722; anion is presented. This approach enables effective spent LFP regeneration by surface reconstruction of the degraded LFP with reducing lithium diffusion barriers and enhancing lithium supplementation.








Abstract
Direct regeneration of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries presents a promising approach to effectively reuse valuable resources and benefit the environment. Unlike controlled laboratory conditions that commonly facilitate impurity purification and minimize structural damage, the LiFePO4 cathode black mass faces significant interfacial challenges, including structure deterioration, cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase residues, and damage from storage procedures, which hinder lithium replenishment and structure regeneration. Here, a metal&#8208;solvent chelation reaction using a lithium acetylacetonate solution is introduced to address these challenges under ambient conditions. This method regulates the near&#8208;surface structure through strong chelation between Acac&#8210; anions and Fe (III) elements, thus effectively eliminating the degraded amorphous phase and residual fluorine compounds. By direct lithium connection and reducing diffusion barriers, the reconstructed surface facilitates the re&#8208;lithiation process. The regenerated LiFePO4 cathodes demonstrate a capacity retention of 88.5% after 400 cycles at 1 C, while also outperforming traditional recycling methods in terms of environmental and economic benefits. This approach provides a promising solution for regenerating degraded LiFePO4 cathodes from actual dismantled black mass, thereby accelerating the practical application of battery recycling.

         <title>Polymorphing Hydrogels Regulated by Photo&#8208;reactive DNA Cross&#8208;links</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;reactive DNA&#8208;cross&#8208;linked hydrogels are presented that enable polymorphing under patterned light. The photo&#8208;reactive DNA crosslinks act as a regulator in morphing of the hydrogels, adjusting the lengths of the cross&#8208;links depending on the wavelength of light. Spatiotemporal controllability and reprogrammable features of the polymorphing hydrogels within a one&#8208;pot system offer advanced solutions for applications in soft robotics and 4D printing.








Abstract
Polymorphing hydrogels can morph into another structure on demand with reprogrammable features. This concept extends the degree of morphing beyond that of traditional shape&#8208;morphing hydrogels, which predetermine their morphing capabilities at the fabrication stage. However, current polymorphing hydrogels face limitations due to the need for complex, non&#8208;sustained responsiveness or additional chemical steps for reconfigurable morphing. Here, photo&#8208;reactive DNA&#8208;cross&#8208;linked polymorphing hydrogels are presented that enable polymorphing under patterned light. The photo&#8208;reactive DNA cross&#8208;links act as a regulator in changing the shapes of the hydrogels by adjusting the lengths of the cross&#8208;links depending on the wavelength of light, which allows precise and dynamic morphing in a programmable way through a one&#8208;pot reaction. The high programmability involving spatiotemporal controllability and reprogrammable features offers advanced solutions for multifunctional soft machines and applications requiring complex processes.

An all&#8208;inorganic perovskite/perovskite tandem self&#8208;powered photodetector (PDs) is reported, incorporated with Bi2TeO6 layer to facilitate enhanced dual pyro&#8208;phototronic effect, to realize an innovated encryption imaging sensing system with a programmable logic gate. The encryption imaging sensing system employing PDs array achieves simultaneous outputs of triple image information, and their programmable optoelectronic logic gate is capable of executing six distinct logical functions.








Abstract
As the focus on information security continues to intensify, encrypted imaging sensing technology becomes increasingly indispensable. However, the widespread application of encrypted imaging sensing technology is hindered by high manufacturing costs and complex system construction. Herein, an all&#8208;inorganic perovskite/perovskite tandem self&#8208;powered photodetector (PDs) is reported, incorporated with Bi2TeO6 layer to enahnce dual pyro&#8208;phototronic effect, to realize an innovated encryption imaging sensing system with programmable logic gate. The PDs reach responsivity of 1.46 A W&#8722;1 and detectivity of 3.44 &#215; 1013 Jones, the corresponding EQE reaches 342%, which is &#8776;75.48 times greater than that without pyro&#8208;phototronic effect. The outstanding performance resulting from dual pyro&#8208;phototronic effect in Cs2PbI2Cl2 perovskite and Bi2TeO6/CsSn0.5Pb0.5IBr2 interface, and optimizing band arrangement from the oxidized Bi2TeO6 layer. The photovoltaic and pyro&#8208;phototronic signal of PDs can still be clearly distinguished under 8 kHz pulsed laser. More importantly, the encryption imaging sensing system achieves simultaneous outputs of triple image information, and their programmable optoelectronic logic gate can execute&#160;six distinct logical functions, including &#8220;OR&#8221;, &#8220;AND&#8221;, &#8220;XOR&#8221;, &#8220;NAND&#8221;, &#8220;NOR&#8221; and &#8220;XNOR&#8221;. This research not only provides a feasible strategy for realizing the outstanding pyro&#8208;phototronic effect of all&#8208;inorganic perovskite materials, but also presents novel insights for designing&#160;encrypted imaging sensing technology.

The outstanding performance resulting from dual pyro-phototronic effect in Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite and Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TeO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/CsSn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;IBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface, and optimizing band arrangement from the oxidized Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TeO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; layer. The photovoltaic and pyro-phototronic signal of PDs can still be clearly distinguished under 8 kHz pulsed laser. More importantly, the encryption imaging sensing system achieves simultaneous outputs of triple image information, and their programmable optoelectronic logic gate can execute&#160;six distinct logical functions, including &#8220;OR&#8221;, &#8220;AND&#8221;, &#8220;XOR&#8221;, &#8220;NAND&#8221;, &#8220;NOR&#8221; and &#8220;XNOR&#8221;. This research not only provides a feasible strategy for realizing the outstanding pyro-phototronic effect of all-inorganic perovskite materials, but also presents novel insights for designing&#160;encrypted imaging sensing technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulation in Spin State of Co3O4 Decorated Fe Single Atom Enables a Superior Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co3O4 nanoparticles are invited to anchor on Fe1&#8208;NC. It is found the spin state of Fe and Co is effectively modulated. Thereby, a boosted ORR and OER performance is achieved for Co3O4@Fe1&#8208;NC proved by 163.1&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 in the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZAB test.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the keystone for the industrialization of rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB). In this work, the modulation in the spin state of Fe single atom on nitrogen doped carbon&#160;(Fe1&#8208;NC) is devised by Co3O4 (Co3O4@Fe1&#8208;NC), and a mediate spin state is recorded. Besides, the d band center of Fe is downshifted associated with the increment in eg filling revealing the weakened interaction with OH* moiety, resulting in a boosted ORR performance. The ORR kinetic current density of Co3O4@Fe1&#8208;NC is 2.0&#8208; and 5.6 times higher than Fe1&#8208;NC and commercial Pt/C, respectively. Moreover, high spin state is found for Co in Co3O4@Fe1&#8208;NC contributing to the accelerated surface reconstruction of Co3O4 witnessed by operando Raman and electrochemical impedance spectroscopies. A robust OER activity with overpotential of 352&#160;mV at 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved, decreased by 18 and 60&#160;mV by comparison with Co3O4@NC and IrO2. The operando Raman reveals a balanced adsorption of OH* species and its deprotonation leading to robust stability. The ZAB performance of Co3O4@Fe1&#8208;NC is 193.2&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and maintains for 200&#160;h. Furthermore, the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZAB shows a promising battery performance of 163.1&#160;mW cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Composition&#8208;Graded Nitride Ferroelectrics Based Multi&#8208;Level Non&#8208;Volatile Memory for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composition&#8208;graded ferroelectric ScAlN multi&#8208;level memory is demonstrated, showing a storage capacity up to 7&#8208;bit, and one order of magnitude higher ON/OFF ratio, 30% reduced working voltage, and up to 50% enhanced operating voltage tuning window compared to uniform composition devices. This approach paves the way for advanced integration of wurtzite ferroelectrics in multifunctional computing systems.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;level non&#8208;volatile ferroelectric memories are emerging as promising candidates for data storage and neuromorphic computing applications, due to the enhancement of storage density and the reduction of energy and space consumption. Traditional multi&#8208;level operations are achieved by utilizing intermediary polarization states, which exhibit an unpredictable ferroelectric domain switching nature, leading to unstable multi&#8208;level memory. In this study, a unique approach of composition&#8208;graded ferroelectric ScAlN to achieve tunable operating voltage in a wide range and attain precise control of domain switching and stable multi&#8208;level memory is proposed. This non&#8208;volatile memory supports multi&#8208;level storage up to 7&#8208;bit capacities, and exhibits enhanced performance compared to the uniform composition device, showing one order of magnitude higher ON/OFF ratio, 30% reduced working voltage, and up to 50% enhanced tuning window of operating voltage. Finally, the emulation of long&#8208;term plasticity and linear weight update akin to biological synapse with high uniformity and reliability are demonstrated. The proposed composition&#8208;grading architecture offers new opportunities for next&#8208;generation multi&#8208;level ferroelectric memories, paving the way for advanced hybrid integration in multifunctional computing systems.

         <title>Improved Efficiency and Stability in Pure&#8208;Red CdSe Nanoplatelet LEDs Enabled by Gradient Alloyed CdSeS/CdZnS Crown/Shell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study designes a gradient crown on the side facets of CdSe nanoplatelets to address the issue of high susceptibility to ripening at elevated temperatures. Consequently, a gradient alloyed shell is successfully grown, and the core/crown/shell nanoplatelets exhibited near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield and high stability. Therefore, the prepared nanoplatelets light&#8208;emitting diodes demonstrates a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 30.1%.








Abstract
Anisotropic nanoplatelets (NPLs) possess strong in&#8208;plane transition dipole moments and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane emission, which enable a maximum photon out&#8208;coupling efficiency of 40% and a high gain coefficient, making them ideal candidates for light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers. However, the unbalanced surface energy between the side and top facets of NPLs results in poor thermal stability and high susceptibility to ripening at elevated temperatures, which complicates the growth of the shell. To address this issue, a gradient crown (CdSeS) around the CdSe NPLs is designed to stabilize the high energy side facets. Consequently, the gradient alloyed shell (CdZnS) is successfully grown, and the CdSe/CdSeS/CdZnS core/crown/shell NPLs exhibited near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield. The CdSeS/CdZnS crown/shell structure suppressed non&#8208;radiative Auger recombinations, achieving a record&#8208;low amplification spontaneous emission threshold of 2.11 &#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2 under femtosecond laser excitation. In addition, by selecting the carrier transport layers with matched energy levels, the NPL&#8208;LEDs demonstrate a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 30.1% in the pure&#8208;red range, driven by the 94% in&#8208;plane transition dipole moment distribution of NPL film. The NPL&#8208;LEDs also exhibited a long operational lifetime of T95 &gt; 600 h at a luminance of 1000 cd&#160;m&#8722;2.

A self&#8208;floating plasmonic sponge that harvests full&#8208;solar&#8208;spectrum light for highly efficient water purification.








Abstract
Solving the global challenge of freshwater scarcity is of great significance for over one billion people in the world. Solar water evaporation based on plasmonic nanostructures is one of the most promising technologies due to its high efficiency. However, the efficiency of this plasmonic nanostructure&#8208;based technology can hardly achieve 100%.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solving the global challenge of freshwater scarcity is of great significance for over one billion people in the world. Solar water evaporation based on plasmonic nanostructures is one of the most promising technologies due to its high efficiency. However, the efficiency of this plasmonic nanostructure-based technology can hardly achieve 100%. Therefore, it is highly desired to develop new solar converters utilizing plasmonic local heating and reasonable structure design to break the limit of solar-to-vapor efficiency for freshwater production. Here, a plasmonic sponge is developed as a solar evaporation converter with excellent full-solar-spectrum absorption, good heat localization performance, and fast evaporation kinetics through 3D nanostructures, achieving a 131% solar-to-vapor efficiency. Distinct from the traditional 2D localized heating-based evaporation and nonmetallic 3D water evaporation, the 3D plasmonic sponge can simultaneously achieve highly efficient local heating and super large water&#8211;air interfaces for boosting solar-to-vapor efficiency. The 3D plasmonic sponge can be also used as a universal converter for purifying seawater, metal ion solutions, organic pollutant solutions, and strong acid and strong alkaline solutions.

         <title>Bias&#8208;Switchable Photodetection and Photosynapse Dual&#8208;Functional Devices Based on 2D Perovskite/Organic Heterojunction for Imaging&#8208;to&#8208;Recognition Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optoelectronic devices integrating visual imaging and recognition functions are achieved by employing 2D perovskite oxide/organic heterojunction. Through switching bias to modulate carrier and oxygen vacancy dynamics, the device exhibits photodetection property at zero bias and photosynaptic property at negative bias. This work provides a novel strategy to achieve low&#8208;power consumption, easy&#8208;switchable and functional integrated optoelectronic devices for artificial visual system.








Abstract
Optoelectronic devices with imaging and recognition capabilities are crucial for developing artificial visual system (AVS). Bias&#8208;switchable photodetection and photosynaptic devices have been developed using 2D perovskite oxide/organic heterojunctions. This unique structure allows for modulated carrier dynamics under varied bias conditions, enabling the devices to function as photodetectors without bias and as photosynapses with bias. At zero bias, the device achieves high responsivity (&#8776;0.36 A W&#8722;1 at 320 nm) and rapid response speed (0.57 s). Under a &#8722;0.5 V bias, it exhibits persistent photoconductivity (PPC), resulting in neuromorphic synaptic behaviors with a paired&#8208;pulse facilitation (PPF) index exceeding 300%. Moreover, an 8 &#215; 8 sensor array demonstrates image sensing and memory capabilities, showing in situ enhanced imaging when switching the bias from 0 to &#8722;0.5 V, and over 200 s of image memory. The image processing and recognition abilities are further explored by constructing an AVS using a 28 &#215; 28 device array combined with an artificial neural network (ANN). The adjustable synaptic weight under different reverse biases allowed for optimized simulated recognition, achieving an accuracy of 92% after 160 training epochs. This work presents a novel method for creating dual&#8208;functional photodetection and photosynaptic devices, paving the way for a more integrated and efficient AVS.

         <title>Boron Trioxide&#8208;Assisted Post&#8208;Annealing Enables Vertical Oriented Recrystallization of Sb2Se3 Thin Film for High&#8208;Efficiency Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, B2O3 coating layer is used as a flux for Sb2Se3 recrystallization, inducing a vertical orientation growth of the film while suppressing the defect of Se vacancies. The orientation control and passivation of defects enables efficient transport of carriers, resulting in the highest efficiency in Sb2Se3 solar cells fabricated by thermal evaporation method.








Abstract
Crystallization process is critical for enhancing the crystallinity, regulating the crystal orientation of polycrystalline thin films, as well as repairing defects within the films. For quasi&#8208;1D Sb2Se3 photovoltaic materials, the preparation of Sb2Se3 thin films still faces great challenges in adjusting orientation and defect properties, which limits the device performance. In this study, a novel post&#8208;treatment strategy is developed that uses a low melting point B2O3 coating layer as a flux to drive the recrystallization of Sb2Se3, thereby regulating the micro&#8208;orientation of thermal evaporation&#8208;derived Sb2Se3 films and optimizing their electrical properties. Mechanistic investigations show that B2O3 exhibits stronger adsorption with (hk1) planes of Sb2Se3 to induce a vertical orientation growth of the film, while blocking the volatilization channels of Se and inhibiting Se vacancy defects by interacting with Sb2Se3. The Sb2Se3 film with [hk1] preferential orientation and suppressed deep&#8208;level defects promotes the effective transport of charge carriers in solar cells. As a result, the B2O3&#8208;treated device delivers a champion efficiency of 9.37% without MgF2 anti&#8208;reflection coating, which is currently the highest efficiency in Sb2Se3 solar cells achieved by thermal evaporation method. This study provides a new method and mechanism for regulating optical and electrical properties of low&#8208;dimensional inorganic thin films.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Regeneration of Spent LiMn2O4 Cathode Into High&#8208;Performance Ni&#8208;Doped LiMn2O4 Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient laser&#8208;assisted regeneration process is developed to convert spent LiMn2O4 cathodes into performance&#8208;enhanced, Ni&#8208;doped cathodes. Surface Ni doping enhances interfacial processes and prevents capacity loss at lower temperatures by forming a new interface with a reduced charge transfer energy barrier. This innovative approach offers a sustainable solution for regenerating spent lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes.








Abstract
The rapid increase in lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) production, fueled by the rise of electric vehicles, highlights significant challenges in managing end&#8208;of&#8208;life LIBs, particularly regarding environmental impact and waste management. Traditional recycling methods, such as pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes, are energy&#8208;intensive and consume substantial reagents. In this study, a laser&#8208;assisted regeneration method is introduced for LiMn2O4 (LMO) cathodes, enabling in situ Ni doping into spent LMO cathodes (r&#8208;LMO&#8208;Ni) to enhance electrochemical performance. Surface Ni&#8208;doping improves interfacial processes and reduces capacity loss at lower temperatures by creating a new interface with a lower charge transfer energy barrier. The r&#8208;LMO&#8208;Ni cathode surpasses pristine LMO cathodes, achieving a specific capacity of 112.95&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 1 C and retaining 95.1% of its capacity after 200 cycles at 0 &#176;C. A techno&#8208;economic analysis supports the feasibility of this laser&#8208;assisted regeneration approach, offering an innovative pathway for upcycling spent cathodes and developing next&#8208;generation Mn&#8208;based cathodes.

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Anisotropic 2D Insulator CrOCl Nanosheets for Interfacial Symmetry Breaking in Isotropic 2D Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly anisotropic 2D insulator CrOCl nanosheets are synthesized via space&#8208;confined chemical vapor deposition growth. A MoS2/CrOCl heterostructure with single&#8208;mirror symmetry stacking and ultrastrong interfacial coupling is built to realize interfacial symmetry breaking, which endows its device with polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection and bulk photovoltaic effect. This study opens new prospects for exploring CrOCl&#8208;based physics and electronics via symmetry engineering.









Abstract
Chromium oxychloride (CrOCl), a van der Waals antiferromagnetic insulator, has attracted significant interest in 2D optoelectronic, ferromagnetic, and quantum devices. However, the bottom&#8211;up preparation of 2D CrOCl remains challenging, limiting its property exploration and device application. Herein, the controllable synthesis of 2D CrOCl crystals by chemical vapor deposition is demonstrated. The combination reaction of precursors together with the space&#8208;confined growth strategy, providing stable and stoichiometric growth conditions, enable a robust synthesis of high&#8208;crystallinity CrOCl nanosheets with regular rhombus&#8208;like morphology and uniform thickness. By tuning the growth temperature from 675 to 800&#160;&#176;C, the thickness of CrOCl nanosheets can be continuously modulated from 10.2 to 30.8&#160;nm, with the domain size increasing from 16.9 to 25.5&#160;&#181;m.

&lt;p&gt;Highly anisotropic 2D insulator CrOCl nanosheets are synthesized via space-confined chemical vapor deposition growth. A MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CrOCl heterostructure with single-mirror symmetry stacking and ultrastrong interfacial coupling is built to realize interfacial symmetry breaking, which endows its device with polarization-sensitive photodetection and bulk photovoltaic effect. This study opens new prospects for exploring CrOCl-based physics and electronics via symmetry engineering.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chromium oxychloride (CrOCl), a van der Waals antiferromagnetic insulator, has attracted significant interest in 2D optoelectronic, ferromagnetic, and quantum devices. However, the bottom&#8211;up preparation of 2D CrOCl remains challenging, limiting its property exploration and device application. Herein, the controllable synthesis of 2D CrOCl crystals by chemical vapor deposition is demonstrated. The combination reaction of precursors together with the space-confined growth strategy, providing stable and stoichiometric growth conditions, enable a robust synthesis of high-crystallinity CrOCl nanosheets with regular rhombus-like morphology and uniform thickness. By tuning the growth temperature from 675 to 800&#160;&#176;C, the thickness of CrOCl nanosheets can be continuously modulated from 10.2 to 30.8&#160;nm, with the domain size increasing from 16.9 to 25.5&#160;&#181;m. The as-grown CrOCl nanosheets exhibit significant structural/optical anisotropy, ultrahigh insulativity, and superior air stability. Furthermore, a MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CrOCl heterostructure with single-mirror symmetry stacking and ultrastrong interfacial coupling is built to realize interfacial symmetry breaking, a novel interface phenomenon that converts MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from isotropy to anisotropy. Consequently, the MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CrOCl heterostructure device achieves polarization-sensitive photodetection and bulk photovoltaic effect, which are nonexistent in high-symmetry 2D materials. This work paves the way for the future exploration of CrOCl-based 2D physics and devices via symmetry engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Neuronal Signal Sorting and Amplifying Nanosensor for EEG&#8208;Concordant Imaging&#8208;Guided Precision Epilepsy Ablation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neuronal signal sorting and amplifying nanosensor integrates real&#8208;time, dynamically reversible potassium ion (K&#8314;) fluorescence imaging (FI) with high&#8208;resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This enables electroencephalogram&#8208;concordant imaging of hidden epileptic foci and guides minimally invasive radiofrequency ablation on mice with drug&#8208;resistant focal epilepsy, resulting in sustained seizure control and improved cognitive outcomes.









Abstract
Surgery remains an essential treatment for managing drug&#8208;resistant focal epilepsy, but its accessibility and efficacy are limited in patients without distinct structural abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Potassium ion (K+), a critical marker for seizure&#8208;associated neuronal signaling, shows significant promise for designing sensors targeting hidden epileptic foci. However, existing sensors cannot cross the blood&#8208;brain barrier and lack the ability to specifically enrich and amplify K+ signals in the brain with high temporal and spatial resolution. Here, an intravenously administered neuronal signal sorting and amplifying nanosensor (NSAN) is reported that combines real&#8208;time dynamic reversible K+ fluorescence imaging with high&#8208;resolution structural MRI, enabling electroencephalogram&#8208;concordant imaging of MRI&#8208;negative epileptic foci. Guided by NSANs, minimally invasive surgery is successfully performed in both intrahippocampal kainic acid (KA) epilepsy model with foci confined to the ipsilateral hippocampus, and intraperitoneal KA model where foci are randomly distributed, resulting in sustained seizure control and cognitive improvement. These findings highlight the NSAN as a transformative tool for visualizing hidden epileptic foci, thereby broadening eligibility for minimally invasive and precision surgical intervention.

         <title>Synergistic Multimodal Energy Dissipation Enhances Certified Efficiency of Flexible Organic Photovoltaics beyond 19%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining multimodal energy dissipation and phase modulation in active layer films, the mechanical and photovoltaic properties of flexible electronics are innovatively co&#8208;developed to achieve a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.07%, which is the highest PCE reported for flexible organic photovoltaic device to date.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer organic solar cells (OSCs) have shown unparalleled application potential in the field of flexible wearable electronics in recent years due to the excellent mechanical and photovoltaic properties. However, the small molecule acceptors after polymerization in still retain some mechanical and aggregation properties of the small molecule, falling short of the ductility requirements for flexible devices. Here, based on the multimodal energy dissipation theory, the mechanical and photovoltaic properties of flexible devices are co&#8208;enhanced by adding the thermoplastic elastomer material (polyurethane, PU) to the PM6:PBQx&#8208;TF:PY&#8208;IT&#8208;based active layer films. The construction of multi&#8208;fiber network structure and the decrease of films&#8217; residual stresses contribute to the enhancement of carrier transport properties and the decrease of defect state density. Eventually, the PCE (power conversion efficiency) of 19.40% is achieved on the flexible devices with an effective area of 0.102 cm2, and the third&#8208;party certified PCE reaches 19.07%, which is the highest PCE for flexible OSCs currently available. To further validate the potential of this strategy for large&#8208;area module applications, the 25&#8208;cm2&#8208;based flexible and super&#8208;flexible modules are prepared with the PCEs of 15.48% and 14.61%, respectively, and demonstration applications are implemented.

         <title>High Efficiency (&gt;10%) AgBiS2 Colloidal Nanocrystal Solar Cells with Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;Based Polymer Hole Transport Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new BD2FCT material is developed as an advanced HTL tailored for AgBiS2 CNC solar cells through precise molecular engineering. This new polymer effectively reduces charge recombination at the CNC/HTL interfaces, thereby leading to enhanced charge extraction. Incorporation of the IEICO&#8208;4F into BD2FCT further improves charge funneling and absorption, resulting in a notable 10.1% PCE for AgBiS2 CNC solar cells.








Abstract
Silver bismuth disulfide (AgBiS2) colloidal nanocrystals (CNCs) have emerged as ecofriendly photoactive materials with excellent photoconductivity and high absorption coefficients, in compliance with the restriction of hazardous substances (RoHS) guidelines. To maximize the theoretical potential of AgBiS2 CNC solar cells, a new diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based polymer, BD2FCT, optimized as a hole transport layer (HTL), is developed. This asymmetric thiophene&#8208;rich polymer HTL effectively complements the optical absorption spectrum of CNCs and forms a homogeneous layer atop the CNCs, facilitating favorable vertical charge transfer through intrinsic molecular packing. Furthermore, the BD2FCT HTL aligns energetically with AgBiS2, significantly reducing charge recombination at the CNC/HTL interfaces and enhancing charge extraction and photocurrent generation across the entire optical absorption spectrum. These characteristics are further optimized through precise molecular engineering. Additionally, a low&#8208;bandgap acceptor, IEICO&#8208;4F, is structurally incorporated with the BD2FCT polymer to further improve charge funneling and complementary absorption. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals enhanced hole transfer from CNC to BD2FCT&#8208;29DPP:IEICO&#8208;4F, resulting in reduced charge recombination and efficient charge extraction. Consequently, a BD2FCT&#8208;based AgBiS2 CNC solar cell achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.1%, demonstrating significant improvements in short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF).

         <title>Retroreflective Multichrome Microdome Arrays Created by Single&#8208;Step Reflow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arrays of microdomes with varying radii are formed by transforming micropillars made of the positive photoresist through a single&#8208;step reflow process. These inverted microdomes exhibit radius&#8208;dependent structural colors via total internal reflection and optical interference. By controlling the density and size of the microdomes, retroreflective multicolor graphics are achieved with exceptional color representation and resolution.








Abstract
Structural colors are known for their tunability, fade resistance, and eco&#8208;friendliness. Recent advancements have shown that such colors can be efficiently produced using total internal reflection (TIR) on high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index convex microstructures without the need for periodic nanostructures. However, a reproducible, fast, and programmable production strategy for these microstructures is essential for commercial applications. Here, a single&#8208;step method is reported for creating multicolor patterns by transforming photolithographically&#8208;patterned micropillars into microdomes through thermal reflow. These micropillars, uniform in height but varying in diameter, are converted into microdomes that differ in diameter and height, which display a full spectrum of structural colors, creating a versatile color palette. This process enables the production of high&#8208;resolution multicolor graphics using a rainbow color set, with high reproducibility. Additionally, by mixing distinct microdomes and adjusting their densities, a rich variety of color presentations can be achieved, enabling the recreation of arbitrary color images with microdome arrays. The variable heights of the microdomes also allow for dynamic discoloration or color changes through mechanical compression. The high reproducibility and scalability of this method hold significant commercial promise for various optical applications.

Recent advancements have shown that such colors can be efficiently produced using total internal reflection (TIR) on high-refractive-index convex microstructures without the need for periodic nanostructures. However, a reproducible, fast, and programmable production strategy for these microstructures is essential for commercial applications. Here, a single-step method is reported for creating multicolor patterns by transforming photolithographically-patterned micropillars into microdomes through thermal reflow. These micropillars, uniform in height but varying in diameter, are converted into microdomes that differ in diameter and height, which display a full spectrum of structural colors, creating a versatile color palette. This process enables the production of high-resolution multicolor graphics using a rainbow color set, with high reproducibility. Additionally, by mixing distinct microdomes and adjusting their densities, a rich variety of color presentations can be achieved, enabling the recreation of arbitrary color images with microdome arrays. The variable heights of the microdomes also allow for dynamic discoloration or color changes through mechanical compression. The high reproducibility and scalability of this method hold significant commercial promise for various optical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Yet Strong Actuator Materials with Muscle&#8208;Like Diastole and Contraction via Multilevel Relaxations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanical robust and healable actuator material with muscle&#8208;like diastole and contraction abilities is fabricated by orientational alignment of dendritic polyphenol&#8208;modified nano&#8208;assembles in eutectogels. The anisotropic hierarchical micro&#8208;nanostructures assembled by supramolecular interaction endow obtained artificial muscle with high output actuation and robust mechanical properties, exceeding typical natural muscles, which pave&#160;the way for advancements in next&#8208;generation intelligent robotics.








Abstract
Skeletal muscles represent a role model in soft robotics featuring agile locomotion and incredible mechanical robustness. However, existing actuators lack an optimal combination of actuation parameters (including actuation modes, work capacity, mechanical strength, and damage repair) to rival biological tissues. Here, a biomimetic structural design strategy via multilevel relaxations (&#945;/&#946;/&#947;/&#948;&#8208;relaxation) modulation is proposed for mechanical robust and healable actuator materials with muscle&#8208;like diastole and contraction abilities by orientational alignment of dendritic polyphenol&#8208;modified nano&#8208;assembles in eutectogels. The anisotropic hierarchical micro&#8208;nanostructures assembled by supramolecular interaction mimic the relative slippage of actin filaments and myosin in muscles, ensuring bistable actuation through rapid thermal &#945;&#8208;relaxation and expansion. Furthermore, kinetically active secondary &#946;/&#947;/&#948;&#8208;relaxation at reconfigurable interfaces can conquer the limited self&#8208;healing ability of fixed&#8208;orientation polymeric chains. The obtained artificial muscle exhibits high output actuation, robust mechanical properties (tensile strength of 33.5&#160;MPa), and desired functional, mechanical self&#8208;healing efficiency (89.7%), exceeding typical natural muscles in living systems. The bionic micro&#8208;nano design strategy achieves bottom&#8208;up cooperative relaxation modulation to integrate all&#8208;round performance of natural muscles, which paves the way for substantial advancements in next&#8208;generation intelligent robotics.

         <title>Breaking the Trade&#8208;Off Between Mobility and On&#8211;Off Ratio in Oxide Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mild CF4 plasma is introduced to resolve the trade&#8208;off between mobility and the on&#8208;current (Ion)/off&#8208;current (Ioff) ratio &#160;in degenerate oxide semiconductors without the need for thermal annealing. This technique effectively reduces carrier density, achieving a high Ion/Ioff ratio (10&#8312;) while preserving high mobility (104 cm2 V&#8722;1s&#8722;1) of thick In2O3 transistors, leading to enhanced switching performance and making it ideal for three&#8208;dimensional&#160;integration in advanced electronic devices.








Abstract
Amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOS) are pivotal for next&#8208;generation electronics due to their high electron mobility and excellent optical properties. However, In2O3, a key material in this family, encounters significant challenges in balancing high mobility and effective switching as its thickness is scaled down to nanometer dimensions. The high electron density in ultra&#8208;thin In2O3 hinders its ability to turn off effectively, leading to a critical trade&#8208;off between mobility and the on&#8208;current (Ion)/off&#8208;current (Ioff) ratio. This study introduces a mild CF4 plasma doping technique that effectively reduces electron density in 10&#160;nm In2O3 at a low processing temperature of 70&#160;&#176;C, achieving a high mobility of 104 cm2 V&#8315;&#185; s&#8315;&#185; and an Ion/Ioff ratio exceeding 10&#8312;. A subsequent low&#8208;temperature post&#8208;annealing further improves the critical reliability and stability of CF4&#8208;doped In2O3 without raising the thermal budget, making this technique suitable for monolithic three&#8208;dimensional (3D) integration. Additionally, its application is demonstrated in In2O3 depletion&#8208;load inverters, highlighting its potential for advanced logic circuits and broader electronic and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Structural MXene/PBO Aerogels for High&#8208;Performance Electromagnetic Interference Shielding with Ultra&#8208;Low Reflection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By means of in situ growth method, heterostructure MXene@Ni electromagnetic functional fillers with good impedance matching performance are prepared by &#8220;electrostatic adsorption&#8208;solvothermal reduction&#8221;. And the obtained asymmetric structural (MXene@Ni/PNF)&#8208;(MXene/PNF) aerogels prepared by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer freeze&#8208;drying based on the layered modular design concept present high&#8208;performance electromagnetic interference shielding with ultra&#8208;low reflection and infrared camouflage.








Abstract
Electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials with low electromagnetic (EM) waves reflection characteristics are ideal materials for blocking EM radiation and pollution. Materials with low reflectivity must be constructed using materials with excellent EM waves absorption properties. However, materials simultaneously possessing both low reflectivity and excellent EMI shielding performance remain scarce, consequently, multilayer structures need to be developed. Poly(p&#8208;phenylene&#8211;2,6&#8211;benzobisoxazole) nanofibers (PNF) are prepared by deprotonation. PNF are combined with MXene and heterostructure MXene@Ni prepared by in&#8208;situ growth; MXene@Ni/PNF acts as an EM absorption layer while MXene/PNF acts as an EM reflective layer. Finally, (MXene@Ni/PNF)&#8211;(MXene/PNF) aerogels are prepared by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer freeze&#8208;drying based on the layered modular design concept. Experimental characterizations revealed that (MXene@Ni/PNF)&#8211;(MXene/PNF) aerogels enable the efficient absorption&#8208;reflection&#8208;reabsorption of EM waves, effectively eliminating EMI. When the mass ratio of MXene to Ni in MXene@Ni is 1:6 and the mass fraction of MXene in the reflective layer is 80 wt.%, the (MXene@Ni/PNF)&#8211;(MXene/PNF) aerogels exhibit excellent EMI shielding performance (71 dB) and a very low reflection coefficient (R = 0.10). Finite element simulations verified that the developed asymmetric structural aerogels achieve high EMI shielding performance with low reflection characteristics. In addition, (MXene@Ni/PNF)&#8211;(MXene/PNF) aerogels display excellent infrared camouflage ability.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Induced Energetic Coordination Compounds as Additives for Laser Initiation Primary Explosives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energetic coordination compounds (ECCs) are first used as additives to lead azide (LA) to design laser ignition primary explosives. These laser&#8208;sensitive mixed composites exhibit remarkable initiating ability, extremely low laser initiation threshold (Emin), fast response times (Tmin), and acceptable stabilities. The strategy can broaden new application scenarios and unveil new perspectives for coordination compounds as additives in advanced laser pyrotechnics for aerospace applications.








Abstract
Laser ignition of primary explosives presents more reliable alternative to traditional electrical initiation methods. However, the commercial initiator lead azide (LA) requires a high&#8208;power density laser to detonate, with the minimum laser initiation energy (Emin) of 2402 mJ. Currently, the laser&#8208;ignitable metal complex&#8208;based igniters still suffer from weak detonation capabilities and high Emin values. Here, the approach is first proposed to design laser ignition primary explosives within the high energy azide and tetrazole&#8208;based energetic coordination compounds (ECCs), [Co(N3)(2&#8208;bmttz)(H2O)]2 1 and [Co(N3)(2&#8208;bmttz)(MeOH)]2 2 as additives to LA. Material 1e with 4&#160;wt.% of 1 in LA, exhibits ultra&#8208;low laser initiation threshold (Emin = 1.6 mJ) and ultrafast corresponding time (Tmin = 0.2&#160;ms).

     alt="Structure-Induced Energetic Coordination Compounds as Additives for Laser Initiation Primary Explosives"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energetic coordination compounds (ECCs) are first used as additives to lead azide (LA) to design laser ignition primary explosives. These laser-sensitive mixed composites exhibit remarkable initiating ability, extremely low laser initiation threshold (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;), fast response times (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;), and acceptable stabilities. The strategy can broaden new application scenarios and unveil new perspectives for coordination compounds as additives in advanced laser pyrotechnics for aerospace applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laser ignition of primary explosives presents more reliable alternative to traditional electrical initiation methods. However, the commercial initiator lead azide (LA) requires a high-power density laser to detonate, with the minimum laser initiation energy (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;) of 2402 mJ. Currently, the laser-ignitable metal complex-based igniters still suffer from weak detonation capabilities and high &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; values. Here, the approach is first proposed to design laser ignition primary explosives within the high energy azide and tetrazole-based energetic coordination compounds (ECCs), [Co(N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(2-bmttz)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and [Co(N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(2-bmttz)(MeOH)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; as additives to LA. Material &lt;b&gt;1e&lt;/b&gt; with 4&#160;wt.% of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; in LA, exhibits ultra-low laser initiation threshold (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.6 mJ) and ultrafast corresponding time (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.2&#160;ms). Specially, compared to LA, the threshold of &lt;b&gt;1e&lt;/b&gt; is as low as 1/1500 of that of LA. Moreover, 30&#160;mg &lt;b&gt;1e&lt;/b&gt; successfully detonates RDX with a laser energy of 1.6 mJ. Theoretical calculations and experiment results reveal that &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; exhibits the superior additive effect compared to &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, attributed to its more enhanced ability to generate free radicals and higher photothermal conversion efficiency under laser conditions. This work represents a paradigm shift, with the potential to develop a laser-driven micro-detonator combining powerful detonation capabilities with exceptionally low laser initiation energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hollow Mo/MoSVn Nanoreactors with Tunable Built&#8208;in Electric Fields for Sustainable Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The built&#8208;in electric fields (BIEFs) in the hollow Mo/MoSVn nanoreactors can be gradiently modulated via tailoring the sulfur vacancies, and exhibit parabola&#8208;shaped relationship with HER and UOR activities. Moderate BIEF evidently facilitates the hydrogen desorption in the HER and the breakage of N&#9472;H bond in the UOR, endowing the Mo/MoSV1 electrolyzer with superior activity and durability.








Abstract
Constructing built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) in heterojunction catalyst is an effective way to optimize adsorption/desorption of reaction intermediates, while its precise tailor to achieve efficient bifunctional electrocatalysis remains great challenge. Herein, the hollow Mo/MoSVn nanoreactors with tunable BIEFs are elaborately prepared to simultaneously promote hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) for sustainable hydrogen production. The BIEF induced by sulfur vacancies can be modulated from 0.79 to 0.57 to 0.42&#160;mV nm&#8722;1, and exhibits a parabola&#8208;shaped relationship with HER and UOR activities, the Mo/MoSV1 nanoreactor with moderate BIEF presents the best bifunctional activity. Theoretical calculations reveal that the moderate BIEF can evidently facilitate the hydrogen adsorption/desorption in the HER and the breakage of N&#9472;H bond in the UOR. The electrolyzer assembled with Mo/MoSV1 delivers a cell voltage of 1.49&#160;V at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, which is 437&#160;mV lower than that of traditional water electrolysis, and also presents excellent durability at 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 200&#160;h. Life cycle assessment indicates the HER||UOR system possesses notable superiority across various environment impact and energy consumption. This work can provide theoretical and experimental direction on the rational design of advanced materials for energy&#8208;saving and eco&#8208;friendly hydrogen production.

         <title>2D Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for New Generation Flexible Multicolor Electrochromic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D conductive conjugated MOFs (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are introduced as a novel class of multicolor electrochromic materials with significant potential for the next&#8208;generation flexible electrochromic devices (FMEDs). This perspective provides new insights into the coloring mechanisms and presents strategies for optimizing device performance, highlighting potential multidisciplinary applications in camera lenses, camouflage, displays, and wearable electronics.








Abstract
There has been considerable interest in 2D conductive conjugated MOFs (2D c&#8208;MOFs) for their potential applications in sensors, opto&#8208;electronics, catalysis, and energy storage, owing to their ultra&#8208;high specific surface area, relatively high electrical conductivity, and tunable pore channel sizes for ion/charge diffusion/adsorption. The unique advantages brought by systematic tunings in the metal nodes and organic ligands enable the creation of highly accessible and remarkable structures with diverse chemical and physical behaviors. While the 2D c&#8208;MOFs are being explored for the rapid widening spectrum of applications, in this work, the great potential of multicolor transitions and functional properties of these 2D c&#8208;MOFs are examined for the new generation of flexible multicolor electrochromic devices (FMEDs). Despite the rather limited and yet steady progress that has been made so far, 2D c&#8208;MOFs offer great opportunities in addressing the monotonous color switching, undesirable stability, as well as the sluggish kinetics of electron/ion transportation, which are typically encountered by the conventional electrochromic materials. Together with the main challenges that are being faced, this perspective provides a timely re&#8208;visit to the expected transition in the near future from the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration to the eventual industrial&#8208;scale implementation of 2D c&#8208;MOFs in the new generation FEMDs.

         <title>Incompatible Geometry Regulation of Nanowire Assemblies Enabled Light&#8208;Driven Shape Morphing and Motions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanowire assemblies&#8208;induced geometry engineering method is reported to fabricate a photoresponsive liquid crystal actuator with mechanically incompatible geometry, exhibiting a saddle&#8208;like appearance. By regulating the off&#8208;axis director angle and strip width, the configurations of the actuators undergo sharp and periodic transitions among the rings, helicoids, and spirals, enabling the generation of multi&#8208;modal photo&#8208;driven locomotion with fast velocities and high controllability.








Abstract
Photoresponsive shape&#8208;changing materials have significant applications in miniaturized smart robotics and biomedicine powered in a remote and wireless manner. Existing light&#8208;fuelled soft materials suffer from limited continuous shape manipulation and constrained mobility and locomotive modes. One promising solution is developing a hierarchical structure design approach to integrate rapid, reversible photoactive molecular alignment and mechanically incompatible geometry in a macroscopic system. Here, a nanowire assemblies&#8208;induced geometry engineering method is reported for the fabrication of silver nanowire&#8208;incorporated nematic liquid crystalline elastomers with prominent anisotropic structures at multi&#8208;length scales and incompatible elasticity that show sharp morphological transitions among the rings, helicoids, and spirals with diverse helical configurations. The engineered composite films can realize complex light&#8208;driven motions including rotating, rolling, and jumping with the controlled directionality and magnitude that are pre&#8208;encoded in their both molecular and macroscopic configurations. Owing to the great controllability of multimodal locomotion, a spiral robot can undertake task&#8208;specific configuration to climb up complex terrains. The complete regulatory relationship among molecular orientation, shape geometry, and light&#8208;driven motions is also established. This study may open an avenue for elaborate design and precise fabrication of novel shape&#8208;morphing materials for future applications in intelligent robotic systems.

         <title>Sequential Stimuli&#8208;Response System of Eu&#8208;MOF Isomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;1 and QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;2 isomers were synthesized for the construction of sequential stimuli&#8208;response (SSR) system. Solvent&#8208;driven structural transformation of the two isomers into QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;3 occurred, accompanied by the solid color changes from white to yellow and emergence of new emission band centered at 495 nm. Furthermore, yellow QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;3 powder transformed into brown QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;4 powder upon light illumination.








Abstract
Multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive materials hold excellent potential for the next generation smart materials owing to their unique response to external stimuli, providing a powerful impetus for the development of intelligent optical devices. The stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior of common multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive materials are independent of each other, causing the lack of multiplicity and identification for information technology, which is easy to decode. Herein, QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;1 and QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;2 isomers were prepared from QIPA and EuCl3&#183;6H2O in different solvent thermal conditions for building sequential stimuli&#8208;response (SSR) system. Solvent&#8208;driven structural transformations of the isomers into QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;3 occurred, along with color change and fluorescence emission variation ascribed to the generation of QIPA aggregates. Furthermore, QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;3 displayed excellent photochromic behaviors. Combining theoretical calculation with well&#8208;defined experiments to reveal the mechanism, it was found that light drove the change in the dihedral angles between the quinoline nucleus and adjacent benzene rings in QIPA aggregates. Finally, on the basis of sequential stimuli&#8208;induced stepwise responsive behavior of QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;1, the sequential logic gate and time&#8208;dependent fluorescence dynamic anti&#8208;counterfeiting pattern were successfully constructed. This study provided a new perspective for design and construction of SSR system, which showed promising potential in the fields of data transmission and information encryption.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple stimuli-responsive materials hold excellent potential for the next generation smart materials owing to their unique response to external stimuli, providing a powerful impetus for the development of intelligent optical devices. The stimuli-responsive behavior of common multiple stimuli-responsive materials are independent of each other, causing the lack of multiplicity and identification for information technology, which is easy to decode. Herein, QIPA-Eu-1 and QIPA-Eu-2 isomers were prepared from QIPA and EuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in different solvent thermal conditions for building sequential stimuli-response (SSR) system. Solvent-driven structural transformations of the isomers into QIPA-Eu-3 occurred, along with color change and fluorescence emission variation ascribed to the generation of QIPA aggregates. Furthermore, QIPA-Eu-3 displayed excellent photochromic behaviors. Combining theoretical calculation with well-defined experiments to reveal the mechanism, it was found that light drove the change in the dihedral angles between the quinoline nucleus and adjacent benzene rings in QIPA aggregates. Finally, on the basis of sequential stimuli-induced stepwise responsive behavior of QIPA-Eu-1, the sequential logic gate and time-dependent fluorescence dynamic anti-counterfeiting pattern were successfully constructed. This study provided a new perspective for design and construction of SSR system, which showed promising potential in the fields of data transmission and information encryption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Evolution and Reconstruction of Air&#8208;Electrode Surface Composition in Reversible Protonic Ceramic Cells: Mechanisms, Impacts on Catalytic Performance, and Optimization Strategies &#8211; A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively summarizes the surface evolution and reconstruction of reversible protonic ceramic cell (R&#8208;PCC) air&#8208;electrodes. It begins by analyzing the thermodynamic and kinetic contributions to surface evolutions, followed by a summary of factors that lead to electrochemical performance degradation, emphasizing on both the negative and positive effects of water. Additionally, recent advances in enhancing electrode surface activity are presented.








Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic cells (R&#8208;PCCs) are at the forefront of electrochemical conversion devices, capable of reversibly and efficiently converting chemical energy into electricity at intermediate temperatures (350&#8211;700&#160;&#176;C) with zero carbon emissions. However, slow surface catalytic reactions at the air&#8208;electrode often hinder their performance and durability. The electrode surface is not merely an extension of the bulk structure, equilibrium reconstruction can lead to significantly different crystal&#8208;plane terminations and morphologies, which are influenced by material's intrinsic properties and external reaction conditions. Understanding electrode surface evolution at elevated temperatures in water&#8208;containing, oxidative atmospheres presents significant importance. In this review, a comprehensive summary of recent processes in applying advanced characterization techniques for high&#8208;temperature electrode surfaces is provided, exploring the correlations between surface evolution and performance fluctuations by examining the structural evolution and reconstruction of various air&#8208;electrode surfaces associated with degradation and activation phenomena, offering insights into their impact on electrode performance. Furthermore, reported strategies and recent advances in enhancing the electrochemical performance of R&#8208;PCCs through engineering air&#8208;electrode surfaces is discussed. This review offers valuable insights into surface evolution in R&#8208;PCCs and is expected to guide future developments in high&#8208;temperature catalysis, solid&#8208;state ionics, and energy materials.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Self&#8208;Discharge Capability of Zn&#8208;Halogen Batteries Through an Entrapment&#8208;Adsorption&#8208;Catalysis Strategy Built Upon Separator</title>

         <dc:description>
The mechanisms of glass fiber (GF) and Zn&#9472;Mn atom pairs&#8208;modified glass fiber separator (named as ZnMn&#8208;NC/GF) work in zinc&#8208;halogen batteries. The Mn&#8208;N4 single&#8208;atom sites are responsible for adsorption, while the Zn&#9472;Mn atom pairs are responsible for catalysis. The polyiodide can be rapidly captured and further transformed into I&#8208; before it reaches zinc anodes through this effective ZnMn&#8208;NC modified layer.









Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;halogen batteries (Zn&#8208;I2/Br2) suffer from grievous self&#8208;discharge behavior, resulting in irreversible loss of active cathode material and severe corrosion of zinc anode, which ultimately leads to rapid battery failure. Herein, an entrapment&#8208;adsorption&#8208;catalysis strategy is reported, leveraging Zn&#9472;Mn atom pairs&#8208;modified glass fiber separator (designated as ZnMn&#8208;NC/GF), to effectively mitigate the self&#8208;discharge phenomenon. The in situ Raman and UV experiments, along with theoretical calculations, confirmed the single&#8208;atom Mn sites are responsible for polyiodides adsorption, while Zn&#9472;Mn atom pairs facilitated the conversion of reaction intermediates. As a result, the utilization rate of cathode active species is enhanced through this ZnMn&#8208;NC/GF separator. The fully charged Zn&#8208;I2 battery assembled with ZnMn&#8208;NC/GF maintained a Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 90.1% after being left for 120 h, as well as a capacity retention rate of 95.3% after 30000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g&#8722;1. Additionally, the Zn&#8208;Br2 battery designed with ZnMn&#8208;NC/GF separator can withstand more serious self&#8208;discharge problems of bromine species, with an average discharge voltage platform of 1.75 V at 0.5 A g&#8722;1. The self&#8208;discharge problem of aqueous Zn&#8208;halogen batteries is significantly suppressed by this entrapment&#8208;adsorption&#8208;catalysis strategy, which can serve as a crucial reference for the advancement of high&#8208;performance aqueous Zn&#8208;halogen batteries.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Defect Regulated G&#8208;C3N4 for Piezoelectric Catalytic Tumor Therapy with Enhanced Efficacy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a surface photoetching strategy is employed to introduce surface nitrogen vacancies on the repaired carbon nitride, significantly improving its piezoelectric performance. This defect&#8208;engineered carbon nitride, serving as an excellent sonosensitizer, can temporally and spatially generate reactive oxygen species within tumor cells under ultrasound stimulation, thereby achieving effective piezoelectric catalytic therapy for cancer.








Abstract
Piezoelectric catalysis for tumor treatment is an emerging method for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the development and optimization of piezoelectric catalytic nanomaterials remain the major challenge. Herein, by regulating the internal and surface defects of graphene phase carbon nitride (defect&#8208;engineered g&#8208;C3N4), its piezoelectricity and sonocatalytic performance is enhanced, thus achieving efficient tumor treatment. By reducing bulk defects, the charges excited by ultrasound (US) within the defect&#8208;engineered g&#8208;C3N4 can migrate more rapidly to the material surface, thereby enhancing their participation in redox reactions. Increasing surface defects not only introduce more active sites on the surface of defect&#8208;engineered g&#8208;C3N4 but also enhance the asymmetry of the defect&#8208;engineered g&#8208;C3N4 structure, resulting in excellent piezoelectric properties. This defect&#8208;engineered g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheet can effectively generate ROS in tumor cells and induce tumor cell apoptosis under US stimulation. This work not only introduces a method to enhance the piezoelectric catalytic performance of g&#8208;C3N4 but also expands the potential application of defect&#8208;engineered piezoelectric materials to tumor treatment.

         <title>Manipulating Aggregation Kinetics toward Efficient All&#8208;Printed Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acceptor BTP&#8208;Cy, featuring cyclohexyl side chains, is synthesized to control molecular aggregation state in solution. Compared to molecules containing benzene and undecyl side chains, BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;based active layer exhibits suitable solubility and molecular aggregation size, leading to an optimal liquid precursor film length and film morphology. Consequently, all&#8208;printed 23.6 cm2 BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;based modules achieve a power conversion efficiency of 16.2%.








Abstract
The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all&#8208;printed organic solar cells (OSCs) remain inferior to those of spin&#8208;coated devices, primarily due to morphological variations within the bulk heterojunction processed via diverse coating/printing techniques. Herein, cyclohexyl is introduced as outer side chains to formulate a non&#8208;fullerene acceptor, BTP&#8208;Cy, aimed at modulating the molecular aggregation in solution and subsequent film formation kinetics during printing. Investigations demonstrate that BTP&#8208;Cy molecule with cyclohexyl side chains exhibits enhanced intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, optimal solution aggregation size, and favorable phase separation. Consequently, PB3:FTCC&#8208;Br:BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;based OSCs achieve remarkable PCEs of 20.2% and 19.5% via spin&#8208;coating and blade&#8208;coating, respectively. Furthermore, a 23.6 cm2 module exhibits a remarkable efficiency of 16.7%. This study offers a fresh perspective on tailoring the film formation kinetics of photoactive materials during printing through molecular design, paving a novel path to enhance the efficiency of all&#8208;printed OSCs.

         <title>Myocardia&#8208;Injected Synergistically Anti&#8208;Apoptotic and Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Poly(amino acid) Hydrogel Relieves Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury</title>

A bioactive thermo&#8208;sensitive poly(amino acid) hydrogel is demonstrated to release the therapeutic drug FTY720 in a reactive oxygen species&#8208;controlled manner and achieves a synergistic effect by inhibiting apoptosis and regulating the reperfusion inflammatory microenvironments, thereby reducing ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury and promoting tissue repair, demonstrating significant clinical potential for the treatment of ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury.








Abstract
Reperfusion therapy is the most effective treatment for acute myocardial infarction, but its efficacy is frequently limited by ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (IRI). While antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory therapies have shown significant potential in alleviating IRI, these strategies have not yielded satisfactory clinical outcomes. For that, a thermo&#8208;sensitive myocardial&#8208;injectable poly(amino acid) hydrogel of methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)45&#8208;poly(L&#8208;methionine20&#8208;co&#8208;L&#8208;alanine10) (mPEG45&#8208;P(Met20&#8208;co&#8208;Ala10), PMA) loaded with FTY720 (PMA/FTY720) is developed to address IRI through synergistic anti&#8208;apoptotic and anti&#8208;inflammatory effects. Upon injection into the ischemic myocardium, the PMA aqueous solution undergoes a sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel phase transition and gradually degrades in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS), releasing FTY720 on demand. PMA acts synergistically with FTY720 to inhibit cardiomyocyte apoptosis and modulate pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 macrophage polarization toward anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 macrophages by clearing ROS, thereby mitigating the inflammatory response and promoting vascular regeneration. In a rat IRI model, PMA/FTY720 reduces the apoptotic cell ratio by 81.8%, increases vascular density by 34.0%, and enhances left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by 12.8%. In a rabbit IRI model, the gel&#8208;based sustained release of FTY720 enhanced LVEF by an additional 7.2% compared to individual treatment. In summary, the engineered PMA hydrogel effectively alleviates IRI through synergistic anti&#8208;apoptosis and anti&#8208;inflammation actions, offering valuable clinical potential for treating myocardial IRI.
