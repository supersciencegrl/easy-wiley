      <dc:description>
Advancement in microelectronics technology enables autonomous edge&#8208;computing platforms the size of a dust mote. Dust&#8208;sized III&#8211;V photovoltaic cells grown on a Si substrate can be integrated using a wafer&#8208;level&#8208;packaging process for heterogeneous integration with other chiplets and achieve high power density. This advancement unlocks the potential of large&#8208;scale manufacturing of these compact integrated systems with high&#8208;performance and ultralow cost.








Abstract
Advancement in microelectronics technology enables autonomous edge computing platforms in the size of a dust mote (&lt;1 mm),&#160;bringing efficient and low&#8208;cost artificial intelligence close to the end user and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things (IoT) applications. The key challenge for these compact high&#8208;performance edge computers is the integration of a power source that satisfies the high&#8208;power&#8208;density requirement and does not increase the complexity and cost of the packaging. Here, it is shown that dust&#8208;sized III&#8211;V photovoltaic (PV) cells grown on Si and silicon&#8208;on&#8208;insulator (SOI) substrates can be integrated using a wafer&#8208;level&#8208;packaging process and achieve higher power density than all prior micro&#8208;PVs on Si and SOI substrates. The high&#8208;throughput heterogeneous integration unlocks the potential of large&#8208;scale manufacturing of these integrated systems with low cost for IoT applications. The negative effect of crystallographic defects in the heteroepitaxial materials on PV performance diminishes at high power density. Simultaneous power delivery and data transmission to the dust mote with heteroepitaxially grown PV are also demonstrated using hand&#8208;held illumination sources.

      <title>Black Bioceramics: Combining Regeneration with Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
A new generation of black bioceramics is successfully synthesized through a magnesium thermal&#8208;reduction strategy. The black bioceramics possess an excellent skin/bone tumor therapy effect while retaining their initial bioactivity, extending the functions of bioceramics from tissue regeneration to disease therapy. Such black bioceramics, with both cancer therapy and tissue regeneration, should greatly promote the scientific revival and clinical application of bioceramics.








Abstract
Bioceramics have been developed from bioinert to bioactive or biodegradable materials in the past few decades. However, at present, traditional bioceramics are still mainly used in bone tissue regeneration and dental restoration. In this work, a new generation of &#8220;black bioceramics,&#8221; extending the applications from tissue regeneration to disease therapy, is presented. Black bioceramics, through magnesium thermal reduction of traditional white ceramics, including silicate&#8208;based (e.g., CaSiO3, MgSiO3) and phosphate&#8208;based (e.g., Ca3(PO4)2, Ca5(PO4)3(OH)), are successfully synthesized. Due to the presence of oxygen vacancies and structural defects, the black bioceramics possess photothermal functionality while maintaining their initial high bioactivity and regenerative capacity. These black bioceramics show excellent photothermal antitumor effects for both skin and bone tumors. At the same time, they have significantly improved bioactivity for skin/bone tissue repair in vitro and in vivo. These fascinating properties award the black bioceramics with profound applications in both tumor therapy and tissue regeneration, which should greatly promote the scientific relevance and clinical application of bioceramics, representing a promising new direction of cell&#8208;instructive biomaterials.

      <title>Material Design of Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries: Fundamental Challenges and Mitigation Strategies</title>
      <dc:description>
Aqueous redox flow batteries (ARFBs) are promising large&#8208;scale energy storage technologies. The latest progress on advanced electrolyte design of ARFBs is reviewed, including a fundamental overview of their physicochemical properties, major challenges, and design strategies. Future directions for material design to realize practical applications and achieve the commercialization of ARFB energy&#8208;storage systems are highlighted.








Abstract
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are critical enablers for next&#8208;generation grid&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage systems, due to their scalability and flexibility in decoupling power and energy. Aqueous RFBs (ARFBs) using nonflammable electrolytes are intrinsically safe. However, their development has been limited by their low energy density and high cost. Developing ARFBs with higher energy density, lower cost, and longer lifespan than the current standard is of significant interest to academic and industrial research communities. Here, a critical review of the latest progress on advanced electrolyte material designs of ARFBs is presented, including a fundamental overview of their physicochemical properties, major challenges, and design strategies. Assessment methodologies and metrics for the evaluation of RFB stability are discussed. Finally, future directions for material design to realize practical applications and achieve the commercialization of ARFB energy&#8208;storage systems are highlighted.

      <title>Photonic Fractal Metamaterials: A Metal&#8211;Semiconductor Platform with Enhanced Volatile&#8208;Compound Sensing Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
Realization of photonic metamaterials is hindered by the lack of multiscale structuring techniques. The stochastically invariant features of fractals are used for engineering a tunable family of active media, consisting of plasmonic nanoresonators in porous semiconductor matrices. This architectures enhance the plasmonic volume over multiple length&#8208;scales, and excellent room&#8208;temperature sensitivity and low detection limits for volatile molecules are demonstrated.








Abstract
Advance of photonics media is restrained by the lack of structuring techniques for the 3D fabrication of active materials with long&#8208;range periodicity. A methodology is reported for the engineering of tunable resonant photonic media with thickness exceeding the plasmonic near&#8208;field enhancement region by more than two orders of magnitude. The media architecture consists of a stochastically ordered distribution of plasmonic nanocrystals in a fractal scaffold of high&#8208;index semiconductors. This plasmonic&#8208;semiconductor fractal media supports the propagation of surface plasmons with drastically enhanced intensity over multiple length scales, overcoming the 2D limitations of established metasurface technologies. The fractal media are used for the fabrication of plasmonic optical gas sensors, achieving a limit of detection of 0.01 vol% at room temperature and sensitivity up to 1.9&#160;nm vol%&#8722;1, demonstrating almost a fivefold increase with respect to an optimized planar geometry. Beneficially to their implementation, the self&#8208;assembly mechanism of this fractal architecture allows fabrication of micrometer&#8208;thick media over surfaces of several square centimeters in a few seconds. The designable optical features and intrinsic scalability of these photonic fractal metamaterials provide ample opportunities for applications, bridging across transformation optics, sensing, and light harvesting.

     alt="Photonic Fractal Metamaterials: A Metal&#8211;Semiconductor Platform with Enhanced Volatile&#8208;Compound Sensing Performance"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realization of photonic metamaterials is hindered by the lack of multiscale structuring techniques. The stochastically invariant features of fractals are used for engineering a tunable family of active media, consisting of plasmonic nanoresonators in porous semiconductor matrices. This architectures enhance the plasmonic volume over multiple length&#8208;scales, and excellent room&#8208;temperature sensitivity and low detection limits for volatile molecules are demonstrated.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advance of photonics media is restrained by the lack of structuring techniques for the 3D fabrication of active materials with long&#8208;range periodicity. A methodology is reported for the engineering of tunable resonant photonic media with thickness exceeding the plasmonic near&#8208;field enhancement region by more than two orders of magnitude. The media architecture consists of a stochastically ordered distribution of plasmonic nanocrystals in a fractal scaffold of high&#8208;index semiconductors. This plasmonic&#8208;semiconductor fractal media supports the propagation of surface plasmons with drastically enhanced intensity over multiple length scales, overcoming the 2D limitations of established metasurface technologies. The fractal media are used for the fabrication of plasmonic optical gas sensors, achieving a limit of detection of 0.01 vol% at room temperature and sensitivity up to 1.9&#160;nm vol%&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, demonstrating almost a fivefold increase with respect to an optimized planar geometry. Beneficially to their implementation, the self&#8208;assembly mechanism of this fractal architecture allows fabrication of micrometer&#8208;thick media over surfaces of several square centimeters in a few seconds. The designable optical features and intrinsic scalability of these photonic fractal metamaterials provide ample opportunities for applications, bridging across transformation optics, sensing, and light harvesting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Co&#8208;Construction of Sulfur Vacancies and Heterojunctions in Tungsten Disulfide to Induce Fast Electronic/Ionic Diffusion Kinetics for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A new&#8208;type W2&#8722;x/ZnS@C composite with special sulfide vacancies and heterostructures is successfully synthesized using a facile one&#8208;step metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;engaged method, which shows excellent electrochemical performances when applied in sodium ion batteries. The rich sulfur vacancies and WS2/ZnS heterojunctions can significantly improve the ion&#8208; and electron&#8208;diffusion kinetics. In addition, a homogeneous carbon protective layer around the surface of the composite guarantees an outstanding structural stability.








Abstract
Engineering novel electrode materials with unique architectures has a significant impact on tuning the structural/electrochemical properties for boosting the performance of secondary battery systems. Herein, starting from well&#8208;organized WS2 nanorods, an ingenious design of a one&#8208;step method is proposed to prepare a bimetallic sulfide composite with a coaxial carbon coating layer, simply enabled by ZIF&#8208;8 introduction. Rich sulfur vacancies and WS2/ZnS heterojunctions can be simultaneously developed, that significantly improve ionic and electronic diffusion kinetics. In addition, a homogeneous carbon protective layer around the surface of the composite guarantees an outstanding structural stability, a reversible capacity of 170.8 mAh g&#8722;1 after 5000 cycles at a high rate of 5 A g&#8722;1. A great potential in practical application is also exhibited, where a full cell based on the WS2&#8722;x/ZnS@C anode and the P2&#8208;Na2/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode can maintain a reversible capacity of 89.4 mAh g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. Moreover, the underlying electrochemical Na storage mechanisms are illustrated in detail by theoretical calculations, electrochemical kinetic analysis, and operando X&#8208;ray diffraction characterization.

      <title>Activating Macrophage&#8208;Mediated Cancer Immunotherapy by Genetically Edited Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel genetically edited nanoparticle is developed to trigger macrophage&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity through a powerful two&#8208;step strategy: blocking the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; pathway in the first step followed by repolarizing tumor&#8208;associated macrophages in the second. This work offers a simple, safe, and effective strategy in activating the body's immune responses for cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Immunomodulation of macrophages against cancer has emerged as an encouraging therapeutic strategy. However, there exist two major challenges in effectively activating macrophages for antitumor immunotherapy. First, ligation of signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRP&#945;) on macrophages to CD47, a &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal on cancer cells, prevents macrophage phagocytosis of cancer cells. Second, colony stimulating factors, secreted by cancer cells, polarize tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) to a tumorigenic M2 phenotype. Here, it is reported that genetically engineered cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated magnetic nanoparticles (gCM&#8208;MNs) can disable both mechanisms. The gCM shell genetically overexpressing SIRP&#945; variants with remarkable affinity efficiently blocks the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; pathway while the MN core promotes M2 TAM repolarization, synergistically triggering potent macrophage immune responses. Moreover, the gCM shell protects the MNs from immune clearance; and in turn, the MN core delivers the gCMs into tumor tissues under magnetic navigation, effectively promoting their systemic circulation and tumor accumulation. In melanoma and breast cancer models, it is shown that gCM&#8208;MNs significantly prolong overall mouse survival by controlling both local tumor growth and distant tumor metastasis. The combination of cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coating nanotechnology and genetic editing technique offers a safe and robust strategy in activating the body's immune responses for cancer immunotherapy.

      <title>Color&#8208;Tunable, Excitation&#8208;Dependent, and Time&#8208;Dependent Afterglows from Pure Organic Amorphous Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>
Smart afterglow rainbow: A facile and efficient strategy is developed to achieve colorful persistent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence from blue to orange&#8208;red in purely organic amorphous polymers with outstanding film&#8208;forming ability. Moreover, excitation&#8208;dependent and time&#8208;dependent afterglows under ambient conditions are accessed owing to the formation of diversified clustered chromophores.

Abstract
Achieving persistent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (p&#8208;RTP), particularly those of tunable full&#8208;colors, from pure organic amorphous polymers is attractive but challenging. Particularly, those with tunable multicolor p&#8208;RTP in response to excitation wavelength and time are highly important but both fundamentally and technically underexplored. Here, a facile and general strategy toward color&#8208;tunable p&#8208;RTP from blue to orange&#8208;red based on amidation grafting of luminophores onto sodium alginate (SA) chains, resulting in amorphous polymers with distinct p&#8208;RTP and even impressively excitation&#8208;dependent and time&#8208;dependent afterglows is reported. p&#8208;RTP is associated with the unique semi&#8208;rigidified SA chains, effective hydrogen bonding network, and oxygen barrier properties of SA, whereas excitation&#8208;dependent and time&#8208;dependent afterglows should stem from the formation of diversified p&#8208;RTP emissive species with comparable but different lifetimes. These results outline a rational strategy toward amorphous smart luminophores with colorful, excitation&#8208;dependent, and time&#8208;dependent p&#8208;RTP, excellent solution processability, and film&#8208;forming ability for versatile applications.

Abstract
Colloidal crystals have emerged as promising candidates for building optical microdevices. Techniques now exist for synthesizing them with control over their nanoscale features (e.g., particle compositions, sizes, shapes, and lattice parameters and symmetry); however, the ability to tune macroscale structural features, such as the relative positions of crystals to one another and lattice orientations, has yet to be realized. Here, inspiration is drawn from epitaxial growth strategies in atomic crystallization, and patterned substrates are prepared that, when used in conjunction with DNA&#8208;mediated nanoparticle crystallization, allow for control over individual Wulff&#8208;shaped crystal growth, location, and orientation. In addition, the approach allows exquisite control over the patterned substrate/crystal lattice mismatch, something not yet realized for any epitaxy process. This level of structural control is a significant step toward realizing complex, integrated devices with colloidal crystal components, and this approach provides a model system for further exploration in epitaxy systems.

      <title>Revealing Electrical&#8208;Poling&#8208;Induced Polarization Potential in Hybrid Perovskite Photodetectors</title>
      <dc:description>
The photocurrent in a hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite photodetector is modulated via the electrical&#8208;poling&#8208;promoted ion migration within perovskite crystals and, in turn, the polarization potential. The electrical poling yields a tenfold increase in the photocurrent and a twofold decrease in response time in the perovskite photodetector.








Abstract
Despite recent rapid advances in metal halide perovskites for use in optoelectronics, the fundamental understanding of the electrical&#8208;poling&#8208;induced ion migration, accounting for many unusual attributes and thus performance in perovskite&#8208;based devices, remain comparatively elusive. Herein, the electrical&#8208;poling&#8208;promoted polarization potential is reported for rendering hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite photodetectors with high photocurrent and fast response time, displaying a tenfold enhancement in the photocurrent and a twofold decrease in the response time after an external electric field poling. First, a robust meniscus&#8208;assisted solution&#8208;printing strategy is employed to facilitate the oriented perovskite crystals over a large area. Subsequently, the electrical poling invokes the ion migration within perovskite crystals, thus inducing a polarization potential, as substantiated by the surface potential change assessed by Kelvin probe force microscopy.

&lt;p&gt;The photocurrent in a hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite photodetector is modulated via the electrical&#8208;poling&#8208;promoted ion migration within perovskite crystals and, in turn, the polarization potential. The electrical poling yields a tenfold increase in the photocurrent and a twofold decrease in response time in the perovskite photodetector.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite recent rapid advances in metal halide perovskites for use in optoelectronics, the fundamental understanding of the electrical&#8208;poling&#8208;induced ion migration, accounting for many unusual attributes and thus performance in perovskite&#8208;based devices, remain comparatively elusive. Herein, the electrical&#8208;poling&#8208;promoted polarization potential is reported for rendering hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite photodetectors with high photocurrent and fast response time, displaying a tenfold enhancement in the photocurrent and a twofold decrease in the response time after an external electric field poling. First, a robust meniscus&#8208;assisted solution&#8208;printing strategy is employed to facilitate the oriented perovskite crystals over a large area. Subsequently, the electrical poling invokes the ion migration within perovskite crystals, thus inducing a polarization potential, as substantiated by the surface potential change assessed by Kelvin probe force microscopy. Such electrical&#8208;poling&#8208;induced polarization potential is responsible for the markedly enhanced photocurrent and largely shortened response time. This work presents new insights into the electrical&#8208;poling&#8208;triggered ion migration and, in turn, polarization potential as well as into the implication of the latter for optoelectronic devices with greater performance. As such, the utilization of ion&#8208;migration&#8208;produced polarization potential may represent an important endeavor toward a wide range of high&#8208;performance perovskite&#8208;based photodetectors, solar cells, transistors, scintillators, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>
Imperceptible soft robotics have great potential to assist humans, and a great enhancement in robotics engineering is expected from the optical transparency of both actuators and sensors, along with camouflage skins. This soft robotic system will potentially enable great advancements in undercover military robots and assistive devices through the development of manufacturing and materials, and understanding the mechanics and working mechanisms and principles.








Abstract
The advent of soft robotics has led to great advancements in robots, wearables, and even manufacturing processes by employing entirely soft&#8208;bodied systems that interact safely with any random surfaces while providing great mechanical compliance. Moreover, recent developments in soft robotics involve advances in transparent soft actuators and sensors that have made it possible to construct robots that can function in a visually and mechanically unobstructed manner, assisting the operations of robots and creating more applications in various fields. In this aspect, imperceptible soft robotics that mainly consist of optically transparent imperceptible hardware components is expected to constitute a new research focus in the forthcoming era of soft robotics. Here, the recent progress regarding extended imperceptible soft robotics is provided, including imperceptible transparent soft robotics (transparent soft actuators/sensors) and imperceptible nontransparent camouflage skins. Their principles, materials selections, and working mechanisms are discussed so that key challenges and perspectives in imperceptible soft robotic systems can be explored.

Abstract
A family of recently developed devices, hydrogel ionotronics, uses hydrogels as ionic conductors, and uses hydrophobic elastomers as dielectrics.

In doing so, a hydrophobic surface is primed to let a hydrophilic precursor wet it, and then polymers of different layers are interlinked with covalent bonds. As a representative example, an ionotronic luminescent fiber that can be lengthened to &#8776;2.5 times its original length and keeps functioning after 10&#160;000 cycles of stretching is fabricated.

      <title>The Importance of Quantifying the Composition of the Amorphous Intermixed Phase in Organic Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
The precise composition of the intermixed phase in bulk heterojunction structures with device&#8208;relevant size is determined via the analysis of the glass transition temperatures proven by fast scanning calorimetry. A relatively small fraction (&lt;15 wt%) of an acceptor in the intermixed amorphous phase leads already to efficient charge generation. However, charge transport can only be sustained in blend morphologies with a significant amount of the acceptor in the intermixed phase (in this case: &#8776;58 wt%).








Abstract
The relation of phase morphology and solid&#8208;state microstructure with organic photovoltaic (OPV) device performance has intensely been investigated over the last twenty years. While it has been established that a combination of donor:acceptor intermixing and presence of relatively phase&#8208;pure donor and acceptor domains is needed to get an optimum compromise between charge generation and charge transport/charge extraction, a quantitative picture of how much intermixing is needed is still lacking. This is mainly due to the difficulty in quantitatively analyzing the intermixed phase, which generally is amorphous. Here, fast scanning calorimetry, which allows measurement of device&#8208;relevant thin films (&lt;200 nm thickness), is exploited to deduce the precise composition of the intermixed phase in bulk&#8208;heterojunction structures. The power of fast scanning calorimetry is illustrated by considering two polymer:fullerene model systems. Somewhat surprisingly, it is found that a relatively small fraction (&lt;15 wt%) of an acceptor in the intermixed amorphous phase leads to efficient charge generation. In contrast, charge transport can only be sustained in blends with a significant amount of the acceptor in the intermixed phase (in this case: &#8776;58 wt%). This example shows that fast scanning calorimetry is an important tool for establishing a complete compositional characterization of organic bulk heterojunctions. Hence, it will be critical in advancing quantitative morphology&#8211;function models that allow for the rational design of these devices, and in delivering insights in, for example, solar cell degradation mechanisms via phase separation, especially for more complex high&#8208;performing systems such as nonfullerene acceptor:polymer bulk heterojunctions.

Abstract
3D ABX3 organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) semiconductors like [CH3NH3]PbI3 have received great attention because of their various properties for wide applications. However, although a number of low&#8208;dimensional lead&#8208;based OIHP ferroelectric semiconductors have been documented, obtaining 3D ABX3 OIHP ferroelectric semiconductors is challenging. Herein, an A&#8208;site cation [CH3PH3]+ (methylphosphonium, MP) is employed to successfully obtain a lead&#8208;free 3D ABX3 OIHP ferroelectric semiconductor MPSnBr3, which shows clear above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity and a direct bandgap of 2.62&#160;eV. It is emphasized that MPSnBr3 is a multiaxial molecular ferroelectric with the number of ferroelectric polar axes being as many as 12, which is far more than those of the other OIHP ferroelectric semiconductors and even the classical inorganic perovskite ferroelectric semiconductors BiFeO3 (4 polar axes) and BaTiO3 (3 polar axes). MPSnBr3 is the first MP&#8208;based 3D ABX3 OIHP ferroelectric semiconductor. This finding throws light on the exploration of other excellent 3D ABX3 OIHP ferroelectric semiconductors with great application prospects.

      <title>Breakdown of the Small&#8208;Polaron Hopping Model in Higher&#8208;Order Spinels</title>
      <dc:description>
The small&#8208;polaron hopping model was developed six decades ago to rationalize electronic charge transport in oxides. The limitations of the old model are highlighted in this work and a new model that includes percolation, cross&#8208;hopping, and polaron distribution parameters in the nearest&#8208;neighbor hopping equation is presented. The new accurate model opens new avenues for designing high&#8208;performance devices such as batteries and supercapacitors.








Abstract
The small&#8208;polaron hopping model has been used for six decades to rationalize electronic charge transport in oxides. The model was developed for binary oxides, and, despite its significance, its accuracy has not been rigorously tested for higher&#8208;order oxides. Here, the small&#8208;polaron transport model is tested by using a spinel system with mixed cation oxidation states (MnxFe3&#8722;xO4). Using molecular&#8208;beam epitaxy (MBE), a series of single crystal MnxFe3&#8722;xO4 thin films with controlled stoichiometry, 0 &#8804; x&#160;&#8804; 2.3, and lattice strain are grown, and the cation site&#8208;occupation is determined through X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy (XES). Density functional theory + U analysis shows that charge transport occurs only between like&#8208;cations (Fe/Fe or Mn/Mn). The site&#8208;occupation data and percolation models show that there are limited stoichiometric ranges for transport along Fe and Mn pathways. Furthermore, due to asymmetric hopping barriers and formation energies, the MnOh2+ polaron is energetically preferred to the FeOh2+ polaron, resulting in an asymmetric contribution of Mn/Mn pathways. All of these findings are not contained in the conventional small&#8208;polaron hopping model, highlighting its inadequacy. To correct the model, new parameters in the nearest&#8208;neighbor hopping equation are introduced to account for percolation, cross&#8208;hopping, and polaron&#8208;distribution, and it is found that a near&#8208;perfect correlation can be made between experiment and theory for the electronic conductivity.

     alt="Breakdown of the Small&#8208;Polaron Hopping Model in Higher&#8208;Order Spinels"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small&#8208;polaron hopping model was developed six decades ago to rationalize electronic charge transport in oxides. The limitations of the old model are highlighted in this work and a new model that includes percolation, cross&#8208;hopping, and polaron distribution parameters in the nearest&#8208;neighbor hopping equation is presented. The new accurate model opens new avenues for designing high&#8208;performance devices such as batteries and supercapacitors.


&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small&#8208;polaron hopping model has been used for six decades to rationalize electronic charge transport in oxides. The model was developed for binary oxides, and, despite its significance, its accuracy has not been rigorously tested for higher&#8208;order oxides. Here, the small&#8208;polaron transport model is tested by using a spinel system with mixed cation oxidation states (Mn&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Using molecular&#8208;beam epitaxy (MBE), a series of single crystal Mn&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; thin films with controlled stoichiometry, 0 &#8804; &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8804; 2.3, and lattice strain are grown, and the cation site&#8208;occupation is determined through X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy (XES). Density functional theory + &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt; analysis shows that charge transport occurs only between like&#8208;cations (Fe/Fe or Mn/Mn). The site&#8208;occupation data and percolation models show that there are limited stoichiometric ranges for transport along Fe and Mn pathways. Furthermore, due to asymmetric hopping barriers and formation energies, the MnOh2+ polaron is energetically preferred to the FeOh2+ polaron, resulting in an asymmetric contribution of Mn/Mn pathways. All of these findings are not contained in the conventional small&#8208;polaron hopping model, highlighting its inadequacy. To correct the model, new parameters in the nearest&#8208;neighbor hopping equation are introduced to account for percolation, cross&#8208;hopping, and polaron&#8208;distribution, and it is found that a near&#8208;perfect correlation can be made between experiment and theory for the electronic conductivity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Numerical Simulations and In Situ Optical Microscopy Connecting Flow Pattern, Crystallization, and Thin&#8208;Film Properties for Organic Transistors with Superior Device&#8208;to&#8208;Device Uniformity</title>
      <dc:description>
A comprehensive analytical system that can manipulate and track low patterns along its entire path is utilized, elucidating the correlation between flow pattern, crystallization process, and thin&#8208;film properties. Under the chaotic advection, unprecedented device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformity with the coefficient of variation (CV) in mobility of 7.3% with high average mobility of 2.04 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 in doped TIPS&#8208;pentacene is achieved.








Abstract
Currently, due to the lack of precise control of flow behavior and the understanding of how it influences thin&#8208;film crystallization, strict tuning of thin&#8208;film properties during solution&#8208;based coating is difficult. In this work, a continuous&#8208;flow microfluidic&#8208;channel&#8208;based meniscus&#8208;guided coating (CoMiC) is introduced, which is a system that enables manipulation of flow patterns and analysis connecting flow pattern, crystallization, and thin&#8208;film properties. Continuous supply of a solution of an organic semiconductor with various flow patterns is generated using microfluidic channels. 3D numerical simulations and in situ microscopy allow the tracking of the flow pattern along its entire path (from within the microfluidic channel to near the liquid&#8211;solid boundary), and enable direct observation of thin&#8208;film crystallization process. In particular, the generation of chaotic flow results in unprecedented device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformity, with coefficient of variation (CV) of 7.3% and average mobility of 2.04 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in doped TIPS&#8208;pentacene. Furthermore, CV and average mobility of 9.6% and 11.4 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 are achieved, respectively, in a small molecule:polymer blend system. CoMiC can serve as a guideline for elucidating the relation between flow behavior, liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition, and device performance, which has thus far been unknown.

      <title>Highly Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs using a TADF Emitter with a Narrow Emission Spectrum and High Horizontal Emitting Dipole Ratio</title>
      <dc:description>
New blue&#8208;emitting thermally activated delayed&#8208;fluorescence (TADF) emitters are designed and synthesized for blue&#8208;emitting organic&#8208;light emitting diodes (OLEDs) by incorporating rigid donor units with an oxygen&#8208;bridged boron acceptor unit. As a result, a deep&#8208;blue OLED with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 29.3% and CIE coordinates of (0.142, 0.090) is realized.








Abstract
New blue (DBA&#8208;SAB) and deep&#8208;blue (TDBA&#8208;SAF) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters are synthesized for blue&#8208;emitting organic&#8208;light emitting diodes (OLEDs) by incorporating spiro&#8208;biacridine and spiro&#8208;acridine fluorene donor units with an oxygen&#8208;bridged boron acceptor unit, respectively. The molecules show blue and deep&#8208;blue emission because of the deep highest occupied molecular energy levels of the donor units. Besides, both emitters exhibit narrow emission spectra with the full&#8208;width at half maximum (FWHM) of less than 65&#160;nm due to the rigid donor and acceptor units. In addition, the long molecular structure along the transition dipole moment direction results in a high horizontal emitting dipole ratio over 80%. By combining the effects, the OLED utilizing DBA&#8208;SAB as the emitter exhibits a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 25.7% and 1931 Commission Internationale de l'&#233;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.144, 0.212). Even a higher efficiency deep blue TADF OLED with a maximum EQE of 28.2% and CIE coordinates of (0.142, 0.090) is realized using TDBA&#8208;SAF as the emitter.

      <title>Distributed Electric Field Induces Orientations of Nanosheets to Prepare Hydrogels with Elaborate Ordered Structures and Programmed Deformations</title>
      <dc:description>
Hydrogels with sophisticated ordered structures at the macroscopic scale are facilely developed by using a distributed electric field to align the nanosheets (NSs), followed by polymerization and gelation. The anisotropic structures of NSs are programmable by tuning the electric field generated by the distributed multiple electrodes with specific arrangements. Upon heating or light irradiation, the composite hydrogels exhibit programmable deformations and locomotion.








Abstract
Living organisms use musculatures with spatially distributed anisotropic structures to actuate deformations and locomotion with fascinating functions. Replicating such structural features in artificial materials is of great significance yet remains a big challenge. Here, a facile strategy is reported to fabricate hydrogels with elaborate ordered structures of nanosheets (NSs) oriented under a distributed electric field. Multiple electrodes are distributed with various arrangements in the precursor solution containing NSs and gold nanoparticles. A complex electric field induces sophisticated orientations of the NSs that are permanently inscribed by subsequent photo&#8208;polymerization. The resultant anisotropic nanocomposite poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hydrogels exhibit rapid deformation upon heating or photoirradiation, owing to the fast switching of permittivity of the media and electric repulsion between the NSs. The complex alignments of NSs and anisotropic shape change of discrete regions result in programmed deformation of the hydrogels into various configurations. Furthermore, locomotion is realized by a spatiotemporal light stimulation that locally triggers time&#8208;variant shape change of the composite hydrogel with complex anisotropic structures. Such a strategy on the basis of the distributed electric&#8208;field&#8208;generated ordered structures should be applicable to gels, elastomers, and thermosets loaded with other anisotropic particles or liquid crystals, for the design of biomimetic/bioinspired materials with specific functionalities.

Abstract
Spiking neural networks (SNNs) sharing large similarity with biological nervous systems are promising to process spatiotemporal information and can provide highly time&#8208; and energy&#8208;efficient computational paradigms for the Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things and edge computing. Nonvolatile electrolyte&#8208;gated transistors (EGTs) provide prominent analog switching performance, the most critical feature of synaptic element, and have been recently demonstrated as a promising synaptic device. However, high performance, large&#8208;scale EGT arrays, and EGT application for spatiotemporal information processing in an SNN are yet to be demonstrated. Here, an oxide&#8208;based EGT employing amorphous Nb2O5 and LixSiO2 is introduced as the channel and electrolyte gate materials, respectively, and integrated into a 32 &#215; 32 EGT array. The engineered EGTs show a quasi&#8208;linear update, good endurance (106) and retention, a high switching speed of 100&#160;ns, ultralow readout conductance (&lt;100 nS), and ultralow areal switching energy density (20 fJ &#181;m&#8722;2). The prominent analog switching performance is leveraged for hardware implementation of an SNN with the capability of spatiotemporal information processing, where spike sequences with different timings are able to be efficiently learned and recognized by the EGT array. Finally, this EGT&#8208;based spatiotemporal information processing is deployed to detect moving orientation in a tactile sensing system. These results provide an insight into oxide&#8208;based EGT devices for energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing to support edge application.

      <title>Exploiting Colloidal Metamaterials for Achieving Unnatural Optical Refractions</title>
      <dc:description>
The colloidal self&#8208;assembly of optical metamaterials has come to the fore along with recent advances in synthetic strategies of colloids, self&#8208;assembly routes for clusters and superlattices, and effective medium theory for analyzing colloidal assemblies. In particular, unnatural optical refractions such as extremely high and negative refractive indices could be available with colloidal self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
The scaling down of meta&#8208;atoms or metamolecules (collectively denoted as metaunits) is a long&#8208;lasting issue from the time when the concept of metamaterials was first suggested. According to the effective medium theory, which is the foundational concept of metamaterials, the structural sizes of meta&#8208;units should be much smaller than the working wavelengths (e.g., &lt;&lt; 1/5 wavelength). At relatively low frequency regimes (e.g., microwave and terahertz), the conventional monolithic lithography can readily address the materialization of metamaterials. However, it is still challenging to fabricate optical metamaterials (metamaterials working at optical frequencies such as the visible and near&#8208;infrared regimes) through the lithographic approaches. This serves as the rationale for using colloidal self&#8208;assembly as a strategy for the realization of optical metamaterials. Colloidal self&#8208;assembly can address various critical issues associated with the materialization of optical metamaterials, such as achieving nanogaps over a large area, increasing true 3D structural complexities, and cost&#8208;effective processing, which all are difficult to attain through monolithic lithography. Nevertheless, colloidal self&#8208;assembly is still a toolset underutilized by optical engineers. Here, the design principle of the colloidally self&#8208;assembled optical metamaterials exhibiting unnatural refractions, the practical challenge of relevant experiments, and the future opportunities are critically reviewed.

      <title>Topological Interlocking and Geometric Stiffening as Complementary Strategies for Strong Plant Shells</title>
      <dc:description>
Seed encapsulation in hard shells is common for protection and dispersal. This study reveals previously unknown functional interrelations between the structure, geometry, and mechanics on multiple length scales in (nut)shells, suggesting that simple geometric modifications, such as the development of puzzle&#8208;shaped instead of round cells, and small spherical shells instead of large ellipsoidal shells, increase their fracture resistance resource&#8208;efficiently.








Abstract
Many organisms encapsulate their embryos in hard, protective shells. While birds and reptiles largely rely on mineralized shells, plants often develop highly robust lignocellulosic shells. Despite the abundance of hard plant shells, particularly nutshells, it remains unclear which fundamental properties drive their mechanical stability. This multiscale analysis of six prominent (nut)shells (pine, pistachio, walnut, pecan, hazelnut, and macadamia) reveals geometric and structural strengthening mechanisms on the cellular and macroscopic length scales. The strongest tissues, found in walnut and pistachio, exploit the topological interlocking of 3D&#8208;puzzle cells and thereby outperform the fiber&#8208;reinforced structure of macadamia under tensile and compressive loading. On the macroscopic scale, strengthening occurs via an increased shell thickness, spherical shape, small size, and a lack of extended sutures. These functional interrelations suggest that simple geometric modifications are a powerful and resource&#8208;efficient strategy for plants to enhance the fracture resistance of entire shells and their tissues. Understanding the interplay between structure, geometry, and mechanics in hard plant shells provides new perspectives on the evolutionary diversification of hard seed coats, as well as insights for nutshell&#8208;based material applications.

      <title>HClO&#8208;Activated Fluorescence and Photosensitization from an AIE Nanoprobe for Image&#8208;Guided Bacterial Ablation in Phagocytes</title>
      <dc:description>
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) nanoprobes with HClO&#8208;activated fluorescence and photosensitization are synthesized for image&#8208;guided bacterial ablation in phagocytes. The fluorescence and photosensitization of the nanoprobes are selectively activated at a bacterial infection site, which facilitates the precise diagnosis and therapy for bacterial infection with no obvious side effects.








Abstract
Bacteria hiding in host phagocytes are difficult to kill, which can cause phagocyte disorders resulting in local and systemic tissue damage. Effective accumulation of activatable photosensitizers (PSs) in phagocytes to realize selective imaging and on&#8208;demand photodynamic ablation of bacteria is of great scientific and practical interests for precise bacteria diagnosis and treatment. Herein, HClO&#8208;activatable theranostic nanoprobes, DTF&#8208;FFP NPs, for image&#8208;guided bacterial ablation in phagocytes are introduced. DTF&#8208;FFP NPs are prepared by nanoprecipitation of an HClO&#8208;responsive near&#8208;infrared molecule FFP and an efficient PS DTF with aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristic using an amphiphilic polymer Pluronic F127 as the encapsulation matrix. As an energy acceptor, FFP can quench both fluorescence and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of DTF, thus eliminating the phototoxicity of DTF&#8208;FFP NPs in normal cells and tissues. Once delivered to the infection sites, DTF&#8208;FFP NPs light up with red fluorescence and efficiently generate ROS owing to the degradation of FFP by the stimulated release of HClO in phagocytes. The selective activation of fluorescence and photosensitization is successfully confirmed by both in vitro and in vivo results, demonstrating the effectiveness and theranostic potential of DTF&#8208;FFP NPs in precise bacterial therapy.

      <title>High&#8208;Pressure Nitrogen&#8208;Extraction and Effective Passivation to Attain Highest Large&#8208;Area Perovskite Solar Module Efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>
A high&#8208;pressure nitrogen&#8208;extraction strategy to drive the formation of a stable intermediate for uniform perovskite crystallization and an effective passivation strategy by utilizing an ionic liquid are reported. As such, the PCEs of a small&#8208;area PSC and a large&#8208;area PSC module are 22.7% and 19.6% respectively, representing a high level made using a large&#8208;area fabrication process.








Abstract
Slot&#8208;die coating holds advantages over other large&#8208;scale technologies thanks to its potential for well&#8208;controlled, high&#8208;throughput, continuous roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll fabrication. Unfortunately, it is challenging to control thin.film uniformity over a large area while maintaining crystallization quality. Herein, by using a high&#8208;pressure nitrogen&#8208;extraction (HPNE) strategy to assist crystallization, a wide processing window in the well&#8208;controlled printing process for preparing high&#8208;quality perovskites is achieved. The yellow&#8208;phase perovskite generated by the HPNE acts as a crucial intermediate phase to produce large&#8208;area high&#8208;quality perovskite film. Furthermore, an ionic liquid is developed to passivate the perovskite surface to reduce surface defect density and to suppress carrier recombination, resulting in significantly increased efficiency to 22.7%, the highest for large&#8208;area fabrication. The strategies are successfully extended to large&#8208;area device fabrication, making it possible to produce a 40&#160;&#215;&#160;40 mm2 module with stabilized PCE as high as 19.4%, the highest&#8208;efficiency for a large&#8208;area module to date.

      <dc:description>
In article number 2003013, Salvador Borros, Metin Sitti, and co&#8208;workers report stealth microrobots that can operate covertly under the immune system's radar. These stealth microrobots, fabricated from custom zwitterionic polymers for 3D microprinting, remain undetected by immune cells after exhaustive inspection, thus avoiding phagocytosis
and immune clearance.

      <title>Multiemission Particle Velocimetry: The Key Role of Intrinsic Lifetime Dynamics from Upconverting Nanosystems in Multiemission Particle Velocimetry (Adv. Mater. 42/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2002266, John A. Capobianco and co&#8208;workers present the novel multiemission particle velocimetry technique, which exploits the upconversion luminescence dynamics in core&#8211;shell nanoparticles engineered with different emitting ions. Their sequential emissions are characterized by a known time interval, resulting in the possibility of accurately measuring the velocity of the nanoprobes flowing through a microcapillary without the need for any calibration.

      <title>Intrinsic Detectivity Limits of Organic Near&#8208;Infrared Photodetectors</title>
      <dc:description>
The specific detectivity of near&#8208;infrared organic photodetectors is found to be limited by non&#8208;radiative recombination, which is also known to be the main contributor to open&#8208;circuit voltage losses. Investigation of the relation between open&#8208;circuit voltage, dark current, and noise current allows the calculation of an intrinsic upper limit of D* as a function of the optical gap.








Abstract
Organic photodetectors (OPDs) with a performance comparable to that of conventional inorganic ones have recently been demonstrated for the visible regime. However, near&#8208;infrared photodetection has proven to be challenging and, to date, the true potential of organic semiconductors in this spectral range (800&#8211;2500&#160;nm) remains largely unexplored. In this work, it is shown that the main factor limiting the specific detectivity (D*) is non&#8208;radiative recombination, which is also known to be the main contributor to open&#8208;circuit voltage losses. The relation between open&#8208;circuit voltage, dark current, and noise current is demonstrated using four bulk&#8208;heterojunction devices based on narrow&#8208;gap donor polymers. Their maximum achievable D* is calculated alongside a large set of devices to demonstrate an intrinsic upper limit of D* as a function of the optical gap. It is concluded that OPDs have the potential to be a useful technology up to 2000&#160;nm, given that high external quantum efficiencies can be maintained at these low photon energies.

Investigation of the relation between open&#8208;circuit voltage, dark current, and noise current allows the calculation of an intrinsic upper limit of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;* as a function of the optical gap.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic photodetectors (OPDs) with a performance comparable to that of conventional inorganic ones have recently been demonstrated for the visible regime. However, near&#8208;infrared photodetection has proven to be challenging and, to date, the true potential of organic semiconductors in this spectral range (800&#8211;2500&#160;nm) remains largely unexplored. In this work, it is shown that the main factor limiting the specific detectivity (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;*) is non&#8208;radiative recombination, which is also known to be the main contributor to open&#8208;circuit voltage losses. The relation between open&#8208;circuit voltage, dark current, and noise current is demonstrated using four bulk&#8208;heterojunction devices based on narrow&#8208;gap donor polymers. Their maximum achievable &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;* is calculated alongside a large set of devices to demonstrate an intrinsic upper limit of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;* as a function of the optical gap. It is concluded that OPDs have the potential to be a useful technology up to 2000&#160;nm, given that high external quantum efficiencies can be maintained at these low photon energies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Freestanding 3D Heterostructure Film Stitched by MOF&#8208;Derived Carbon Nanotube Microsphere Superstructure and Reduced Graphene Oxide Sheets: A Superior Multifunctional Electrode for Overall Water Splitting and Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A freestanding 3D heterostructure film stitched by a metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived carbon nanotube (CNT) microsphere superstructure and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets is synthesized. The high specific surface area, hierarchical pores, controlled dopants, and conductive CNT@rGO heterostructure render the freestanding film as having excellent multifunctional activity and superior stability toward the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Developing a scalable approach to construct efficient and multifunctional electrodes for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an urgent need for overall water splitting and zinc&#8211;air batteries. In this work, a freestanding 3D heterostructure film is synthesized from a Ni&#8208;centered metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF)/graphene oxide. During the pyrolysis process, 1D carbon nanotubes formed from the MOF link with the 2D reduced graphene oxide sheets to stitch the 3D freestanding film. The results of the experiments and theoretical calculations show that the synergistic effect of the N&#8208;doped carbon shell and Ni nanoparticles leads to an optimized film with excellent electrocatalytic activity. Low overpotentials of 95 and 260&#160;mV are merely needed for HER and OER, respectively, to reach a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In addition, a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.875&#160;V is obtained for the ORR, which is comparable to that of Pt/RuO2 and ranks among the top of non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal catalysts. The use of an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; film as the electrode leads to excellent performance of the homemade water electrolyzer and zinc&#8211;air battery, indicating the potential of the film for practical applications.

      <title>Magneto&#8208;Driven Gradients of Diamagnetic Objects for Engineering Complex Tissues</title>
      <dc:description>
A versatile and predictable magnetics&#8208;based approach is developed and implemented to pattern a range of diamagnetic objects, including living cells, in 3D crosslinkable solutions without magnetically tagging the objects. This approach is applied to engineer complex tissues that mimic the native depth&#8208;dependent cellularity of articular cartilage. This work provides a foundation for engineers to create opposing gradients in continuous materials.








Abstract
Engineering complex tissues represents an extraordinary challenge and, to date, there have been few strategies developed that can easily recapitulate native&#8208;like cell and biofactor gradients in 3D materials. This is true despite the fact that mimicry of these gradients may be essential for the functionality of engineered graft tissues. Here, a non&#8208;traditional magnetics&#8208;based approach is developed to predictably position naturally diamagnetic objects in 3D hydrogels. Rather than magnetizing the objects within the hydrogel, the magnetic susceptibility of the surrounding hydrogel precursor solution is enhanced. In this way, a range of diamagnetic objects (e.g., polystyrene beads, drug delivery microcapsules, and living cells) are patterned in response to a brief exposure to a magnetic field. Upon photo&#8208;crosslinking the hydrogel precursor, object positioning is maintained, and the magnetic contrast agent diffuses out of the hydrogel, supporting long&#8208;term construct viability. This approach is applied to engineer cartilage constructs with a depth&#8208;dependent cellularity mirroring that of native tissue. These are thought to be the first results showing that magnetically unaltered cells can be magneto&#8208;patterned in hydrogels and cultured to generate heterogeneous tissues. This work provides a foundation for the formation of opposing magnetic&#8208;susceptibility&#8208;based gradients within a single continuous material.

      <title>Shape Programming by Modulating Actuation over Hierarchical Length Scales</title>
      <dc:description>
Many active materials used in shape&#8208;morphing respond to an external stimulus by stretching or contracting along a director field. Texturing this field in zigzag patterns is shown to provide an extended family of biaxial active stretches, opening a larger parameter space for shape control. This general notion of texturing over hierarchical length scales can be applied to any anisotropically responsive material.








Abstract
Many active materials used in shape&#8208;morphing respond to an external stimulus by stretching or contracting along a director field. The programming of such actuators remains complex because of the single degree of freedom (the orientation) in local actuation. Here, texturing this field in zigzag patterns is shown to provide an extended family of biaxial active stretches out of an otherwise single uniaxial active deformation, opening a larger parameter space. By further modulating the zigzag patterns at the larger scale of the structure, its deployed shape can be controlled. This notion of texturing over hierarchical length scales follows geometrical principles, and is robust against changes in size and materials. The robustness of the approach is demonstrated by considering three different responsive materials: inextensible flat fabrics, channel&#8208;bearing elastomer (respectively, contracting and expanding perpendicularly to the director field when actuated pneumatically), and 3D&#8208;printed thermoplastic (composed of extruded filaments that contract when heated). It is shown that large&#8208;scale shape&#8208;morphing structures can be generated and that their geometry can be controlled with high&#160;accuracy.

      <title>Prediction of Chronic Inflammation for Inhaled Particles: the Impact of Material Cycling and Quarantining in the Lung Epithelium</title>
      <dc:description>
The prediction of material&#8208;associated diseases is currently hindered by the lack of understanding of underlying mechanisms. Counteracting of nanomaterial quarantining and nanomaterial cycling are identified as the main modes of cellular response in a living nanomaterial&#8208;exposed lung epithelium. This enables animal&#8208;free prediction of material&#8208;induced chronic inflammation using only in vitro measurements and in silico modeling.








Abstract
On a daily basis, people are exposed to a multitude of health&#8208;hazardous airborne particulate matter with notable deposition in the fragile alveolar region of the lungs. Hence, there is a great need for identification and prediction of material&#8208;associated diseases, currently hindered due to the lack of in&#8208;depth understanding of causal relationships, in particular between acute exposures and chronic symptoms. By applying advanced microscopies and omics to in vitro and in vivo systems, together with in silico molecular modeling, it is determined herein that the long&#8208;lasting response to a single exposure can originate from the interplay between the newly discovered nanomaterial quarantining and nanomaterial cycling between different lung cell types. This new insight finally allows prediction of the spectrum of lung inflammation associated with materials of interest using only in vitro measurements and in silico modeling, potentially relating outcomes to material properties for a large number of materials, and thus boosting safe&#8208;by&#8208;design&#8208;based material development. Because of its profound implications for animal&#8208;free predictive toxicology, this work paves the way to a more efficient and hazard&#8208;free introduction of numerous new advanced materials into our lives.

      <title>Nanopore Confinement of Electrocatalysts Optimizing Triple Transport for an Ultrahigh&#8208;Power&#8208;Density Zinc&#8211;Air Fuel Cell with Robust Stability</title>
      <dc:description>
An ultrahigh&#8208;power&#8208;density zinc&#8211;air fuel cell with robust stability is developed with triple transport optimization. The 5&#160;nm nanopores behave synergistically with the optimization of electron conduction, oxygen gas diffusion, and ion transport for electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;air fuel cells with high energy density, eco&#8208;friendliness, and low cost bring significantly high security to future power systems. However, the impending challenges of low power density and high&#8208;current&#8208;density stability limit their widespread applications. In this study, an ultrahigh&#8208;power&#8208;density Zn&#8211;air fuel cell with robust stability is highlighted. Benefiting from the water&#8208;resistance effect of the confined nanopores, the highly active cobalt cluster electrocatalysts reside in specific nanopores and possess stable triple&#8208;phase reaction areas, leading to the synergistic optimization of electron conduction, oxygen gas diffusion, and ion transport for electrocatalysis. As a result, the as&#8208;established Zn&#8211;air fuel cell shows the best stability under high&#8208;current&#8208;density discharging (&gt;90 h at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and superior power density (peak power density: &gt;300&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, specific power: 500 Wgcat&#8722;1) compared to most reported non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal electrocatalysts. The findings will provide new insights in the rational design of electrocatalysts for advanced metal&#8211;air fuel cell systems.

      <title>Helix Inversion Controlled by Molecular Motors in Multistate Liquid Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>
A series of light&#8208;driven molecular motors are used to achieve advanced control over chirality in liquid crystals. The dynamic features of these motors are faithfully reproduced at the macroscopic level, into addressable structural colors that can find applications in tunable optics and photonics.








Abstract
Unravelling the rules of molecular motion is a contemporary challenge that promises to support the development of responsive materials and is likely to enhance the understanding of functional motion. Advances in integrating light&#8208;driven molecular motors in soft matter have led to the design and realization of chiral nematic (cholesteric) liquid crystals that can respond to light with modification of their helical pitch, and also with helix inversion. Under illumination, these chiral liquid crystals convert from one helical geometry to another. Here, a series of light&#8208;driven molecular motors that feature a rich configurational landscape is presented, specifically which involves three stable chiral states. The succession of chiral structures involved in the motor cycle is transmitted at higher structural levels, as the cholesteric liquid crystals that are formed can interconvert between helices of opposite handedness, reversibly. In these materials, the dynamic features of the motors are thus expressed at the near&#8208;macroscopic, functional level, into addressable colors that can be used in advanced materials for tunable optics and photonics.

      <title>Recent Advances in Nanomaterial&#8208;Assisted Combinational Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is becoming a rising star on the horizon of nanomedicine and has received ever&#8208;increasing attention in recent years. In particular, SDT&#8208;involved combination therapy opens up new therapeutic possibilities and is developing into an exciting tide.

Abstract
Ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered sonodynamic therapy (SDT), as a promising noninvasive therapeutic modality, has received ever&#8208;increasing attention in recent years. Its specialized chemical agents, named sonosensitizers, are activated by low&#8208;intensity US to produce lethal reactive oxygen species (ROS) for oncotherapy. Compared with phototherapeutic strategies, SDT provides many noteworthy opportunities and benefits, such as deeper penetration depth, absence of phototoxicity, and fewer side effects. Nevertheless, previous studies have also demonstrated its intrinsic limitations. Thanks to the facile engineering nature of nanotechnology, numerous novel nanoplatforms are being applied in this emerging field to tackle these intrinsic barriers and achieve continuous innovations. In particular, the combination of SDT with other treatment strategies has demonstrated a superior efficacy in improving anticancer activity relative to that of monotherapies alone. Therefore, it is necessary to summarize the nanomaterial&#8208;assisted combinational sonodynamic cancer therapy applications. Herein, the design principles in achieving synergistic therapeutic effects based on nanomaterial engineering methods are highlighted. The ultimate goals are to stimulate the design of better&#8208;quality combined sonodynamic treatment schemes and provide innovative ideas for the perspectives of SDT in promoting its future transformation to clinical application.

      <title>Angular&#8208;Independent Photonic Pigments via the Controlled Micellization of Amphiphilic Bottlebrush Block Copolymers</title>
      <dc:description>
Photonic microparticles are produced in a single, scalable step from an amphiphilic, low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight bottlebrush block copolymer. By controlling the formation, swelling, and subsequent self&#8208;assembly of giant reverse micelles within an emulsified toluene&#8208;in&#8208;water droplet, a highly porous structure with short&#8208;range correlation is produced. This isotropic inverse photonic architecture allows for a full spectrum of angular&#8208;independent, structurally colored pigments.








Abstract
Photonic materials with angular&#8208;independent structural color are highly desirable because they offer the broad viewing angles required for application as colorants in paints, cosmetics, textiles, or displays. However, they are challenging to fabricate as they require isotropic nanoscale architectures with only short&#8208;range correlation. Here, porous microparticles with such a structure are produced in a single, scalable step from an amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymer. This is achieved by exploiting a novel &#8220;controlled micellization&#8221; self&#8208;assembly mechanism within an emulsified toluene&#8208;in&#8208;water droplet. By restricting water permeation through the droplet interface, the size of the pores can be precisely addressed, resulting in structurally colored pigments. Furthermore, the reflected color can be tuned to reflect across the full visible spectrum using only a single polymer (Mn&#160;= 290&#160;kDa) by altering the initial emulsification conditions. Such &#8220;photonic pigments&#8221; have several key advantages over their crystalline analogues, as they provide isotropic structural coloration that suppresses iridescence and improves color purity without the need for either refractive index matching or the inclusion of a broadband absorber.

      <title>Different Modes of Deformation of Soft Triangular Honeycombs at the Sub&#8208;5&#160;nm Scale</title>
      <dc:description>
Control of liquid crystalline honeycombs with triangular prismatic cells on the &lt;5&#160;nm scale, having either regular, acute, and obtuse cross&#8208;sectional shapes, is achieved by strategic positioning of fluorines at the &#960;&#8208;conjugated core of X&#8208;shaped bolapolyphiles as a result of the emerging tilt of some molecules.








Abstract
Patterning on the sub&#8208;5&#160;nm length scale is a contemporary challenge for further miniaturization of microelectronic circuits. Here, the first soft self&#8208;assembled triangular patterns are reported showing transitions between regular and two different kinds of isosceles (acute and obtuse angled) triangles on this length scale, formed by liquid crystalline honeycombs of polyphilic block molecules involving a fluorinated oligo(para&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) core. The type of formed triangular pattern depends on the degree and position of fluorination and on temperature. They are the first soft honeycombs combining tilted and nontilted organizations in a uniform nanostructure, where the tilted molecules in only one or two sides of the triangular prismatic cells dominate the shape and the size of the morphology.

      <title>A Novel Heterostructure Based on RuMo Nanoalloys and N&#8208;doped Carbon as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel heterostructure based on uniform RuMo nanoalloys and hexagonal N&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets is prepared through a combination of hard template and anion&#8208;exchange methods. The obtained material exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Theoretical calculation confirms that the heterosurfaces play a crucial role in accelerating the hydrogen evolution activity.








Abstract
Heterostructures exhibit considerable potential in the field of energy conversion due to their excellent interfacial charge states in tuning the electronic properties of different components to promote catalytic activity. However, the rational preparation of heterostructures with highly active heterosurfaces remains a challenge because of the difficulty in component tuning, morphology control, and active site determination. Herein, a novel heterostructure based on a combination of RuMo nanoalloys and hexagonal N&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets is designed and synthesized. In this protocol, metal&#8208;containing anions and layered double hydroxides are employed to control the components and morphology of heterostructures, respectively. Accordingly, the as&#8208;made RuMo&#8208;nanoalloys&#8208;embedded hexagonal porous carbon nanosheets are promising for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), resulting in an extremely small overpotential (18 mV), an ultralow Tafel slope (25 mV dec&#8722;1), and a high turnover frequency (3.57 H2 s&#8722;1) in alkaline media, outperforming current Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts. First&#8208;principle calculations based on typical 2D N&#8208;doped carbon/RuMo nanoalloys heterostructures demonstrate that introducing N and Mo atoms into C and Ru lattices, respectively, triggers electron accumulation/depletion regions at the heterosurface and consequently reduces the energy barrier for the HER. This work presents a convenient method for rational fabrication of carbon&#8211;metal heterostructures for highly efficient electrocatalysis.

     alt="A Novel Heterostructure Based on RuMo Nanoalloys and N&#8208;doped Carbon as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel heterostructure based on uniform RuMo nanoalloys and hexagonal N&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets is prepared through a combination of hard template and anion&#8208;exchange methods. The obtained material exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Theoretical calculation confirms that the heterosurfaces play a crucial role in accelerating the hydrogen evolution activity.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heterostructures exhibit considerable potential in the field of energy conversion due to their excellent interfacial charge states in tuning the electronic properties of different components to promote catalytic activity. However, the rational preparation of heterostructures with highly active heterosurfaces remains a challenge because of the difficulty in component tuning, morphology control, and active site determination. Herein, a novel heterostructure based on a combination of RuMo nanoalloys and hexagonal N&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets is designed and synthesized. In this protocol, metal&#8208;containing anions and layered double hydroxides are employed to control the components and morphology of heterostructures, respectively. Accordingly, the as&#8208;made RuMo&#8208;nanoalloys&#8208;embedded hexagonal porous carbon nanosheets are promising for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), resulting in an extremely small overpotential (18 mV), an ultralow Tafel slope (25 mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and a high turnover frequency (3.57 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) in alkaline media, outperforming current Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts. First&#8208;principle calculations based on typical 2D N&#8208;doped carbon/RuMo nanoalloys heterostructures demonstrate that introducing N and Mo atoms into C and Ru lattices, respectively, triggers electron accumulation/depletion regions at the heterosurface and consequently reduces the energy barrier for the HER. This work presents a convenient method for rational fabrication of carbon&#8211;metal heterostructures for highly efficient electrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Intra&#8208;Nanogap Au Plasmonic Nanostructures for Bioanalytical Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Various synthetic strategies are investigated to prepare Au nanoparticles with narrow intra&#8208;nanogap structures in solution. A variety of 3D core&#8211;shell structures with intra&#8208;nanogap are synthesized. The greatly enhanced Raman signal intensity, uniform responses, small size, and high photostability of the nanostructures enable to overcome the issues in the previous Raman&#8208;based bioanalytical applications.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanogap&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering has attracted considerable attention in the fields of Raman&#8208;based bioanalytical applications and materials science. Various strategies have been proposed to prepare nanostructures with an inter&#8208; or intra&#8208;nanogap for fundamental study models or applications. This report focuses on recent advances in synthetic methods to fabricate intra&#8208;nanogap structures with diverse dimensions, with detailed focus on the theory and bioanalytical applications. Synthetic strategies ranging from the use of a silica layer to small molecules, the use of polymers and galvanic replacement, are extensively investigated. Furthermore, various core structures, such as spherical, rod&#8208;, and cube&#8208;shaped, are widely studied, and greatly expand the diversity of plasmonic nanostructures with an intra&#8208;nanogap. Theoretical calculations, ranging from the first plasmonic hybridization model that is applied to a concentric Au&#8211;SiO2&#8211;Au nanosphere to the modern quantum corrected model, have evolved to accurately describe the plasmonic resonance property in concentric core&#8211;shell nanostructures with a subnanometer nanogap. The greatly enhanced and uniform Raman responses from the localized Raman reporter in the built&#8208;in nanogap have made it possible to achieve promising probes with an extraordinary high sensitivity in various formats, such as biomolecule detection, high&#8208;resolution cell imaging, and an in vivo imaging application.

      <title>A Habituation Sensory Nervous System with Memristors</title>
      <dc:description>
A sensory nervous system with habituation characteristics is fundamental for organisms to adapt to the external environment. A memristor&#8208;based habituation sensory nervous system is developed and demonstrated for robot navigation. The results demonstrate that a direct emulation of the biologically inspired learning process by memristors can be a sound choice for neuromorphic hardware implementation.








Abstract
The sensory nervous system (SNS) builds up the association between external stimuli and the response of organisms. In this system, habituation is a fundamental characteristic that filters out irrelevantly repetitive information and makes the SNS adapt to the external environment. To emulate this critical process in electronic devices, a LixSiOy&#8208;based memristor (TiN/LixSiOy/Pt) is developed where the temporal response under repetitive stimulation is similar to that of habituation. By connecting this synaptic device to a leaky integrate&#8208;and&#8208;fire neuron based on a Ag/SiO2:Ag/Au memristor, a fully memristive SNS with habituation is experimentally demonstrated. Finally, a habituation spiking neural network based on the SNS is built and its application in obstacle avoidance for robot navigation is successfully presented. The results provide that a direct emulation of the biologically inspired learning process by memristors could be a sound choice for neuromorphic hardware implementation.

      <title>Superwetting Shape Memory Microstructure: Smart Wetting Control and Practical Application</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent developments in the smart control of wettability on superwetting shape memory microstructures and corresponding applications are summarized. Research results demonstrate that the shape memory ability of a shape memory polymer can provide an excellent controllability in surface microstructure and wetting performance; meanwhile, some new functions can also be realized.








Abstract
Smart control of wettability on superwetting surfaces has aroused much attention in the past few years. Compared with traditional strategies such as adjusting the surface chemistry, regulating the surface microstructure is more difficult, though it can bring lots of new functions. Recently, it was found that, based on the shape memory effect of a shape memory polymer, the surface microstructure can be controlled more easily and precisely. Here, recent developments in the smart control of wettability on superwetting shape memory microstructures and corresponding applications are summarized. The primary concern is the superhydrophobic surfaces that have demonstrated numerous attractive functions, including controllable droplet storage, transportation, bouncing, capture/release, and reprogrammable gradient wetting, under variation of the surface microstructure. Finally, some achievements in wetting control on other superwetting surfaces (such as superomniphobic surfaces and superslippery surfaces) and perspectives on future research directions are also discussed.

      <title>Proton&#8208;Conductive Melanin&#8208;Like Fibers through Enzymatic Oxidation of a Self&#8208;Assembling Peptide</title>
      <dc:description>
Melanins are a class of pigments with remarkable optical and electric properties, yet their applications in bioelectronics are limited due to difficulties in control of supramolecular structure and nano&#8208;to&#8208;micrometer scale morphology. Supramolecular templating of a minimalistic peptide precursor containing two oxidizable tyrosines is used to form a melanin&#8208;like material with controlled fibrillar morphology, broad UV absorption, and unprecedented high conductivity.








Abstract
Melanin pigments have various properties that are of technological interest including photo&#8208; and radiation protection, rich coloration, and electronic functions. Nevertheless, laboratory&#8208;based synthesis of melanin and melanin&#8208;like materials with morphologies and chemical structures that are specifically optimized for these applications, is currently not possible. Here, melanin&#8208;like materials that are produced by enzymatic oxidation of a supramolecular tripeptide structures that are rich in tyrosine and have a 1D morphology are demonstrated, that are retained during the oxidation process while conducting tracks form through oxidative tyrosine crosslinking. Specifically, a minimalistic self&#8208;assembling peptide, Lys&#8211;Tyr&#8211;Tyr (KYY) with strong propensity to form supramolecular fibers, is utilized. Analysis by Raman spectroscopy shows that the tyrosines are pre&#8208;organized inside these fibers and, upon enzymatic oxidation, result in connected catechols. These form 1D conducting tracks along the length of the fiber, which gives rise to a level of internal disorder, but retention of the fiber morphology. This results in highly conductive structures demonstrated to be dominated by proton conduction. This work demonstrates the ability to control oxidation but retain a well&#8208;defined fibrous morphology that does not have a known equivalent in biology, and demonstrate exceptional conductivity that is enhanced by enzymatic oxidation.

      <dc:description>
Despite extensive research, only a handful of vaccine adjuvants, non&#8208;native to the human body, have been approved. A new adjuvant based on ionic liquids is demonstrated, which combines two metabolites of the body, choline and lactic acid (ChoLa). It successfully enhances immune infiltration at the injection site and leads to a potent immune response against the antigen, serving as a safe adjuvant alternative that can help protect against infections.








Abstract
Adjuvants play a critical role in the design and development of novel vaccines. Despite extensive research, only a handful of vaccine adjuvants have been approved for human use. Currently used adjuvants are mostly composed of components that are non&#8208;native to the human body, such as aluminum salt, bacterial lipids, or foreign genomic material. Here, a new ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;based adjuvant is explored, synthesized using two metabolites of the body, choline and lactic acid (ChoLa). ChoLa distributes the antigen efficiently upon injection, maintains antigen integrity, enhances immune infiltration at the injection site, and leads to a potent immune response against the antigen. Thus, it can serve as a promising safe adjuvant platform that can help to protect against pandemics and future infectious threats.

      <title>Single Cobalt Sites Dispersed in Hierarchically Porous Nanofiber Networks for Durable and High&#8208;Power PGM&#8208;Free Cathodes in Fuel Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed single&#8208;Co&#8208;site catalysts, through electrospinning cobalt&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;8 crystals, and selected dual polyacrylonitrile and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) polymers are reported. The interconnected porous nanofiber networks with hierarchical architecture are essential to facilitate mass and charge transfer within an electrode, along with uniform ionomer dispersion for the oxygen reduction reaction. The catalyst is highly active and durable in proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells.








Abstract
Increasing catalytic activity and durability of atomically dispersed metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (M&#8211;N&#8211;C) catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) cathode in proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells remains a grand challenge. Here, a high&#8208;power and durable Co&#8211;N&#8211;C nanofiber catalyst synthesized through electrospinning cobalt&#8208;doped zeolitic imidazolate frameworks into selected polyacrylonitrile and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) polymers is reported. The distinct porous fibrous morphology and hierarchical structures play a vital role in boosting electrode performance by exposing more accessible active sites, providing facile electron conductivity, and facilitating the mass transport of reactant. The enhanced intrinsic activity is attributed to the extra graphitic N dopants surrounding the CoN4 moieties. The highly graphitized carbon matrix in the catalyst is beneficial for enhancing the carbon corrosion resistance, thereby promoting catalyst stability. The unique nanoscale X&#8208;ray computed tomography verifies the well&#8208;distributed ionomer coverage throughout the fibrous carbon network in the catalyst. The membrane electrode assembly achieves a power density of 0.40 W cm&#8722;2 in a practical H2/air cell (1.0&#160;bar) and demonstrates significantly enhanced durability under accelerated stability tests. The combination of the intrinsic activity and stability of single Co sites, along with unique catalyst architecture, provide new insight into designing efficient PGM&#8208;free electrodes with improved performance and durability.

      <title>General Synthesis of Nanoporous 2D Metal Compounds with 3D Bicontinous Structure</title>
      <dc:description>
2D metal compounds with bicontinous nanoporous structure are successfully prepared by using a recyclable nanoporous gold assisted chemical vapor deposition process. The resulting 3D nanoporous MoSSe with tunable pore sizes and porosity exhibits excellent electrochemical N2 reduction reaction properties. This work opens up a promising avenue for fundamental studies and potential applications of a wide variety of nanoporous metal compounds.








Abstract
Although 2D layered metal compounds are widely exploited using various techniques such as exfoliation and vapor&#8208;phase&#8208;assisted growth, it is still challenging to construct the 2D materials in a 3D configuration with preservation of the unique physicochemical properties of the metal compounds. Herein, a general synthetic strategy is reported for a wide variety of 2D (atomic&#8208;scale thickness) metal compounds with 3D bicontinous nanoporous structure. 19 binary compounds including sulfides, selenides, tellurides, carbides, and nitrides, and five alloyed compounds, are successfully prepared via a surface alloy strategy, which are readily created by using a recyclable nanoporous gold assisted chemical vapor deposition process. These 3D nanoporous metal compounds with preserved 2D physicochemical properties, tunable pore sizes, and compositions for electrocatalytic applications, show excellent catalytic performance in the electrochemical N2 reduction reaction. This work opens up a promising avenue for fundamental studies and potential applications of a wide variety of nanoporous metal compounds.

      <title>Quantitative Polarization&#8208;Resolved Second&#8208;Harmonic&#8208;Generation Microscopy of Glycine Microneedles</title>
      <dc:description>
A quantitative framework for finding &#967;(2), the second&#8208;order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, from polarization&#8208;resolved second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy in transmission mode is presented. This method corrects for micrometer&#8208;scale morphology and birefringence, which enable the determination and comparison of the &#967;(2) tensors of &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;phase glycine microneedles and is broadly applicable for quantitative SHG material characterization and biological diagnostic imaging.








Abstract
Second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) is a nonlinear optical process that can provide disease diagnosis through characterization of biological building blocks such as amino acids, peptides, and proteins. The second&#8208;order nonlinear susceptibility tensor &#967;(2) of a material characterizes its tendency to cause SHG. Here, a method for finding the &#967;(2) elements from polarization&#8208;resolved SHG microscopy in transmission mode is presented. The quantitative framework and analytical approach that corrects for micrometer&#8208;scale morphology and birefringence enable the determination and comparison of the SHG susceptibility tensors of &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;phase glycine microneedles. The maximum nonlinear susceptibility coefficients are d33&#160;= 15 pm V&#8722;1 for the &#946; and d33&#160;= 5.9 pm V&#8722;1 for the &#947; phase. The results demonstrate glycine as a useful biocompatible nonlinear material. This combination of the analytical model and polarization&#8208;resolved SHG transmission microscopy is broadly applicable for quantitative SHG material characterization and diagnostic imaging.

      <title>A Versatile Nonviral Delivery System for Multiplex Gene&#8208;Editing in the Liver</title>
      <dc:description>
A liposome&#8208;coated mesoporous silica nanoparticle enables multiplex gene editing to understand potential therapeutic targets in liver lipid metabolism. Using this novel nonviral platform to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein, gene editing is&#160;demonstrated at three potential therapeutic targets (pcsk9, apoc3, angptl3) for cardioprotection in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Recent advances in CRISPR present attractive genome&#8208;editing toolsets for therapeutic strategies at the genetic level. Here, a liposome&#8208;coated mesoporous silica nanoparticle (lipoMSN) is reported as an effective CRISPR delivery system for multiplex gene&#8208;editing in the liver. The MSN provides efficient loading of Cas9 plasmid as well as Cas9 protein/guide RNA ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP), while liposome&#8208;coating offers improved serum stability and enhanced cell uptake. Hypothesizing that loss&#8208;of&#8208;function mutation in the lipid&#8208;metabolism&#8208;related genes pcsk9, apoc3, and angptl3 would improve cardiovascular health by lowering blood cholesterol and triglycerides, the lipoMSN is used to deliver a combination of RNPs targeting these genes. When targeting a single gene, the lipoMSN achieved a 54% gene&#8208;editing efficiency, besting the state&#8208;of&#8208;art Lipofectamine CRISPRMax. For multiplexing, lipoMSN maintained significant gene&#8208;editing at each gene target despite reduced dosage of target&#8208;specific RNP. By delivering combinations of targeting RNPs in the same nanoparticle, synergistic effects on lipid metabolism are observed in vitro and vivo. These effects, such as a 50% decrease in serum cholesterol after 4 weeks of post&#8208;treatment with lipoMSN carrying both pcsk9 and angptl3&#8208;targeted RNPs, could not be reached with a single gene&#8208;editing approach. Taken together, this lipoMSN represents a versatile platform for the development of efficient, combinatorial gene&#8208;editing therapeutics.

Abstract
Device engineering based on the tunable electronic properties of ternary transition metal dichalcogenides has recently gained widespread research interest. In this work, monolayer ternary telluride core/shell structures are synthesized using a one&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition process with rapid cooling. The core region is the tellurium&#8208;rich WSe2&#8722;2xTe2x alloy, while the shell is the tellurium&#8208;poor WSe2&#8722;2yTe2y alloy. The bandgap of the material is &#8776;1.45&#160;eV in the core region and &#8776;1.57&#160;eV in the shell region. The lateral gradient of the bandgap across the monolayer heterostructure allows for the fabrication of heterogeneous transistors and photodetectors. The difference in work function between the core and shell regions leads to a built&#8208;in electric field at the heterojunction. As a result, heterogeneous transistors demonstrate a unidirectional conduction and strong photovoltaic effect. The bandgap gradient and high mobility of the ternary telluride core/shell structures provide a unique material platform for novel electronic and photonic devices.

In this work, monolayer ternary telluride core/shell structures are synthesized using a one&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition process with rapid cooling. The core region is the tellurium&#8208;rich WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; alloy, while the shell is the tellurium&#8208;poor WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; alloy. The bandgap of the material is &#8776;1.45&#160;eV in the core region and &#8776;1.57&#160;eV in the shell region. The lateral gradient of the bandgap across the monolayer heterostructure allows for the fabrication of heterogeneous transistors and photodetectors. The difference in work function between the core and shell regions leads to a built&#8208;in electric field at the heterojunction. As a result, heterogeneous transistors demonstrate a unidirectional conduction and strong photovoltaic effect. The bandgap gradient and high mobility of the ternary telluride core/shell structures provide a unique material platform for novel electronic and photonic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Programming Multiphase Media Superwetting States in the Oil&#8211;Water&#8211;Air System: Evolutions in Hydrophobic&#8211;Hydrophilic Surface Heterogeneous Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
A new conceptual insight &#8220;multiphase media superwetting states&#8221; for superwettability is presented. Programming of multiphase media superwetting states can be manipulated by surface hydrophobic&#8208;hydrophilic heterogeneous chemistry by varying the spraying inks&#8217; chemistry and external stimuli. In&#8208;air superhydrophilicity&#8211;superoleophobicity and underoil superhydrophilicity can be realized via ammonia vapor exposure and ultraviolet light illumination, respectively.








Abstract
Studies toward tailoring macroscopic extreme wetting behaviors on a certain well&#8208;defined surface in multiphase media are significant but still at an infant stage. Herein, superantiwetting evolutions in the oil&#8211;water&#8211;air system can be programmed from single to quadruple superrepellence by controlling the surface hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophilic heterogeneous chemistry. Ammonia vapor exposure makes the realization of challenging superhydrophilicity&#8211;superoleophobicity possible in air medium, causing the transition from quadruple to triple superantiwetting states in the oil&#8211;water&#8211;air system. Upon UV illumination, only single superrepellence&#8211;underwater superoleophobicity is maintained on titanium dioxide (TiO2, P25)&#8208;based coatings. A reversible transition between underoil superhydrophilicity and superhydrophobicity via an alternating UV irradiation and heating process leads to a switching between &#8220;water&#8208;absorbing&#8221; and &#8220;size&#8208;sieving&#8221; effects in water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsion separation. A comparative study for investigating two such effects in emulsion separation is further investigated. The current conceptual insights not only extend superwetting states to multiphase media, but can also deepen the understanding of the relationship between macroscopic extreme wetting behaviors and surface chemistry.

      <title>Understanding the Self&#8208;Assembly of Cellulose Nanocrystals&#8212;Toward Chiral Photonic Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Chiral photonic films that selectively reflect circularly polarized light can be prepared using the liquid crystalline properties of cellulose nanocrystals. The recent developments to understand the growth and structure of films with chiral nematic order are highlighted, together with studies that may lead to the development of new optical components, sensory materials, and decorative applications.








Abstract
Over millions of years, animals and plants have evolved complex molecules and structures that endow them with vibrant colors. Among the sources of natural coloration, structural color is prominent in insects, bird feathers, snake skin, plants, and other organisms, where the color arises from the interaction of light with nanoscale features rather than absorption from a pigment. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are a biorenewable resource that spontaneously organize into chiral nematic liquid crystals having a hierarchical structure that resembles the Bouligand structure of arthropod shells. The periodic, chiral nematic organization of CNC films leads them to diffract light, making them appear iridescent. Over the past two decades, there have been many advances to develop the photonic properties of CNCs for applications ranging from cosmetics to sensors. Here, the origin of color in CNCs, the control of photonic properties of CNC films, the development of new composite materials of CNCs that can yield flexible photonic structures, and the future challenges in this field are discussed. In particular, recent efforts to make flexible photonic materials using CNCs are highlighted.

      <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence: Chiral Organic Materials for Emerging Optical Technologies</title>
      <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state light emission is very promising in view of potential applications. Scientific approaches to the realization of chiral emissive materials are indeed growing exponentially. The properties of the nanostructures discussed are related both to the way in which luminescence is generated upon aggregation (aggregation&#8208;induced emission) and the way in which it is detected (circularly polarized emission).








Abstract
Chirality is becoming increasingly important in the design of organic materials with functional properties, when bulk anisotropy is needed. In the past decades, a plethora of chiral organic materials have been studied and developed. Nanostructures have brought substantial advancement to the realization of organic&#8208;molecule&#8208;based devices, and the possibilities for solid&#8208;state light emission are very promising in view of potential applications. Scientific approaches to the realization of chiral emissive materials are indeed growing exponentially. The chiral nanostructures discussed are related both to the way in which luminescence is generated and the way in which it is detected. As to the former, the focus will be on organic chromophores with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties, so that emission is present, or at least largely amplified, when the molecules are in the aggregated state. As to the latter, the focus will be on the ability and a quantitative comparison of organic nanostructures capable of circularly polarized emission.

      <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Nanoassemblies: Generation, Amplification, and Application</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent development of circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) materials has aroused extensive attention. The self&#8208;assembly strategy is proposed to address the barriers of tedious syntheses and the restricted substitutes during the development of CPL&#8208;active materials. By highlighting the meritorious findings, the present status and progress in this field are reviewed, with the aim of boosting the development of chiroptical materials.








Abstract
Currently, the development of circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) materials has drawn extensive attention due to the numerous potential applications in optical data storage, displays, backlights in 3D displays, and so on. While the fabrication of CPL&#8208;active materials generally requires chiral luminescent molecules, the introduction of the &#8220;self&#8208;assembly&#8221; concept offers a new perspective in obtaining the CPL&#8208;active materials. Following this approach, various self&#8208;assembled materials, including organic&#8208;, inorganic&#8208;, and hybrid systems can be endowed with CPL properties. Benefiting from the advantages of self&#8208;assembly, not only chiral molecules, but also achiral species, as well as inorganic nanoparticles have potential to be self&#8208;assembled into chiral nanoassemblies showing CPL activity. In addition, the dissymmetry factor, an important parameter of CPL materials, can be enhanced through various pathways of self&#8208;assembly. Here, the present status and progress of self&#8208;assembled nanomaterials with CPL activity are reviewed. An overview of the key factors in regulating chiral emission materials at the supramolecular level will largely boost their application in multidisciplinary fields.

Abstract
Exploration of molecular functions and material properties based on the control of chirality would be a scientifically elegant approach. Here, the fabrication and function of chiral&#8208;featured materials from both chiral and achiral components using a supramolecular nanoarchitectonics concept are discussed. The contents are classified in to three topics: i) chiral nanoarchitectonics of rather general molecular assemblies; ii) chiral nanoarchitectonics of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs); iii) chiral nanoarchitectonics in liquid crystals. MOF structures are based on nanoscopically well&#8208;defined coordinations, while mesoscopic orientations of liquid&#8208;crystalline phases are often flexibly altered. Discussion on the effects and features in these representative materials systems with totally different natures reveals the universal importance of supramolecular chiral nanoarchitectonics. Amplification of chiral molecular information from molecules to materials&#8208;level structures and the creation of chirality from achiral components upon temporal statistic fluctuations are universal, regardless of the nature of the assemblies. These features are thus surely advantageous characteristics for a wide range of applications.

      <title>Chirality and Surface Bonding Correlation in Atomically Precise Metal Nanoclusters</title>
      <dc:description>
Atomically precise, ligand&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters provide an excellent opportunity to reveal that chirality is intrinsic and &#8220;outside&#8208;in.&#8221; A unified picture of metal&#8211;ligand surface bonding&#8208;induced chirality is provided; that is, the Aun(SR)n+1 staple motifs, Agn(SR)m mount motifs, and even the whole Ag&#8208;SR cage are responsible for the chirality in Au&#8208;SR and Ag&#8208;SR nanoclusters.








Abstract
Chirality is ubiquitous in nature and occurs at all length scales. The development of applications for chiral nanostructures is rising rapidly. With the recent achievements of atomically precise nanochemistry, total structures of ligand&#8208;protected Au and other metal nanoclusters (NCs) are successfully obtained, and the origins of chirality are discovered to be associated with different parts of the cluster, including the surface ligands (e.g., swirl patterns), the organic&#8211;inorganic interface (e.g., helical stripes), and the kernel. Herein, a unified picture of metal&#8211;ligand surface bonding&#8208;induced chirality for the nanoclusters is proposed. The different bonding modes of M&#8211;X (where M = metal and X = the binding atom of ligand) lead to different surface structures on nanoclusters, which in turn give rise to various characteristic features of chirality. A comparison of Au&#8211;thiolate NCs with Au&#8211;phosphine ones further reveals the important roles of surface bonding. Compared to the Au&#8211;thiolate NCs, the Ag/Cu/Cd&#8211;thiolate systems exhibit different coordination modes between the metal and the thiolate. Other than thiolate and phosphine ligands, alkynyls are also briefly discussed. Several methods of obtaining chiroptically active nanoclusters are introduced, such as enantioseparation by high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography and enantioselective synthesis. Future perspectives on chiral NCs are also proposed.

      <title>Plasmonic Chirality and Circular Dichroism in Bioassembled and Nonbiological Systems: Theoretical Background and Recent Progress</title>
      <dc:description>
The recent progress in the field of plasmonic chirality of both bio and inorganic systems is summarized, focusing on both the theoretical background and the experimental advances in the study of molecular&#8208;plasmonic assemblies, chiral plasmonic nanostructures, chiral assemblies of interacting plasmonic nanoparticles, and chiral metal metasurfaces and metamaterials. The new directions in this rapidly growing field are also discussed.








Abstract
Nature is chiral, thus chirality is a key concept required to understand a multitude of systems in physics, chemistry, and biology. The field of optics offers valuable tools to probe the chirality of nanosystems, including the measurement of circular dichroism, the differential interaction strength between matter and circularly polarized light with opposite helicity. Simultaneously, the use of plasmonic systems with giant light&#8208;interaction cross&#8208;sections opens new paths to investigate and manipulate systems on the nanoscale. Consequently, the interest in chiral plasmonic and hybrid systems has continually grown in recent years, due to their potential applications in biosensing, polarization&#8208;encoded optical communication, polarization&#8208;selective chemical reactions, and materials with polarization&#8208;dependent light&#8211;matter interaction. Experimentally, chiral properties of nanostructures can be either created artificially using modern fabrication techniques involving inorganic materials, or borrowed from nature using bioassembly or biomolecular templating. Herein, the recent progress in the field of plasmonic chirality is summarized, with a focus on both the theoretical background and the experimental advances in the study of chirality in various systems, including molecular&#8208;plasmonic assemblies, chiral plasmonic nanostructures, chiral assemblies of interacting plasmonic nanoparticles, and chiral metal metasurfaces and metamaterials.

      <title>Reconfigurable Plasmonic Chirality: Fundamentals and Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
The chiroptical response of artificial metal nanostructures can be manipulated postfabrication. Different approaches to reconfigure the chiroptical spectral signature, the structural conformation of the plasmonic systems, or both, are presented. The discussed concepts have the potential to serve as key elements in future optical systems and chiral sensing.








Abstract
Molecular chirality is a geometric property that is of great importance in chemistry, biology, and medicine. Recently, plasmonic nanostructures that exhibit distinct chiroptical responses have attracted tremendous interest, given their ability to emulate the properties of chiral molecules with tailored and pronounced optical characteristics. However, the optical chirality of such human&#8208;made structures is in general static and cannot be manipulated postfabrication. Herein, different concepts to reconfigure the chiroptical responses of plasmonic nano&#8208; and micro&#8208;objects are outlined. Depending on the utilized strategies and stimuli, the chiroptical signature, the 3D structural conformation, or both can be reconfigured. Optical devices based on plasmonic nanostructures with reconfigurable chirality possess great potential in practical applications, ranging from polarization conversion elements to enantioselective analysis, chiral sensing, and catalysis.

Abstract
Liquid crystals (LCs) are omnipresent in living matter, whose chirality is an elegant and distinct feature in certain plant tissues, the cuticles of crabs, beetles, arthropods, and beyond. Taking inspiration from nature, researchers have recently devoted extensive efforts toward developing chiral liquid crystalline materials with self&#8208;organized nanostructures and exploring their potential applications in diverse fields ranging from dynamic photonics to energy and safety issues. In this review, an account on the state of the art of emerging chiral liquid crystalline nanostructured materials and their technological applications is provided. First, an overview on the significance of chiral liquid crystalline architectures in various living systems is given. Then, the recent significant progress in different chiral liquid crystalline systems including thermotropic LCs (cholesteric LCs, cubic blue phases, achiral bent&#8208;core LCs, etc.) and lyotropic LCs (DNA LCs, nanocellulose LCs, and graphene oxide LCs) is showcased. The review concludes with a perspective on the future scope, opportunities, and challenges in these truly advanced functional soft materials and their promising applications.

      <title>Enantiomeric Control of Intrinsically Chiral Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>
Chiral nanocrystals can be prepared with high enantioselectivity by utilizing chiral biomolecules. The several chiral nanocrystal systems that have been studied so far are reviewed with insights on the role of the chiral molecules and the possible mechanisms that may lead to chiral shape formation. The imprinting of the chiral shape to achiral functional materials is discussed.








Abstract
The chiral aspect of inorganic crystals that crystallize in chiral space groups has been largely ignored until recently, partly due to difficulties in characterizing the chiroptical properties of bulk crystals, and also due to the difficulty in separating (sub)micrometer&#8208;scale chiral crystal enantiomers. In recent years, the colloidal synthesis of intrinsically chiral nanocrystals (NCs) of several chiral inorganic compounds with significant enantiomeric excess has been demonstrated. This is achieved through the use of chiral molecular ligands, which bind to the atomic/ionic components of the crystals, preferentially forming one crystal enantiomorph. Here, recent progress on several aspects of these NCs is described, including the connection between ligand structure and its ability to direct NC handedness, chiral amplification in the synthesis leading to enantiopure NC samples, spontaneous symmetry breaking, the formation of NCs with chiral shapes, the connection between lattice and shape chirality and mixed contributions of atomic&#8208;scale and shape chirality to the chiroptical properties.

      <title>Construction of Chiral, Helical Nanoparticle Superstructures: Progress and Prospects</title>
      <dc:description>
Helical nanoparticle superstructures are an exciting subclass of chiral nanomaterials with interesting chiroptical properties. The emergence and recent growth of this field is detailed, focusing on the various assembly methods developed for fabricating these unique materials.








Abstract
Chiral nanoparticle (NP) superstructures, in which discrete NPs are assembled into chiral architectures, represent an exciting and growing class of nanomaterials. Their enantiospecific properties make them promising candidates for a variety of potential applications. Helical NP superstructures are a rapidly expanding subclass of chiral nanomaterials in which NPs are arranged in three dimensions about a screw axis. Their intrinsic asymmetry gives rise to a variety of interesting properties, including plasmonic chiroptical activity in the visible spectrum, and they hold immense promise as chiroptical sensors and as components of optical metamaterials. Herein, a concise history of the foundational conceptual advances that helped define the field of chiral nanomaterials is provided, and some of the major achievements in the development of helical nanomaterials are highlighted. Next, the key methodologies employed to construct these materials are discussed, and specific merits that are offered by each assembly methodology are identified, as well as their potential disadvantages. Finally, some specific examples of the emerging applications of these materials are discussed and some areas of future development and research focus are proposed.

      <title>Supramolecular Chiral 2D Materials and Emerging Functions</title>
      <dc:description>
Chiral materials are widely applied in various fields, providing stereospecific conditions and environments. Recent progress in the construction of 2D chiral materials and their emerging functions is reviewed, focusing on construction strategies, enantiomeric separation, asymmetric catalysis, and chiroptical effects. A perspective is given to construct single&#8208;layered chiral sheets with uniform&#8208;sized chiral pores that can be used as chiral nanoreactors.








Abstract
Chiral materials are widely applied in various fields such as enantiomeric separation, asymmetric catalysis, and chiroptical effects, providing stereospecific conditions and environments. Supramolecular concepts to create the chiral materials can provide an insight for emerging chiro&#8208;optical properties due to their well&#8208;defined scaffolds and the precise functionalization of the surfaces or skeletons. Among the various supramolecular chiral structures, 2D chiral sheet structures are particularly interesting materials because of their extremely high surface area coupled with many unique chemical and physical properties, thereby offering potential for the next generation of functional materials for optically active systems and optoelectronic devices. Nevertheless, relatively limited examples for 2D chiral materials exhibiting specific functionality have been reported because incorporation of molecular chirality into 2D architectures is difficult at the present stage. Here, a brief overview of the recent advances is provided on the construction of chiral supramolecular 2D materials and their functions. The design principles toward 2D chirality and their potential applications are also discussed.

      <title>Chiral Surface and Geometry of Metal Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>
The fundamentals needed to crystallographically define the surface chirality in metal are summarized, and synthetic strategies to produce the corresponding chiral geometries by controlling chiral high&#8208;Miller&#8208;index facets are provided. The surface and overall geometry are linked, and thus a guide for producing various chiral metallic nanoparticles for metamaterials, biosensors, catalysts, and optical applications is given.








Abstract
Chirality is a basic property of nature and has great importance in photonics, biochemistry, medicine, and catalysis. This importance has led to the emergence of the chiral inorganic nanostructure field in the last two decades, providing opportunities to control the chirality of light and biochemical reactions. While the facile production of 3D nanostructures has remained a major challenge, recent advances in nanocrystal synthesis have provided a new pathway for efficient control of chirality at the nanoscale by transferring molecular chirality to the geometry of nanocrystals. Interestingly, this discovery stems from a purely crystallographic outcome: chirality can be generated on high&#8208;Miller&#8208;index surfaces, even for highly symmetric metal crystals. This is the starting point herein, with an overview of the scientific history and a summary of the crystallographic definition. With the advance of nanomaterial synthesis technology, high&#8208;Miller&#8208;index planes can be selectively exposed on metallic nanoparticles. The enantioselective interaction of chiral molecules and high&#8208;Miller&#8208;index facets can break the mirror symmetry of the metal nanocrystals. Herein, the fundamental principle of chirality evolution is emphasized and it is shown how chiral surfaces can be directly correlated with chiral morphologies, thus serving as a guide for researchers in chiral catalysts, chiral plasmonics, chiral metamaterials, and photonic devices.

      <title>Magnetic Circular Dichroism in Nanomaterials: New Opportunity in Understanding and Modulation of Excitonic and Plasmonic Resonances</title>
      <dc:description>
Magnetic circular dichroism shows indispensable capability in elucidating the Zeeman splitting of the excitonic transition in semiconductor nanocrystals, the electronic information of discrete optical transitions in noble metal nanoclusters, and the geometry modulation of plasmon resonance in noble metal nanostructures. Key strategies in designing magneto&#8208;optically active advanced nanomaterials are highlighted for potential applications in fields of sensing, spintronics, and nanophotonics.








Abstract
The unique capability of magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) in revealing geometry and electronic information has provided new opportunities in exploring the relationship between structure and magneto&#8208;optical properties in nanomaterials with extraordinary optical absorption. Here, the representative studies referring to application of the MCD technique in semiconductor and noble metal nanomaterials are overviewed. MCD is powerful in elucidating the structural information of the excitonic transition in semiconductor nanocrystals, electronic transitions in noble metal nanoclusters, and plasmon resonance in noble metal nanostructures. By virtue of these advantages, the MCD technique shows its unrivalled ability in evaluating the magnetic modulation of excitonic and plasmonic optical activity of nanomaterials with varied chemical composition, geometry, assembly conformation, and coupling effect. Knowledge of the key factors in manipulating magneto&#8208;optical properties at the nanoscale acquired with the MCD technique will largely boost the application of semiconductor and noble nanomaterials in the fields of sensing, spintronic, nanophotonics, etc.

      <title>Shedding Light on the Role of Misfit Strain in Controlling Core&#8211;Shell Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent investigations on heterogeneous core&#8211;shell nanocrystals containing misfit strains are summarized, with a focus on mechanistic understanding of strain and strain&#8208;induced effects such as tuning the epitaxial habit, modulating the optical emission, and enhancing the catalytic activity and magnetic coercivity.








Abstract
Heteroepitaxial modification of nanomaterials has become a powerful means to create novel functionalities for various applications. One of the most elementary factors in heteroepitaxial nanostructures is the misfit strain arising from mismatched lattices of the constituent parts. Misfit strain not only dictates epitaxy kinetics for diversifying nanocrystal morphologies but also provides rational control over materials properties. In recent years, advances in chemical synthesis along with the rapid development of electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques have enabled a substantial understanding of strain&#8208;related processes, which offers theoretical foundation and experimental guidance for researchers to refine heteroepitaxial nanostructures and their properties. Herein, recent investigations on heterogeneous core&#8211;shell nanocrystals containing misfit strains are summarized, with a focus on the mechanistic understanding of strain and strain&#8208;induced effects such as tuning the epitaxial habit, modulating the optical emission, and enhancing the catalytic activity and magnetic coercivity.

      <title>Tumor&#8208;Targeting Glycol Chitosan Nanoparticles for Cancer Heterogeneity</title>
      <dc:description>
Glycol chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) are widely utilized for tumor&#8208;targeted delivery of various theranostic agents. The continuing efforts to develop tumor&#8208;targeting CNPs for the delivery of therapeutics and imaging agents are reviewed. Furthermore, various targeting strategies and interesting stimulus&#8208;responsive designs of CNPs are discussed to overcome multiple physiological barriers, such as tumor heterogeneity and the complex tumor microenvironment.








Abstract
Nanomedicine is extensively employed for cancer treatment owing to its unique advantages over conventional drugs and imaging agents. This increased attention to nanomedicine, however, has not fully translated into clinical utilization and patient benefits due to issues associated with reticuloendothelial system clearance, tumor heterogeneity, and complexity of the tumor microenvironment. To address these challenges, efforts are being made to modify the design of nanomedicines, including optimization of their physiochemical properties, active targeting, and response to stimuli, but these studies are often performed independently. Combining favorable nanomedicine designs from individual studies may improve therapeutic outcomes, but, this is difficult to achieve as the effects of different designs are interconnected and often conflicting. Glycol chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) are shown to accumulate in tumors, suggesting that this type of nanoparticle may constitute a good basis for the additional modification of nanoparticles. Here, multifunctional glycol CNPs designed to overcome multiple obstacles to their use are described and key factors influencing in vivo targeted delivery, targeting strategies, and interesting stimulus&#8208;responsive designs for improving cancer nanomedicine are discussed.

      <title>Computation&#8208;Guided Synthesis of New Garnet&#8208;Type Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes via an Ultrafast Sintering Technique</title>
      <dc:description>
New members of the family of garnet&#8208;type solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) including LNZTO, LSZTO, and L&#8208;LSZTO are predicted by computation and synthesized by an ultrafast sintering technique. This study demonstrates the successful realization of computational predictions through the ultrafast sintering technique for the rapid optimization and screening of high&#8208;performance SSEs.








Abstract
The discovery of new solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) can be guided by computation for next&#8208;generation Li batteries toward higher energy density and better safety. However, conventional synthetic methods often suffer from severe loss of Li and poor material quality, therefore preventing the promise of the predicted SSE candidates to be realized. In this study, computationally predicted SSEs with desirable material quality are synthesized via an ultrafast sintering technique. Three new garnet&#8208;type Li+ conductors, including Li6.5Nd3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LNZTO), Li6.5Sm3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LSZTO), and Li6.5(Sm0.5La0.5)3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (L&#8208;LSZTO), are screened by density functional theory to exhibit good synthesizability and stability. The ultrafast sintering method by Joule heating effectively shorten the sintering time from several hours to &lt;25&#160;s, thereby reducing the Li loss and effectively merging the grains toward high material quality. In agreement with the computational prediction, LNZTO demonstrates the best synthesizability and phase stability, thereby achieving the highest conductivity of 2.3 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 among the three new SSE candidates. Using a current density of 0.2 mA cm&#8722;2, the Li/LNZTO/Li symmetric cell can cycle for &#8776;90 h without obvious increase of overpotentials. This study showcases the successful realization of computational predictions by the ultrafast sintering technique for the rapid optimization and screening of high&#8208;performance SSEs.

      <title>Ultrafast Exciton Transport with a Long Diffusion Length in Layered Perovskites with Organic Cation Functionalization</title>
      <dc:description>
Apart from exciton&#8211;phonon coupling, the octahedral distortion is revealed to significantly affect exciton diffusion process. A simple fluorine substitution to phenethylammonium for the organic cations to tune the structural rigidity and octahedral distortion yields a record exciton diffusivity of 1.91 cm2 s&#8722;1 and a diffusion length of 405&#160;nm along the in&#8208;plane direction.








Abstract
Layered perovskites have been employed for various optoelectronic devices including solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes for improved stability, which need exciton transport along both the in&#8208;plane and the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane directions. However, it is not clear yet what determines the exciton transport along the in&#8208;plane direction, which is important to understand its impact toward electronic devices. Here, by employing both steady&#8208;state and transient photoluminescence mapping, it is found that in&#8208;plane exciton diffusivities in layered perovskites are sensitive to both the number of layers and organic cations. Apart from exciton&#8211;phonon coupling, the octahedral distortion is revealed to significantly affect the exciton diffusion process, determined by temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence, light&#8208;intensity&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence, and density function theory calculations. A simple fluorine substitution to phenethylammonium for the organic cations to tune the structural rigidity and octahedral distortion yields a record exciton diffusivity of 1.91 cm2 s&#8722;1 and a diffusion length of 405 nm along the in&#8208;plane direction. This study provides guidance to manipulate exciton diffusion by modifying organic cations in layered perovskites.

      <title>A Zinc&#8211;Dual&#8208;Halogen Battery with a Molten Hydrate Electrolyte</title>
      <dc:description>
A new aqueous zinc&#8208;based battery exploiting dual redox couples of Br0/Br&#8722; and Cl0/Cl&#8722; at a graphite cathode is presented. The battery achieves both a high average working voltage of 1.71&#160;V and a remarkable capacity of 257 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1. This work provides an affordable, easily scalable, membrane&#8208;free, and high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage system.








Abstract
Halogen redox couples offer several advantages for energy storage such as low cost, high solubility in water, and high redox potential. However, the operational complexity of storing halogens at the oxidation state via liquid&#8208;phase media hampers their widespread application in energy&#8208;storage devices. Herein, an aqueous zinc&#8211;dual&#8208;halogen battery system taking the advantages of redox flow batteries (inherent scalability) and intercalation chemistry (high capacity) is designed and fabricated. To enhance specific energy, the designed cell exploits both bromine and chlorine as the cathode redox couples that are present as halozinc complexes in a newly developed molten hydrate electrolyte, which is distinctive to the conventional zinc&#8211;bromine batteries. Benefiting from the reversible uptake of halogens at the graphite cathode, exclusive reliance on earth&#8208;abundant elements, and membrane&#8208;free and possible flow&#8208;through configuration, the proposed battery can potentially realize high&#8208;performance massive electric energy storage at a reasonable cost.

      <title>Eppur si Muove: Proton Diffusion in Halide Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>
Various phenomena and techniques can be explained by ambient&#8208;temperature ion diffusion in halide perovskites. It is shown that the really fast diffusers are protons, rather than halides, using deuterium isotope tracing in MAPbI3, MAPbBr3, and FAPbBr3, and other methods; that water is critical for proton diffusion, and that already reported results are compatible with this new insight.








Abstract
Ion diffusion affects the optoelectronic properties of halide&#8208;perovskites (HaPs). Until now, the fastest diffusion has been attributed to the movement of the halides, largely neglecting the contribution of protons, on the basis of computed density estimates. Here, the process of proton diffusion inside HaPs, following deuterium&#8211;hydrogen exchange and migration in MAPbI3, MAPbBr3, and FAPbBr3 single crystals, is proven through D/H NMR quantification, Raman spectroscopy, and elastic recoil detection analysis, challenging the original assumption of halide&#8208;dominated diffusion. The results are confirmed by impedance spectroscopy, where MAPbBr3&#8208; and CsPbBr3&#8208;based solar cells respond at very different frequencies. Water plays a key role in allowing the migration of protons as deuteration is not detected in its absence. The water contribution is modeled to explain and forecast its effect as a function of its concentration in the perovskite structure. These findings are of great importance as they evidence how unexpected, water&#8208;dependent proton diffusion can be at the basis of the &#8776;7 orders of magnitude spread of diffusion (attributed to I&#8722; and Br&#8722;) coefficient values, reported in the literature. The reported enhancement of the optoelectronic properties of HaP when exposed to small amounts of water may be related to the finding.

These findings are of great importance as they evidence how unexpected, water&#8208;dependent proton diffusion can be at the basis of the &#8776;7 orders of magnitude spread of diffusion (attributed to I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) coefficient values, reported in the literature. The reported enhancement of the optoelectronic properties of HaP when exposed to small amounts of water may be related to the finding.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recent Progress in Interconnection Layer for Hybrid Photovoltaic Tandems</title>
      <dc:description>
The introduction of an intermediate layer to bridge different solar cell technologies, which have become mature for the optimization of single&#8208;junction cells, is a critical technology of fabricating efficient hybrid tandem solar cells. The design and classification of an efficient interconnection layer that leverages the full potential of the hybrid tandems are discussed.








Abstract
Hybrid tandem solar cells offer the benefits of low cost and full solar spectrum utilization. Among the hybrid tandem structures explored to date, the most popular ones have four (simple stacking design) or two (terminal/tunneling layer addition design) terminal electrodes. Although the latter design is more cost&#8208;effective than the former, its widespread application is hindered by the difficulty of preparing an interface between two solar cell materials. The oldest approach to the in&#8208;series bonding of two or more bandgap solar cells relies on the introduction of a tunneling layer in multijunction III&#8211;V solar cells, but it has some limitations, e.g., the related materials/technologies are applicable only to III&#8211;V and certain other solar cells. Thus, alternative methods of realizing junction contacts based on the use of novel materials are highly sought after. Here, the strategies used to realize high&#8208;performance tandem cells are described, focusing on interface control in terms of bonding two or more solar cells for tandem approaches. The presented information is expected to aid the establishment of ideal methods of connecting two or more solar cells to obtain the highest performance for different solar cell choices with minimized energy loss through the interface.

      <title>Repeatable and Reprogrammable Shape Morphing from Photoresponsive Gold Nanorod/Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
      <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive gold nanorod/liquid crystal elastomer film is prepared, demonstrating excellent photothermal performance with fast actuation and recovery speed, cyclability, and the ability to achieve multiple shapes (both symmetric and asymmetric) from a single film with monodomain alignment of the liquid crystal director field through spatial modulation of the projected light to the film.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are of interest for applications such as soft robotics and shape&#8208;morphing devices. Among the different actuation mechanisms, light offers advantages such as spatial and local control of actuation via the photothermal effect. However, the unwanted aggregation of the light&#8208;absorbing nanoparticles in the LCE matrix will limit the photothermal response speed, actuation performance, and repeatability. Herein, a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive LCE composite consisting of up to 0.20 wt% poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;modified gold nanorods (AuNRs) without apparent aggregation is demonstrated. The high Young's modulus, 20.3&#160;MPa, and excellent photothermal performance render repeated and fast actuation of the films (actuation within 5 s and recovery in 2 s) when exposed to 800&#160;nm light at an average output power of &#8776;1.0 W cm&#8722;2, while maintaining a large actuation strain (56%). Further, it is shown that the same sheet of AuNR/LCE film (100&#160;&#181;m thick) can be morphed into different shapes simply by varying the motifs of the photomasks.

      <title>Controlled Assembly of Liquid Metal Inclusions as a General Approach for Multifunctional Composites</title>
      <dc:description>
A general approach to synthesize soft material composites that incorporate liquid metal is described. The approach extends functionalities imparted by liquid metal inclusions to functional matrix materials. A key to this study is the understanding of the influence of processing parameters to activate electrical conductivity in the composites.








Abstract
Soft composites that use droplets of gallium&#8208;based liquid metal (LM) as the dispersion phase have the potential for transformative impact in multifunctional material engineering. However, it is unclear whether percolation pathways of LM can support high electrical conductivity in a wide range of matrix materials. This issue is addressed through an approach to LM composite synthesis that focuses on the interrelated effects of matrix curing/solidification and droplet formation. The combined influence of LM concentration, particle size, and sedimentation is explored. By developing this approach, the functionalities that have been demonstrated with LM composites can be generalized to other matrix materials that impart additional functionality. Specifically, composites are synthesized using a biodegradable/reprocessable plastic (polycaprolactone), a hydrogel (poly(vinyl alcohol)), and a processable rubber (a styrene&#8211;ethylene&#8211;butylene&#8211;styrene derivative) to demonstrate wide applicability. This method enables synthesis of composites: i) with high stretchability and negligible electromechanical coupling (&gt;600% strain); ii) with Joule&#8208;heated healing and reprocessability; iii) with electrical and mechanical self&#8208;healing; and iv) that can be printed. This approach to controlled assembly represents a widely applicable technique for creating new classes of LM composites with unprecedented multifunctionality.

      <title>Fractal Web Design of a Hemispherical Photodetector Array with Organic&#8208;Dye&#8208;Sensitized Graphene Hybrid Composites</title>
      <dc:description>
A spider&#8208;web&#8208;inspired fractal design is integrated with a high&#8208;performance photodetector array, providing a viable possibility for hemispherical light detection to replicate the vision system of arthropods such as insects and crustaceans. The enhanced photoresponsivity (&gt;1000 A W&#8722;1) and mechanical reliability of the hemisherical photodetector are enabled by the use of organic&#8208;dye&#8208;sensitized graphene hybrid composites.








Abstract
The vision system of arthropods consists of a dense array of individual photodetecting elements across a curvilinear surface. This compound&#8208;eye architecture could be a useful model for optoelectronic sensing devices that require a large field of view and high sensitivity to motion. Strategies that aim to mimic the compound&#8208;eye architecture involve integrating photodetector pixels with a curved microlens, but their fabrication on a curvilinear surface is challenged by the use of standard microfabrication processes that are traditionally designed for planar, rigid substrates (e.g., Si wafers). Here, a fractal web design of a hemispherical photodetector array that contains an organic&#8208;dye&#8208;sensitized graphene hybrid composite is reported to serve as an effective photoactive component with enhanced light&#8208;absorbing capabilities. The device is first fabricated on a planar Si wafer at the microscale and then transferred to transparent hemispherical domes with different curvatures in a deterministic manner. The unique structural property of the fractal web design provides protection of the device from damage by effectively tolerating various external loads. Comprehensive experimental and computational studies reveal the essential design features and optoelectronic properties of the device, followed by the evaluation of its utility in the measurement of both the direction and intensity of incident light.

      <title>Bloch Lines Constituting Antiskyrmions Captured via Differential Phase Contrast</title>
      <dc:description>
Recently, the discovery of transformations between magnetic spin textures, antiskyrmions and skyrmions, has generated a flurry of interest. The mechanism by which these topologically protected spin textures transform may be the creation and annihilation of Bloch lines. In this work, Bloch lines constituting antiskyrmions are directly measured, a significant advancement in the understanding of and quest to manipulate magnetic spin textures.








Abstract
Much scientific capital has been directed toward exotic magnetic spin textures called Bloch lines, that is, N&#233;el&#8208;type line boundaries within domain walls, because their geometry promises high&#8208;density magnetic storage. While predicted to arise in high&#8208;anisotropy magnets, bulk soft magnets, and thin films with in&#8208;plane magnetization, Bloch lines also constitute magnetic antiskyrmions, that is, topological antiparticles of skyrmions. Most domain walls occur as Bloch&#8208;type or N&#233;el&#8208;type, in which the magnetization rotates parallel or perpendicular to the domain wall across its profile, respectively. The Bloch lines&#8217; N&#233;el&#8208;type rotation and their minute size make them difficult to directly measure. This work utilizes differential phase contrast (DPC) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to measure the in&#8208;plane magnetization of Bloch lines within antiskyrmions emergent in a non&#8208;centrosymmetric Heusler magnet with D2d symmetry, Mn1.4Pt0.9Pd0.1Sn, in addition to Bloch&#8208;type skyrmions in an FeGe magnet with B20&#8208;type crystal structure to benchmark the DPC technique. Both in&#8208;focus measurement and identification of Bloch lines at the antiskyrmion's corners are provided.

Power consumption is one of the most challenging bottlenecks for complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8211;semiconductor integration. Negative&#8208;capacitance field&#8208;effect transistors (NC&#8208;FETs) offer a promising platform to break the thermionic limit defined by the Boltzmann tyranny and architect energy&#8208;efficient devices. However, it is a great challenge to achieving ultralow&#8208;subthreshold&#8208;swing (SS) (10&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) and small&#8208;hysteresis NC&#8208;FETs simultaneously at room temperature, which has only been reported using the hafnium zirconium oxide system. Here, based on a ferroelectric LiNbO3 thin film with great spontaneous polarization, an ultralow&#8208;SS NC&#8208;FET with small hysteresis is designed. The LiNbO3 NC&#8208;FET platform exhibits a record&#8208;low SS of 4.97&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 with great repeatability due to the superior capacitance matching characteristic as evidenced by the negative differential resistance phenomenon. By modulating the structure and operating parameters (such as channel length (Lch), drain&#8211;sourse bias (Vds), and gate bias (Vg)) of devices, an optimized SS from &#8776;40 to &#8776;10&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 and hysteresis from &#8776;900 to &#8776;60&#160;mV are achieved simultaneously. The results provide a new potential method for future highly integrated electronic and optical integrated energy&#8208;efficient devices.

The recent advancements in miniaturized cavity resonators employing three light engineering methods are discussed: 1) cladding engineering in subwavelength metal&#8208;clad cavities for room&#8208;temperature lasing and efficient waveguide coupling; 2) low&#8208;loss plasmonic cavities and waveguides engineered by plasmonic crystals; and 3) geometric engineering for photon squeezing into a deep&#8208;subwavelength space.








Abstract
Significant advances have been made in photonic integrated circuit technology, similar to the development of electronic integrated circuits. However, the miniaturization of cavity resonators, which are the essential components of photonic circuits, still requires considerable improvement. Over the past decades, various optical cavities have been utilized to implement next&#8208;generation light sources in photonic circuits with low energy, high data traffic, and integrable physical sizes. Nevertheless, it has been difficult to reduce the size of most commercialized cavities beyond the diffraction limit while maintaining high performance. Herein, recent advancements in subwavelength metallic cavities that can improve performance, even with the use of lossy plasmonic modes, are reviewed. The discussion is divided in three parts according to light engineering methods: subwavelength metal&#8208;clad cavities engineered using intermediate dielectric cladding; implementation of plasmonic cavities and waveguides using plasmonic crystals; and development of deep&#8208;subwavelength plasmonic waveguides and cavities using geometric engineering. A direction for further developments in photonic integrated circuit technology is also discussed, along with its practical application.

      <dc:description>
By virtue of the active role of DNAs, even conventional organic molecules widely used in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes can become bioactive and generate biospecific photonics. The fabrication of emerging hybrid assemblies of DNAs complexed with various organic semiconductors is described, together with their applications in the field of biophotonic electronics resulting from their endowed biofunctions.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors are photonic and electronic materials with high luminescence, quantum efficiency, color tunability, and size&#8208;dependent optoelectronic properties. The self&#8208;assembly of organic molecules enables the establishment of a fabrication technique for organic micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;architectures with well&#8208;defined shapes, tunable sizes, and defect&#8208;free structures. DNAs, a class of biomacromolecules, have recently been used as an engineering material capable of intricate nanoscale structuring while simultaneously storing biological genetic information. Here, the up&#8208;to&#8208;date research on hybrid materials made from organic semiconductors and DNAs is presented. The trends in photonic and electronic phenomena discovered in DNA&#8208;functionalized and DNA&#8208;driven organic semiconductor hybrids, comprising small molecules and polymers, are observed. Various hybrid forms of solutions, arrayed chips, nanowires, and crystalline particles are discussed, focusing on the role of DNA in the hybrids. Furthermore, the recent technical advances achieved in the integration of DNAs in light&#8208;emitting devices, transistors, waveguides, sensors, and biological assays are presented. DNAs not only serve as a recognizing element in organic&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;based sensors, but also as an active charge&#8208;control material in high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices.

      <title>A Multistage Cooperative Nanoplatform Enables Intracellular Co&#8208;Delivery of Proteins and Chemotherapeutics for Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
A multistage cooperative drug delivery nanoplatform is developed to concurrently load doxorubicin and phenylboronic&#8208;acid&#8208;modified RNase A through hydrophobic interactions and dynamic covalent conjugation, respectively. This nanoplatform efficiently delivers both cargos into tumor sites with high systemic stability and mediates low&#8208;pH&#8208; and ROS&#8208;triggered cooperative release of doxorubicin and RNase A within tumor cells, leading to enhanced combined anticancer efficacy.








Abstract
Combining intracellularly active proteins with chemotherapeutics represents a promising strategy for synergistic cancer therapy. However, the lack of nanocarrier systems for delivery into cancer cells and controlled intracellular release of both physicochemically very distinct cargos significantly impedes the biomedical translation of this combination strategy in cancer therapy. Here, a well&#8208;designed triblock copolymer, mPEG&#8208;b&#8208;PGCA&#8208;b&#8208;PGTA, is reported for application in a multistage cooperative drug delivery nanoplatform that accomplishes effective intracellular co&#8208;delivery of hydrophilic ribonuclease A (RNase A) and hydrophobic doxorubicin (DOX). RNase A bioreversibly modified with phenylboronic acid groups via a ROS&#8208;cleavable carbamate linker is incorporated into the triblock copolymer nanoparticles with high efficiency through a pH&#8208;reversible phenylboronic acid&#8211;catechol linkage. The reversible covalent conjugations between RNase A and the triblock copolymer endow the nanoparticles with high stability under normal physiological conditions. Upon cellular internalization, the cooperative release of DOX and RNase A from the triblock copolymer nanoparticles is triggered at multiple stages by endosomal acidic environment and subsequent DOX&#8208;enhanced intracellular ROS environment. This leads to enhanced synergistic anticancer effects as demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Given the versatility of dynamic covalent conjugations, this work provides a universal and stable platform for intracellular co&#8208;delivery of various combinations of proteins and chemotherapeutics.

      <title>Quantum Computing: Exploiting a Single&#8208;Crystal Environment to Minimize the Charge Noise on Qubits in Silicon (Adv. Mater. 40/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Atom qubits in silicon provide a promising platform for realising a scalable quantum computer. In article number 2003361, Michelle Simmons and co&#8208;workers present a qubit environment with a notably low level of charge noise achieved by hosting phosphorus atoms in an all&#8208;crystalline silicon substrate well&#8208;separated from surface and interface states. The level of charge noise experienced by the phosphorus atoms is sufficiently low to enable two&#8208;qubit gate fidelities above 99.99%, well within the 99% threshold required for error&#8208;correction.

      <title>Nano&#8208;Ligands: Independent Tuning of Nano&#8208;Ligand Frequency and Sequences Regulates the Adhesion and Differentiation of Stem Cells (Adv. Mater. 40/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2004300, Young Keun Kim, Heemin Kang, and co&#8208;workers report a magnetic nano&#8208;barcoding system that enables unique tunability of ligand frequency and nano&#8208;sequences to effectively regulate stem cell adhesion with no systemic toxicity in vivo. Low&#8208;frequency and terminally sequenced nano&#8208;ligands facilitate focal adhesion, mechanotransduction, and differentiation of stem cells.

      <dc:description>
The development of smart inks that change color and transparency in response to external stimuli is important in safety and anticounterfeiting. In article number 2003980, Kwang&#8208;Un Jeong and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that a secret code, written with thermoresponsive and polarization&#8208;dependent secret inks consisting of imidazolium&#8208;functionalized diacetylenes, can be deciphered by wearing polaroid glasses and the heat from torchlight.

      <title>High&#8208;Entropy Alloys: Irradiation&#8208;Induced Extremes Create Hierarchical Face&#8208;/Body&#8208;Centered&#8208;Cubic Phases in Nanostructured High Entropy Alloys (Adv. Mater. 39/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2002652, Lumin Wang and co&#8208;workers report that a nanoscale hierarchical dual&#8208;phase structure forms in a nanocrystalline NiFeCoCrCu high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy film via an ion&#8208;irradiation&#8208;induced face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (fcc) to body&#8208;centeredcubic (bcc) phase transformation. The microstructure of the material is represented in the top and bottom TEM images: a five&#8208;component high&#8208;entropy alloy, before (top) and after (bottom) ion&#8208;beam irradiation. Atoms are displaced in the induced &#8220;displacement cascade&#8221; (as shown in the top image). The two crystal models (top and bottom) show the atomic arrangement (bcc or fcc) in the resultant dual&#8208;phase structure.

      <title>Helical Peptide Nanofibers: Controlled Lengthwise Assembly of Helical Peptide Nanofibers to Modulate CD8+ T&#8208;Cell Responses (Adv. Mater. 39/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In nanofibers composed of self&#8208;assembling helical peptides, &#8220;capping&#8221; peptides can limit fiber growth and influence the character of immune responses raised by the materials. In article number 2003310, Joel H. Collier and co&#8208;workers design short peptides such that they self&#8208;assemble into immunologically active helical nanofibers. The lengths of these fibers, tailorable by the incorporation of structure&#8208;modifying peptides within the assemblies, influence the character of the immune responses they elicit.

      <title>Live&#8208;Cell Imaging: A Cyclometalated Iridium (III) Complex as a Microtubule Probe for Correlative Super&#8208;Resolution Fluorescence and Electron Microscopy (Adv. Mater. 39/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2003901, Zhongping Zhang, Yupeng Tian, Giuseppe Battaglia, and co&#8208;workers report the design of a cyclometalated iridium (III) complex that is capable of selectively binding with microtubules in living cells. They demonstrate that this probe is suitable for both super&#8208;resolution optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, and subsequently achieve correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) imaging.

      <title>Water Harvesting: A Moisture&#8208;Hungry Copper Complex Harvesting Air Moisture for Potable Water and Autonomous Urban Agriculture (Adv. Mater. 39/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2002936, Swee Ching Tan and co&#8208;workers report the synthesis of a moisture&#8208;hungry Cu&#8208;complex and use it for fabricating a &#8220;Smart Farm&#8221; device that can autonomously harvest atmospheric water during the night and release water during the day under natural sunlight. Driven by solar energy, the device enables self&#8208;sustaining irrigation, which can help to alleviate both water and food scarcity.
