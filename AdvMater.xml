         <title>Intense Circular Dichroism and Spin Selectivity in AgBiS2 Nanocrystals by Chiral Ligand Exchange</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral ligand exchange on nontoxic AgBiS2 nanocrystals (NCs) is developed. The bidentate binding attributed to strong ligand&#8208;NC interaction, including lattice distortion and charge transportation, both of which provide intense chiroptical behavior on AgBiS2 NC (one magnitude higher than the reported ligand exchange NCs). Further, a spintronic device is made, and the highest spin&#8208;polarization based on chiral nanocrystals is achieved.








Abstract
Chiral semiconducting nanomaterials offer many potential applications in photodetection, light emission, quantum information, and so on. However, it is difficult to achieve a strong circular dichroism (CD) signal in semiconducting nanocrystals (NCs) due to the complexity of chiral ligand surface engineering and multiple, uncertain mechanisms of chiroptical behavior. Here, a chiral ligand exchange strategy with cysteine on the ternary metal chalcogenide AgBiS2 NCs is developed, and a strong, long&#8208;lasting CD signal in the near&#8208;UV region is achieved. By carefully optimizing the ligand concentration, the CD peaks are observed at 260 and 320&#160;nm, respectively, giving insight into the different ligand binding mechanisms influencing the CD signal of AgBiS2 NCs. Using density&#8208;functional theory, a large degree of crystal distortion by the bidentate mode of ligand chelation, and efficient ligand&#8208;NC electron transfer, synergistically resulting in the strongest CD signal (g&#8208;factor over 10&#8722;2) observed in chiral ligand&#8208;exchanged semiconductor NCs to date, is demonstrated. To demonstrate the effective chiral properties of these AgBiS2 NCs, a spin&#8208;filter device with over 86% efficiency is fabricated. This work represents a considerable leap in the field of chiral semiconductor NCs and points toward their future applications.

         <title>Targeted Defect Repair and Multi&#8208;functional Interface Construction for the Direct Regeneration of Spent LiFePO4 Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic effect is utilized for repairing defects of spent LiFePO4 (SLFP) at low temperature and constructing a multifunctional carbon layer with N/S doped on the surface of the regenerated LFP (RLFP). The electrochemical properties of the RLFP are improved due to the enhanced conductivity, structure protection, and the improved kinetics of Li+ transport.








Abstract
Due to the low economic benefits and environmental pollution of traditional recycling methods, the disposal of spent LiFePO4 (SLFP) presents a significant challenge. The capacity fade of SLFP cathode is primarily caused by lithium loss and formation of a Fe (III) phase. Herein, a synergistic repair effect is proposed to achieve defect repair and multi&#8208;functional interface construction for the direct regeneration of SLFP. Tannic acid (TA) forms a compact coating precursor for a carbon layer on SLFP with abundant functional groups and creates a mildly acidic environment to enhance the reducibility of thiourea (TU). Therefore, TU reduces Fe (III) to Fe (II) and repairs Li&#8208;Fe anti&#8208;site defects of SLFP, while at the same time acting as a source of N/S&#8208;doping elements for the carbon layer at a lower temperature (140&#160;&#176;C). The multi&#8208;functional carbon layer improves the properties of the regenerated LiFePO4 (RLFP) due to the enhanced conductivity, structure maintenance and protection, and the improved kinetics of Li+ transport. Furthermore, the Fe&#9472;O and P&#9472;O bonds are strengthened, further enhancing the structural stability of the RLFP. Consequently, the RLFP demonstrates outstanding performance with a discharge capacity of 141.3 mAh g&#8722;1 and capacity retention of 72% after 1000 cycles at 1&#160;C.

         <title>Beyond Flexible: Unveiling the Next Era of Flexible Electronic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible electronics are essential in various fields like wearables, healthcare, and environmental sensing due to their flexibility, lightweight construction, and low profile. These systems conform to diverse surfaces, enhancing or replacing bulky instruments in many applications. This study reviews key components of standalone flexible electronics, integration strategies, and recent advancements, emphasizing flexible hybrid and transformational electronics, and concludes with future research directions and challenges.








Abstract
Flexible electronics are integral in numerous domains such as wearables, healthcare, physiological monitoring, human&#8211;machine interface, and environmental sensing, owing to their inherent flexibility, stretchability, lightweight construction, and low profile. These systems seamlessly conform to curvilinear surfaces, including skin, organs, plants, robots, and marine species, facilitating optimal contact. This capability enables flexible electronic systems to enhance or even supplant the utilization of cumbersome instrumentation across a broad range of monitoring and actuation tasks. Consequently, significant progress has been realized in the development of flexible electronic systems. This study begins by examining the key components of standalone flexible electronic systems&#8211;sensors, front&#8208;end circuitry, data management, power management and actuators. The next section explores different integration strategies for flexible electronic systems as well as their recent advancements. Flexible hybrid electronics, which is currently the most widely used strategy, is first reviewed to assess their characteristics and applications. Subsequently, transformational electronics, which achieves compact and high&#8208;density system integration by leveraging heterogeneous integration of bare&#8208;die components, is highlighted as the next era of flexible electronic systems. Finally, the study concludes by suggesting future research directions and outlining critical considerations and challenges for developing and miniaturizing fully integrated standalone flexible electronic systems.

         <title>Imaging Locally Inhomogeneous Properties of Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the locally inhomogeneous properties of metal halide perovskites. The available microscopic imaging techniques crucial for mapping these inhomogeneities are discussed. The insights into the impact of various inhomogeneities on performance of perovskite solar cells are provided. The technical aspects and experimental considerations of microscopic techniques are introduced, offering a comprehensive guide for researchers in the field.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are a perfect example of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photovoltaic materials whose compositional and structural diversity,&#160;coupled with utilization of low&#8208;temperature processing, can undesirably result in spatially inhomogeneous properties that locally vary within the material. This complexity of MHPs requires sensitive imaging characterization methods at the microscopic level to gauge the impact of such inhomogeneities on device performance and to formulate mitigation strategies. This review consolidates properties of MHPs that are susceptible to local variations and highlights appropriate imaging techniques that can be employed to map them. Inhomogeneities in morphology, emission, electrical response, and chemical composition of MHP thin films are specifically considered, and possible microscopic techniques for their visualization are reviewed. For each type of microscopy, a short discussion about spatial resolution, sample requirements, advantages, and limitations is provided, thus leaving the reader with a guide of available imaging characterization tools to evaluate inhomogeneities of their MHPs.

         <title>Simplified Lipid Nanoparticles for Tissue&#8208; And Cell&#8208;Targeted mRNA Delivery Facilitate Precision Tumor Therapy in a Lung Metastasis Mouse Model</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SELECT platform (Simplified LNP with Engineered mRNA for Cell&#8208;type Targeting) is designed to achieve organ&#8208; and cell&#8208; specific mRNA delivery by integrating LNP&#8208;based targeting and mRNA sequence&#8208;controlled expression. Combined with the delivery of tumor&#8208;selective killing protein (ELANE), such triple&#8208;selection approach enables precision tumor therapy in the lungs. SELECT thereby offers great potentials for mRNA&#8208;based precision therapy.








Abstract
mRNA&#8208;based applications have achieved remarkable success in the development of next&#8208;generation vaccines and the treatment of diverse liver diseases. Overcoming the challenge of delivering mRNA to extrahepatic tissues, especially specific cells within tissues, is crucial for precision therapy. In this study, a platform is developed for selective mRNA delivery to desired cells within tissues by combining lipid nanoparticle (LNP)&#8208;based targeted delivery with mRNA sequence&#8208;controlled expression. Through systematic optimization, a three&#8208;component LNP platform is developed, enabling targeted mRNA delivery to the lung, liver, and spleen. The incorporation of unique microRNA target sites into the mRNA scaffold further enhances control over protein translation in specific cells within the target tissue. This combined strategy, named SELECT (Simplified LNP with Engineered mRNA for Cell&#8208;type Targeting), demonstrates its efficacy in distinguishing mRNA expression between tumor and normal cells based on intracellular microRNA abundance. SELECT encapsulating mRNA encoding a tumor&#8208;specific cytotoxic protein, human ELANE, exhibits selective mRNA delivery to tumor lesions and significant inhibition of tumor growth in a mouse model of melanoma lung metastasis.

&lt;p&gt;The SELECT platform (Simplified LNP with Engineered mRNA for Cell-type Targeting) is designed to achieve organ- and cell- specific mRNA delivery by integrating LNP-based targeting and mRNA sequence-controlled expression. Combined with the delivery of tumor-selective killing protein (ELANE), such triple-selection approach enables precision tumor therapy in the lungs. SELECT thereby offers great potentials for mRNA-based precision therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mRNA-based applications have achieved remarkable success in the development of next-generation vaccines and the treatment of diverse liver diseases. Overcoming the challenge of delivering mRNA to extrahepatic tissues, especially specific cells within tissues, is crucial for precision therapy. In this study, a platform is developed for selective mRNA delivery to desired cells within tissues by combining lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based targeted delivery with mRNA sequence-controlled expression. Through systematic optimization, a three-component LNP platform is developed, enabling targeted mRNA delivery to the lung, liver, and spleen. The incorporation of unique microRNA target sites into the mRNA scaffold further enhances control over protein translation in specific cells within the target tissue. This combined strategy, named SELECT (Simplified LNP with Engineered mRNA for Cell-type Targeting), demonstrates its efficacy in distinguishing mRNA expression between tumor and normal cells based on intracellular microRNA abundance. SELECT encapsulating mRNA encoding a tumor-specific cytotoxic protein, human ELANE, exhibits selective mRNA delivery to tumor lesions and significant inhibition of tumor growth in a mouse model of melanoma lung metastasis. Overall, SELECT has great potential as a new precision tumor treatment approach and also offers promising prospects for other mRNA therapies targeting specific cell types.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polyoxometalate Reinforced Perovskite Phase for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic/inorganic hybrid polyoxometalate is developed to reinforce the halide perovskite ABX3 structure, involving the strategic regulation of cationic components to passivate A&#8208;site vacancy defects and metal ions to enhance electron shuttling at B&#8208; and X&#8208;site defects. The resulting device achieves an efficiency exceeding 25% with improved durability, showing the promise of using functional polyoxometalates to improve perovskite photovoltaics.








Abstract
Ionic hybrid perovskites face challenges in maintaining their structural stability against non&#8208;equilibrium phase degradation, therefore, it is essential to develop effective ways to reinforce their corner&#8208;shared [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedral units. To strengthen structural stability, redox&#8208;active functional polyoxometalates (POMs) are developed and incorporated into perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to form a robust polyoxometalates/perovskite interlayer for stabilizing the perovskite phase. This approach offers several advantages: 1) promotes the formation of an interfacial connecting layer to passivate interfacial defects in addition to stabilize the [PbI6]4&#8722; units through exchanged ammonium cations in POMs with perovskites; 2) facilitates continuous structural repairing of Pb0&#8208; and I0&#8208;rich defects in the [PbI6]4&#8722; unit through redox electron shuttling of the electroactive metal ions in POMs; 3) provides guidance for selecting suitable redox mediators based on the kinetic studies of POM's effectiveness in reacting with targeted defects. The POM&#8208;reinforced device maintains 97.2% of its initial PCE after 1500 h of shelf&#8208;life test at 65&#160;&#176;C, while also enhancing the long&#8208;term operational stability. Additionally, this approach can be generally applicable across scalable sizes and various bandgap perovskites in devices, showing the promise of using functional POMs to enhance perovskite photovoltaic performance.

         <title>A Near&#8208;Infrared Retinomorphic Device with High Dimensionality Reservoir Expression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared retinomorphic device featuring a core&#8208;shell upconversion nanoparticle/organic material nanocomposite channel, achieving simultaneous perception and encoding information. The synergy of photovoltaic and photogating effects ultimately determines device operates as dynamic reservoir with high expression power, nonlinearity response, short&#8208;term memory, multiple states, and large dynamic range for affordable reservoir computing&#8208;based edge learning, therefore unleashing potential of artificial infrared perception.








Abstract
Physical reservoir&#8208;based reservoir computing (RC) systems for intelligent perception have recently gained attention because they require fewer computing resources. However, the system remains limited in infrared (IR) machine vision, including materials and physical reservoir expression power. Inspired by biological visual perception systems, the study proposes a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) retinomorphic device that simultaneously perceives and encodes narrow IR spectral information (at &#8776;980&#160;nm). The proposed device, featuring core&#8208;shell upconversion nanoparticle/poly (3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) nanocomposite channels, enables the absorption and conversion of NIR into high&#8208;energy photons to excite more photo carriers in P3HT. The photon&#8208;electron&#8208;coupled dynamics under the synergy of photovoltaic and photogating effects influence the nonlinearity and high dimensionality of the RC system under narrow&#8208;band NIR irradiation. The device also exhibits multilevel data storage capability (&#8805;8 levels), excellent stability (&#8805;2000 s), and durability (&#8805;100 cycles). The system accurately identifies NIR static and dynamic handwritten digit images, achieving recognition accuracies of 91.13% and 90.07%, respectively. Thus, the device tackles intricate computations like solving second&#8208;order nonlinear dynamic equations with minimal errors (normalized mean squared error&#160;of 1.06 &#215; 10&#8315;3 during prediction).

         <title>Giant Decrease in Interfacial Energy of Liquid Metals by Native Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The native oxide of liquid metal (LM) lowers the interfacial energy from 700mN/m (bare metal) to &#8764;10 mN/m due to the anisotropy of the oxide: metallophilic inward&#8208;facing, and hydrophilic outward&#8208;facing interfaces. This decrease helps explain the unusual interfacial behavior of LM, such as adhesion to surfaces and dewetting of the metal from the oxide, including from an oxide&#8208;encased air bubble.








Abstract
Native oxides form on the surface of many metals. Here, using gallium&#8208;based liquid metal alloys, Johnson&#8208;Kendall&#8208;Roberts (JKR) measurements are employed to show that native oxide dramatically lower the tension of the metal interface from 724 to 10 mN&#160;m&#8722;1. Like conventional surfactants, the oxide has asymmetry between the composition of its internal and external interfaces. Yet, in comparison to conventional surfactants, oxides are an order of magnitude more effective at lowering tension and do not need to be added externally to the liquid (i.e., oxides form naturally on metals). This surfactant&#8208;like asymmetry explains the adhesion of oxide&#8208;coated metals to surfaces. The resulting low interfacial energy between the metal and the interior of the oxide helps stabilize non&#8208;spherical liquid metal structures. In addition, at small enough macroscopic contact angles, the finite tension of the liquid within the oxide can drive fluid instabilities that are useful for separating the oxide from the metal to form oxide&#8208;encased bubbles or deposit thin oxide films (1&#8211;5&#160;nm) on surfaces. Since oxides form on many metals, this work can have implications for a wide range of metals and metal oxides in addition to explaining the physical behavior of liquid metal.

         <title>Dynamically Favorable Ion Channels Enabled by a Hybrid Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conducting Film toward Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid film composed of g&#8208;C3N4 and conductive polymers (CP) of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)&#8208;poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is introduced to Zn anode via a scalable spray&#8208;coating strategy. The g&#8208;C3N4 promotes a screening effect, disrupting the coulombic interaction between the PEDOT+ segments and PSS&#8722; chains within CP, thereby endowing the Zn anode with dynamically favorable ion channels and pH&#8208;buffering capability.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries show great promise for future applications due to their high safety and ecofriendliness. However, nonuniform dendrite growth and parasitic reactions on the Zn anode have severely impeded their use. Herein, a hybrid ionic&#8208;electronic conducting ink composed of graphene&#8208;like carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) and conductive polymers (CP) of poly(3,4ethylenedioxythiophene)&#8208;poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is introduced to Zn anode using a scalable spray&#8208;coating strategy. Notably, the g&#8208;C3N4 promotes a screening effect, disrupting the coulombic interaction between the PEDOT+ segments and PSS&#8722; chains within CP, thereby reducing interfacial resistance and homogenizing the surface electric field distribution of the Zn anode. Furthermore, the abundant N&#8208;containing species and &#9472;SO3&#8722; groups in g&#8208;C3N4/CP exhibit strong zincophilicity, which accelerates the diffusion of Zn2+ and disrupts the solvation structure of Zn(H2O)62+, thus improving the Zn2+ transfer capability. Consequently, the g&#8208;C3N4/CP can powerfully stabilize the Zn2+ flux and thus enable a high coulombic efficiency of 99.47% for 1500 cycles and smooth Zn plating/stripping behaviors more than 3000&#160;h at a typical current density of 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. These findings shed new light on the Zn electrodeposition process under the mediation of g&#8208;C3N4/CP and offer sustainability considerations in designing more stable Zn&#8208;metal anodes with enhanced reversibility.

Consequently, the g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CP can powerfully stabilize the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; flux and thus enable a high coulombic efficiency of 99.47% for 1500 cycles and smooth Zn plating/stripping behaviors more than 3000&#160;h at a typical current density of 1&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These findings shed new light on the Zn electrodeposition process under the mediation of g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CP and offer sustainability considerations in designing more stable Zn-metal anodes with enhanced reversibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Super&#8208;Tough, Non&#8208;Swelling Zwitterionic Hydrogel Sensor Based on the Hofmeister Effect for Potential Motion Monitoring of Marine Animals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, based on the Hoffmeister effect of sulfuric acid and polyzwitterions that promote numerous nanocrystalline domains in PVA chains, a super&#8208;tough and non&#8208;swelling double&#8208;network hydrogel is designed. Due to its excellent underwater sensing performance, the oceanic strain sensor based on the hydrogel successfully demonstrates long&#8208;term and stable motion monitoring of marine animal models.








Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based electronic devices in aquatic environments have sparked widespread research interest. Nevertheless, the challenge of developing hydrogel electronics underwater has not been profoundly surmounted because of the fragility and swelling of hydrogels in aquatic environments. In this work, a zwitterionic double network hydrogel comprised&#160;of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (PSBMA), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) demonstrates super&#8208;tough and non&#8208;swelling performance. The Hofmeister effect of H2SO4 and PSBMA induces the PVA chains to form numerous nanocrystalline domains, which serve as the primary physical crosslinking points and provide effective energy dissipation. H2SO4 induces a strong salting&#8208;out effect to facilitate PVA crystallization and the formation of a dense and stable network structure that inhibits swelling. The resulting hydrogel exhibits an ultra&#8208;high toughness of 4.61&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, non&#8208;swelling, and long&#8208;term stability for up to a month in pure water and seawater. Based on this, a hydrogel&#8208;based seawater strain sensor has been developed to monitor the underwater movements of marine animal models. Reliable and stable sensing performance ensures real&#8208;time collection of underwater motion signals, despite the impacts of water flow and the interference of ions. This study provides a facile approach to designing super&#8208;tough and non&#8208;swelling hydrogels and further expands the application of underwater electronic devices.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Anchoring of Co Single&#8208;Atom Synergistically with Cd Vacancy of Cadmium Sulfide for Boosting Asymmetric Charge Distribution and Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the single atom catalyst is conducted in parallel with hydrogen evolution reaction under simulated sunlight irradiation and the synergy between electron delocalization VCd and Co single atom is constructed on in&#8208;situ synthesized Co5:DCdS, which bifunctional sites severally liable for boosting water adsorption&#8208;dissociation and weakening hydrogen evolution energy barrier.








Abstract
In the context of reshaping the energy pattern, designing and synthesizing high&#8208;performance noble metal&#8208;free photocatalysts with ultra&#8208;high atomic utilization for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) still remains a&#160;challenge. In a streamlined synthesis process, in&#8208;situ single atom anchoring is performed in parallel with HER by irradiating a precursory defect&#8208;state CdS/Co suspension (Co&#8208;DCdS&#8208;Ss) system under simulated sunlight and the in&#8208;situ synthesizing single&#8208;atom Co photocatalyst (Co5:DCdS) exhibits further improved catalytic performance (60.10 mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) compared with Co&#8208;DCdS&#8208;Ss (18.09 mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1), reaching an apparent quantum yield of 57.6% at 500&#160;nm and a solar&#8208;chemical energy conversion efficiency (SCC) of 6.26% at AM 1.5G. In&#8208;depth characterization tests and density functional theory (DFT) calculations prove that the anchoring of Co single atom deepens the asymmetric charge distribution of the two&#8208;coordination S atom adjacent to the cadmium vacancy (VCd). The synergy between electron delocalization VCd and Co single atom on the catalyst surface is constructed, which bifunctional sites responsible for boosting water adsorption&#8208;dissociation and hydrogen evolution. This study advances the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of synergy between surface defects and metal single atoms and opens a new horizon for the development of advanced materials in the field of photocatalysis.

         <title>3D Bioprinting of Liquid High&#8208;Cell&#8208;Proportion Bioinks in Liquid Granular Bath</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There are challenges for extrusion 3D bioprinting in simultaneously satisfying the requirements of high&#8208;cell&#8208;activity, high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion, and low&#8208;viscosity bioinks, which allows the establishment of improved cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell communication and enhanced biological. Here, liquid high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion GelMA are found to be printed in liquid granular through ink&#8208;bath electrostatic interaction, that is, liquid&#8208;in&#8208;liquid 3D bioprinting (LL3DBP).








Abstract
Embedded 3D bioprinting techniques have emerged as a powerful method to fabricate 3D engineered constructs&#160;using low strength bioinks; however, there are challenges in simultaneously satisfying the requirements of high&#8208;cell&#8208;activity, high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion, and low&#8208;viscosity bioinks. In particular, the printing capacity of embedded 3D bioprinting is limited as two main challenges: spreading and diffusion, especially for liquid, high&#8208;cell&#8208;activity bioinks that can facilitate high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion. Here, a liquid&#8208;in&#8208;liquid 3D bioprinting (LL3DBP) strategy is developed, which used a liquid granular bath to prevent the spreading of liquid bioinks during 3D printing, and electrostatic interaction between the liquid bioinks and liquid granular baths is found to effectively prevent the diffusion of liquid bioinks. As an example, the printing of positively charged 5% w/v gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) in a liquid granular bath prepared with negatively charged &#954;&#8208;carrageenan is proved to be achievable. By LL3DBP, printing capacity is greatly advanced and bioinks with over 90% v/v cell can be printed, and printed structures with high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion exhibit excellent bioactivity.

         <title>Accelerating Li&#8208;Ion Diffusion in LiFePO4 by Polyanion Lattice Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyanion lattice engineering strategy is applied on LiFePO4, with planar triangle BO33&#8722; substituting tetrahedron PO43&#8722; to induce more flexibility and provide additional paths between Li&#8208;ion diffusion channels. These synergetically contribute to accelerate the Li&#8208;ion diffusion, which have outstanding high&#8208;rate and low&#8208;temperature battery performances. This method may be extended to the other polyanionic materials.








Abstract
Despite the widespread commercialization of LiFePO4 as cathodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, the rigid 1D Li&#8208;ion diffusion channel along the [010] direction strongly limits its fast charge and discharge performance. Herein, lattice engineering is developed by the planar triangle BO33&#8722; substitution on tetrahedron PO43&#8722; to induce flexibility in the Li&#8208;ion diffusion channels, which are broadened simultaneously. The planar structure of BO33&#8722; may further provide additional paths between the channels. With these synergetic contributions, LiFe(PO4)0.98(BO3)0.02 shows the best performance, which delivers the high&#8208;rate capacity (66.8 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 50 C) and long cycle stability (ultra&#8208;low capacity loss of 0.003% every cycle at 10 C) at 25&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, excellent rate performance (34.0 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 40 C) and capacity retention (no capacity loss after 2500 cycles at 10 C) at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C are realized.

         <title>Domain Dynamics Response to Polarization Switching in Relaxor Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A clear and direct link between micro domain dynamics and macro polarization switching in relaxors is established by integrating ex/in situ multiscale characterizations with theoretical analyses grounded in the Landau&#8208;Ginzburg&#8208;Devonshire (LGD) thermodynamic model. The gains can serve as a guiding principle for the precise manipulation of polarization switching, strategic design, and optimization of relaxors.








Abstract
Nanoscale polar regions, or nanodomains (NDs), are crucial for understanding the domain structure and high susceptibility of relaxors. However, unveiling the evolution and function of NDs during polarization switching at the microscopic level is of great challenge. The experimental in situ characterization of NDs under electric&#8208;field perturbations, and computational accurate prediction of the dipole switching within a sufficiently large supercell, are notoriously tricky and tedious. These difficulties hinder a full understanding of the link between micro domain dynamics and macro polarization switching. Herein, the real&#8208;time evolution of NDs at the nanoscale is observed and visualized during polarization switching in an exemplary relaxor system of Bi5&#8208;xLaxMg0.5Ti3.5O15. Two fundamentally different domain switching pathways and dynamic characteristics are revealed: one steep, bipolar&#8208;like switching between two degenerate polarization states; and another flat, multi&#8208;step switching process with a thermodynamically stable non&#8208;polar mesophase mediating the degenerate polarization states. The two are determined by the distinct Landau energy landscapes that are strongly dependent on the intrinsic domain configurations and interdomain interactions. This work bridges the gap between micro domain dynamics and macro polarization switching, providing a guiding principle for the strategic design and optimization of relaxors.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Seed Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Anode&#8208;Less All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anode&#8208;less all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery system reported here operates at room temperature by employing dual seeds in the anode protection layer. Lithiophilic silver (Ag) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles promote multistep lithiation for high lithium diffusivity during charge and yield Ag&#8211;Zn alloy with high ductility during discharge, both of which contribute to stabilizing the anode|solid electrolyte interface for extended cycle life.









Abstract
Interest in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), particularly the anode&#8208;less type, has grown alongside the expansion of the electric vehicle (EV) market, because they offer advantages in terms of their energy density and manufacturing cost. However, in most anode&#8208;less ASSBs, the anode is covered by a protective layer to ensure stable lithium (Li) deposition, thus requiring high temperatures to ensure adequate Li ion diffusion kinetics through the protective layer. This study proposes a dual&#8208;seed protective layer consisting of silver (Ag) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles for sulfide&#8208;based anode&#8208;less ASSBs. This dual&#8208;seed&#8208;based protective layer not only facilitates Li diffusion via multiple lithiation pathways over a wide range of potentials, but also enhances the mechanical stability of the anode interface through the in situ formation of a Ag&#8211;Zn alloy with high ductility. The capacity retention during full&#8208;cell evaluation is 80.8% for 100 cycles when cycled at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with 3 mAh cm&#8722;2 at room temperature. The dual&#8208;seed approach provides useful insights into the design of multi&#8208;seed concepts in which, from a mechanochemical perspective, various lithiophilic materials synergistically impact upon the anode&#8208;less interface.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Morphing in Oxide Ceramic Kirigami Nanomembranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;dimensional multiferroic nanomembrane architectures with stretchability and shape reconfigurability are demonstrated. Complex 3&#8208;D microarchitectures such as kirigami frames are fabricated using strain and geometrical engineering. Large mechanical deformation by stretching and dynamic shape&#8208;morphing by electric stimuli are demonstrated. These findings open new avenues in the actuation of microscale 3&#8208;D architectures, showcasing the potential of smart materials, micro robotics, and microelectromechanical systems.








Abstract
Interfacial strain engineering in ferroic nanomembranes can broaden the scope of ferroic nanomembrane assembly as well as facilitate the engineering of multiferroic&#8208;based devices with enhanced functionalities. Geometrical engineering in these material systems enables the realization of 3&#8208;D architectures with unconventional physical properties. Here, 3&#8208;D multiferroic architectures are introduced by incorporating barium titanate (BaTiO3, BTO) and cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4, CFO) bilayer nanomembranes. Using photolithography and substrate etching techniques, complex 3&#8208;D microarchitectures including helices, arcs, and kirigami&#8208;inspired frames are developed. These 3&#8208;D architectures exhibit remarkable mechanical deformation capabilities, which can be attributed to the superelastic behavior of the membranes and geometric configurations. It is also demonstrated that dynamic shape reconfiguration of these nanomembrane architectures under electron beam exposure showcases their potential as electrically actuated microgrippers and for other micromechanical applications. This research highlights the versatility and promise of multi&#8208;dimensional ferroic nanomembrane architectures in the fields of micro actuation, soft robotics, and adaptive structures, paving the way for incorporating these architectures into stimulus&#8208;responsive materials and devices.

         <title>Tailoring Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Tetraborylated Multiple Resonance Emitter for High&#8208;Performance Blue OLED</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a novel &#8220;short&#8208;range charge&#8208;transfer region regulation&#8221; design strategy is proposed toward the goal of ultra&#8208;narrowband blue emitters. The corresponding device exhibits leading performance for pure&#8208;blue OLEDs, with excellent efficiencies of 36.4%, 49.1&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1, and 51.4&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1, a record high luminescence of 9.0 &#215; 105&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, an ultra&#8208;small FWHM of 15&#160;nm and a CIEy coordinate of 0.20.








Abstract
Ultra&#8208;narrowband multiple resonance (MR) emitters are a key component in the fabrication of highly efficient and stable blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). To explore the theoretical boundaries of wavelength and full width at half maximum (FWHM) in blue emitters, the currently narrowest boron&#8208;based MR emitter is carefully designed by integrating the superior v&#8208;DABNA and BBCz&#8208;DB structures under the auspices of the ingenious short&#8208;range charge&#8208;transfer region regulation strategy. The target tetraboron compound TB&#8208;PB demonstrates a blue emission with an emission maximum of 473&#160;nm, a small FWHM of 12&#160;nm and a CIEy coordinate of 0.14. Benefiting from the emitter's high photoluminescence quantum yield (99%), low excited&#8208;state energy (2.74&#160;eV) and short delayed fluorescence lifetime (0.53&#160;&#181;s), the corresponding OLED achieves exceptional efficiencies of 36.4%, 49.1&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1, and 51.4&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1 with a record&#8208;high luminescence of 9.0&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, an ultra&#8208;narrow FWHM of 15&#160;nm and a CIEy coordinate of 0.20.

         <title>Magnesium Nanocomposite Hydrogel Reverses the Pathologies to Enhance Mandible Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The innovative design offers an injectable bone substitute that addresses various detrimental pathologies associated with medication&#8208;related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). It promotes vascularization, reduces inflammation, activates stem cells, and inhibits pathogens. The convenient implantation, assistance in blood clotting, and robust osteopromotive effects make it a promising solution for filling irregular bone defects and realizing functional regeneration.








Abstract
The healing of bone defects after debridement in medication&#8208;related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a challenging medical condition with impaired angiogenesis, susceptible infection, and pro&#8208;inflammatory responses. Magnesium (Mg) nanocomposite hydrogel is developed to specifically tackle multiple factors involved in MRONJ. Mg&#8208;oxide nanoparticles tune the gelation kinetics in the reaction between N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide&#8208;functionalized hyperbranched poly (ethylene glycol) and proteins.

&lt;p&gt;The innovative design offers an injectable bone substitute that addresses various detrimental pathologies associated with medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). It promotes vascularization, reduces inflammation, activates stem cells, and inhibits pathogens. The convenient implantation, assistance in blood clotting, and robust osteopromotive effects make it a promising solution for filling irregular bone defects and realizing functional regeneration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The healing of bone defects after debridement in medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a challenging medical condition with impaired angiogenesis, susceptible infection, and pro-inflammatory responses. Magnesium (Mg) nanocomposite hydrogel is developed to specifically tackle multiple factors involved in MRONJ. Mg-oxide nanoparticles tune the gelation kinetics in the reaction between N-hydroxysuccinimide-functionalized hyperbranched poly (ethylene glycol) and proteins. This reaction allows an enhanced mechanical property after instant solidification and, more importantly, also stable gelation in challenging environments such as wet and hemorrhagic conditions. The synthesized hydrogel guides mandible regeneration in MRONJ rats by triggering the formation of type H vessels, activating Osterix+ osteoprogenitor cells, and generating anti-inflammatory microenvironments. Additionally, this approach demonstrates its ability to suppress infection by inhibiting specific pathogens while strengthening stress tolerance in the affected alveolar bone. Furthermore, the enhanced osteogenic properties and feasibility of implantation of the hydrogel are validated in mandible defect and iliac crest defect created in minipigs, respectively. Collectively, this study offers an injectable and innovative bone substitute to enhance mandible defect healing by tackling multiple detrimental pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrahigh Energy&#8208;Storage in Dual&#8208;Phase Relaxor Ferroelectric Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is presented to enhance the dielectric energy&#8208;storage performance by constructing a dual&#8208;phase structure through in situ phase separation. By capitalizing on the synergistic effects of the dual perovskite structure configuration, a record&#8208;high energy density of 23.6&amp;amp;#x000A0;J&amp;amp;#x000A0;cm&#8722;3 with an efficiency of 92% is achieved in a bulk ceramic capacitor.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance dielectric energy&#8208;storage ceramics are beneficial for electrostatic capacitors used in various electronic systems. However, the trade&#8208;off between reversible polarizability and breakdown strength poses a significant challenge in simultaneously achieving high energy density and efficiency. Here a strategy is presented to address this issue by constructing a dual&#8208;phase structure through in situ phase separation. (Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3&#8208;BaTiO3&#8208;based relaxor ferroelectric ceramics are developed, creating a grain&#8208;separated dual perovskite phase structure using a facile solid&#8208;state reaction method. These ceramics feature two interactive relaxor phases with diversified nanoscale polar structures and heterogeneous grain boundaries, synergistically contributing to high polarization with low hysteresis, substantially increased resistivity, and suppressed electrostrain. Remarkably, a record&#8208;high energy density of 23.6&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 with a high efficiency of 92% under 99&#160;kV&#160;mm&#8722;1 is achieved in the bulk ceramic capacitor. This strategy holds promise for enhancing overall energy&#8208;storage performance and related functionalities in ferroelectrics.

This work reports the fabrication of dual Fe/I single atoms anchored on N&#8208;doped carbon nanorods (Fe/I&#8208;N&#8208;CR). Benefiting from the novel design of dual Fe/I single atoms and the structural advantages of 1D ultrafine nanorods, the Fe/I&#8208;N&#8208;CR catalyst delivers excellent oxygen reduction performance. In addition, wide&#8208;temperature adaptability from &#8208;40 to 60 &#176;C are realized for the Fe/I&#8208;N&#8208;CR&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air batteries. 








Abstract
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts are essential for widespread application of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs), but the well&#8208;known Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) suffer from low activity and stability because of unfavorable strong adsorption of oxygenated intermediates. Herein, the study synthesizes dual Fe/I single atoms anchored on N&#8208;doped carbon nanorods (Fe/I&#8208;N&#8208;CR) via a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;mediated two&#8208;step tandem&#8208;pyrolysis method. Atomic&#8208;level I doping modulates the electronic structure of Fe&#8208;Nx centers via the long&#8208;range electron delocalization effect. Benefitting from the synergistic effect of dual Fe/I single&#8208;atom sites and the structural merits of 1D nanorods, the Fe/I&#8208;N&#8208;CR catalyst shows excellent ORR activity and stability, superior to Pt/C and Fe or I SACs. When the Fe/I&#8208;N&#8208;CR is employed as cathode for quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZABs, a high power density of 197.9&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and an ultralong cycling lifespan of 280&#160;h at 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 are both achieved, greatly exceeding those of commercial Pt/C+IrO2 (119.1&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and 47&#160;h). In addition, wide&#8208;temperature adaptability and superior stability from &#8722;40 to 60 &#176;C are realized for the Fe/I&#8208;N&#8208;CR&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZABs. This work provides a MOF&#8208;mediated two&#8208;step tandem&#8208;pyrolysis strategy to engineer high&#8208;performance dual SACs with metal/nonmetal centers for ORR and sustainable ZABs.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Healing, Flowable, Yet Solid Electrolyte Suppresses Li&#8208;Metal Morphological Instabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries encounter challenges including dendrite penetration, electrode&#8211;electrolyte delamination, and void/crack formation. Here, by deploying a novel composite electrolyte system comprising nonconstrained ceramics within dynamic polymers, self&#8208;healing capability, flowability, and solid properties are successfully integrated into one material. Utilizing this electrolyte, the Li0&#8208;NMC811 full cell demonstrates stable operation at high current density (5 mA cm&#8722;2) for 1100 cycles.








Abstract
Lithium metal (Li0) solid&#8208;state batteries encounter implementation challenges due to dendrite formation, side reactions, and movement of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface in cycling. Notably, voids and cracks formed during battery fabrication/operation are hot spots for failure. Here, a self&#8208;healing, flowable yet solid electrolyte composed of mobile ceramic crystals embedded in a reconfigurable polymer network is reported. This electrolyte can auto&#8208;repair voids and cracks through a two&#8208;step self&#8208;healing process that occurs at a fast rate of 5.6&#160;&#181;m h&#8722;1. A dynamical phase diagram is generated, showing the material can switch between liquid and solid forms in response to external strain rates. The flowability of the electrolyte allows it to accommodate the electrode volume change during Li0 stripping. Simultaneously, the electrolyte maintains a solid form with high tensile strength (0.28&#160;MPa), facilitating the regulation of mossy Li0 deposition. The chemistries and kinetics are studied by operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray and in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Solid&#8208;state NMR reveals a dual&#8208;phase ion conduction pathway and rapid Li+ diffusion through the stable polymer&#8208;ceramic interphase. This designed electrolyte exhibits extended cycling life in Li0&#8211;Li0 cells, reaching 12&#160;000 h at 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 5000 h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, owing to its high critical current density of 9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the Li0&#8211;LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) full cell demonstrates stable cycling at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 1100 cycles, retaining 88% of its capacity, even under near&#8208;zero stack pressure conditions.

         <title>High Efficiency n&#8208;Type Doping of Organic Semiconductors by Cation Exchange</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a high&#8208;efficiency n&#8208;type doping method for organic semiconductors through cation exchange, achieving high doping levels while preserving the material's structural integrity, thereby leading to high electrical conductivity. The method holds great potential for improving the performance of organic electronic devices, including thermoelectric and solar cells.








Abstract
Achieving efficient doping in n&#8208;type conjugated polymers is crucial for their application in electronic devices. In this study, an n&#8208;type doping method is developed based on cation exchange that maintains a high doping level while ensuring a high degree of structural order, leading to significantly improved electrical conductivity. By investigating various dopants and ionic liquids, it is discovered that the choice of dopant influences doping efficiency, while the selection of ionic liquid affects cation exchange efficiency. Through careful selection of suitable dopants and ionic liquids, High doping levels are achieved remarkably in a short period, resulting in the highest conductivity (nearly 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;&#185;) compared to other doping methods for poly{[N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;octyldodecyl)&#8208;naphthalene&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;bis(dicarboximide)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl]&#8208;alt&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene)} (N2200). The findings highlight the robustness and efficiency of cation exchange doping as an effective approach for achieving high&#8208;quality n&#8208;type doping in conjugated polymers, thereby opening new avenues for the development of advanced polymer&#8208;based electronic devices.

Schematic illustration of the periodic single&#8208;metal site catalysts (PSMSCs) with the atomically dispersed and uniform structure of metal sites, exhibiting enhanced activity, optimized selectivity, mechanism exploration ability, predictable reactivity, and intricate reaction suitability.








Abstract
Heterogeneous single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalysts (SMSCs), often referred to as single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), demonstrate promising catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability across a wide spectrum of reactions due to their rationally designed microenvironments encompassing coordination geometry, binding ligands, and electronic configurations. However, the inherent disorderliness of SMSCs at both atomic scale and nanoscale poses challenges in deciphering working principles and establishing the correlations between microenvironments and the catalytic performances of SMSCs. The rearrangement of randomly dispersed single metals into homogeneous and atomic&#8208;precisely structured periodic single&#8208;metal site catalysts (PSMSCs) not only simplifies the chaos in SMSCs systems but also unveils new opportunities for manipulating catalytic performance and gaining profound insights into reaction mechanisms. Moreover, the synergistic effects of adjacent single metals and the integration effects of periodic single&#8208;metal arrangement further broaden the industrial application scope of SMSCs. This perspective offers a comprehensive overview of recent advancements and outlines prospective avenues for research in the design and characterizations of PSMSCs, while also acknowledging the formidable challenges encountered and the promising prospects that lie ahead.

         <title>Autonomous Atmospheric Water Harvesting over a Wide RH Range Enabled by Super Hygroscopic Composite Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium alginate/carbon nanotubes/magnesium complexes&#160;(SA/CNTs/MC) composite aerogel is developed with high water uptake and rapid water vapor absorption/desorption kinetics.&#160;A fully solar&#8208;driven autonomous atmospheric water generator is designed and constructed with two SA/CNTs/MC&#8208;based absorption layers, which can alternately conduct the water absorption/desorption process without any other energy consumption.








Abstract
Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) offers a sustainable strategy to address the global freshwater shortage. However, obtaining sorbents with excellent performance over a wide relative humidity (RH) range and devices with fully autonomous water production remains challenging. Herein, magnesium chloride (MgCl2) is innovatively converted into super hygroscopic magnesium complexes(MC), which can effectively solve the problems of salt deliquescence and agglomeration. The MC are then integrated with photothermal aerogels composed of sodium alginate and carbon nanotubes (SA/CNTs) to form composite aerogels, which showed high water uptake over a wide RH range, reaching 5.43 and 0.27&#160;kg kg&#8722;1 at 95% and 20% RH, respectively. The hierarchical porous structure enables the as&#8208;prepared SA/CNTs/MC to exhibit rapid absorption/desorption kinetics with 12 cycles per day at 70% RH, equivalent to a water yield of 10.0 L kg&#8722;1 day&#8722;1. To further realize continuous and practical freshwater production, a fully solar&#8208;driven autonomous atmospheric water generator is designed and constructed with two SA/CNTs/MC&#8208;based absorption layers, which can alternately conduct the water absorption/desorption process without any other energy consumption. The design provides a promising approach to achieving autonomous, high&#8208;performance, and scalable SAWH.

         <title>Bioinspired Capillary Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric re&#8208;entrant structures with long overhangs and connected forward/lateral microchannels are 3D printed to promote the unidirectional capillary rise, whose capillary heights have approached the theoretical limits. Capillary transistors based on asymmetric and symmetric re&#8208;entrant structures are proposed to provide a new strategy for microfluidic devices in 3D space.








Abstract
Inspired by the unidirectional liquid spreading on Nepenthes peristome, Araucaria leaf, butterfly wings, etc., various microfluidic devices have been developed for water collection, irrigation, physical/chemical reaction, and oil&#8211;water separation. Despite extensive progress, most natural and artificial structures fail to enhance the Laplace pressure difference or capillary force, thus suffering from a low unidirectional capillary height (&lt;30&#160;mm). In this work, asymmetric re&#8208;entrant structures with long overhangs and connected forward/lateral microchannels are fabricated by 3D printing, resulting in a significantly increased unidirectional capillary height of 102.3&#160;mm for water, which approximately corresponds to the theoretical limit. The overhangs can partially overlap the forward microchannels of the front structures without direct contact, thus enhancing the Laplace pressure difference and capillary force simultaneously. Based on asymmetric and symmetric re&#8208;entrant structures, capillary transistors are proposed and realized to programmably adjust the capillary direction, height, and width, which are envisioned to function as switches/valves and amplifiers/attenuators for highly efficient liquid patterning, desalination, and biochemical microreaction in 3D space.

         <title>Biointerface&#8208;Engineered Hybrid Nanovesicles for Targeted Reprogramming of Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoplatform combining M1&#8208;like macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes and AS1411 aptamer&#8208;modified liposomes is developed, as P&#8208;I@M1E/AALs, exhibiting enhanced cargo&#8208;loading capability and stability. P&#8208;I@M1E/AALs can effectively facilitate oxygen and photosensitizer delivery, achieving in situ engineering of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and alleviation of tumor hypoxia. This approach reprograms tumor microenvironment and suppresses tumor growth, demonstrating a promising strategy for antitumor therapy.








Abstract
The tumor microenvironment (TME) of typical tumor types such as triple&#8208;negative breast cancer is featured by hypoxia and immunosuppression with abundant tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), which also emerge as potential therapeutic targets for antitumor therapy. M1&#8208;like macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes (M1&#8208;Exos) have emerged as a promising tumor therapeutic candidate for their tumor&#8208;targeting and macrophage&#8208;polarization capabilities. However, the limited drug&#8208;loading efficiency and stability of M1&#8208;Exos have hindered their effectiveness in antitumor applications. Here, a hybrid nanovesicle is developed by integrating M1&#8208;Exos with AS1411 aptamer&#8208;conjugated liposomes (AApt&#8208;Lips), termed M1E/AALs. The obtained M1E/AALs are loaded with&#160;perfluorotributylamine (PFTBA)&#160;and IR780, as P&#8208;I, to construct P&#8208;I@M1E/AALs for reprogramming TME by alleviating tumor hypoxia and engineering TAMs. P&#8208;I@M1E/AAL&#8208;mediated tumor therapy enhances the in situ generation of reactive oxygen species, repolarizes TAMs toward an antitumor phenotype, and promotes the infiltration of T lymphocytes. The synergistic antitumor therapy based on P&#8208;I@M1E/AALs significantly suppresses tumor growth and prolongs the survival of 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice. By integrating multiple treatment modalities, P&#8208;I@M1E/AAL nanoplatform demonstrates a promising therapeutic approach for overcoming hypoxic and immunosuppressive TME by targeted TAM reprogramming and enhanced tumor photodynamic immunotherapy. This study highlights an innovative TAM&#8208;engineering hybrid nanovesicle platform for the treatment of tumors characterized by hypoxic and immunosuppressive TME.

         <title>Highly Efficient Wide Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells With Tunneling Junction by Self&#8208;Assembled 2D Dielectric Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembled 2D perovskite layer (BA&#8322;PbBr&#8324;) is engineered as a tunneling layer to mitigate the band alignment mismatch between SnO&#8322; and wide bandgap perovskite layers. This approach significantly enhanced the open&#8208;circuit voltage, achieving values of 1.30 and 1.33&#160;V, and resulted in power conversion efficiencies of 21.54% and 19.16% for bandgaps of 1.7 and 1.8 eV, respectively.








Abstract
Reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination and addressing band alignment mismatches at interfaces remain major challenges in achieving high&#8208;performance wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells. This study proposes the self&#8208;organization of a thin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite BA2PbBr4 layer beneath a wide&#8208;bandgap three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskite Cs0.17FA0.83Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3, forming a 2D/3D bilayer structure on a tin oxide (SnO2) layer. This process is driven by interactions between the oxygen vacancies on the SnO2 surface and hydrogen atoms of the n&#8208;butylammonium cation, aiding the self&#8208;assembly of the BA2PbBr4 2D layer. The 2D perovskite acts as a tunneling layer between SnO2 and the 3D perovskite, neutralizing the energy level mismatch and reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination. This results in high power conversion efficiencies of 21.54% and 19.16% for wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells with bandgaps of 1.7 and 1.8 eV, with open&#8208;circuit voltages over 1.3 V under 1&#8208;Sun illumination. Furthermore, an impressive efficiency of over 43% is achieved under indoor conditions, specifically under 200 lux white light&#8208;emitting diode light, yielding an output voltage exceeding 1 V. The device also demonstrates enhanced stability, lasting up to 1,200 hours.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Enzymatic Microgels for Precise Hydrogel Sculpturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magneto&#8208;enzymatic microgels, consisting of collagenase and magnetic nanoparticles, are used to sculpt internal channels within biomimetic hydrogels through the synergy of enzymatic degradation and remote magnetic guidance. This approach enhances cell viability by optimizing nutrient and oxygen distribution beyond conventional methods. Wireless control enables intricate hydrogel topographies, advancing vascularization and targeted drug delivery, marking a notable achievement in biofabrication.








Abstract
The inclusion of hollow channels in tissue&#8208;engineered hydrogels is crucial for mimicking the natural physiological conditions and facilitating the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to cells. Although bio&#8208;fabrication techniques provide diverse strategies to create these channels, many require sophisticated equipment and time&#8208;consuming protocols. Herein, collagenase, a degrading agent for methacrylated gelatin hydrogels, and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are combined and processed into enzymatically active spherical structures using a straightforward oil bath emulsion methodology. The generated microgels are then used to microfabricate channels within biomimetic hydrogels via a novel sculpturing approach that relied on the precise coupling of protein&#8208;enzyme pairs (for controlled local degradation) and magnetic actuation (for directional control). Results show that the sculpting velocity can be tailored by adjusting the magnetic field intensity or concentration of MNPs within the microgels. Additionally, varying the magnetic field position or microgel size generated diverse trajectories and channels of different widths. This innovative technology improves the viability of encapsulated cells through enhanced medium transport, outperforming non&#8208;sculpted hydrogels and offering new perspectives for hydrogel vascularization and drug/biomolecule administration. Ultimately, this novel concept can help design fully controlled channels in hydrogels or soft materials, even those with complex tortuosity, in a single wireless top&#8208;down biocompatible step.

         <title>Ionizable Drugs Enable Intracellular Delivery of Co&#8208;Formulated siRNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;delivery of small molecule drugs and ribonucleic acids (RNA) in the same nanocarrier can unlock the benefits of combination therapies, but current formulation strategies are typically limited by low drug loading. Here, ionizable analogs of a colloid&#8208;forming drug, fulvestrant, are used to formulate high&#8208;content nanoparticles that encapsulate small interfering RNA (siRNA). This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study demonstrates effective siRNA delivery by ionizable drugs.








Abstract
Targeting complementary pathways in diseases such as cancer can be achieved with co&#8208;delivery of small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) and small molecule drugs; however, current formulation strategies are typically limited to one, but not both. Here, ionizable small molecule drugs and siRNA are co&#8208;formulated&#160;in drug&#8208;rich nanoparticles. Ionizable analogs of the selective estrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant self&#8208;assemble into colloidal drug aggregates and cause endosomal disruption, allowing co&#8208;delivery of siRNA against a non&#8208;druggable target. siRNA is encapsulated in lipid&#8208;stabilized, drug&#8208;rich colloidal nanoparticles where the ionizable lipid used in conventional lipid nanoparticles is replaced with an ionizable fulvestrant analog. The selection of an appropriate phospholipid and formulation buffer enables endocytosis and potent reporter gene knockdown in cancer cells. Importantly, siRNA targeting cyclin E1 is effectively delivered to drug&#8208;resistant breast cancer cells, demonstrating the utility of this approach. This strategy opens the possibility of using ionizable drugs to co&#8208;deliver RNA and ultimately improve therapeutic outcomes.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Induced Magnetic Polarization by Charge Localization in a Chiral Supramolecular Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect is a fascinating phenomenon that correlates the molecular structure with electron spin&#8208;polarization. In this work, chiral crystals of imide&#8208;substituted coronene bisimide ((S)&#8208;CBI&#8208;GCH) are studied to show that current flows dynamically, controlled by the voltage sweep rate. This observation is crucial for redox group molecules, and sheds light on the possible origin of spin&#8208;polarization in chiral molecules. 








Abstract
The chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect is a fascinating phenomenon that correlates the molecular structure with electron spin&#8208;polarization (SP). Experimental procedures to quantify the spin&#8208;filtering magnitude have extensively used magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;dependent conductive AFM. In this work chiral crystals of imide&#8208;substituted coronene bisimide ((S)&#8208;CBI&#8208;GCH) are studied to explain the dynamics of the current&#8211;voltage I &#8722; V spectra and the origin of superimposed peaks are investigated. A dynamic voltage&#8208;sweep rate&#8208;dependent phenomenon can give rise to complex I &#8722; V curves. The redox group, capable of localization of charge, acts as a localized state that interferes with the continuum of the &#960; &#8211; &#960; stacking, giving rise to Fano resonances. A novel mechanism for dynamic transport is introduced, which provides insight into the origin of spin&#8208;polarized charge in crystallized CBI&#8208;GCH molecules after absorption on a metallic substrate, guided by transient charge polarization. Crucially, interference between charge localization and delocalization during transport may be important properties in understanding the magnetochiral phenomena observed by electrostatic force microscopy. Finally, it is observed that charge trapping sensitively modifies the injection barrier from direct tunneling to Fowler&#8211;Nordheim tunneling transport supporting nonlinearity in CISS for this class of molecules.

         <title>Programmable Chemical Reactions Enable Ultrastrong Soft Pneumatic Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating thermoelectric materials and preprogramming strategy into the management of reversible reactions, an soft pneumatic actuation is realized with high regulation, high pressure, and the ability to transport gas over long distances. The soft pneumatic actuation is successfully applying the programmable chemical reactions to soft assistive wearables, haptic devices, and lifting a sightseeing car.








Abstract
Soft pneumatic actuation is widely used in wearable devices, soft robots, artificial muscles, and surgery machines. However, generating high&#8208;pressure gases in a soft, controllable, and portable way remains a substantial challenge. Here, a class of programmable chemical reactions that can be used to controllably generate gases with a maximum pressure output of nearly 6&#160;MPa is reported. It is proposed to realize the programmability of the chemical reaction process using thermoelectric material with programmable electric current and employing preprogrammed reversible chemical reactants. The programmable chemical reactions as soft pneumatic actuation can be operated independently as miniature gas sources (&#8764;20&#8211;100&#160;g) or combined with arbitrary physical structures to make self&#8208;contained machines, capable of generating unprecedented pressures of nearly 6&#160;MPa or forces of about 18&#160;kN in a controllable, portable, and silent manner. Striking demonstrations of breaking a brick, a marble, and concrete blocks, raising a sightseeing car, and successful applications in artificial muscles and soft assistive wearables illustrate tremendous application prospects of soft pneumatic actuation via programmable chemical reactions. The study establishes a new paradigm toward ultrastrong soft pneumatic actuation.

         <title>Exciton Dissociation and Recombination Afford Narrowband Organic Afterglow Through Efficient FRET</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy is proposed for achieving narrow&#8208;band, long&#8208;lived, and full&#8208;color organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) by isolating multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent fluorophores in a steroid&#8208;type host capable of exciton dissociation and recombination. Through efficient FRET, the LPL exhibits a small full&#8208;width at a half&#8208;maximum of 33&#160;nm, persistent time exceeding 10&#160;s, and tunable color among 414&#8211;600&#160;nm.








Abstract
Organic afterglow with long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) after photoexcitation is highly attractive, but the realization of narrowband afterglow with small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) is a huge challenge since it is intrinsically contradictory to the triplet&#8208; and solid&#8208;state emission nature of organic afterglow. Here, narrow&#8208;band, long&#8208;lived, and full&#8208;color organic LPL is realized by isolating multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) fluorophores in a glassy steroid&#8208;type host through a facile melt&#8208;cooling treatment. Such prepared host becomes capable of exciton dissociation and recombination (EDR) upon photoirradiation for both long&#8208;lived fluorescence and phosphorescence; and, the efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the host to various MR&#8208;TADF emitters leads to high&#8208;performance LPL, exhibiting small FWHM of 33&#160;nm, long persistent time over 10&#160;s, and facile color&#8208;tuning in a wide range from deep&#8208;blue to orange (414&#8211;600&#160;nm). Moreover, with the extraordinary narrowband LPL and easy processability of the material, centimeter&#8208;scale flexible optical waveguide fibers and integrated FWHM/color/lifetime&#8208;resolved multilevel encryption/decryption devices have been designed and fabricated. This novel EDR and singlet/triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet FRET strategy to achieve excellent LPL performances illustrates a promising way for constructing flexible organic afterglow with easy preparation methods, shedding valuable scientific insights into the design of narrow&#8208;band emission in organic afterglow.

         <title>Multicompartment Polyion Complex Micelles Based on Triblock Polypept(o)ides Mediate Efficient siRNA Delivery to Cancer&#8208;Associated Fibroblasts for Antistromal Therapy of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a novel identified target of cancer&#8208;associated fibroblast&#8208;derived microfibrillar&#8208;associated protein 5 (MFAP&#8208;5), ABC&#8208;triblock copolymer&#8208;based multicompartment polyion complex micelle delivers siRNA against MFAP&#8208;5 (siMFAP&#8208;5) and the cationic amphiphilic drug desloratatine simultaneously. The codelivery of DES facilitates intracellular siRNA delivery, resulting in a knockdown of MFAP&#8208;5 and significantly reduced&#160;tumor burden in a mice model of hepatocellular carcinoma.








Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent type of primary liver cancer and the third leading cause for cancer&#8208;related death worldwide. The tumor is difficult&#8208;to&#8208;treat due to its inherent resistance to chemotherapy. Antistromal therapy is a novel therapeutic approach, targeting cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAF) in the tumor microenvironment. CAF&#8208;derived microfibrillar&#8208;associated protein 5 (MFAP&#8208;5) is identified as a novel target for antistromal therapy of HCC with high translational relevance. Biocompatible polypept(o)ide&#8208;based polyion complex micelles (PICMs) constructed with a triblock copolymer composed of a cationic poly(l&#8208;lysine) complexing anti&#8208;MFAP&#8208;5 siRNA (siMFAP&#8208;5) via electrostatic interaction, a poly(&#947;&#8208;benzyl&#8208;l&#8208;glutamate) block loading cationic amphiphilic drug desloratatine (DES) via &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#160;interaction as endosomal escape enhancer and polysarcosine poly(N&#8208;methylglycine) for introducing stealth properties, are generated for siRNA delivery. Intravenous injection of siMFAP&#8208;5/DES PICMs significantly reduces the hepatic tumor burden in a syngeneic implantation model of HCC, with a superior MFAP&#8208;5 knockdown effect over siMFAP&#8208;5 PICMs or lipid nanoparticles. Transcriptome and histological analysis reveal that MFAP&#8208;5 knockdown inhibited CAF&#8208;related tumor vascularization, suggesting the anti&#8208;angiogenic effect of RNA interference therapy. In conclusion, multicompartment PICMs combining siMFAP&#8208;5 and DES in a single polypept(o)ide micelle induce a specific knockdown of MFAP&#8208;5 and demonstrate a potent antitumor efficacy (80% reduced tumor burden vs untreated control) in a clinically relevant HCC model.

         <title>Ultrahigh Single Au Atoms Loaded Porous Aromatic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ strategy with pre&#8208;metallated monomers is employed to achieve a new porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;164) with Au single atoms loading up to a record high 45.3 wt.%. The serial PAF supported Au single atoms catalysts exhibit excellent photocatalytic activities toward hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Supported single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are promising in heterogeneous catalysis because of their atom economy, unusual transformations, and mechanistic clarity. The metal SAs loading, however, limits the catalytic efficiency. Herein, an in situ pre&#8208;metallated monomer&#8208;based preparation strategy is shown to achieve ultrahigh Au SAs loading in catalyst formations. The polymerization of single&#8208;atom loaded monomers yield a new porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;164) with Au SAs loading up to a record high 45.3 wt.%. SACs of Au&#8208;PAFs exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity in hydrogen (H2) evolution, and the H2 evolution rate of Au100%&#8208;SAs&#8208;PAF&#8208;164 can reach 4.82&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with great recyclability.

         <title>Operando Colorations from Real&#8208;Time Growth of 3D&#8208;Printed Nanoarchitectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Considering that most colors fade with time, this work develops an additive approach to diversify colors over time. This color enrichment is realized by operando observation and measurement of the real&#8208;time growth of subwavelength metallic nanoarchitectures during 3D nanoprinting. The dimensions and geometries of these growing nanoarchitectures change in real time, thereby generating a magnificent library of time&#8208;varying colors.








Abstract
While artificial 3D nanostructures can generate precise and flexible coloration, their real&#8208;time color changes during 3D nanoprinting remain unexplored owing&#160;to the inherent challenges of in situ transient measurements and observations. In this study, a 3D&#8208;printing system which supports the operando observation/measurement of the color dynamics of subwavelength metallic nanoarchitectures fabricated in real time is developed and evaluated. During 3D printing, the dimensions and geometries of the 3D nanostructures grow over time, producing a large library of optical spectra associated with real&#8208;time color changes. Only a timer is needed to define the expected colors from a single 3D print run. Fin&#8208;like nanostructures are used to toggle colors based on the polarization effect and produce color gradients. Based on structural coloration, nanoarchitectures are designed and printed to animate desired color patterns. Moreover, the resulting color dynamics can also serve as an operando identifier for real&#8208;time structural information during 3D nanoprinting. A single print run enables the efficient creation of a comprehensive library of desired colorations owing to the flexibility in time&#8208;dependent controllability and 3D geometries at the subwavelength scale. 3D nanoprinted plasmonic structures exhibiting time&#8208;varying colorations (4D printing of colors) uniquely redefines the coloring stategy,&#160;offering considerable potential for numerous&#160;applications.

         <title>Ternary Logic Circuit and Neural Network Integration via Small Molecule&#8208;Based Antiambipolar Vertical Electrochemical Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiambipolar behavior is observed in a small molecule&#8208;based vertical organic electrochemical transistor with a current density &gt; 30&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, and low driving voltage (0.6&#160;V). Consequently, a vertically stacked ternary inverter (VSTI) is fabricated with three distinguishable logic states, along with the demonstration for image recognition tasks based on ternary neural networks with such VSTI array.








Abstract
Circuits based on organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have great potential in the fields of biosensors and artificial neural computation due to their biocompatibility and neural similarity. However, the integration of OECT&#8208;based circuits lags far behind other emerging electronics. Here, ternary inverters based on antiambipolar vertical OECTs (vOECTs) and their integration with the establishment of neural networks are demonstrated. Specifically, by adopting a small molecule (t&#8208;gdiPDI) as the channel of vOECT, high antiambipolar performance, with current density&#160;of 33.9&#160;&#177;&#160;2.1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 under drain voltage of 0.1&#160;V, peak voltage &#8776;0&#160;V, low driving voltage &lt; &#177; 0.6&#160;V, and current on/off ratio&#160;&gt;&#160;106, are realized. Consequently, vertically stacked ternary circuits based solely on OECTs are constructed for the first time, showing three distinct logical states and high integration density. By further developing inverter array as the internal fundamental units of ternary weight network hardware circuits for ternary processing and computation, it demonstrates excellent data classification and recognition capabilities. This work demonstrates the possibility of constructing multi&#8208;valued logic circuits by OECTs and promotes a new strategy for high&#8208;density integration and multivalued computing systems based on organic circuits.

         <title>Structural Regulation of Au&#8208;Pt Bimetallic Aerogels for Catalyzing the Glucose Cascade Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work leverages the structural versatility of aerogels to regulate the Au&#8211;Pt bimetallic system into three representative structures, including segregated, alloy, and core&#8211;shell configurations and investigates the structure&#8211;activity relationship toward glucose cascade catalysis. Among them, the Au&#8211;Pt segregated structure exhibits the optimal enzyme&#8208;mimic catalytic performances, which is ascribed to the synergistic effect and abundant grain boundaries.








Abstract
Bimetallic nanostructures are promising candidates for the development of enzyme&#8208;mimics, yet the deciphering of the structural impact on their catalytic properties poses significant challenges. By leveraging the structural versatility of nanocrystal aerogels, this study reports a precise control of Au&#8211;Pt bimetallic structures in three representative structural configurations, including segregated, alloy, and core&#8211;shell structures. Benefiting from a synergistic effect, these bimetallic aerogels demonstrate improved peroxidase&#8208; and glucose oxidase&#8208;like catalytic performances compared to their monometallic counterparts, unleashing tremendous potential in catalyzing the glucose cascade reaction. Notably, the segregated Au&#8211;Pt aerogel shows optimal catalytic activity, which is 2.80 and 3.35 times higher than that of the alloy and core&#8211;shell variants, respectively. This enhanced activity is attributed to the high&#8208;density Au&#8211;Pt interface boundaries within the segregated structure, which foster greater substrate affinity and superior catalytic efficiency. This work not only sheds light on the structure&#8211;property relationship of bimetallic catalysts but also broadens the application scope of aerogels in biosensing and biological detections.

         <title>Asymmetric Wettability Hydrogel Surfaces for Enduring Electromyographic Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversal wettability inducing strategy based on hydrophobic interaction is proposed to integrally synthesize Janus hydrogel without affecting the mechanical elasticity and electrical properties. This interfacial engineering successfully realizes the optional inducing on the hydrogel surfaces. A combination of asymmetric wettability surfaces, excellent elasticity, and compatible conductivity endows the hydrogel electrode patch with a high&#8208;fidelity EMG signal in a perspiration environment.








Abstract
Hydrogel electrode interfaces have shown tremendous promise in the acquisition of surface electromyography (EMG) signals. However, the perspiration or moisture environments will trigger the deadhesion between hydrogel electrodes and human skin. Despite the hydrophobic/hydrophilic surfaces can perform the anti&#8208;moisture or adhesion respectively, it remains a challenge to integrally form a Janus hydrogel with homogeneous mechanical elasticity and electronic performance. Herein, a surface induction strategy is proposed to approach the hydrophobic/hydrophilic hydrogel surfaces. The hydrophobic interaction between surfactants and molds regulates the distribution of hydrophobic/hydrophilic monomers on the surface. The hydrophobic molds induce a hydrophilic hydrogel surface, while the hydrophilic molds induce a hydrophobic surface. It presents a new phenomenon of reversal wettability inducing and optional hydrogel surfaces. The integral Janus hydrogel can be easily obtained by the hydrophilic molds. Balance of adhesion, elasticity, and conductivity endows the hydrogel electrode patch with durable conformal adhesion and high&#8208;fidelity EMG signals even in the sweaty epidermis due to the asymmetric wettability surfaces. This hydrogel performs the quantitative description of muscle strength and accurate fatigue assessment. It offers a reliable candidate for future practical applications in continuous digital healthcare and intelligent human&#8211;machine interaction, even the Metaverse.

         <title>Human Circulatory/Respiratory&#8208;Inspired Comprehensive Air Purification System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A circulatory/respiratory&#8208;inspired air purification system (CAPS) is reported, a novel bioinspired approach that integrates microbubble&#8208;based gas exchange and circulating liquid (water) mechanisms akin to alveoli, capillary beds, and the bloodstream. By incorporating waste removal, CAPS ensures continuous particulate matter removal and gas exchange between indoor and outdoor spaces, with the potential for networked integration across various internal and external environments.








Abstract
The circulatory and respiratory systems in humans are marvels of biological engineering that exhibit competence in maintaining homeostasis. These systems not only shield the organism from external contaminants but also orchestrate the vital gases via the bloodstream to sustain cellular respiration and metabolic processes across diverse tissues. It is noticed that spaces inhabited encounter challenges akin to those of the human body: protecting the indoor air from external pollutants while removing anthropogenic byproducts like carbon dioxide (CO2), particulate matters (PM), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) tooutside. A biomimetic approach, composed of a microbubble&#8208;based gas exchanger and circulating liquid inspired by alveoli, capillary beds, and bloodstream of the human circulatory/respiratory system, offer an innovative solution for comprehensive air purification of hermetic spaces. Circulatory/respiratory&#8208;inspired air purification system (CAPS) ensure both continuous removal of PM and exchange of gas species between indoor and outdoor environments to maintain homeostasis. The effectiveness of this system is also supported by animal behavior experiments with and without CAPS, showing an effect of reducing CO2 concentration by 30% and increasing mice locomotor activity by 53%. CAPS is expected to evolve into robust and comprehensive air purification schemes through the networked integration of plural internal and external environments.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circulatory and respiratory systems in humans are marvels of biological engineering that exhibit competence in maintaining homeostasis. These systems not only shield the organism from external contaminants but also orchestrate the vital gases via the bloodstream to sustain cellular respiration and metabolic processes across diverse tissues. It is noticed that spaces inhabited encounter challenges akin to those of the human body: protecting the indoor air from external pollutants while removing anthropogenic byproducts like carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), particulate matters (PM), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) tooutside. A biomimetic approach, composed of a microbubble-based gas exchanger and circulating liquid inspired by alveoli, capillary beds, and bloodstream of the human circulatory/respiratory system, offer an innovative solution for comprehensive air purification of hermetic spaces. Circulatory/respiratory-inspired air purification system (CAPS) ensure both continuous removal of PM and exchange of gas species between indoor and outdoor environments to maintain homeostasis. The effectiveness of this system is also supported by animal behavior experiments with and without CAPS, showing an effect of reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration by 30% and increasing mice locomotor activity by 53%. CAPS is expected to evolve into robust and comprehensive air purification schemes through the networked integration of plural internal and external environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Proximal High&#8208;Index Metamaterials based on a Superlattice of Gold Nanohexagons Targeting the Near&#8208;Infrared Band</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmonic gold nanohexagons (AuNHs) assembled into a planar superlattice serve as optical metamaterials for precise refractive index (RI) control. With controlled gap proximities in an edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge manner, they exhibit unprecedented optical properties in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) band, achieving an RI of 10.04 at &#955; = 1.5 &#181;m. The RI tunability is shown by varying nanometer&#8208;scale gaps, promising significant optical advancements.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanoparticles can be assembled into a superlattice, to form optical metamaterials, particularly targeting precise control of optical properties such as refractive index (RI). The superlattices exhibit enhanced near&#8208;field, given the sufficiently narrow gap between nanoparticles supporting multiple plasmonic resonance modes only realized in proximal environments. Herein, the planar superlattice of plasmonic Au nanohexagons (AuNHs) with precisely controlled geometries such as size, shape, and edge&#8208;gaps is reported. The proximal AuNHs superlattice realized over a large area with selective edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge assembly exhibited the highest&#8208;ever&#8208;recorded RI values in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) band, surpassing the upper limit of the RI of the natural intrinsic materials (up to 10.04 at &#955; = 1.5&#160;&#181;m). The exceptionally enhanced RI is derived from intensified in&#8208;plane surface plasmon coupling across the superlattices. Precise control of the edge&#8208;gap of neighboring AuNHs systematically tuned the RI as confirmed by numerical analysis based on the plasmonic percolation model. Furthermore, a 1D photonic crystal, composed of alternating layers of AuNHs superlattices and low&#8208;index polymers, is constructed to enhance the selectivity of the reflectivity operating in the NIR band. It is expected that the proximal AuNHs superlattices can be used as new optical metamaterials that can be extended to the NIR range.

         <title>A High Capacity Gas Diffusion Electrode for Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capacity of lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries is limited by the mass transport of O2 throughout the porous positive electrode. Here it is shown that by replacing the binder in the electrode with a polymer that can transport O2, it is possible to reach energy densities that significantly exceed Li&#8208;ion batteries and previously reported Li&#8211;O2 cells.








Abstract
The very high theoretical specific energy of the lithium&#8211;air (Li&#8211;O2) battery (3500&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) compared with other batteries makes it potentially attractive, especially for the electrification of flight. While progress has been made in realizing the Li&#8211;air battery, several challenges remain. One such challenge is achieving a high capacity to store charge at the positive electrode at practical current densities, without which Li&#8211;air batteries will not outperform lithium&#8208;ion. The capacity is limited by the mass transport of O2 throughout the porous carbon positive electrode. Here it is shown that by replacing the binder in the electrode by a polymer with the intrinsic ability to transport O2, it is possible to reach capacities as high as 31 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a 300&#160;&#181;m thick electrode. This corresponds to a positive electrode energy density of 2650&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 and specific energy of 1716&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, exceeding significantly Li&#8208;ion batteries and previously reported Li&#8211;O2 cells. Due to the enhanced oxygen diffusion imparted by the gas diffusion polymer, Li2O2 (the product of O2 reduction on discharge) fills a greater volume fraction of the electrode and is more homogeneously distributed.

         <title>In Situ&#8208;Constructed Multifunctional Composite Anode with Ultralong&#8208;Life Toward Advanced Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional Li/SnS2 composite anode is rationally designed through an in situ melt&#8208;infusion approach utilizing SnS2 as &#8216;solute&#8217; and molten lithium as the &#8216;solvent&#8217;. The 3D porous Li2S/Li22Sn5 framework possesses a&#160;low Li+ diffusion barrier, high electronic conductivity, and&#160;Li&#8208;clusters decomposition capability, thus effectively eliminating the growth of dendrite and enabling ultra&#8208;long cycling lifespan, especially at high rates.








Abstract
Metallic lithium is the most competitive anode material for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy batteries. Nevertheless, the extensive volume expansion and uncontrolled Li dendrite growth of lithium metal not only cause potential safety hazards but also lead to low Coulombic efficiency and inferior cycling lifespan for Li metal batteries. Herein, a multifunctional dendrite&#8208;free composite anode (Li/SnS2) is proposed through an in situ melt&#8208;infusion strategy. In this configuration, the 3D cross&#8208;linked porous Li2S/Li22Sn5 framework facilitates the rapid penetration of electrolytes and accommodates the volume expansion during the repeated Li&#8722;plating process. Meanwhile, the lithiophilic Li2S phases with a low Li+ transport barrier ensure preferential Li deposition, effectively avoiding uneven electron distribution. Moreover, the Li22Sn5 electron conductors with appropriate Li+ bonding ability guarantee rapid charge transport and mass transfer. Most importantly, the steady multifunctional skeleton with sufficient inner interfaces (Li2S/Li22Sn5) in the whole electrode, not only realizes the redistribution of the localized free electron, contributing to the decomposition of Li clusters, but also induces a planar deposition model, thus restraining the generation of Li dendrites. Consequently, an unprecedented cyclability of over 6&#160;500&#160;h under an ultrahigh areal capacity of 10&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a current rate of 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 is achieved for the prepared Li2S/Li22Sn5 composite anode. Moreover, the assembled Li/SnS2||LiFePO4 (LFP) pouch full&#8208;cells also demonstrate remarkable rate capability and a convincing cycling lifespan of more than 2&#160;000 cycles at 2 C.

         <title>Optical&#8208;Propulsion Metastructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces optical&#8208;propulsion metastructures, for enhanced laser micropropulsion performance. This metastructure achieves 99% light absorption efficiency and a material density of 0.958 g cm&#8722;3. It maintains exceptional energy conversion and structural integrity under adverse conditions. The cost&#8208;effective fabrication technique suggests scalability for future microspacecraft and nanosatellite propulsion systems.








Abstract
Pulsed laser micropropulsion (PLMP) offers a promising avenue for miniature space craft, yet conventional propellants face challenges in balancing efficiency and stability. An optical&#8208;propulsion metastructure strategy using metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is presented to generate graphene&#8208;metal metastructures (GMM), specifically GMM&#8208;(HKUST&#8208;1), which significantly enhances PLMP performance. This novel approach leverages the unique interaction between pulsed lasers and the precisely engineered GMMs&#8212;comprising optimized metal nanoparticle size, graphene layers, and inter&#8208;particle gaps&#8212;to boost both propulsion efficiency and stability.

&lt;p&gt;This study introduces optical-propulsion metastructures, for enhanced laser micropropulsion performance. This metastructure achieves 99% light absorption efficiency and a material density of 0.958 g cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. It maintains exceptional energy conversion and structural integrity under adverse conditions. The cost-effective fabrication technique suggests scalability for future microspacecraft and nanosatellite propulsion systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulsed laser micropropulsion (PLMP) offers a promising avenue for miniature space craft, yet conventional propellants face challenges in balancing efficiency and stability. An optical-propulsion metastructure strategy using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is presented to generate graphene-metal metastructures (GMM), specifically GMM-(HKUST-1), which significantly enhances PLMP performance. This novel approach leverages the unique interaction between pulsed lasers and the precisely engineered GMMs&#8212;comprising optimized metal nanoparticle size, graphene layers, and inter-particle gaps&#8212;to boost both propulsion efficiency and stability. Experimental and numerical analyses reveal that GMM-(HKUST-1) achieves aspecific impulse of 1072.94 s, ablation efficiency of 51.22%, and impulse thrust per mass of 105.15 &#181;N &#181;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, surpassing traditional propellants. With an average particle size of &#8776;12 nm and a density of 0.958&#160;g&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, these metastructures exhibit 99% light absorption efficiency and maintain stability under atmospheric and humid conditions. The graphene nanolayer efficiently absorbs and converts laser energy, while the metal nanostructures enhance light-matter interactions, promoting energy transfer and material stability. These findings suggest that this GMM-based optical-propulsion strategy can revolutionize microspacecraft propulsion and energy systems, offering significant advancements across various domains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust Field&#8208;Free Switching Using Large Unconventional Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque in an All&#8208;Van der Waals Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study uses the low&#8208;symmetry Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 and above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 to achieve the field&#8208;free magnetization switching. The unconventional SOT effective field efficiency is determined to be 0.37, and the switching&#8208;polarity&#8208;change magnetic field is as high as 252&#160;mT, indicating a robust field&#8208;free switching against the external magnetic field.








Abstract
The emerging all&#8208;van der Waals (vdW) magnetic heterostructure provides a new platform to control the magnetization by the electric field beyond the traditional spintronics devices. One promising strategy is using unconventional spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) exerted by the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarized spin current to enable deterministic magnetization switching and enhance the switching efficiency. However, in all&#8208;vdW heterostructures, large unconventional SOT remains elusive and the robustness of the field&#8208;free switching against external magnetic field has not been examined, which hinders further applications. Here, the study demonstrates the field&#8208;free switching in an all&#8208;vdW heterostructure combining a type&#8208;II Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 and above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2. The fully field&#8208;free switching can be achieved at 2.56 &#215; 1010 A&#160;m&#8722;2 at 300&#160;K and a large SOT effective field efficiency of the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarized spin current generated by TaIrTe4 is determined to be 0.37. Moreover, it is found that the switching polarity cannot be changed until the external in&#8208;plane magnetic field reaches 252&#160;mT, indicating a robust switching against the magnetic field. The numerical simulation suggests the large unconventional SOT reduces the switching current density and enhances the robustness of the switching. The work shows that all&#8208;vdW heterostructures are promising candidates for future highly efficient and stable SOT&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adhesive and Self&#8208;Sustainable Bioelectronic Patch for Physiological Feedback Electronic Modulation of Soft Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bionic electrical stimulation (Bio&#8208;ES), spontaneously synchronized with target neural signatures in a convenient and electronics&#8208;free form, has always been a coveted goal for the development of flexible bioelectronics technology. Targeting the above goal, the study develops a Bio&#8208;ES strategy synchronized with the vagal nerve impulses peak envelope for physiological feedback electronic modulation of visceral organs innervated by the vagal interoceptive system. In particular, it can operate self&#8208;sustainably without the need for any external energy input through a conformal self&#8208;adhesive design of tissue&#8208;device interface to realize dynamic synergizing with the real&#8208;time physiological environment via the electromechanical coupling effect.








Abstract
Bionic electrical stimulation (Bio&#8208;ES) aims to achieve personalized therapy and proprioceptive adaptation by mimicking natural neural signatures of the body, while current Bio&#8208;ES devices are reliant on complex sensing and computational simulation systems, thus often limited by the low&#8208;fidelity of simulated electrical signals, and failure of interface information interaction due to the mechanical mismatch between soft tissues and rigid electrodes. Here, the study presents a flexible and ultrathin self&#8208;sustainable bioelectronic patch (Bio&#8208;patch), which can self&#8208;adhere to the lesion area of organs and generate bionic electrical signals synchronized vagal nerve envelope in situ to implement Bio&#8208;ES. It allows adaptive adjustment of intensity, frequency, and waveform of the Bio&#8208;ES to fully meet personalized needs of tissue regeneration based on real&#8208;time feedback from the vagal neural controlled organs. With this foundation, the Bio&#8208;patch can effectively intervene with excessive fibrosis and microvascular stasis during the natural healing process by regulating the polarization time of macrophages, promoting the reconstruction of the tissue&#8208;engineered structure, and accelerating the repair of damaged liver and kidney. This work develops a practical approach to realize biomimetic electronic modulation of the growth and development of soft organs only using a multifunctional Bio&#8208;patch, which establishes a new paradigm for precise bioelectronic medicine.

         <title>A Strategy of Killing Two Birds With One Stone for Blocking Drug Resistance Spread With Engineered Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living Bdello is engineered with polydopamine and a multinuclear cerium (IV) complex to construct Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello for blocking the spread of drug resistance. Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello exhibits synergistic functions in penetrating biofilms, killing bacteria and degrading drug&#8208;resistant genes, rendering it a versatile therapeutic for treating P. aeruginosa (KanR) infected scald/burn&#160;wounds by simultaneously eliminating resistant pathogens and blocking bacterial drug&#8208;resistance dissemination.








Abstract
Drug&#8208;resistant pathogens significantly threaten human health and life. Simply killing drug&#8208;resistant pathogens cannot effectively eliminate their threat since the drug&#8208;resistant genes (DRGs) released from dead drug&#8208;resistant pathogens are difficult to eliminate and can further spread via horizontal gene transfer, leading to the spread of drug resistance. The development of antibacterial materials with sterilization and DRGs cleavage activities is highly crucial. Herein, a living system, Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello, is fabricated with bacterial killing and DRGs cleavage activities for blocking bacterial drug resistance dissemination by engineered Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus (Bdello). Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello is obtained by engineering Bdello with dopamine and a multinuclear cerium (IV) complex. Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello can penetrate and eliminate kanamycin&#8208;resistant P. aeruginosa (KanR) biofilms via the synergistic effect of predatory Bdello and photothermal polydopamine under near&#8208;infrared light. Additionally, the DNase&#8208;mimicking ability of Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello endows it with genome and plasmid DNA cleavage ability. An in vivo study reveals that Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello can eliminate P. aeruginosa (KanR) and cleave DRGs in scald/burn infected wounds to block the spread of drug resistance and accelerate wound healing. This bioactive system constructed from natural living materials offers a promising means for blocking the spread of drug resistance.

         <title>Sensitive SWIR Organic Photodetectors with Spectral Response Reaching 1.5&#160;&#181;m</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new non&#8208;fullerene acceptor exhibiting an ultralow bandgap of 0.83 eV and strong absorption extending up to 1.5 &#181;m is developed by rationally regulating its molecular packing order. The resulting photodetectors achieve an unprecedented detectivity&#160;over 1011 Jones from 0.4 to 1.5 &#181;m with a maximum of 1.68 &#215; 1012 Jones at 1.16 &#181;m under 0 V bias.








Abstract
The performance of organic photodetectors (OPDs) sensitive to the short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) light lags behind commercial indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) photodetectors primarily due to the scarcity of organic semiconductors with efficient photoelectric responses exceeding 1.3&#160;&#181;m. Limited by the Energy&#8208;gap law, ultralow&#8208;bandgap organic semiconductors usually suffer from severe non&#8208;radiative transitions, resulting in low external quantum efficiency (EQE). Herein, a difluoro&#8208;substituted quinoid terminal group (QC&#8208;2F) with exceptionally strong electron&#8208;negativity is developed for constructing a new non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA), Y&#8208;QC4F with an ultralow bandgap of 0.83&#160;eV. This subtle structural modification significantly enhances intermolecular packing order and density, enabling an absorption onset up to 1.5&#160;&#181;m while suppressing non&#8208;radiation recombination in Y&#8208;QC4F films. SWIR OPDs based on Y&#8208;QC4F achieve an impressive detectivity (D*) over 1011 Jones from 0.4 to 1.5&#160;&#181;m under 0&#160;V bias, with a maximum of 1.68 &#215; 1012 Jones at 1.16&#160;&#181;m. Furthermore, the resulting OPDs demonstrate competitive performance with commercial photodetectors for high&#8208;quality SWIR imaging even under 1.4&#160;&#181;m irradiation.

&lt;p&gt;A new non-fullerene acceptor exhibiting an ultralow bandgap of 0.83 eV and strong absorption extending up to 1.5 &#181;m is developed by rationally regulating its molecular packing order. The resulting photodetectors achieve an unprecedented detectivity&#160;over 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; Jones from 0.4 to 1.5 &#181;m with a maximum of 1.68 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; Jones at 1.16 &#181;m under 0 V bias.

         <title>Facilitating Oriented Dense Deposition: Utilizing Crystal Plane End&#8208;Capping Reagent to Construct Dendrite&#8208;Free and Highly Corrosion&#8208;Resistant (100) Crystal Plane Zinc Anode</title>

         <dc:description>
Oriented dense Zn anodes with high corrosion resistance are fabricated by introducing a Zn (100) crystal plane end&#8208;capping reagent into the electrolyte, which mitigates the dendrite growth and corrosive behavior of Zn anodes in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries and improves their durability. This study deepens the understanding of diverse Zn crystal planes and broadens the choice of crystal plane modulation.








Abstract
Dendrite growth and corrosion issues have significantly hindered the usability of Zn anodes, which further restricts the development of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). In this study, a zinc&#8208;philic and hydrophobic Zn (100) crystal plane end&#8208;capping reagent (ECR) is introduced into the electrolyte to address these challenges in AZIBs. Specifically, under the mediation of 100&#8208;ECR, the electroplated Zn configures oriented dense deposition of (100) crystal plane texture, which slows down the formation of dendrites. Furthermore, owing to the high corrosion resistance of the (100) crystal plane and the hydrophobic protective interface formed by the adsorbed ECR on the electrode surface, the Zn anode demonstrates enhanced reversibility and higher Coulombic efficiency in the modified electrolyte. Consequently, superior electrochemical performance is achieved through this novel crystal plane control strategy and interface protection technology. The Zn//VO2 cells based on the modified electrolyte maintained a high&#8208;capacity retention of &#8776;80.6% after 1350 cycles, corresponding to a low&#8208;capacity loss rate of only 0.014% per cycle. This study underscores the importance of deposition uniformity and corrosion resistance of crystal planes over their type. And through crystal plane engineering, a high&#8208;quality (100) crystal plane is constructed, thereby expanding the range of options for viable Zn anodes.

         <title>Strategically Modulating Proton Activity and Electric Double Layer Adsorption for Innovative All&#8208;Vanadium Aqueous Mn2+/Proton Hybrid Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel all&#8208;vanadium symmetric manganese ion batteries are developed for the first time based on tunnel&#8208;type monoclinic VO2 electrode materials. Through further rational electrolyte design and advanced multi&#8208;scale in situ characterization, the effective modulation of proton activity and electric double&#8208;layer structure at the interface is fully revealed and a unique mechanism of manganese ion/proton hybrid energy storage is demonstrated.








Abstract
Aqueous Mn&#8208;ion batteries (MIBs) exhibit a promising development potential due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness, high safety, and potential for high energy density. However, the development of MIBs is hindered by the lack of electrode materials capable of storing Mn2+ ions due to acidic manganese salt electrolytes and large ion radius. Herein, the tunnel&#8208;type structure of monoclinic VO2 nanorods to effectively store Mn2+ ions via a reversible (de)insertion chemistry for the first time is reported. Utilizing exhaustive in situ/ex situ multi&#8208;scale characterization techniques and theoretical calculations, the co&#8208;insertion process of Mn2+/proton is revealed, elucidating the capacity decay mechanism wherein high proton activity leads to irreversible dissolution loss of vanadium species. Further, the Grotthuss transfer mechanism of protons is broken via a hydrogen bond reconstruction strategy while achieving the modulation of the electric double&#8208;layer structure, which effectively suppresses the electrode interface proton activity. Consequently, the VO2 demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance at both ambient temperatures and &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, especially maintaining a high capacity of 162&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 after a record&#8208;breaking 20&#160;000 cycles. Notably, the all&#8208;vanadium symmetric pouch cells are successfully assembled for the first time based on the &#8220;rocking&#8208;chair&#8221; Mn2+/proton hybrid mechanism, demonstrating the practical application potential.

         <dc:description>
A series of benzo[a]phenazine (BP)&#8208;based acceptors achieved through an isomerization chlorination strategy is presented, namely NA1, NA2, NA3, and NA4. The ortho&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) processed binary organic solar cells (OSCs) based on PM6:NA3 yields an efficiency of 18.94%. Importantly, the o&#8208;XY processed ternary OSC device based on PM6:D18&#8208;Cl:NA3 exhibits an efficiency as high as 19.75%.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance organic solar cells often rely on halogen&#8208;containing solvents, which restrict the photovoltaic industry. Therefore, it is imperative to develop efficient organic photovoltaic materials compatible with halogen&#8208;free solvents. Herein, a series of benzo[a]phenazine (BP)&#8208;core&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) achieved through an isomerization chlorination strategy is presented, comprising unchlorinated NA1, 10&#8208;chlorine substituted NA2, 8&#8208;chlorine substituted NA3, and 7&#8208;chlorine substituted NA4. Theoretical simulations highlight NA3's superior orbit overlap length and tight molecular packing, attributed to interactions between the end group and BP unit. Furthermore, NA3 demonstrates dense 3D network structures and a record electronic coupling of 104.5 meV. These characteristics empower the ortho&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) processed PM6:NA3 device with superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.94%, surpassing PM6:NA1 (15.34%), PM6:NA2 (7.18%), and PM6:NA4 (16.02%). Notably, the significantly lower PCE in the PM6:NA2 device is attributed to excessive self&#8208;aggregation characteristics of NA2 in o&#8208;XY. Importantly, the incorporation of D18&#8208;Cl into the PM6:NA3 binary blend enhances crystallographic ordering and increases the exciton diffusion length of the donor phase, resulting in a ternary device efficiency of 19.75% (certified as 19.39%). These findings underscore the significance of incorporating new electron&#8208;deficient units in the design of efficient SMAs tailored for environmentally benign solvent processing of OSCs.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Regulated Motion and Energy Conversion of Polyelectrolyte Membrane Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>

This work reports the shape&#8208;dependent motion and adaptive rotation of self&#8208;powered Marangoni actuators on the water surface. Among them, circular actuators show regular motion and passage properties that enable energy harvesting and wireless sensing for obstruction location in closed pipes.








Abstract
Smart actuators hold great potential in soft robotics and sensors, but their movement at the fluid interface is less understood and controlled, hindering their performances and applications in complicated fluids. Here an ethanol&#8208;containing polyelectrolyte actuator is prepared that demonstrates excellent actuating performance via the Marangoni effect. These actuators exhibit enduring (17&#160;min), repeatable (50 cycles), and autonomous motion on the water surface. More importantly, the motion of actuators are dependent on their shapes. Polygonal actuators with more edges exhibit round motion attached to walls of containers, while the actuators with few edges move randomly. On the basis of this property, the circular actuators can pass through pipe bends with S&#8208;shaped complex geometry. These unique advantages lend the actuators to successful applications in wireless sensing (standard 0&#8211;5&#160;V level signals) for locating obstructions inside invisible pipes and continuous energy harvesting (7700&#160;nC per cycle) for micro mechanical energy.

         <title>Sulfate Radical Based In Situ Vaccine Boosts Systemic Antitumor Immunity via Concurrent Activation of Necroptosis and STING Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfate radical based in situ vaccine (ISV) is developed by intercalating peroxydisulfate into manganese&#8208;layered double hydroxide nanoparticles. This ISV mediates advanced oxidation process in tumor microenvironment to produce SO4&#183;&#8722; that induces immunogenic necroptosis of tumor cells, and concurrently activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING)&#160;signaling pathway that augments immune cells maturation, leading to remarkable systemic T cell immunity against primary and distant/metastatic tumors.








Abstract
In situ vaccine (ISV) can provoke systemic anti&#8208;tumor immunity through the induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD). The development of ISV technology has been restricted by the limited and suboptimal ICD driven tumor antigen production which are currently relying on chemo&#8208;drugs, photo&#8208;/radio&#8208;sensitizers, oncolytic&#8208;virus and immunostimulatory agents. Herein, a sulfate radical (SO4&#183;&#8722;) based ISV is reported that accomplishes superior tumor immunotherapy dispense from conventional approaches. The ISV denoted as P&#8208;Mn&#8208;LDH is constructed by intercalating peroxydisulfate (PDS, a precursor of SO4&#183;&#8722;) into manganese layered double hydroxide nanoparticles (Mn&#8208;LDH). This design allows the stabilization of PDS under ambient condition, but triggers a Mn2+ mediated PDS decomposition in acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) to generate in situ SO4&#183;&#8722;. Importantly, it is found that the SO4&#183;&#8208; radicals not only effectively kill cancer cells, but also induce a necroptotic cell death pathway, leading to robust ICD signaling for eliciting adaptive immunity. Further, the P&#8208;Mn&#8208;LDH can activate the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway to further boost anti&#8208;tumor immunity. Collectively, the P&#8208;Mn&#8208;LDH based ISV exhibited potent activity in inhibiting tumor growth and lung metastasis. When combined with immune checkpoint inhibitor, significant inhibition of distant tumors is achieved. This study underpins the promise of SO4&#183;&#8208; based vaccine technology for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Reviving Sodium Tunnel Oxide Cathodes Based on Structural Modulation and Sodium Compensation Strategy Toward Practical Sodium&#8208;Ion Cylindrical Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An internal and external synergistic modulation strategy is proposed to slove the problems of surface residual alkali, multiple voltage plateaus, and low initial charge specific capacity in the tunnel oxide cathode material (Na0.44MnO2). In addition, Prussian blue analog (PBA)&#8208;Na0.44Mn1&#8208;xTixO2 composites are designed to construct practical sodium&#8208;ion cylindrical battery with hard carbon anodes for the first time, which displays excellent electrochemical performance and promotes the commercialization of SIBs.








Abstract
As a typical tunnel oxide, Na0.44MnO2 features excellent electrochemical performance and outstanding structural stability, making it a promising cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, it suffers from undesirable challenges such as surface residual alkali, multiple voltage plateaus, and low initial charge specific capacity. Herein, an internal and external synergistic modulation strategy is adopted by replacing part of the Mn with Ti to optimize the bulk phase and construct a Ti&#8208;containing epitaxial stabilization layer, resulting in reduced surface residual alkali, excellent Na+ transport kinetics and improved water/air stability. Specifically, the Na0.44Mn0.85Ti0.15O2 using water&#8208;soluble carboxymethyl cellulose as a binder can realize a capacity retention rate of 94.30% after 1,000 cycles at 2C, and excellent stability is further verified in kilogram large&#8208;up applications. In addition, taking advantage of the rich Na content in Prussian blue analog (PBA), PBA&#8208;Na0.44Mn1&#8208;xTixO2 composites are designed to compensate for the insufficient Na in the tunnel oxide and are matched with hard carbon to achieve the preparation of coin full cell and 18650 cylindrical battery with satisfactory electrochemical performance. This work enables the application of tunnel oxides cathode for SIBs in 18650 cylindrical batteries for the first time and promotes the commercialization of SIBs.

         <title>Evidence of Lone Pair Crafted Emphanisis in the Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Halide Perovskite Cs2PbI2Cl2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emphanisis, or local symmetry reduction upon warming, in Cs2PbI2Cl2, is revealed by synchrotron X&#8208;ray total scattering analysis. Origin of emphanisis is traced to Pb 6s2 lone&#8208;pair&#8208;induced cooperative structural distortion, featuring thermally activated Pb off&#8208;centering and static Cl displacement. Insights from inelastic neutron scattering and theoretical studies shed light on impact of these distortions on the ultralow thermal conductivity of Cs2PbI2Cl2.








Abstract
A hallmark of typical structural transformations is an increase in symmetry upon heating due to entropic favourability. However, local symmetry breaking upon warming is recently evidenced in rare crystalline phases. Termed as emphanisis, the phenomenon implores exploration of fascinating thermodynamic nuances that drive unusual structural evolutions. Here, synchrotron X&#8208;ray total scattering measurements are presented on a Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper mixed halide perovskite, Cs2PbI2Cl2, which reveal signatures of emphanisis. The genesis of symmetry lowering upon heating is traced to a lone pair&#8208;driven cooperative local structural distortion composed of thermally actuated Pb off&#8208;centring and static Cl displacement. Mapping the thermal evolution of low&#8208;lying phonon modes with inelastic neutron scattering uncovers instances of mode hardening with picosecond lifetime and an intriguing soft mode at the X&#8208;point of the Brillouin zone&#8212;features conducive to ultralow thermal transport. Together, these observations highlight the fundamental and functional implications of chemical design in engendering unconventional phenomena in crystalline materials and associated properties.

         <title>Ultrastable Carboxyl&#8208;Functionalized Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large family of carboxyl&#8208;functionalized MOFs with high porosity for gas separation have been synthesized. New Cr&#8208;MOFs are exceptionally stable in boiling water, extremely acidic (pH &lt; 0) or basic (pH &gt; 14) conditions and can be deprotonated and re&#8208;protonated following cycle of base&#8208;acid treatments, opening up applications under harsh conditions. New materials exhibit excellent adsorption properties such as high uptake capacity and promising separation performance for gas mixtures such as C2H2/CO2, C2H2/C2H4, and C6H6/C6H12.








Abstract
Isoreticular chemistry, which enables property optimization by changing compositions without changing topology, is a powerful synthetic strategy. One of the biggest challenges facing isoreticular chemistry is to extend it to ligands with strongly coordinating substituent groups such as unbound &#8722;COOH, because competitive interactions between such groups and metal ions can derail isoreticular chemistry. It is even more challenging to have an isoreticular series of carboxyl&#8208;functionalized MOFs capable of encompassing chemically disparate metal ions. Here, with the simultaneous introduction of carboxyl functionalization and pore space partition, a family of carboxyl&#8208;functionalized materials is developed in diverse compositions from homometallic Cr3+ and Ni2+ to heterometallic Co2+/V3+, Ni2+/V3+, Co2+/In3+, Co2+/Ni2+. Cr&#8208;MOFs remain highly crystalline in boiling water. Unprecedentedly, one Cr&#8208;MOF can withstand the treatment cycle with 10m NaOH and 12m HCl, allowing reversible inter&#8208;conversion between unbound &#8722;COOH acid form and &#8722;COO&#8722; base form. These materials exhibit excellent sorption properties such as high uptake capacity for CO2 (100.2 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1) and hydrocarbon gases (e.g., 142.1 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1 for C2H2, 110.5 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1 for C2H4) at 1 bar and 298K, high benzene/cyclohexane selectivity (up to &#8776;40), and promising separation performance for gas mixtures such as C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4.

&lt;p&gt;A large family of carboxyl-functionalized MOFs with high porosity for gas separation have been synthesized. New Cr-MOFs are exceptionally stable in boiling water, extremely acidic (pH &amp;lt; 0) or basic (pH &amp;gt; 14) conditions and can be deprotonated and re-protonated following cycle of base-acid treatments, opening up applications under harsh conditions. New materials exhibit excellent adsorption properties such as high uptake capacity and promising separation performance for gas mixtures such as C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.

         <title>Chiral Intranasal Nanovaccines as Antivirals for Respiratory Syncytial Virus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral intranasal vaccines are fabricated to target the Respiratory Syncytial Virus and promote the immunological response by controlling the composition, size, and chirality of the nanostructures.








Abstract
This study aimed to develop an intranasal nanovaccine by combining chiral nanoparticles with the RSV pre&#8208;fusion protein (RSV protein) to create L&#8208;nanovaccine (L&#8208;Vac). The results showed that L&#8208;NPs increased antigen attachment in the nasal cavity by 3.83 times and prolonged its retention time to 72&#160;h. In vivo experimental data demonstrated that the intranasal immunization with L&#8208;Vac induced a 4.86&#8208;fold increase in secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) secretion in the upper respiratory tract, a 1.85&#8208;fold increase in the lower respiratory tract, and a 20.61&#8208;fold increase in RSV&#8208;specific immunoglobin G (IgG) titer levels in serum, compared with the commercial Alum Vac, while the neutralizing activity against the RSV authentic virus is 1.66&#8208;fold higher. The mechanistic investigation revealed that L&#8208;Vac activated the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway in nasal epithelial cells (NECs), in turn increasing the expression levels of interleukin&#8208;6 (IL&#8208;6) and C&#8211;C motif chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) by 1.67&#8208;fold and 3.46&#8208;fold, respectively, through the downstream nuclear factor kappa&#8208;B (NF&#8208;&#954;B) signaling pathway. Meanwhile, CCL20 recruited dendritic cells (DCs) and L&#8208;Vac activated the Toll&#8208;like receptor signaling pathway in DCs, promoting IL&#8208;6 expression and DCs maturation, and boosted sIgA production and T&#8208;cell responses. The findings suggested that L&#8208; Vac may serve as a candidate for the development of intranasal medicine against various types of respiratory infections.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells via In Situ Passivation Directed Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ passivation (ISP) method is introduced to adjust the crystal growth kinetics and obtain the (111)&#8208;orientated perovskite films with the passivated boundaries and interfaces, leading to high&#8208;performance inverted perovskite solar cells, with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 26.7% (certified as 26.09% at a 5.97 square millimeters active area).








Abstract
Lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as one of the influential photovoltaic technologies with promising cost&#8208;effectiveness. Though with mild processabilities to massive production, inverted PSCs have long suffered from inferior photovoltaic performances due to intractable defective states at boundaries and interfaces. Herein, an in situ passivation (ISP) method is presented to effectively adjust crystal growth kinetics and obtain the well&#8208;orientated perovskite films with the passivated boundaries and interfaces, successfully enabled the new access of high&#8208;performance inverted PSCs. The study unravels that the strong yet anisotropic ISP additive adsorption between different facets and the accompanied additive engineering yield the high&#8208;quality (111)&#8208;orientated perovskite crystallites with superior photovoltaic properties. The ISP&#8208;derived inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 26.7% (certified as 26.09% at a 5.97 mm2 active area) and 24.5% (certified as 23.53% at a 1.28 cm2 active area), along with decent operational stabilities.

         <title>Aggregate&#8208;Dominated Dilute Electrolytes with Low&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Resistant Ion&#8208;Conducting Channels for Highly Reversible Na Plating/Stripping</title>

         <dc:description>
A 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran&#8208;based electrolyte is designed with weak dissociation of Na+&#8208;PF6&#8722; ion pairs and a highly efficient network for ultrafast Na+ hopping, which breaks through the LT ion&#8208;conducting limitation of conventional electrolytes. The methyl&#8208;regulated electronic structure induces gradient decomposition toward an inorganic&#8208;organic bilayer SEI with high Na+ mobility. A record&#8208;high CE beyond 99.9% is achieved even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Developing rechargeable batteries with high power delivery at low temperatures (LT) below 0&#160;&#176;C is significant for cold&#8208;climate applications. Initial anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) promise high LT performances because of the low de&#8208;solvation energy and smaller Stokes radius of Na+, nondiffusion&#8208;limited plating/stripping electrochemistry, and maximized energy density. However, the severe reduction in electrolyte ionic conductivity and formation of unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) hinder their practical applications at LT. In this study, a 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran&#8208;based dilute electrolyte is designed to concurrently achieve an anion&#8208;coordinated solvation structure and impressive ionic conductivity of 3.58&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. The dominant aggregate solvates enable the formation of highly efficient and LT&#8208;resistant Na+ hopping channels in the electrolyte. Moreover, the methyl&#8208;regulated electronic structure in 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran induces gradient decomposition toward an inorganic&#8208;organic bilayer SEI with high Na+ mobility, composition homogeneity, and mechanical robustness. As such, a record&#8208;high Coulombic efficiency beyond 99.9% is achieved even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. The as&#8208;constructed AFSMBs sustain 300 cycles with 80% capacity maintained, and a 0.5&#8208;Ah level pouch cell delivers 85% capacity over 180 cycles at &#8722;25&#160;&#176;C. This study affords new insights into electrolyte formulation for fast ionic conduction and superior Na reversibility at ultralow temperatures.

         <title>Multifunctional Scavenger Boosts Cathode Interfacial Stability with Reduced Water Footprint for Direct Recycling of Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A refined direct recycling process to improve cathode interface stability by leveraging in situ reaction between surface residual lithium species and a weak inorganic acid to form a conformal Li+ conductive coating stabilizes the regenerated Ni&#8208;rich cathodes with significantly reduced water footprint. This intensified recycling process offers a more sustainable approach with the potential to transition from laboratory to industrial&#8208;scale applications, improving both product quality and environmental sustainability.








Abstract
The burgeoning accumulation of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), a byproduct from the widespread adoption of portable electronics and electric vehicles, necessitates efficient recycling strategies. Direct recycling represents a promising strategy to maximize the value of LIB waste and minimize harmful environmental outcomes. However, current efforts to large&#8208;scale direct recycling face challenges stemming from heterophase residues (e.g., Li2CO3, LiOH) in the recycled products and uncontrolled interfacial instability, often requiring repeated washing that generates significant wastewater. Here, a refined direct recycling process is proposed to improve cathode interface stability by leveraging in situ reaction between surface residual lithium species and a weak inorganic acid to form a conformal Li+ conductive coating that stabilizes the regenerated Ni&#8208;rich cathodes with significantly reduced water footprint. The findings reveal that the conductive coating also prevents direct contact between contaminants and the cathode surface, thus improving the ambient storage stability. By eliminating the need for extensive washing, this intensified recycling process offers a more sustainable approach with the potential to transition from laboratory to industrial&#8208;scale applications, improving both product quality and environmental sustainability.

         <title>Dynamic Control of Asymmetric Charge Distribution for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic catalytic system by precisely controlling the asymmetric charge density distribution in an Au&#8208;doped cpCu7CF catalyst is developed and successfully applied in regulating the multiple steps of sequential reactions in urea electrosynthesis.








Abstract
Constructing dual catalytic sites with charge density differences is an efficient way to promote urea electrosynthesis from parallel NO3&#8722;${\mathrm{NO}}_3^ - $ and CO2 reduction yet still challenging in static system. Herein, a dynamic system is constructed by precisely controlling the asymmetric charge density distribution in an Au&#8208;doped coplanar Cu7 clusters&#8208;based 3D framework&#160;catalyst (Au@cpCu7CF). In Au@cpCu7CF, the redistributed charge between Au and Cu atoms changed periodically with the application of pulse potentials switching between &#8722;0.2 and &#8722;0.6&#8201;V and greatly facilitated the electrosynthesis of urea. Compared with the static condition of pristine cpCu7CF (FEurea = 5.10%), the FEurea of Au@cpCu7CF under pulsed potentials is up to 55.53%. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the high potential of &#8722;0.6&#160;V improved the adsorption of *HNO2 and *NH2 on Au atoms and inhibited the reaction pathways of by&#8208;products. While at the low potential of &#8722;0.2&#160;V, the charge distribution between Au and Cu atomic sites facilitated the thermodynamic C&#8211;N coupling step. This work demonstrated the important role of asymmetric charge distribution under dynamic regulation for urea electrosynthesis, providing a new inspiration for precise control of electrocatalysis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Growing Hydrogel Bioadhesives for Chronic Wound Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel bioadhesive patch, which is featured with a gradual increase in mechanics in an autonomous and self&#8208;growing manner is exploited for the chronic wound management through long&#8208;term yet dynamic mechanical modulation.








Abstract
Hydrogel bioadhesives have emerged as a promising alternative to wound dressings for chronic wound management. However, many existing bioadhesives do not meet the functional requirements for efficient wound management through dynamically mechanical modulation, due to the reduced wound contractibility, frequent wound recurrence, incapability to actively adapt to external microenvironment variation, especially for those gradually&#8208;expanded chronic wounds. Here, a self&#8208;growing hydrogel bioadhesive (sGHB) patch that exhibits instant adhesion to biological tissues but also a gradual increase in mechanical strength and interfacial adhesive strength within a 120&#8208;h application is presented. The gradually increased mechanics of the sGHB patch could effectively mitigate the stress concentration at the wound edge, and also resist the wound expansion at various stages, thus mechanically contracting the chronic wounds in a programmable manner. The self&#8208;growing hydrogel patch demonstrated enhanced wound healing efficacy in a mouse diabetic wound model, by regulating the inflammatory response, promoting the faster re&#8208;epithelialization and angiogenesis through mechanical modulation. Such kind of self&#8208;growing hydrogel bioadhesives have potential clinical utility for a variety of wound management where dynamic mechanical modulation is indispensable.

         <title>Sequential Targeted Enzyme&#8208;Instructed Self&#8208;Assembly Supramolecular Nanofibers to Attenuate Intervertebral Disc Degeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inflammatory cytokines and cellular senescence collectively contribute to the intervertebral disc degeneration. Enzyme&#8208;instructed self&#8208;assembly supramolecular nanofibers (Fbp&#8208;GFFYPLGLAG(E)nRGD) are developed to target the overexpression of two crucial enzymes, MMP&#8208;2 and COX&#8208;2. These nanofibers can effectively block the synergistic effect of the inflammatory cascade and aging&#8208;related secretion phenotype and reduce the extracellular matrix damage caused by inflammation and aging cell accumulation. Finally, it can mitigate the progression of disc degeneration.








Abstract
As an age&#8208;related disease, intervertebral disc degeneration is closely related to inflammation and aging. Inflammatory cytokines and cellular senescence collectively contribute to the degradation of intervertebral disc. Blocking this synergy reduces disc extracellular matrix damage caused by inflammation and aging. In this study, drug&#8208;loaded nanofibers with sequential targeting functions are constructed through intelligent response, hydrophilicity, and in situ self&#8208;assembly empowerment of flurbiprofen. The peptide precursor responds to the cleavage of overexpressed MMP&#8208;2 in the degenerative intervertebral disc microenvironment (intracellular and extracellular), resulting in the formation of self&#8208;assembled nanofibers that enable the on&#8208;demand release of flurbiprofen and COX&#8208;2 response. In vitro, Comp. 1 (Flurbiprofen&#8208;GFFYPLGLAGEEEERGD) reduces the expression of inflammation&#8208;related genes and proteins and the polarization of M1 macrophages by competitively inhibiting COX&#8208;2 and increases the expression of extracellular matrix proteins COL&#8208;2 and aggrecan. Additionally, it can reduce the expression of Senescence&#8208;Associated Secretory Phenotype and DNA damage in aged nucleus pulposus cells and promote the recovery of proliferation and cell cycle. In vivo, drug&#8208;loaded nanofibers delay intervertebral disc degeneration by inhibiting inflammation and preventing the accumulation of senescent cells. Therefore, the sequentially targeted self&#8208;assembled drug&#8208;loaded nanofibers can delay intervertebral disc degeneration by blocking the synergistic effect of inflammatory cytokines and cellular senescence.

         <title>Near 100% Conversion of Acetylene to High&#8208;purity Ethylene at Ampere&#8208;Level Current</title>

The delicately prepared CuO nanoribbons electrocatalyst with abundant vacancies exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance for the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of C2H2 to C2H4 in the C2H2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 flow cell and Zn&#8208;C2H2 battery. The integrated system achieves near 100% C2H2 conversion and higher than 96.1% C2H4 specific selectivity, generating polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 products.








Abstract
Direct production of high&#8208;purity ethylene from acetylene using renewable energy through electrocatalytic semi&#8208;hydrogenation presents a promising alternative to traditional thermocatalytic processes. However, the low conversion of acetylene results in a significant amount of acetylene impurities in the product, necessitating additional purification steps.

&lt;p&gt;The delicately prepared CuO nanoribbons electrocatalyst with abundant vacancies exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance for the semi-hydrogenation of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; flow cell and Zn-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery. The integrated system achieves near 100% C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion and higher than 96.1% C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; specific selectivity, generating polymer-grade C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; products.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct production of high-purity ethylene from acetylene using renewable energy through electrocatalytic semi-hydrogenation presents a promising alternative to traditional thermocatalytic processes. However, the low conversion of acetylene results in a significant amount of acetylene impurities in the product, necessitating additional purification steps. Herein, a tandem electrocatalytic system that integrates acetylene electrolyzer and zinc-acetylene battery units for high-purity ethylene production is designed. The ultrathin CuO nanoribbons with enriched oxygen vacancies (CuO&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt; NRs) as electrocatalysts achieve a remarkable 93.2% Faradaic efficiency of ethylene at an ampere-level current density of 1.0&#160;A&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in an acetylene electrolyzer, and the power density reaches 3.8&#160;mW&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in a zinc-acetylene battery under acetylene stream. Moreover, the tandem electrocatalysis system delivers a single-pass acetylene conversion of 99.998% and ethylene selectivity of 96.1% at a high current of 1.4&#160;A. Experimental data and calculations demonstrate that the presence of oxygen vacancies accelerates water dissociation to produce active hydrogen atoms while preventing the over-hydrogenation of ethylene. Furthermore, techno-economic analysis reveals that the tandem system can dramatically reduce the overall ethylene production cost compared to the conventional thermocatalytic processes. A novel strategy for complete acetylene-to-ethylene conversion under mild conditions, establishing a non-petroleum route for the production of ethylene is reported.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Local Dipole Modulation Toward High Fill Factor in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Local dipole modulation in organic solar cells can significantly enhance device performance. By adjusting molecular asymmetries, two non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, AA&#8208;1 and AA&#8208;2 are synthesized. The unidirectional asymmetry in AA&#8208;2 led to an improved balanced charge transport, resulting in an exceptional fill factor of 0.830 and a power conversion efficiency of 18.3%.








Abstract
Dipole moment arrangement in organic semiconductors plays a critical role in affecting the intermolecular packing, determining optoelectronic properties and device performance. Here, to get the desired fill factor (FF) values in organic solar cells (OSCs), the local dipole of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) is modulated by changing the molecular asymmetries. Two NFAs, AA&#8208;1 and AA&#8208;2 are designed and synthesized, which have different substitutions of alkyl and alkoxyl groups. The unidirectional asymmetry in AA&#8208;2 creates distinct local dipoles, while the bidirectional asymmetry in AA&#8208;1 mitigates dipole variation. Despite the minimal impact on monomolecular properties, the local dipole moment significantly influences terminal group packing modes in the film state. This, in turn, enhances the relative dielectric constant, prolongs exciton lifetime, and reduces sub&#8208;bandgap defect states. Consequently, PBDB&#8208;TF:AA&#8208;2&#8208;based OSCs achieve an exceptional FF of 0.830 and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.3%, with a ternary device reaching a PCE of 19.3%. This work highlights the potential of dipole modulation in material design to get ideal FF values for high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Constructing Multiscale Fibrous Morphology to Achieve 20% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells by Mixing High and Low Molecular Weight D18</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MIX&#8208;D18, by mixing HW&#8208;D18 (high molecular weight D18) and LW&#8208;D18 (low molecular weight D18), can form multiscale fibrous morphology. The finer nanofibers of HW&#8208;D18 can increase Donor/Acceptor contact, enhancing exciton dissociation and collection efficiency, while the thicker nanofibers of LW&#8208;D18 can improve crystallinity and boost charge transport capability. Ultimately, a efficiency of 20.0% is achieved by MIX&#8208;D18:L8&#8208;BO device.








Abstract
This study underscores the significance of precisely manipulating the morphology of the active layer in organic solar cells (OSCs). By blending polymer donors of D18 with varying molecular weights, a multiscale interpenetrating fiber network structure within the active layer is successfully created. The introduction of 10% low molecular weight D18 (LW&#8208;D18) into high molecular weight D18 (HW&#8208;D18) produces MIX&#8208;D18, which exhibits an extended exciton diffusion distance and orderly molecular stacking. Devices utilizing MIX&#8208;D18 demonstrate superior electron and hole transport, improves exciton dissociation, enhances charge collection efficiency, and reduces trap&#8208;assisted recombination compared to the other two materials. Through the use of the nonfullerene acceptor L8&#8208;BO, a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.0% is achieved. This methodology, which integrates the favorable attributes of high and low molecular weight polymers, opens a new avenue for enhancing the performance of OSCs.

         <title>Extracellular Vesicles from Nanomedicine&#8208;Trained Intestinal Microbiota Substitute for Fecal Microbiota Transplant in Treating Ulcerative Colitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>

Gut microbiota from CN@Lp127&#8208;trained healthy mice secrete extracellular vesicles (Gm&#8208;EVs) that regulate intestinal microbiota, colonic immune environment, and purine metabolism. These Gm&#8208;EVs significantly improve the treatment outcomes against ulcerative colitis by reducing inflammation, restoring colonic barrier function, and rebalancing intestinal microbiota, offering an alternative to fecal microbiota transplant.








Abstract
The biosafety concerns associated with fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) limit their clinical application in treating ulcerative colitis (UC). Gut microbiota secrete abundant extracellular vesicles (Gm&#8208;EVs), which play a critical role in bacteria&#8208;to&#8208;bacteria and bacteria&#8208;to&#8208;host communications. Herein, intestinal microbiota are trained using tea leaf lipid/pluronic F127&#8208;coated curcumin nanocrystals (CN@Lp127s), which can maintain stability during transit through the gastrointestinal tract. Compared with FMT, Gm&#8208;EVs derived from healthy mice significantly improve treatment outcomes against UC by reducing colonic inflammatory responses, restoring colonic barrier function, and rebalancing intestinal microbiota. Strikingly, Gm&#8208;EVs obtained from CN@Lp127&#8208;trained healthy mice exhibit a superior therapeutic effect on UC compared to groups receiving FMT from healthy mice, Gm&#8208;EVs from healthy mice, and FMT from CN@Lp127&#8208;trained healthy mice. Oral administration of Gm&#8208;EVs from CN@Lp127&#8208;trained healthy mice not only alleviates colonic inflammation, promotes mucosal repair, and regulates gut microbiota but also regulates purine metabolism to decrease the uric acid level, resulting in a robust improvement in the UC. This study demonstrates the UC therapeutic efficacy of Gm&#8208;EVs derived from nanomedicine&#8208;trained gut microbiota in regulating the immune microenvironment, microbiota, and purine metabolism of the colon. These EVs provide an alternative platform to replace FMT as a treatment for UC.

         <title>Bottom Contact Engineering for Ambient Fabrication of &gt;25% Durable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium gluconate (SG) is used to disperse tin oxide (SnO2) nanoparticles (NPs) in order to create a uniform SG&#8208;SnO2 film and control the buried interface. This allows for the deposition of perovskite films with nearly pinhole&#8208;free at the bottom contact interface in ambient air. The SG&#8208;SnO2 PSCs achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.34% (certified as 25.17%). Additionally, these PSCs retained around 90% of their initial PCE after 1000 h of operation (T90 = 1000&#160;h). Microstructure analysis revealed that light&#8208;induced degradation primarily occurred at the buried holes, so SG&#8208;SnO2 PSCs enhance light stability by suppressing the formation of holes at the buried interface.








Abstract
The bottom contact in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is easy to cause deep trap states and severe instability issues, especially under maximum power point tracking (MPPT). In this study, sodium gluconate (SG) is employed to disperse tin oxide (SnO2) nanoparticles (NPs) and regulate the interface contact at the buried interface. The SG&#8208;SnO2 electron transfer layer (ETL) enabled the deposition of pinhole&#8208;free perovskite films in ambient air and improved interface contact by bridging effect. SG&#8208;SnO2 PSCs achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.34% (certified as 25.17%) with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) exceeding 1.19&#160;V. The VOC loss is less than 0.34&#160;V relative to the 1.53&#160;eV bandgap, and the fill factor (FF) loss is only 2.02% due to the improved contact. The SG&#8208;SnO2 PSCs retained around 90% of their initial PCEs after 1000&#160;h operation (T90 = 1000&#160;h), higher than T80 = 1000&#160;h for the control SnO2 PSC. Microstructure analysis revealed that light&#8208;induced degradation primarily occurred at the buried holes and grain boundaries and highlighted the importance of bottom&#8208;contact engineering.

&lt;p&gt;Sodium gluconate (SG) is used to disperse tin oxide (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) nanoparticles (NPs) in order to create a uniform SG-SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; film and control the buried interface. This allows for the deposition of perovskite films with nearly pinhole-free at the bottom contact interface in ambient air. The SG-SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; PSCs achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.34% (certified as 25.17%). Additionally, these PSCs retained around 90% of their initial PCE after 1000 h of operation (T&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; = 1000&#160;h). Microstructure analysis revealed that light-induced degradation primarily occurred at the buried holes, so SG-SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; PSCs enhance light stability by suppressing the formation of holes at the buried interface.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom contact in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is easy to cause deep trap states and severe instability issues, especially under maximum power point tracking (MPPT). In this study, sodium gluconate (SG) is employed to disperse tin oxide (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) nanoparticles (NPs) and regulate the interface contact at the buried interface. The SG-SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electron transfer layer (ETL) enabled the deposition of pinhole-free perovskite films in ambient air and improved interface contact by bridging effect. SG-SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; PSCs achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.34% (certified as 25.17%) with a high open-circuit voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;) exceeding 1.19&#160;V. The &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; loss is less than 0.34&#160;V relative to the 1.53&#160;eV bandgap, and the fill factor (FF) loss is only 2.02% due to the improved contact. The SG-SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; PSCs retained around 90% of their initial PCEs after 1000&#160;h operation (T&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; = 1000&#160;h), higher than T&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt; = 1000&#160;h for the control SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; PSC. Microstructure analysis revealed that light-induced degradation primarily occurred at the buried holes and grain boundaries and highlighted the importance of bottom-contact engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enabling Stable Operation of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries under Fast&#8208;Operating Conditions by Tuning the Electrolyte Chemistry</title>

Fluorinated ester&#8208;based fast&#8208;charging electrolytes (FCEs) facilitate an exceptional lifespan of 3000 cycles at charge rates of as high as 4 C with 0&#8211;100% state&#8208;of&#8208;charge in commercial 1 Ah graphite|LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 pouch cells. The superior performance is due to the well&#8208;tuned solvation structure, enhanced solvent solvation ability, and ameliorated electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase chemistry.








Abstract
Inferior fast&#8208;charging and low&#8208;temperature performances remain a hurdle for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Overcoming this hurdle is extremely challenging primarily due to the low conductivity of commercial ethylene carbonate (EC)&#8208;based electrolytes and the formation of undesirable solid electrolyte interphases with poor Li+&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics. Here, a series of EC&#8208;free fast&#8208;charging electrolytes (FCEs) by incorporating a fluorinated ester, methyl trifluoroacetate (MTFA), as a special cosolvent into a practically viable LiPF6&#8211;dimethyl carbonate&#8211;fluoroethylene carbonate system, is reported. With a solvent&#8208;dominated solvation structure, MTFA facilitates the formation of thin, yet robust, interphases on both the cathode and anode. Commercial 1 Ah graphite|LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 pouch cells filled with the FCE exhibit &#8776;80% capacity retention over 3000 cycles at 3 C and 4 C (15&#160;min) charging rates in the full range of 0&#8211;100% state&#8208;of&#8208;charge. Moreover, even at a low operating temperature of &#8722;20 &#176;C, the 1 Ah cell retains a high capacity of 0.65 Ah at a 2 C discharge rate and displays virtually no capacity fade on cycling at a C/5 rate. The work highlights the power of electrolyte design in achieving extra&#8208;fast&#8208;charging and low&#8208;temperature performances.

         <title>General Design of Aligned&#8208;Channel Porous Carbon Electrodes for Efficient High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Gas&#8208;Evolving Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of aligned&#8208;channel carbon electrodes by a general design strategy are developed, which not only facilitates the fast accessibility of liquid reactants and the timely detachment of gaseous products but also possesses a large pore area to accommodate abundant active sites, thus achieving high&#8208;performance gas&#8208;evolving electrocatalysis at high current densities, including urea oxidation reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Gas&#8208;evolving reactions (GERs) are important in many electrochemical energy conversion technologies and chemical industries. The operation of GERs at high current densities is critical for their industrial implementation but remains challenging as it poses stringent requirements on the electrodes in terms of reaction kinetics, mass transfer, and electron transport. Here the general and rational design of self&#8208;standing carbon electrodes with vertically aligned porous channels, appropriate pore size distribution, and high surface area as supports for loading a variety of catalytic species by facile electrodeposition are reported. These electrodes simultaneously possess high intrinsic activity, large numbers of active sites, and efficient transport highways for ions, gases, and electrons, resulting in significant performance improvements at high current densities in diverse GERs such as urea oxidation, hydrogen evolution, and oxygen evolution reactions, as well as overall urea/water electrolyzers. As an example, the carbon electrode decorated with Ni(OH)2 demonstrates a record&#8208;high current density of 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.360&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, largely outperforming the conventional nickel foam&#8208;based counterpart and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrodes.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Indium Oxide Electrochemical Sensor for Stable and Selective NO2 Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study pioneers the use of nonprecious metal electrochemical sensing materials, specifically nitrided In2O3, for NO2 detection. The In2O3 N&#8208;40 min sensor exhibits a robust response (771 nA to 10 ppm NO2), exceptional stability (&gt;30 days), and rapid recovery (5/16 s), outperforming Pt/C with 63 times higher selectivity and 98% longer stability.








Abstract
Efficient gas sensors are critical for environmental monitoring and industrial safety. While metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensors are cost&#8208;effective, they struggle with poor selectivity, high operating temperatures, and limited stability. Electrochemical sensors, though selective and energy&#8208;efficient, face high costs, and stability issues due to precious metal catalysts like platinum on carbon (Pt/C). Herein, a novel, cost&#8208;effective electrochemical sensor using nitrogen&#8208;doped indium oxide In2O3&#8722;xN2x/3Vx/3 (0.01&#8804;x&#8804;0.14), synthesized with varying nitriding times is presented. The optimized In2O3 N&#8208;40&#160;min sensor demonstrates a remarkable response current of 771 nA to 10&#160;ppm nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at ambient temperature, with outstanding long&#8208;term stability (over 30 days) and rapid response/recovery times (5/16 s). Compared to Pt/C sensors, it shows 84% and 67% reductions in response and recovery times, respectively, and maintains 98% performance after a month, versus 68% for Pt/C. This cost&#8208;effective sensor presents a promising alternative for electrochemical gas sensing, eliminating the need for precious metal catalysts.

Ferroptosis in neurons is considered one of the key factors that induces Parkinson's disease (PD), which is caused by excessive iron accumulation in the intracellular labile iron pool (LIP). The iron ions released from the LIP lead to the aberrant generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to trigger ferroptosis and exacerbate PD progression. Herein, a pioneering design of multifunctional nanoregulator deferoxamine (DFO)&#8208;integrated nanosheets (BDPR NSs) is presented that target the LIP to restrict ferroptosis and protect against PD. The BDPR NSs are constructed by incorporating a brain&#8208;targeting peptide and DFO into polydopamine&#8208;modified black phosphorus nanosheets. These BDPR NSs can sequester free iron ions, thereby ameliorating LIP overload and regulating iron metabolism. Furthermore, the BDPR NSs can decrease lipid peroxidation generation by mitigating ROS accumulation. More importantly, BDPR NSs can specifically accumulate in the mitochondria to suppress ROS generation and decrease mitochondrial iron accumulation. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the BDPR NSs highly efficiently mitigated dopaminergic neuronloss and its associated behavioral disorders by modulating the LIP and inhibiting ferroptosis. Thus, the BDPR&#8208;based nanovectors holds promise as a potential avenue for advancing PD therapy.

         <title>Polymeric Nanocarriers Autonomously Cross the Plant Cell Wall and Enable Protein Delivery for Stress Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic high aspect ratio polymeric nanocarrier is developed to deliver functional protein in crops to enable species&#8208;independent plant engineering. The delivered sensor protein reduction&#8208;oxidation sensitive green fluorescent protein (roGFP) successfully monitors stressors in tobacco, tomato, and maize. This functional protein delivery platform paves the way for new technologies in plant sensing and engineering, contributing to the design of new solutions that promote plant&#8208;based sustainable development.








Abstract
Delivery of proteins in plant cells can facilitate the design of desired functions by modulation of biological processes and plant traits but is currently limited by narrow host range, tissue damage, and poor scalability. Physical barriers in plants, including cell walls and membranes, limit protein delivery to desired plant tissues. Herein, a cationic high aspect ratio polymeric nanocarriers (PNCs) platform is developed to enable efficient protein delivery to plants. The cationic nature of PNCs binds proteins through electrostatic. The ability to precisely design PNCs&#8217; size and aspect ratio allowed us to find a cutoff of &#8776;14&#160;nm in the cell wall, below which cationic PNCs can autonomously overcome the barrier and carry their cargo into plant cells. To exploit these findings, a reduction&#8208;oxidation sensitive green fluorescent protein (roGFP) is deployed as a stress sensor protein cargo in a model plant Nicotiana benthamiana and common crop plants, including tomato and maize. In vivo imaging of PNC&#8208;roGFP enabled optical monitoring of plant response to wounding, biotic, and heat stressors. These results show that PNCs can be precisely designed below the size exclusion limit of cell walls to overcome current limitations in protein delivery to plants and facilitate species&#8208;independent plant engineering.

         <title>Stabilization of Cu&#948;+ Sites Within MnO2 for Superior Urea Electro&#8208;Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A typical Cu&#8208;doped MnO2 (Cu&#8208;MnO2) with stable Cu&#948;+&#8208;oxygen vacancies (Ovs)&#8208;Mn3+ dual site (Cu&#948;+&#8208;Ovs&#8208;Mn3+) achieves a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) and urea yield rate in electrocatalytic CO2/NO3&#8722; reduction with a highest yield rate of 116.7&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;gcat.&#8722;1 in a flow cell. Mechanistic studies reveal that such stabilized Cu&#948;+ sites kinetically lower the energy barrier of C&#8208;N coupling.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic C&#8208;N coupling between NO3&#8208; and CO2 has emerged as a sustainable route for urea production. However, identifying catalytic active sites and designing efficient electrocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, the synthesis of Cu&#8208;doped MnO2 nanotube (denoted as Cu&#8208;MnO2) with stable Cu&#948;+&#8208;oxygen vacancies (Ovs)&#8208;Mn3+ dual sites is reported. Compared with pure MnO2, Cu&#948;+ doping can effectively enhance urea production performance in the co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and NO3&#8208;. Thus, Cu&#8208;MnO2 catalyst exhibits a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 54.7% and the highest yield rate of 116.7&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;gcat.&#8722;1 in a flow cell. Remarkably, the urea yield rate remains over 78&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;gcat.&#8722;1 across a wide potential range. Further experimental and theoretical results elucidate the unique role of Cu&#8208;MnO2 solid&#8208;solution for stabilizing Cu&#948;+ sites in Cu&#948;+&#8208;Ovs&#8208;Mn3+, endowing the catalyst with superior structural and electrochemical stabilities. This thermodynamically promotes urea formation and kinetically lowers the energy barrier of C&#8208;N coupling.

         <title>Substrate Induced p&#8211;n Transition for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substrate&#8208;induced re&#8208;growth strategy is proposed to induce p&#8208; to n&#8208;transition of perovskite surface. Bulk perovskite grows on ITO/P3CT&#8208;N and shows p&#8208;type, while its surface re&#8208;grows on ITO/SnO2 and transits to n&#8208;type, introducing an interfacial junction. Resulting inverted perovskite solar cells exhibit &gt;25% efficiency with good stability, retaining 90% of initial efficiency after MPP tracking for 800&#160;h at 65&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The p&#8208; or n&#8208;type property of semiconductor materials directly determine the final performance of photoelectronic devices. Generally, perovskite deposited on p&#8208;type substrate tends to be p&#8208;type, while perovskite deposited on n&#8208;type substrate tends to be n&#8208;type. Motived by this, a substrate&#8208;induced re&#8208;growth strategy is reported to induce p&#8208; to n&#8208;transition of perovskite surface in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). p&#8208;type perovskite film is obtained and crystallized on p&#8208;type substrate first. Then an n&#8208;type ITO/SnO2 substrate with saturated perovskite solution is pressed onto the perovskite film and annealed to induce the secondary re&#8208;growth of perovskite surface region. As a result, p&#8208; to n&#8208;type transition happens and induces an extra junction at perovskite surface region, thus enhancing the built&#8208;in potential and promoting carrier extraction in PSCs. Resulting inverted PSCs exhibit high efficiency of over 25% with good operational stability, retaining 90% of initial efficiency after maximum power point (MPP) tracking for 800&#160;h at 65&#160;&#176;C with ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocol.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A group of Co X&#8208;ides are adopted as the models to investigate the catalytic behavior differences toward the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of quinoline (ECHQ). The Co3O4 undergoes an ideal 1,4/2,3&#8208;H* addition pathway and presents the best conversion and selectivity toward ECHQ. The key enhanced mechanism of Co3O4 toward ECHQ is demonstrated to be closely&#160;related to its favorable interfacial water adsorption and the spontaneous desorption of product.








Abstract
Earth&#8208;abundant Co X&#8208;ides are emerging as promising catalysts for the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of quinoline (ECHQ), yet challenging due to the limited fundamental understanding of ECHQ mechanism on Co X&#8208;ides. This work identifies the catalytic performance differences of Co X&#8208;ides in ECHQ and provides significant insights into the catalytic mechanism of ECHQ. Among selected Co X&#8208;ides, the Co3O4 presents the best ECHQ performance with a high conversion of 98.2% and 100% selectivity at ambient conditions. The Co3O4 sites present a higher proportion of 2&#8208;coordinated hydrogen&#8208;bonded water at the interface than other Co X&#8208;ides at a low negative potential, which enhances the kinetics of subsequent water dissociation to produce H*. An ideal 1,4/2,3&#8208;H* addition pathway on Co3O4 surface with a spontaneous desorption of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline is demonstrated through operando tracing and theoretical calculations. In comparison, the Co9S8 sites display the lowest ECHQ performance due to the high thermodynamic barrier in the H* formation step, which suppresses subsequent hydrogenation; while the ECHQ on Co(OH)F and CoP sites undergo the 1,2,3,4&#8208; and 4,3/1,2&#8208;H* addition pathway respectively with the high desorption barriers and thus low conversion of quinoline. Moreover, the Co3O4 presents a wide substrate scope and allows excellent conversion of other quinoline derivatives and N&#8208;heterocyclic substrates.

         <title>Unveiling the Reaction Mystery Between Lithium Polysulfides and Lithium Metal Anode in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction mystery of the reaction between lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and Li metal is revealed. Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfony)imide (LiTFSI) slowly reacts with Li metal to form a SO42&#8722;&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). LiPSs react rapidly with Li metal to form a Li2S&#8208;rich SEI with poor stability. Lithium nitrate (LiNO3) modulates the solvation structure of LiPSs to inherently suppress the reactivity of LiPSs and improves the Li anode stability.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are widely regarded as one of the most promising next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage devices. However, soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) corrode Li metal and deteriorate the cycling stability of Li&#8211;S batteries. Understanding the reaction mechanism between LiPSs and Li metal anode is imperative. Herein, the reaction rate and products of LiPSs with Li metal anode, the composition and structure of the as&#8208;generated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and the mechanism of lithium nitrate (LiNO3) additives for inhibiting the corrosion reactions are systematically unveiled. Concretely, LiPSs react with Li metal anode more rapidly than Li salt and generate a Li2S&#8208;rich SEI. The Li2S&#8208;rich SEI is highly reactive with LiPSs, which exacerbates the formation of dendritic Li and the continuous corrosion of active Li. LiNO3 functions dominantly by modulating the solvation structure of LiPSs and inherently reducing the reactivity of LiPSs, rather than the conventional understanding of LiNO3 participating in the formation of SEI. This work reveals the reaction mechanism between LiPSs and Li metal anode and inspires rational regulating of the solvation structure of LiPSs for stabilizing Li metal anode in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Enhancing the Electrical Conductivity and Long&#8208;Term Stability of PEDOT:PSS Electrodes through Sequential Treatment with Nitric Acid and Cesium Chloride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conductivity of sub&#8208;20&#8208;nm thin poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) films is improved by treating them sequentially with HNO3 and CsCl. The resulting layers show enhanced crystallinity with electrical conductivity of up to 5500 S cm&#8722;1, with 85% of this value being retained after 270 d of storage in ambient air at room temperature without being encapsulated.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is an important polymeric conductor used extensively in organic flexible, wearable, and stretchable optoelectronics. However, further enhancing its conductivity and long&#8208;term stability while maintaining its superb mechanical properties remains challenging. Here, a novel post&#8208;treatment approach to enhance the electrical properties and stability of sub&#8208;20&#8208;nm&#8208;thin PEDOT:PSS films processed from solution is introduced. The approach involves a sequential post&#8208;treatment with HNO3 and CsCl, resulting in a remarkable enhancement of the electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films to over 5500 S cm&#8722;1, along with improved carrier mobility. The post&#8208;treated films exhibit remarkable air stability, retaining over 85% of their initial conductivity even after 270 days of storage. Various characterization techniques, including X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Hall effect measurements, and grazing incidence wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering, coupled with density functional theory calculations, provide insights into the structural changes and interactions responsible for these improvements. To demonstrate the potential for practical applications, the ultrathin PEDOT:PSS films are connected to an inorganic light&#8208;emitting diode with a battery, showcasing their suitability as transparent electrodes. This work presents a promising approach for enhancing the electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS while offering a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms that can guide further advances.

         <title>Bubble&#8208;Guidance Breaking Gas Shield for Highly Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to break the gas shield by an anisotropic groove&#8208;micro/nanostructured porous electrode (GMPE) is demonstrated for achieving high&#8208;efficiency electrolytic water splitting. Gradient groove&#8208;micro/nanostructures on the GMPE serve as high&#8208;speed bubble form, transport, and detach channels, and exhibit superior bubble&#8208;guidance capabilities, which cooperatively improve mass transfer.








Abstract
Overall water splitting is a promising technology for sustainable hydrogen production, but the primary challenge is removing bubbles from the electrode surface quickly to increase hydrogen production. Inspired by the directional fluid transport properties of natural biological surfaces like Nepenthes peristome and Morpho butterfly's wings, here a strategy is demonstrated to achieve highly efficient overall water splitting by a bubble&#8208;guidance electrode, that is, an anisotropic groove&#8208;micro/nanostructured porous electrode (GMPE). Gradient groove micro/nanostructures on the GMPE serve as high&#8208;speed bubble transmission channels and exhibit superior bubble&#8208;guidance capabilities. The synergistic effect of the asymmetric Laplace pressure generated between microscale porous structure and groove patterns and the buoyancy along the groove patterns pushes the produced bubbles directionally to spread, transport, and detach from the electrode surface in time. Moreover, the low adhesive nanosheet arrays are beneficial to reduce bubble size and increase bubble release frequency, which cooperatively improve mass transfer with the microscale structure. Notably, GMPE outperforms planar&#8208;micro/nanostructured porous electrode (PMPE) in hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions, with GMPE||GMPE showing better water splitting performance than commercially available RuO2||20 wt.% Pt/C. This work improves electrodes for better mass transfer and kinetics in electrochemical reactions at solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;gas interfaces, offering insight for designing and preparing gas&#8208;involved photoelectrochemical electrodes.

         <title>Monolithic DNApatite: An Elastic Apatite with Sub&#8208;Nanometer Scale Organo&#8211;Inorganic Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel realization of an elastic&#8208;ceramic material, featuring &#8216;deoxyribonucleic apatite (DNApatite),&#8217; is newly synthesized, incorporating both ceramic (hydroxyapatite, HA) and polymeric (single&#8208;stranded DNA, ssDNA) elements at a sub&#8208;nm scale to overcome the limits of conventional ceramic materials. This novel non&#8208;composite material achieves synergistic effects from the combination of different material types, namely ceramic and polymer without additional phosphate ion.








Abstract
Hydroxyapatite (HA) exhibits outstanding biocompatibility, bioactivity, osteoconductivity, and natural anti&#8208;inflammatory properties. Pure HA, ion&#8208;doped HA, and HA&#8208;polymer composites are investigated, but&#160;critical limitations such as brittleness remain; numerous efforts are being made to address them. Herein, the novel self&#8208;crystallization of a polymeric single&#8208;stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (ssDNA) without additional phosphate ions for synthesizing deoxyribonucleic apatite (DNApatite) is presented. The synthesized DNApatite, DNA1Ca2.2(PO4)1.3OH2.1, has a repetitive dual phase of inorganic HA crystals and amorphous organic ssDNA at the sub&#8208;nm scale, forming nanorods. Its mechanical properties, including toughness and elasticity, are significantly enhanced compared with those of HA nanorod, with a Young's modulus similar to that of natural bone.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Weak Polarization&#8208;Strain Coupling Effect Boosts Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As the service electric field for MLCCs in pulsed circuit systems increases, electrostrain&#8208;induced vibration has become a critical failure mechanism. By employing a polarization&#8208;strain weak coupling strategy, the electrostriction coefficient of the relaxor dielectrics is significantly suppressed. This mitigation reduces the breakdown risk, enhancing the stability, performance, and lifespan of MLCCs.








Abstract
In pulse power systems, multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) encounter significant challenges due to the heightened loading electric field (E), which can lead to fatigue damage and ultrasonic concussion caused by electrostrictive strain. To address these issues, an innovative strategy focused on achieving an ultra&#8208;weak polarization&#8208;strain coupling effect is proposed, which effectively reduces strain in MLCCs. Remarkably, an ultra&#8208;low electrostrictive coefficient (Q33) of 0.012 m4 C&#8722;2 is achieved in the composition 0.55(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3&#8208;0.45Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3, resulting in a significantly reduced strain of 0.118% at 330&#160;kV cm&#8722;1. At the atomic scale, the local structural heterogeneity leads to an expanded and loose lattice structure, providing ample space for large ionic displacement polarization instead of lattice stretching when subjected to the applied E. This unique behavior not only promotes energy storage performance (ESP) but also accounts for the observed ultra&#8208;low Q33 and strain. Consequently, the MLCC device exhibits an impressive energy storage density of 14.6 J cm&#8722;3 and an ultrahigh efficiency of 93% at 720&#160;kV cm&#8722;1. Furthermore, the superior ESP of the MLCC demonstrates excellent fatigue resistance and temperature stability, making it a promising solution for practical applications. Overall, this pivotal strategy offers a cost&#8208;effective solution for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MLCCs with ultra&#8208;low strain&#8208;vibration in pulse power systems.

         <title>Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom Modulated Protonated Iridium Oxide for Acidic Water Oxidation in Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonated iridium oxides, known for their durability in acidic water oxidation, have limited intrinsic catalytic performance. This study demonstrates that incorporating Ru single atoms and oxygen vacancies within the Ir&#9472;O lattice can optimize oxygen intermediate binding and stabilize Ir active sites, significantly enhancing both catalytic activity and stability, leading to a highly efficient electrocatalyst in proton exchange membrane water electrolysers.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane water electrolysers promise to usher in a new era of clean energy, but they remain a formidable obstacle in designing active and durable electrocatalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, a protonated iridium oxide embedded with single&#8208;atom dispersed ruthenium atoms (H3.8Ir1&#8722;xRuxO4) that demonstrates exceptional activity and stability in acidic water oxidation is introduced. The single Ru dopants favorably induce localized oxygen vacancies in the Ir&#9472;O lattice, synergistically strengthening the adsorption of OOH* intermediates and enhancing the intrinsic OER activity. In addition, the preferential oxidation of Ru and the electronegativity of the oxygen vacancies significantly stabilize the Ir&#9472;O active sites, improving the OER stability. Consequently, the H3.8Ir1&#9472;xRuxO4 catalyst shows an overpotential of 255&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and displays exceptional catalytic endurance in acidic electrolytes, surpassing 1100 h, representing a remarkable one&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude increase in stability compared to that of pristine H3.8IrO4. A proton exchange membrane electrolyser utilizing the H3.8Ir1&#8722;xRuxO4 catalyst as an anode exhibits stable performance for more than 1280 h under a high current density of 2 A cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Modulating the Electronic Structure of Cobalt&#8208;Vanadium Bimetal Catalysts for High&#8208;Stable Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic structures of Co&#8208;V bimetallic electrocatalyst are precisely modulated by nitrogen and phosphate anions to enhance hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively, significantly promoting the performance of anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer.








Abstract
Modulating the electronic structure of catalysts to effectively couple the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for developing high&#8208;efficiency anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE). Herein, a coral&#8208;like nanoarray composed of nanosheets through the synergistic layering effect of cobalt and the 1D guiding of vanadium is synthesized, which promotes extensive contact between the active sites and electrolyte. The HER and OER activities can be enhanced by modulating the electronic structure through nitridation and phosphorization, respectively, enhancing the strength of metal&#8208;H bond to optimize hydrogen adsorption and facilitating the proton transfer to improve the transformation of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. Resultantly, the AEMWE achieves a current density of 500 mA cm&#8211;2 at 1.76 V for 1000 h in 1.0 M KOH at 70&#160;&#176;C. The energy consumption is 4.21 kWh Nm&#8211;3 with the producing hydrogen cost of $0.93 per kg H2. Operando synchrotron radiation and Bode phase angle analyses reveal that during the high&#8208;energy consumed OER, the dissolution of vanadium species transforms distorted Co&#8722;O octahedral into regular octahedral structures, accompanied by a shortening of the Co&#8722;Co bond length. This structural evolution facilitates the formation of oxygen intermediates, thus accelerating the reaction kinetics.

         <title>Efficient Permeable Monolithic Hybrid Tribo&#8208;Piezo&#8208;Electromagnetic Nanogenerator Based on Topological&#8208;Insulator&#8208;Composite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first highly efficient permeable and stretchable monolithic hybrid tribo&#8208;piezo&#8208;electromagnetic nanogenerator&#8208;based electronic skin is developed, by adopting a fairly facile and scalable design of two&#8208;layer porous topological insulator&#8208;piezoelectric polymer composite nanofibers sandwiching liquid metal networks. It works not only as an efficient epidermal power source but also as a multifunctional self&#8208;powered sensor.








Abstract
Escalating energy demands of self&#8208;independent on&#8208;skin/wearable electronics impose challenges on corresponding power sources to offer greater power density, permeability, and stretchability. Here, a high&#8208;efficient breathable and stretchable monolithic hybrid triboelectric&#8208;piezoelectric&#8208;electromagnetic nanogenerator&#8208;based electronic skin (TPEG&#8208;skin) is reported via sandwiching a liquid metal mesh with two&#8208;layer topological insulator&#8208;piezoelectric polymer composite nanofibers. TPEG&#8208;skin concurrently extracts biomechanical energy (from body motions) and electromagnetic radiations (from adjacent appliances), operating as epidermal power sources and whole&#8208;body self&#8208;powered sensors. Topological insulators with conductive surface states supply notably enhanced triboelectric and piezoelectric effects, endowing TPEG&#8208;skin with a 288&#160;V output voltage (10 N, 4&#160;Hz), &#8764;3 times that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices. Liquid metal meshes serve as breathable electrodes and extract ambient electromagnetic pollution (&#177;60&#160;V, &#177;1.6&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2). TPEG&#8208;skin implements self&#8208;powered physiological and body motion monitoring and system&#8208;level human&#8208;machine interactions. This study provides compatible energy strategies for on&#8208;skin/wearable electronics with high power density, monolithic device integration, and multifunctionality.

&lt;p&gt;Escalating energy demands of self-independent on-skin/wearable electronics impose challenges on corresponding power sources to offer greater power density, permeability, and stretchability. Here, a high-efficient breathable and stretchable monolithic hybrid triboelectric-piezoelectric-electromagnetic nanogenerator-based electronic skin (TPEG-skin) is reported via sandwiching a liquid metal mesh with two-layer topological insulator-piezoelectric polymer composite nanofibers. TPEG-skin concurrently extracts biomechanical energy (from body motions) and electromagnetic radiations (from adjacent appliances), operating as epidermal power sources and whole-body self-powered sensors.

Hybrid Biointerface Engineering
In article number 2401495, Wei Tao, Sicen Wang, Xiaoyu Xie, and co&#8208;workers present a novel biointerface&#8208;engineered hybrid nanovesicle (P&#8208;I@M1E/AAL), achieved by integrating M1&#8208;like macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes with AS1411 aptamer&#8208;conjugated liposomes. The designed P&#8208;I@M1E/AAL nanoplatform combines multiple treatment modalities, offering a promising therapeutic approach to overcome the challenges of the hypoxic and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. By reprogramming tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and enhancing tumor&#8208;targeted photodynamic&#8208;immunotherapy, this platform shows significant potential for improving anti&#8208;tumor treatment outcomes.

Ultrastrong Soft Pneumatic Actuation
In article number 2403954, Yang Qu, Wei Tang, Jun Zou, and co&#8208;workers have developed an ultra&#8208;strong pneumatic source enabled by programmable chemical reactions. By integrating thermoelectric materials and &#8220;pre&#8208;programming strategy&#8221; into the management of reversible reactions, a soft pneumatic actuation is realized with high regulation, high pressure, and the ability to transport gas over long distances. The soft pneumatic actuation is successfully applied to soft assistive wearables, haptic devices, and sightseeing car lifting.

Proximal High&#8208;Index Metamaterials from Gold Nanohexagons
Plasmonic nanoparticles, when arranged into periodic structures known as superlattices, can form metamaterials capable of manipulating light&#8208;matter interactions. In article number 2405650, Gi&#8208;Ra Yi and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the large&#8208;scale fabrication of a planar plasmonic superlattice composed of edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge assembled gold nanohexagons with precisely controlled gap proximities. The resulting metamaterial exhibits unprecedentedly high refractive index values in the near&#8208;infrared spectrum, surpassing the refractive index limits of naturally occurring materials.

siRNA co&#8208;Delivery
With a novel identified target of cancer&#8208;associated fibroblast&#8208;derived microfibrillar&#8208;associated protein 5 (MFAP&#8208;5), ABC&#8208;triblock copolymer based multicompartment polyion complex micelle (PICM) deliver siRNA against MFAP&#8208;5 and the cationic amphiphilic drug desloratadine simultaneously. The codelivery of desloratadine facilitates intracellular siRNA delivery, resulting in knockdown of MFAP&#8208;5 and significantly reduce tumor burden in a mice model of hepatocellular carcinoma. More details can be found in article number 2404784 by Heyang Zhang, Leonard Kaps, Matthias Barz, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Innovative Formulation Platform: Paving the Way for Superior Protein Therapeutics with Enhanced Efficacy and Broadened Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein therapeutics hold great promise for treating various diseases, yet their delivery remains challenging. This review introduces &#8220;Pcapsulation,&#8221; a protein formulation technology. Specifically, this review details the material design and summarizes the applications of formulated proteins across metabolic disorders, cancer, infectious diseases, and nervous system diseases. Perspectives on the future directions of protein delivery are also discussed.








Abstract
Protein therapeutics offer high therapeutic potency and specificity; the broader adoptions and development of protein therapeutics, however, have been constricted by their intrinsic limitations such as inadequate stability, immunogenicity, suboptimal pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, and off&#8208;target effects. This review describes a platform technology that formulates individual protein molecules with a thin formulation layer of crosslinked polymers, which confers the protein therapeutics with high activity, enhanced stability, controlled release capability, reduced immunogenicity, improved pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, and ability to cross the blood brain barriers. Based on currently approved protein therapeutics, this formulating platform affords the development of a vast family of superior protein therapeutics with improved efficacy and broadened indications at significantly reduced cost.

         <title>In&#8208;Depth Understanding of Interfacial Na+ Behaviors in Sodium Metal Anode: Migration, Desolvation, and Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically discusses the interfacial Na+ migration, desolvation, and deposition behaviors of sodium&#8208;metal anode in terms of fundamental understanding, influencing factors and optimization strategies, anode&#8208;free sodium&#8208;metal batteries, advanced characterization techniques, etc.








Abstract
Interfacial Na+ behaviors of sodium (Na) anode severely threaten the stability of sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs). This review systematically and in&#8208;depth discusses the current fundamental understanding of interfacial Na+ behaviors in SMBs including Na+ migration, desolvation, diffusion, nucleation, and deposition. The key influencing factors and optimization strategies of these behaviors are further summarized and discussed. More importantly, the high&#8208;energy&#8208;density anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) are highlighted by addressing key issues in the areas of limited Na sources and irreversible Na loss. Simultaneously, recent advanced characterization techniques for deeper insights into interfacial Na+ deposition behavior and composition information of SEI film are spotlighted to provide guidance for the advancement of SMBs and AFSMBs. Finally, the prominent perspectives are presented to guide and promote the development of SMBs and AFSMBs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interfacial Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; behaviors of sodium (Na) anode severely threaten the stability of sodium-metal batteries (SMBs). This review systematically and in-depth discusses the current fundamental understanding of interfacial Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; behaviors in SMBs including Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration, desolvation, diffusion, nucleation, and deposition. The key influencing factors and optimization strategies of these behaviors are further summarized and discussed. More importantly, the high-energy-density anode-free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) are highlighted by addressing key issues in the areas of limited Na sources and irreversible Na loss. Simultaneously, recent advanced characterization techniques for deeper insights into interfacial Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; deposition behavior and composition information of SEI film are spotlighted to provide guidance for the advancement of SMBs and AFSMBs. Finally, the prominent perspectives are presented to guide and promote the development of SMBs and AFSMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances in Antimony Selenide Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review reports recent advances in Sb2Se3 photodetectors (PDs), focusing on fundamental characteristics, nanostructure tuning, applications in heart rate monitoring, and monolithic integrated matrix imaging. The challenges, including the broadening of the detection range, the reduction of dark current, and the potential applications of flexible devices are highlighted, which provide a valuable reference for Sb2Se3 PDs and expand application areas.








Abstract
Photodetectors (PDs) rapidly capture optical signals and convert them into electrical signals, making them indispensable in a variety of applications including imaging, optical communication, remote sensing, and biological detection. Recently, antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) has achieved remarkable progress due to its earth&#8208;abundant, low toxicity, low price, suitable bandgap width, high absorption coefficient, and unique structural characteristics. Sb2Se3 has been extensively studied in solar cells, but there's a lack of timely updates in the field of PDs. A literature review based on Sb2Se3 PDs is urgently warranted. This review aims to provide a concise understanding of the latest progress in Sb2Se3 PDs, with a focus on the basic characteristics and the performance optimization for Sb2Se3 photoconductive&#8208;type and photodiode&#8208;type detectors, including nanostructure regulation, process optimization, and stability improvement of flexible devices. Furthermore, the application progresses of Sb2Se3 PDs in heart rate monitoring, and monolithic&#8208;integrated matrix images are introduced. Finally, this review presents various strategies with potential and feasibility to address challenges for the rapid development and commercial application of Sb2Se3 PDs.

         <title>Asymmetric Microenvironment Tailoring Strategies of Atomically Dispersed Dual&#8208;Site Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction and CO2 Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work first presents the frequently&#8208;used experimental synthesis and characterization methods of dual&#8208;atom catalysts. Then, four synergistic catalytic mechanisms, including cascade, assistance, co&#8208;adsorption and bifunction mechanisms, are summarized. The emphasis is placed on four asymmetric microenvironment modulating strategies, including active site asymmetric strategy, transverse/axial&#8208;modification engineering, distance engineering and strain engineering, and their effects on oxygen/carbon dioxide reduction reaction.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) with atomically dispersed dual&#8208;sites, as an extension of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), have recently become a new hot topic in heterogeneous catalysis due to their maximized atom efficiency and dual&#8208;site diverse synergy, because the synergistic diversity of dual&#8208;sites achieved by asymmetric microenvironment tailoring can efficiently boost the catalytic activity by optimizing the electronic structure of DACs. Here, this work first summarizes the frequently&#8208;used experimental synthesis and characterization methods of DACs. Then, four synergistic catalytic mechanisms (cascade mechanism, assistance mechanism, co&#8208;adsorption mechanism and bifunction mechanism) and four key modulating methods (active site asymmetric strategy, transverse/axial&#8208;modification engineering, distance engineering and strain engineering) are elaborated comprehensively. The emphasis is placed on the effects of asymmetric microenvironment of DACs on oxygen/carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Finally, some perspectives and outlooks are also addressed. In short, the review summarizes a useful asymmetric microenvironment tailoring strategy to speed up synthesis of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for different reactions.

         <title>The Reinforced Separation of Intractable Gas Mixtures by Using Porous Adsorbents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given the broad range of intractable gas mixtures, it is urgently necessitated to summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art porous adsorbents used in this field. Herein, the review systematically summarizes the recent advancements in inorganic small molecules and light hydrocarbon separation, categorizes their separation modes, highlights the functionalization strategies of materials, and finally provides new insights into the structure&#8208;activity relationships and future challenges.








Abstract
This review focuses on the mechanism and driving force in the intractable gas separation using porous adsorbents. A variety of intractable mixtures have been discussed, including air separation, carbon capture, and hydrocarbon purification. Moreover, the separation systems are categorized according to distinctly biased modes depending on the minor differences in the kinetic diameter, dipole/quadruple moment, and polarizability of the adsorbates, or sorted by the varied separation occasions (e.g., CO2 capture from flue gas or air) and driving forces (thermodynamic and kinetic separation, molecular sieving). Each section highlights the functionalization strategies for porous materials, like synthesis condition optimization and organic group modifications for porous carbon materials, cation exchange and heteroatom doping for zeolites, and metal node&#8208;organic ligand adjustments for MOFs. These functionalization strategies are subsequently associated with enhanced adsorption performances (capacity, selectivity, structural/thermal stability, moisture resistance, etc.) toward the analog gas mixtures. Finally, this review also discusses future challenges and prospects for using porous materials in intractable gas separation. Therein, the combination of theoretical calculation with the synthesis condition and adsorption parameters optimization of porous adsorbents may have great potential, given its fast targeting of candidate adsorbents and deeper insights into the adsorption forces in the confined pores and cages.

The first bacteria&#8208;based hybrid light&#8208;emitting diodes are prepared with a new protocol to form spheroplast with &gt; 90% scattering reduction, high FP expression yield fairly keeping the photoluminescence features, and high resilience in polymer matrices (1 year under ambient storage) and similar photostabilities compared to their respective films and devices prepared with the purified FPs.








Abstract
Photon down&#8208;converting filters with fluorescent proteins (FPs) are a new frontier in the quest for rare&#8208;earth&#8208;free and non&#8208;toxic color filters for white light&#8208;emitting diodes. There are, however, concerns related to the FP purification costs and lack of FP recyclability/reuse. Here, the direct use of bacteria in photon down&#8208;converting filters can be of utmost relevance, eliminating purification and allowing in situ production of new FPs. However, their high background autofluorescence/scattering and low stability in polymer coatings have traditionally hampered the application of Engineering Living Materials (ELMs) for photon manipulation. Indeed, there are no examples of ELMs in lighting systems. This work discloses the first protocol to prepare living spheroplasts with &gt; 90% scattering reduction, high FP expression fairly keeping their photoluminescence figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit, and excellent resilience in polymer films over 1 year under ambient storage. This unlocked the preparation of the first bacteria hybrid light&#8208;emitting diodes integrating ELMs for photon conversion. These devices feature similar stabilities to those using purified FPs, while enabling a cost&#8208;effective strategy and active FP recycling by the simple recultivation of spheroplasts. Overall, this work introduces a successful case toward bacteria&#8208;polymer photon manipulation, in general, and a new living lighting concept, in particular.

         <title>Designing Contact Independent High&#8208;Performance Low&#8208;Cost Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;scale simulations identify device design parameters to circumvent charge injection limitations in organic field&#8208;effect transistors, enabling high charge carrier mobility (&gt;5&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1s&#8722;1) in all&#8208;organic, solution&#8208;processed devices with printed contacts.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors enable low&#8208;cost solution processing of optoelectronic devices on flexible substrates. Their use in contemporary applications, however, is sparse due to persistent challenges in achieving the requisite performance levels in a reliable and reproducible manner. A critical bottleneck is the inefficiency associated with charge injection. Here, large&#8208;scale simulations are employed to identify operational windows where key device parameters that are difficult to control experimentally, such as the contact resistance, become less consequential to overall device functionality. This design methodology overcomes injection barrier limitations in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), leading to high charge carrier mobility and significantly expanding the range of suitable electrode materials. Leveraging this new understanding, all&#8208;organic, solution&#8208;deposited OFETs are successfully fabricated on flexible substrates. These devices incorporate printed contacts and showcase mobilities exceeding 5&#160;cm2&#160;Vs&#8722;1. These results provide a route for accessing the fundamental limits of material properties even in the absence of ideal contacts &#8211; a critical step in establishing reliable structure/property relationships and optimal material design paradigms. While reducing the injection barrier and contact resistance remains critical for achieving high OFET performance, this work demonstrates a path toward consistently achieving high charge carrier mobility through device geometry design, ultimately reducing processing complexity and cost.

         <title>Excellent Low&#8208;Frequency Microwave Absorption and High Thermal Conductivity in Polydimethylsiloxane Composites Endowed by Hydrangea&#8208;Like CoNi@BN Heterostructure Fillers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D chain&#8208;like CoNi is encapsulated by the 2D flake BN to form hydrangea&#8208;like CoNi@BN heterostructure fillers by the spray&#8208;drying&#8208;sintering process. Hydrangea&#8208;like CoNi@BN morphology utilizes full advantage for natural resonance of CoNi and high thermal conductivity of BN, and integrating low&#8208;frequency microwave absorption &amp; thermal conductive in CoNi@BN/PDMS composites.








Abstract
The advancement of thin, lightweight, and high&#8208;power electronic devices has increasingly exacerbated issues related to electromagnetic interference and heat accumulation. To address these challenges, a spray&#8208;drying&#8208;sintering process is employed to assemble chain&#8208;like CoNi and flake boron nitride (BN) into hydrangea&#8208;like CoNi@BN heterostructure fillers. These fillers are then composited with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to develop CoNi@BN/PDMS composites, which integrate low&#8208;frequency microwave absorption and thermal conductivity. When the volume fraction of CoNi@BN is 44 vol% and the mass ratio of CoNi to BN is 3:1, the CoNi@BN/PDMS composites exhibit optimal performance in both low&#8208;frequency microwave absorption and thermal conductivity. These composites achieve a minimum reflection loss of &#8722;49.9&#160;dB and a low&#8208;frequency effective absorption bandwidth of 2.40&#160;GHz (3.92&#8211;6.32&#160;GHz) at a thickness of 4.4&#160;mm, fully covering the n79 band (4.4&#8211;5.0&#160;GHz) for 5G communications. Meanwhile, the in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity (&#955;&#8741;) of the CoNi@BN/PDMS composites is 7.31&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, which is &#8776;11.4 times of the &#955;&#8741; (0.64&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) for pure PDMS, and 32% higher than that of the (CoNi/BN)/PDMS composites (5.52&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) with the same volume fraction of CoNi and BN obtained through direct mixing.

         <title>Multiscale Defective Interfaces for Realizing Na&#8208;CO2 Batteries With Ultralong Lifespan</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a multiscale defective interface concept via designing a &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; electrode to simultaneously enhance sodiophilicity and CO2RR/CO2ER properties, facilitating the development of durable Na&#8208;CO2 batteries. The CP@FeCu electrode functions as a CO2 cathode with exceptional cycling stability exceeding 2400 cycles. Additionally, it optimizes sodium deposition behavior as a sodium stripping/plating host, achieving a dendrite&#8208;resistant and long&#8208;lasting anode.








Abstract
Despite their favorable high energy density and potential for CO2 recycling, Na&#8208;CO2 batteries have been held back by limitations in cycling capability, stemming from the sluggish CO2 reduction/evolution reaction (CO2RR/CO2ER) kinetics at CO2 cathode and unmanageable deposition/stripping of metallic Na at the anode upon cycling. Herein, a &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; electrode with multiscale defective FeCu interfaces (CP@FeCu) is presented, which is capable of improving the CO2RR/CO2ER kinetics of CO2&#8208;breathing cathode, while modulating sodium deposition behavior. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal multiscale defective FeCu interfaces are responsible for the enhancement of sodiophilicity and catalytic properties. The defect and valence oscillation effects originate in multiscale defective FeCu interfaces, effectively facilitating the adsorption of reactants and decomposition of Na2CO3 during CO2RR/CO2ER processes, along with exceptional cycling stability of 2400 cycles (4800&#160;h) at 5&#160;&#181;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. Meanwhile, the CP@FeCu with sodium affinity creates a uniform electric field and robust adsorption for Na, making initial nucleation sites more conducive to Na deposition and achieving dendrite&#8208;resistant and durable anodes. This work offers a scientific insight into the functionalization design of &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; electrodes, which is essential for a unified solution to the challenges in sodium anodes and CO2 cathodes.

         <title>An Oriented Diffusion Strategy to Configure All&#8208;Region Ultrahigh&#8208;Density Metal Single Atoms for High&#8208;Capacity Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal and scalable oriented diffusion strategy is developed to synthesize ultrahigh loadings of 18.9&#160;wt.% Sn single&#8208;atom metalsover carbon nanorings, leveraging the nanoengineering design of a g&#8208;C3N4/SnO2/polydopamine nested structure. When used as the anode for sodium ion batteries, remarkably enhanced capacity (462&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) and durability (over 5000 cycles) are achieved.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom metals (SAMs), despite being promising for high&#8208;utilization catalysis, biomedicine, and energy storage, usually suffer from limited catalytic performance caused by low metal loading.

&lt;p&gt;A universal and scalable oriented diffusion strategy is developed to synthesize ultrahigh loadings of 18.9&#160;wt.% Sn single-atom metalsover carbon nanorings, leveraging the nanoengineering design of a g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/polydopamine nested structure. When used as the anode for sodium ion batteries, remarkably enhanced capacity (462&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and durability (over 5000 cycles) are achieved.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-atom metals (SAMs), despite being promising for high-utilization catalysis, biomedicine, and energy storage, usually suffer from limited catalytic performance caused by low metal loading. Herein, via an oriented diffusion strategy, all-region ultrahigh-loading (18.9&#160;wt.%) Sn-SAMs over carbon nanorings matrix (Sn-SAMs@CNR) are initially achieved based on the transformation of a g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@polydopamine ring-like nested structure. The formation process of Sn-SAMs involves a critical conversion from oxygen-coordination (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to nitrogen-coordination (Sn-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and simultaneous anti-Osterwalder ripening promoted under spatial confinement. Notably, the g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-derived N-containing gaseous intermediates dynamically drive the oriented diffusion (inside-out diffusion) of Sn-SAMs across the carbon nanorings, realizing an all-region ultrahigh loading of SAMs throughout the carbon matrix. This strategy is also applied to other metal materials (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Sb), and features excellent universality. When applied as the anode for sodium-ion batteries, experimental analyses and theoretical calculations demonstrate that high-loading Sn-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; active sites significantly optimize electron density distribution and improve reaction kinetics. Consequently, Sn-SAMs@CNR exhibits outstanding durability of 364&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; &#160; even after 5000 cycles with an impressively low (0.00068%) capacity decay per cycle.

         <title>Rhombohedral R3 Phase of Mn&#8208;Doped Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 Epitaxial Films with Robust Ferroelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A distinct rhombohedral R3 ferroelectric phase is successfully synthesized in Mn&#8208;doped Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 epitaxial thin films, with exceptional remnant polarization, retention, and endurance. This advancement enables the controlled phase transition among R3m, R3, and Pca21 polar phases by simply adjusting the Mn dopant concentration and film thickness. The research broadens the understanding of HfO2&#8208;based ferroelectric materials and potentially promotes the advancement of integrated ferroelectric devices.








Abstract
HfO2&#8208;based ferroelectric materials are emerging as key components for next&#8208;generation nanoscale devices, owing to their exceptional nanoscale properties and compatibility with established silicon&#8208;based electronics infrastructure. Despite the considerable attention garnered by the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase, the polar rhombohedral phase has remained relatively unexplored due to the inherent challenges in its stabilization. In this study, the successful synthesis of a distinct ferroelectric rhombohedral phase is reported, i.e., the R3 phase, in Mn&#8208;doped Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZM) epitaxial thin films, which stands different from the conventional Pca21 and R3m polar phases. These findings reveal that this R3 phase HZM film exhibits a remnant polarization of up to 47 &#181;C cm&#8722;2 at room temperature, along with an exceptional retention capability projected to exceed a decade and an endurance surpassing 109 cycles. Moreover, it is demonstrated that by modulating the concentration of Mn dopant and the film's thickness, it is possible to selectively control the phase transition between the R3, R3m, and Pca21 polar phases. This research not only sheds new light on the ferroelectricity of the HfO2 system but also paves the way for innovative strategies to manipulate ferroelectric properties for enhanced device performance.

         <title>A Novel Upside&#8208;Down Thermal Annealing Method Toward High&#8208;Quality Active Layers Enables Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency Approaching 20%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel annealing method is proposed for preparing high&#8208;quality bulk heterojunction films by flipping the active layer, which can slow down the volatilization of casting solvent and refine the evolution of phase separation and crystalline orientation, thereby achieving small non&#8208;radiative recombination losses in several highly efficient organic solar cells.








Abstract
The emerging non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with low voltage losses have pushed the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs) to &#8776;20% with auxiliary morphology optimization. Thermal annealing (TA), as the most widely adopted post&#8208;treatment method, has been playing an essential role in realizing the potential of various material systems. However, the procedure of TA, i.e., the way that TA is performed, is almost identical among thousands of OSC papers since &#8776;30 years ago other than changes in temperature and annealing time. Herein, a reverse thermal annealing (RTA) technique is developed, which can enhance the dielectric constant of active layer film, thereby producing a smaller Coulomb capture radius (14.93 nm), meanwhile, forming a moderate nano&#8208;scale phase aggregation and a more favorable face&#8208;on molecular stacking orientation. Thus, this method can reduce the decline in open circuit voltage of the conventional TA method by achieving decreased radiative (0.334 eV) and non&#8208;radiative (0.215 eV) recombination loss. The power conversion efficiency of the RTA PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;X device increases to 19.91% (certified 19.42%) compared to the TA device (18.98%). It is shown that this method exhibits a superb universality in 4 other material systems, revealing its dramatic potential to be employed in a wide range of OSCs.

The electronic confinement&#8208;restrained strategy is innovatively utilized to achieve the regulation of anti&#8208;site defects and to eliminate voltage hysteresis. Accordingly, the sodium&#8208;rich Na3.5MnTi0.5V0.5(PO4)3 cathode breached &#8776;3.2&#8208;electron transfer in common voltage range, enabling the energy efficiency to reach a peak value of 89.5% at 0.5&#160;C and an improvement of 35.5% over the prototype at 30&#160;C.








Abstract
Sodium (Na) super&#8208;ionic conductor structured Na3MnTi(PO4)3 (NMTP) cathodes have garnered interest owing to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and high operating voltages. However, the voltage hysteresis phenomenon triggered by MnNa&#183;${\mathrm{Mn}}_{{\mathrm{Na}}}^{\mathrm{\cdot}}$ anti&#8208;site defects (MnNa&#183;${\mathrm{Mn}}_{{\mathrm{Na}}}^{\mathrm{\cdot}}$&#8208;ASD), namely, the occupation of Mn2+ in the Na2 vacancies in NMTP, leads to sluggish diffusion kinetics and low energy efficiency. This study employs an innovative electronic confinement&#8208;restrained strategy to achieve the regulation of MnNa&#183;${\mathrm{Mn}}_{{\mathrm{Na}}}^{\mathrm{\cdot}}$&#8208;ASD. Partial replacement of titanium (Ti) with electron&#8208;rich vanadium (V) favors strong electronic interactions with Mn2+, restraining Mn2+ migration. The results suggest that this strategy can significantly increase the vacancy formation energy and migration energy barrier of manganese (Mn), thus inhibiting MnNa&#183;${\mathrm{Mn}}_{{\mathrm{Na}}}^{\mathrm{\cdot}}$&#8208;ASD formation. As proof of this concept, an Na&#8208;rich Na3.5MnTi0.5V0.5(PO4)3 (NMTVP) material is designed, wherein the electronic interaction enhanced the redox activity and achieved more Na+ storage under high&#8208;voltage. The NMTVP cathode delivered a reversible specific capacity of up to 182.7 mAh g&#8722;1 and output an excellent specific energy of 513.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, corresponding to &#8776;3.2 electron transfer processes, wherein the energy efficiency increased by 35.5% at 30&#160;C. Through the confinement effect of electron interactions, this strategy provides novel perspectives for the exploitation and breakthrough of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials in Na&#8208;ion batteries.

         <dc:description>
Modulating electrochemical properties via straightforward approaches to achieve expedited fabrication of high&#8208;performance artificial muscles remains challenging. This work significantly enhances the ion transport efficiency while endowing multi&#8208;responsive capability by introducing laser&#8208;induced nano&#8208;heterostructures on 3D graphene frameworks. With the exceptional actuation performance, biomedical&#8208;oriented soft robotics under electrical and magnetic stimuli is realized.








Abstract
Efficient ion transport and enriched responsive modals via modulating electrochemical properties of conductivity and capacitance are essential for soft electro&#8208;ionic actuators. However, cost&#8208;effective and straightforward approaches to achieve expedited fabrication of active electrode materials capable of multimodal&#8208;responsiveness remain limited. Herein, this work reports the one&#8208;step ultrafast laser direct patterning method, to readily synthesize electro&#8208; and magneto&#8208;active electrode material, derived from the unique cobalt&#8208;phosphorus co&#8208;doped core&#8211;shell heterostructures within 3D graphene frameworks, for fulfilling the dual&#8208;mode responsive electro&#8208;ionic actuators. The designed nanofiber&#8208;structured heterointerfaces across electrodes and electrolytes further promote highly efficient electron/ion transfer. The developed soft actuator exhibits superior actuation performance of peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak displacement to 13.08&#160;mm under an ultra&#8208;low &#177;0.5&#160;V, with doubled direct current deflection under 200 mT at 1&#160;V, an ultrafast response of 1.38 s and long&#8208;term stability (&gt;90% retention for &#8776;106&#160;000 cycles), even detectable bending to &#8776;280&#160;&#181;m under exceptional &#177;10&#160;mV. The promising demonstration of promoting differentiation and proliferation of stem cells under mechanical strain and electrical stimuli, sheds more light as well on the possibility of facilitating biomedical soft robotics with ultrahigh actuation performance.

         <title>Reducing Dielectric Loss of High&#8208;Dielectric&#8208;Constant Elastomer via Rigid Short&#8208;Chain Crosslinking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For wearable electronics, reducing the dielectric loss of elastomers is more important than merely achieving a high dielectric constant. Herein, a simple but effective strategy to reduce the dielectric loss of high&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant elastomers is proposed. A ferroelectric elastomer with a high dielectric constant (35 at 1 kHz and 25&#160;&#176;C) and a low dielectric loss (0.09) has been achieved, surpassing all previously reported intrinsic elastomers.








Abstract
High&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant elastomers have broad applications in wearable electronics, which can be achieved by the elastification of relaxor ferroelectric polymers. However, the introduction of soft long chains, with their high mobility under strong electric fields, leads to high dielectric loss. Given the relatively low modulus of relaxor ferroelectric polymers, elastification can be realized by introducing short&#8208;chain crosslinkers. In this work, a molecular engineering design is employed, utilizing a rigid short&#8208;chain crosslinker to create crosslinks with relaxor ferroelectric polymer, resulting in intrinsic elastomers characterized by a high dielectric constant but low dielectric loss. The obtained intrinsic ferroelectric elastomer possesses a high dielectric constant (35 at 1&#160;kHz and 25&#160;&#176;C) and a low dielectric loss (0.09). Furthermore, this elastomer exhibits stable ferroelectric response and relaxor characteristics even under strains up to 80%. The study supplies a simple but effective method to reduce the dielectric loss of high&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant intrinsic elastomers, thereby expanding their application fields in wearable electronics.

         <title>Transformable Gel&#8208;to&#8208;Nanovaccine Enhances Cancer Immunotherapy via Metronomic&#8208;Like Immunomodulation and Collagen&#8208;Mediated Paracortex Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioadhesive immune niche domain (BIND) is developed that delivers timely&#8208;activating conjugated nanovaccine (t&#8208;CNV) in a metronomic&#8208;like manner, enhancing its accumulation and retention in lymph nodes. By binding to collagen in the subcapsular sinus, t&#8208;CNV gradually transforms into an antigen&#8211;adjuvant conjugate, penetrates the paracortex through conduit, and triggers durable antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T&#8208;cell responses.








Abstract
The generation of non&#8208;exhausted effector T&#8208;cells depends on vaccine's spatiotemporal profile, and untimely delivery and low targeting to lymph node (LN) paracortex by standard bolus immunization show limited efficacy. By recapitulating the dynamic processes of acute infection, a bioadhesive immune niche domain (BIND) is developed that facilitates the delivery of timely&#8208;activating conjugated nanovaccine (t&#8208;CNV) in a metronomic&#8208;like manner and increased the accumulation and retention of TANNylated t&#8208;CNV (tannic acid coated t&#8208;CNV) in LN by specifically binding to collagen in subcapsular sinus where they gradually transformed into TANNylated antigen&#8211;adjuvant conjugate by proteolysis, inducing their penetration into paracortex through the collagen&#8208;binding in LN conduit and evoking durable antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T&#8208;cell responses. The BIND combined with t&#8208;CNV, mRNA vaccine, IL&#8208;2, and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody also significantly enhanced cancer immunotherapy by the dynamic modulation of immunological landscape of tumor microenvironment. The results provide material design strategy for dynamic immunomodulation that can potentiate non&#8208;exhausted T&#8208;cell&#8208;based immunotherapy.

         <title>Breaking the Lithiation Barrier via Tailored&#8208;Design Facile Kinetic Pathways in TiO2(B) Realizing 50C Ultrafast Charging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The consistent lithiation path and morphology anisotropy of rice&#8208;granular TiO2(B) is important to minimize the challenging lithiation on the C&#8217; site, thus leads to enhanced Li+ diffusion efficiency and homogeneous Li+ distribution, including a high specific capacity of 159.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50C and a remarkable capacity retention ratio of 93.67% after 5000 cycles at 10C.








Abstract
As a promising anode material for fast charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries, bronze&#8208;phase titanium dioxide (TiO2(B)) still faces the challenge of sluggish Li+ diffusion kinetics in the solid phase during lithiation/delithiation processes. Herein, a facile synthetic strategy has been proposed to optimize the microstructure of TiO2(B), which enables facilitated lithiation and therefore significantly improved rate performance. The rice&#8208;granular nanoparticles with precisely controlled aspect ratios (AR) can be obtained via manipulating the ligand concentrations that affect nucleation and oriented attachment processes, as well as adjusting the calcination temperatures to control the Oswald ripening process. As a result, the smaller ab plane in rice&#8208;granular TiO2(B) enhances Li+ diffusion efficiency on C&#8217; site and inhibits the inhomogeneity of Li+ between inter and inside particles. Benefiting from breaking the Li+ diffusion kinetics, the rice&#8208;granular TiO2(B) maintains a high specific capacity of 159.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50C, with an excellent capacity retention ratio of 93.67% after 5000 cycles at 10C. This work provides an efficient and simple strategy to minimize the challenging lithiation paths in TiO2(B) anode, and offers new opportunities for high rate battery design.

         <title>Seed&#8208;Mediated Growth and Advanced Characterization of Chiral Gold Nanorods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in bottom&#8208;up wet&#8208;chemical synthesis of gold nanoparticles has created remarkable opportunities to produce nanoparticles with well&#8208;defined chiral shapes and strong chiroptical activities. This perspective focuses on the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis of chiral gold nanorods as a convenient case of chiral morphogenesis. Growth mechanisms, chirality measures, and advanced electron microscopy characterization techniques are discussed, aiming to connect chiral morphologies, growth conditions, and optical behavior.








Abstract
The controlled growth of gold nanostructures with complex shapes and reduced symmetry, exemplified by chiral gold nanorods and nanoparticles, is one of the most dynamic fields of nanochemistry. A timely summary of underlying concepts, including growth mechanisms and redefined chirality measures, would further promote this research area. In this perspective, we aim to establish qualitative connections between the chiral shapes and growth conditions, specifically for the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis of chiral gold nanorods as a convenient case of chiral morphogenesis. The crystallographic and morphological features of achiral nanorods used as seeds, the experimental conditions during chiral growth, and the symmetry of the chiral inducers, can all be exploited to obtain nanorods with intricate chiral shapes. Chirality characterization (such as electron tomography techniques) and quantification (including chirality measures) emerge as critical aspects to comprehensively explore and understand such structures, enabling optimization of their geometric and optical features. We conclude by discussing relevant challenges to be addressed toward a better controlled synthesis of chiral plasmonic nanostructures.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controlled growth of gold nanostructures with complex shapes and reduced symmetry, exemplified by chiral gold nanorods and nanoparticles, is one of the most dynamic fields of nanochemistry. A timely summary of underlying concepts, including growth mechanisms and redefined chirality measures, would further promote this research area. In this perspective, we aim to establish qualitative connections between the chiral shapes and growth conditions, specifically for the seed-mediated synthesis of chiral gold nanorods as a convenient case of chiral morphogenesis. The crystallographic and morphological features of achiral nanorods used as seeds, the experimental conditions during chiral growth, and the symmetry of the chiral inducers, can all be exploited to obtain nanorods with intricate chiral shapes. Chirality characterization (such as electron tomography techniques) and quantification (including chirality measures) emerge as critical aspects to comprehensively explore and understand such structures, enabling optimization of their geometric and optical features. We conclude by discussing relevant challenges to be addressed toward a better controlled synthesis of chiral plasmonic nanostructures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Super SEI&#8208;Forming Anion for Enhanced Interfacial Stability in Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A super SEI&#8208;forming anion (SSA) is proposed as an efficient percussor for building self&#8208;restraint interphases between lithium metal electrodes and solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). The sulfonate and polyfluoroalkyl functionalities in SSA contribute to uniform spatial distributions of designer interfacial species, thus greatly improving the surface coverage property and conformal ability of the interphases.








Abstract
The extremely high chemical reactivity of lithium metal (Li&#176;) electrodes and its enormous volume change during repetitive cycles cause continuous interfacial degradations in prevailing organic electrolytes, thus deteriorating the cycling performances of rechargeable lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, departing from traditional wisdom on the design of electrolyte components, a super SEI&#8208;forming anion (SSA), as an efficient percussor for building stable interphases on Li&#176; electrode, is proposed. Comprehensive investigations related to the unique anion chemistry of SSA reveal that the sulfonate and polyfluoroalkyl functionalities synergistically contribute to uniform spatial distributions of designer interfacial species, greatly improving the surface coverage property and conformal ability of the resulting interphases. Consequently, the incorporation of SSA leads to significant improvements in the cyclability of Li&#176; electrode (exceeding 575 mAh cm&#8722;2 before failure) and the corresponding rechargeable Li&#176;||LiFePO4 cells [a five&#8208;time increase in lifespan as compared to the benchmark cell with the popular SEI&#8208;forming anion bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI)]. The present work offers a paradigm shift to tame the notorious interfacial issues via upgraded anion chemistry, which can promote the practical development of rechargeable LMBs and other kinds of metal batteries.

         <title>Synergistic effect of Hypoxic Conditioning and Cell&#8208;Tethering Colloidal Gels enhanced Productivity of MSC Paracrine Factors and Accelerated Vessel Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces cell&#8208;tethering and oxygenating colloidal hydrogels that prevent cell egression and maintain mild hypoxic conditions while providing mechanical stimulation and interconnected microporous networks. These synergistic multiple factors significantly increase the productivity of paracrine factors of mesenchymal stem cells locally and in a long&#8208;term manner, improving blood flow restoration and muscle regeneration in response to hindlimb ischemia.








Abstract
Microporous hydrogels have been widely used for delivering therapeutic cells. However, several critical issues, such as the lack of control over the harsh environment they are subjected to under pathological conditions and rapid egression of cells from the hydrogels, have produced limited therapeutic outcomes. To address these critical challenges, cell&#8208;tethering and hypoxic conditioning colloidal hydrogels containing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are introduced to increase the productivity of paracrine factors locally and in a long&#8208;term manner. Cell&#8208;tethering colloidal hydrogels that are composed of tyramine&#8208;conjugated gelatin prevent cells from egressing through on&#8208;cell oxidative phenolic crosslinks while providing mechanical stimulation and interconnected microporous networks to allow for host&#8208;implant interactions. Oxygenating microparticles&#160;encapsulated in tyramine&#8208;conjugated colloidal microgels continuously generated oxygen for 2 weeks with rapid diffusion, resulting in maintaining a mild hypoxic condition while MSCs consumed oxygen under severe hypoxia. Synergistically, local retention of MSCs within the mild hypoxic&#8208;conditioned and mechanically robust colloidal hydrogels significantly increased the secretion of various angiogenic cytokines and chemokines. The oxygenating colloidal hydrogels induced anti&#8208;inflammatory responses, reduced cellular apoptosis, and promoted numerous large blood vessels in vivo. Finally, mice injected with the MSC&#8208;tethered oxygenating colloidal hydrogels significantly improved blood flow restoration and muscle regeneration in a hindlimb ischemia (HLI) model.

         <title>Novel Photo&#8208;STING Agonists Delivered by Erythrocyte Efferocytosis&#8208;Mimicking Pattern to Repolarize Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages for Boosting Anticancer Immunotherapy</title>

Manganese porphyrins realize cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8208;adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon gene (STING) pathway activation. The high Mn2+ delivery efficiency and reactive oxygen species generation capability enable this function. The well&#8208;designed delivery system further enhances their accuracy and efficacy to facilitate cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has emerged as a highly effective therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8208;adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon gene (STING) pathway activation facilitates tumor&#8208;associated macrophage (TAM) polarization toward M1 phenotype, and Mn2+ are effective agents for this pathway activation. However, the high in vivo degradation rate and toxicity of Mn2+ hamper clinical application of immunotherapy. Here, this work has newly synthesized and screened manganese porphyrins for Mn2+ transport, referred to as photo&#8208;STING agonists (PSAs), and further encapsulate them into core&#8208;shell nanoparticles named Rm@PP&#8208;GA with dual specificity for tumor tissue and TAMs. Not only do PSAs achieve higher Mn2+ delivery efficiency compared to Mn2+, but they also generate reactive oxygen species under light exposure, promoting mitochondrial DNA release for cGAS&#8208;STING pathway activation. In Rm@PP&#8208;GA, globin and red blood cell membranes (Rm) are used for erythrocyte efferocytosis&#8208;mimicking delivery. Rm can effectively prolong the in vivo circulation period while globin enables PSAs to be taken up by TAMs via CD163 receptors. After Rm rupture mediated by perfluorohexane in nanoparticles under ultrasonication, drugs are specifically released for TAM repolarization. Further, dendritic cells mature, as well as T lymphocyte infiltrate, both of which favor tumor eradication. Therefore, cancer immunotherapy is optimized by novel PSAs delivered by erythrocyte efferocytosis&#8208;mimicking delivery pattern.

         <title>Air and Thermally Stable Fluoride Bridged Rare&#8208;Earth Clusters Showing Intense Photoluminescence and Potential LED Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal fluoride is famous for clean phonon structures. Herein fluoride is used to construct a family of rare earth (RE) clusters RE16(&#956;4&#8208;F)6(&#956;3&#8208;F)12(tBuCOO)18[N(CH2CH2O)3]4 (RE = Eu and Tb) with nano&#8208;size, air and thermal stability is synthesized using a facile one&#8208;pot reaction. These clusters display high photoluminescence quantum yield, high color purity, high hydrophobicity,&#160;and high&#160;solubility in common organic solvents, making them ideal phosphor for light emitting diode (LED). 



Abstract
Fluoride based lattice is attractive for reducing phonon&#8208;induced quenching in rare&#8208;earth (RE) based luminescent materials. However, due to the strong affinity between&#160;RE and oxygen, the synthesis of fluoride&#8208;based complexes has to be protected under anhydrous conditions,&#160;and many known fluoride bridged RE clusters are unstable in air. Here, by using the &#8220;mixed&#8208;ligand&#8221; strategy a family of fluoride bridged RE clusters is synthesized, namely RE16(&#956;4&#8208;F)6(&#956;3&#8208;F)12(tBuCOO)18[N(CH2CH2O)3]4 (RE = Eu, EuFC&#8208;16; RE = Tb, TbFC&#8208;16), which are highly stable in air and decomposed thermally only when heating above 435&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, both clusters exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYEuFC&#8208;16 = 87.7%, PLQYTbFC&#8208;16 = 99.0%). Upon warming, EuFC&#8208;16 and TbFC&#8208;16 display&#160;excellent structural, thermal, and chroma stability. Thus, EuFC&#8208;16 and TbFC&#8208;16 have the potential to be used in light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) devices, offering many advantages over commercial phosphors. First, both clusters are soluble in UV&#8208;curable resin at any mixing rate, and the emission colors can be tuned from magenta, turquoise, willow green, and ivory to pure white if mixing blue phosphor BAM:Eu2+. Second, the clusters are hydrophobic, and the LEDs work well after soaking in water, indicating a good quality for outdoor lighting.

Second, the clusters are hydrophobic, and the LEDs work well after soaking in water, indicating a good quality for outdoor lighting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Aquatic Autonomic Nervous System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports an artificial aquatic ANS with switchable excitatory/inhibitory behaviors in electrolyte and real neurotransmitter (acetylcholine)&#8208;mediated plasticity. The advanced ANS functions are then demonstrated by controlling the action of the artificial pupil and muscle. This work may provide guidance for innovative artificial nervous systems in fluids with biological language.








Abstract
Reproducing human nervous systems with endogenous mechanisms has attracted increasing attention, driven by its great potential in streamlining the neuro&#8208;electronic interfaces with bilateral signaling. Here, an artificial aquatic autonomic nervous system (ANS) with switchable excitatory/inhibitory characteristics and acetylcholine (ACh)&#8208;mediated plasticity is reported based on the newly emerged organic photoelectrochemical transistor (OPECT). Under the modulation of spatial light and ACh, the system exhibits an immediate switch between excitation and inhibition, and many pulse patterns as well as advanced ANS functions are mimicked. To demonstrate its potential usage, the artificial ANS is then utilized to control artificial pupils and muscles to emulate real biological responses during an emergency. In contrast to previous solid&#8208;state attempts, this ANS is aqueous compatible just like biological nervous systems, which are capable of real neurotransmitter mediation.

         <title>Scalable Layered Heterogeneous Hydrogel Fibers with Strain&#8208;Induced Crystallization for Tough, Resilient, and Highly Conductive Soft Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered heterogeneous hydrogel fibers (LHHFs) that are tough, resilient, and highly conductive, are manufactured by a microchannel&#8208;integrated wet spinning method. The uniquely combined electromechanical properties stem from the reversible strain&#8208;induced crystallization and the symmetric layered structure with separated electrical and mechanical functional layers. The LHHFs are directly utilized as soft iontronic sensors and epidermal electrodes for wireless full&#8208;body physiological monitoring.








Abstract
The advancement of soft bioelectronics hinges critically on the electromechanical properties of hydrogels. Despite ongoing research into diverse material and structural strategies to enhance these properties, producing hydrogels that are simultaneously tough, resilient, and highly conductive for long&#8208;term, dynamic physiological monitoring remains a formidable challenge. Here, a strategy utilizing scalable layered heterogeneous hydrogel fibers (LHHFs) is introduced that enables synergistic electromechanical modulation of hydrogels. High toughness (1.4&#160;MJ m&#8722;3) and resilience (over 92% recovery from 200% strain) of LHHFs are achieved through a damage&#8208;free toughening mechanism that involves dense long&#8208;chain entanglements and reversible strain&#8208;induced crystallization of sodium polyacrylate. The unique symmetrical layered structure of LHHFs, featuring distinct electrical and mechanical functional layers, facilitates the mixing of multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes to significantly enhance electrical conductivity (192.7 S m&#8722;1) without compromising toughness and resilience. Furthermore, high&#8208;performance LHHF capacitive iontronic strain/pressure sensors and epidermal electrodes are developed, capable of accurately and stably capturing biomechanical and bioelectrical signals from the human body under long&#8208;term, dynamic conditions. The LHHF offers a promising route for developing hydrogels with uniquely integrated electromechanical attributes, advancing practical wearable healthcare applications.

         <title>All&#8208;In&#8208;One Optoelectronic Transistors for Bio&#8208;Inspired Visual System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optoelectronic transistor with comprehensive visual functions is reported. By coupling photoreceptive properties of the IGZO channel and electrical regulation through charge injection/ferroelectric switching from the HZO gate, functions of photoreceptors in the retina and synapses in the visual cortex are achieved. This work provides a potential solution for developing compact and efficient devices for the next&#8208;generation bio&#8208;inspired visual system.








Abstract
Visual perception has profound effects on human decision&#8208;making and emotional responses. Replicating the functions of the human visual system through device development has been a constant pursuit in recent years. However, to fully simulate the various functions of the human visual system, it is often necessary to integrate multiple devices with different functions, resulting in complex, large&#8208;volume device structures and increased power consumption. Here, an optoelectronic transistor with comprehensive visual functions is introduced. By coupling diverse photoreceptive properties of the channel and electrical regulation through charge injection/ferroelectric switching from the hafnium&#8208;based gate, the devices can simulate functions of both photoreceptors in the retina and synapses in the visual cortex. A device array is constructed to confirm the perceptual functions of cone and rod cells. Subsequently, color discrimination and recognition for color images are achieved by combining the tunable perception and synapse functions. Then an intelligent traffic judgment system with this all&#8208;in&#8208;one device is developed, which is capable of making judgments and decisions regarding traffic signals and pedestrian movements. This work provides a potential solution for developing compact and efficient devices for the next&#8208;generation bio&#8208;inspired visual system.

         <title>Electrochemical Switching of Electromagnetism by Hierarchical Disorder Tailored Atomic Scale Polarization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through electrochemically tailoring interfacial and cationic disordering, atomic electric fields are controllably coupled to form the local polarization domain, which eventually realizes superior electromagnetic tunability and dynamic switching between electromagnetic wave absorption/transparency.








Abstract
High&#8208;frequency electronic response governs a broad spectrum of electromagnetic applications from radiation protection, and signal compatibility, to energy recovery. Despite various efforts to manage electric conductivity, dynamic control over dielectric polarization for real&#8208;time electromagnetic modulation remains a notable challenge. Herein, an electrochemical lithiation&#8208;driven hierarchical disordering strategy is demonstrated for actively modulating electromagnetic properties. The controllable formation and diffusion of coherent interfaces and cation vacancies tailor the coupling of atomic electric field and thus the locally polarized domains, which leads to the reversible electromagnetic transparency/absorption switching with a tunable range of &#8722;0.8&#8211;&#8722;20.4 dB for the reflection loss and a broad operation bandwidth of 4.6 GHz. Compared to traditional methods of heteroatomic doping, hydrogenation, mechanical deformation, and phase transition, the electrochemical strategy shows a larger regulation scope of dielectric permittivity with the maximum increase ratios of 260% and 1950% for real and imaginary parts, respectively. This enables the construction of various device architectures including the adaptive window and pixelated metasurface. The results offer opportunities to achieve intelligent electromagnetic devices and pave an avenue to rejuvenate various electromagnetic functions of semiconductive oxides.

         <title>Enable Rechargeable Carbon Fluoride Batteries with Unprecedented High Rate and Long Life by Oxygen Doping and Electrolyte Formulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rechargeable carbon fluoride battery is demonstrated with unprecedented high rate (364 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 20 A&#160;g&#8722;1), long life (600 cycles) and low charging plateau voltage down to 3.2 V by oxygen doping and electrolyte formulation. This Li&#8208;CFx system demonstrates application potentiality in view of its low temperature operation, low self&#8208;discharge ability, large&#8208;scale pouch cell fabrication and high cathode loading.








Abstract
Here, a rechargeable carbon fluoride battery is demonstrated with unprecedented high rate and long life by oxygen doping and electrolyte formulation. The introductions of Mn2+&#8211;O catalyst and porous structure during the oxidation process of CFx cathode can promote the splitting of Li&#8211;F during charging. By further modulating the electrolyte with triphenylantimony chloride (TSbCl) as anion acceptor and CsF as product modulator, the more readily dissociable CsLiF2 product instead of LiF is preferentially formed, and the TSbCl&#8208;salt protection interface is constructed to confine Li&#8211;F based products and reduce fluoride loss at cathode side. These effects endow Li&#8208;CFx batteries with durable reversible conversion reaction (for at least 600 cycles), ultrahigh rate performance (e.g., 364 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 20 A&#160;g&#8722;1) and low charging plateau voltage down to 3.2&#160;V. The cathode exhibits the maximum power density of 38342&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1 and energy density of 1012&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. Furthermore, this Li&#8208;CFx system demonstrates the promising prospects for applications in view of its low temperature operation (e.g., 280 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C), low self&#8208;discharge ability, large&#8208;scale pouch cell fabrication and high cathode loading (5&#8211;6&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2), enabling it to move beyond previous role as primary battery and into new role as fast&#8208;charging rechargeable battery with high energy density.

&lt;p&gt;A rechargeable carbon fluoride battery is demonstrated with unprecedented high rate (364 mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 20 A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), long life (600 cycles) and low charging plateau voltage down to 3.2 V by oxygen doping and electrolyte formulation. This Li-CF&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; system demonstrates application potentiality in view of its low temperature operation, low self-discharge ability, large-scale pouch cell fabrication and high cathode loading.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, a rechargeable carbon fluoride battery is demonstrated with unprecedented high rate and long life by oxygen doping and electrolyte formulation. The introductions of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;O catalyst and porous structure during the oxidation process of CF&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; cathode can promote the splitting of Li&#8211;F during charging. By further modulating the electrolyte with triphenylantimony chloride (TSbCl) as anion acceptor and CsF as product modulator, the more readily dissociable CsLiF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; product instead of LiF is preferentially formed, and the TSbCl-salt protection interface is constructed to confine Li&#8211;F based products and reduce fluoride loss at cathode side. These effects endow Li-CF&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; batteries with durable reversible conversion reaction (for at least 600 cycles), ultrahigh rate performance (e.g., 364 mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 20 A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and low charging plateau voltage down to 3.2&#160;V. The cathode exhibits the maximum power density of 38342&#160;W&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and energy density of 1012&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, this Li-CF&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; system demonstrates the promising prospects for applications in view of its low temperature operation (e.g., 280 mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C), low self-discharge ability, large-scale pouch cell fabrication and high cathode loading (5&#8211;6&#160;mg&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), enabling it to move beyond previous role as primary battery and into new role as fast-charging rechargeable battery with high energy density.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A NIR&#8208;II Organic Dendrimer with Superb Photothermal Performance Based on Electron&#8208;Donor Iteration for Photothermal Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the electron&#8208;donor iteration strategy, the near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) absorbing&#160;organic photothermal dendrimer CR&#8208;(DPA)3&#8208;T nanoparticles (CR&#8208;(DPA)3&#8208;T NPs) is for the first time designed to exhibit superb photothermal performance with the value (&#603;1064&#160;&#215;&#160;PTCE1064) of 2.85&#160;&#215;&#160;104 at 1064&#160;nm, offering a universal strategy to develop NIR&#8208;II organic small molecule photothermal materials for photothermal immunotherapy.








Abstract
Organic photothermal materials have attracted extensive attention due to their designable molecular structure, tunable excited&#8208;state properties, and excellent biocompatibility, however, the development of near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) absorbing&#160;organic photothermal materials with high photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE) and molar extinction coefficient (&#603;) remains challenging. Herein, a novel &#8220;electron&#8208;donor iteration&#8221; strategy is proposed to construct organic photothermal dendrimers (CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T, CR&#8208;(DPA)2&#8208;T and CR&#8208;(DPA)3&#8208;T) with donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D) features and diradical characteristics. Owing to the enhanced D&#8211;A effect and intramolecular motions, their absorption and photothermal capacity increase as the generation grows. Surprisingly, an excellent photothermal performance (&#603;1064 &#215;&#160;PTCE1064) with a superb value of 2.85&#160;&#215;&#160;104 in the NIR&#8208;II region is achieved for CR&#8208;(DPA)3&#8208;T nanoparticles (CR&#8208;(DPA)3&#8208;T NPs) compared to most reported counterparts. Besides, CR&#8208;(DPA)3&#8208;T NPs exhibit superior antitumor efficacy by the synergistic effect of photothermal therapy (PTT)&#160;and immunotherapy, efficiently inhibiting the growth of both primary and distant tumors. To the best knowledge, organic photothermal dendrimer is for the first time reported, and a universal donor engineering strategy is offered to develop NIR&#8208;II&#8208;absorbing organic photothermal materials for photothermal immunotherapy.

         <title>Jamming Giant Molecules at Interface in Organic Photovoltaics to Improve Performance and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A giant molecule designated DQx&#8208;Ph is synthesized, characterized by a reduced Huang&#8208;Rhys parameter and suppressed non&#8208;radiative energy loss. Through the implementation of an interface&#8208;enhanced layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer fabrication strategy, DQx&#8208;Ph giant molecules are successfully jammed at the interface of donor and acceptor crystalline fibrils. This configuration preserves the superior transport properties of PM6 and L8&#8208;BO while integrating the high open&#8208;circuit voltage and thermodynamically stable characteristics of DQx&#8208;Ph. Consequently, the organic photovoltaic device exhibits a high efficiency of 19.9%, along with improved operational stability.








Abstract
A novel approach for depositing the giant molecule acceptor (GMA) at the donor&#8211;acceptor interface to enhance the efficiency and stability of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices through a designed interface&#8208;enhanced layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer device fabrication protocol is proposed. The giant molecule acceptor DQx&#8208;Ph is mixed with the polymer donor in the bottom layer to form a polymer donor fibril phase and a mixed phase, followed by subsequent deposition of the main acceptor L8&#8208;BO. The L8&#8208;BO solution swells the bottom layer and alters the localized morphology of the mixing phase, introducing L8&#8208;BO fibrillar crystallization and pushing DQx&#8208;Ph giant molecules outwards to the fibril interfaces. Through this approach, the localized morphology and optoelectronic property of the bulk heterojunction are optimized. This configuration maintains the superior transport properties of L8&#8208;BO while integrating the high open&#8208;circuit voltage characteristics of DQx&#8208;Ph. Additionally, exciton dissociation and charge generation are simultaneously enhanced, with suppressed energy losses. A power conversion efficiency of 19.9% with improved operational stability is achieved, underscoring the importance of GMA interface jamming in advancing OPV technology. This study provides new insights into the development of ancillary OPV materials to overcome the critical limitations in OPV, revealing innovative approaches for photovoltaic technologies.

         <title>Crosslinkable Ligands for High&#8208;Density Photo&#8208;Patterning of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and synthesis of a bidentate photo&#8208;crosslinkable ligand for high&#8208;density photo&#8208;patterning of perovskite nanocrystals is reported. The incorporation of the photo&#8208;crosslinker to perovskite nanocrystals enables the creation of a high&#8208;density crosslinked film with high optical density of 1.1, at a film thickness of only 1.4 &#181;m. Patterning via laser writing gave well&#8208;defined patterns with feature sizes of 20 &#181;m.








Abstract
Perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are promising luminescent materials for electronic color displays due to their high luminescence efficiency, widely&#8208;tunable emission wavelengths, and narrow emission linewidth. Their application in emerging display technologies&#160;necessitates precise micron&#8208;scale patterning&#160;while maintaining good optical performance. Although photolithography is a well&#8208;established micro&#8208;patterning technique in the industry, conventional processes are incompatible with PNCs as the use of polar solvents can damage the ionic PNCs, causing&#160;severe luminescence quenching. Here,&#160;we report the rational design and synthesis of a new bidentate photo&#8208;crosslinkable ligand for the direct photo&#8208;patterning of PNCs. Each ligand contains two photosensitive acrylate groups and two carboxylate groups, and is introduced to the PNCs via an entropy&#8208;driven ligand exchange process. In a close&#8208;packed thin film, the acrylate ligands photo&#8208;polymerize and crosslink under ultraviolet light, rendering the PNCs insoluble in developing solvents. A high&#8208;density crosslinked PNC film with an optical density of 1.1 is attained at 1.4&#160;&#181;m thickness, surpassing industry requirements on the absorption coefficient. Micron&#8208;scale patterning is further demonstrated using direct laser writing, producing well&#8208;defined 20&#160;&#181;m features. This study thus offers an effective and versatile approach for micro&#8208;patterning PNCs, and may also be broadly applicable to other nanomaterial systems.

         <title>Switching from Molecules to Functional Materials: Breakthroughs in Photochromism With MOFs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uniting the innovative design strategies of reticular chemistry with photoresponsive moieties creates a synergistic relationship that elevates material performance and overcomes common challenges in functional material development. These advances can be realized using photochromic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as platforms, paving the way for breakthroughs in the areas of high&#8208;speed and programable optoelectronics, heterogeneous photocatalysis, and beyond.








Abstract
Photochromic materials with properties that can be dynamically tailored as a function of external stimuli are a rapidly expanding field driven by applications in areas ranging from molecular computing, nanotechnology, or photopharmacology to programable heterogeneous catalysis. Challenges arise, however, when translating the rapid, solution&#8208;like response of stimuli&#8208;responsive moieties to solid&#8208;state materials due to the intermolecular interactions imposed through close molecular packing in bulk solids. As a result, the integration of photochromic compounds into synthetically programable porous matrices, such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), has come to the forefront as an emerging strategy for photochromic material development. This review highlights how the core principles of reticular chemistry (on the example of MOFs) play a critical role in the photochromic material performance, surpassing the limitations previously observed in solution or solid state. The symbiotic relationship between photoresponsive compounds and porous frameworks with a focus on how reticular synthesis creates avenues toward tailorable photoisomerization kinetics, directional energy and charge transfer, switchable gas sorption, and synergistic chromophore communication is discussed. This review not only focuses on the recent cutting&#8208;edge advancements in photochromic material development, but also highlights novel, vital&#8208;to&#8208;pursue pathways for multifaceted functional materials in the realms of energy, technology, and biomedicine.

         <title>Achieving Efficient X&#8208;ray Scintillation of Purely Organic Phosphorescent Materials by Chromophore Confinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of rigid and flexible is proposed host&#8208;guest doping strategies to achieve efficient purely organic phosphorescent scintillation. Under UV&#8208;light excitation, the phosphorescence efficiency of the doped crystal reaches up to 99.4%. Compared with single&#8208;component crystals, the doped crystals display markedly enhanced radioluminescence because of the confinement of isolated chromophores and the effective harvesting of triplet excitons, which benefits potential applications in X&#8208;ray radiography.








Abstract
Scintillators have attracted significant attention due to their wide&#8208;ranging applications in both industrial and medical fields. However, one of the ongoing challenges is the efficient utilization of triplet excitons to achieve high radioluminescence efficiency. Here, a series of purely organic phosphors is presented for X&#8208;ray scintillation, employing a combined rigid and flexible host&#8208;guest doping strategy. The doped crystals exhibit a remarkable maximum phosphorescence efficiency of 99.4% under UV excitation. Furthermore, upon X&#8208;ray irradiation, the radioluminescence intensities of the doped phosphors are markedly higher compared to their single&#8208;component crystal counterparts. Through systematic investigations, it is demonstrated the crucial role of confining isolated chromophores in enhancing scintillation efficiency. Additionally, a transparent scintillator screen fabricated with the doped phosphor exhibits excellent X&#8208;ray imaging performance, achieving a high spatial resolution of 18.0 lp&#160;mm&#8722;1. This work not only offers valuable insights into suppressing non&#8208;radiative transitions of triplet excitons during scintillation but also opens a new avenue for designing highly efficient purely organic phosphorescent scintillators.

         <title>Zinc Chemistries of Hybrid Electrolytes in Zinc Metal Batteries: From Solvent Structure to Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microscopic solvent structures, Zn2+ migration forms, physicochemical properties, and zinc chemistries mechanisms at the anode/cathode interfaces in hybrid electrolytes, which consist of aqueous solution, multiple ions, &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt,&#8221; solid, eutectic, ionic liquids, hydrogel, or organic solvent, are systematically elaborated and reviewed. The scotoma and amelioration strategies for designing current hybrid electrolytes are actively exposited as well.








Abstract
Along with the booming research on zinc metal batteries (ZMBs) in recent years, operational issues originated from inferior interfacial reversibility have become inevitable. Presently, single&#8208;component electrolytes represented by aqueous solution, &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt,&#8221; solid, eutectic, ionic liquids, hydrogel, or organic solvent system are hard to undertake independently the task of guiding the practical application of ZMBs due to their specific limitations. The hybrid electrolytes modulate microscopic interaction mode between Zn2+ and other ions/molecules, integrating vantage of respective electrolyte systems. They even demonstrate original Zn2+ mobility pattern or interfacial chemistries mechanism distinct from single&#8208;component electrolytes, providing considerable opportunities for solving electromigration and interfacial problems in ZMBs. Therefore, it is urgent to comprehensively summarize the zinc chemistries principles, characteristics, and applications of various hybrid electrolytes employed in ZMBs. This review begins with elucidating the chemical bonding mode of Zn2+ and interfacial physicochemical theory, and then systematically elaborates the microscopic solvent structure, Zn2+ migration forms, physicochemical properties, and the zinc chemistries mechanisms at the anode/cathode interfaces in each type of hybrid electrolytes. Among of which, the scotoma and amelioration strategies for the current hybrid electrolytes are actively exposited, expecting to provide referenceable insights for further progress of future high&#8208;quality ZMBs.

         <title>A Dynamic H&#8208;Bonding Network Enables Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Color&#8208;Tunable Chiral Afterglow Polymer for 4D Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy utilizing dynamic H&#8208;bonding networks is proposed to create stimuli&#8208;responsive, color&#8208;tunable chiral organic afterglow materials, offering precise control over both color and lifetime. These materials pave the way for the development of advanced optical information displays and sophisticated 4D encryption systems, significantly enhancing the functionality and adaptability of optoelectronic information systems.








Abstract
The development of stimuli&#8208;responsive and color&#8208;tunable chiral organic afterglow materials has attracted great attention but remains a daunting challenge. Here, a simple yet effective strategy through the construction of a dynamic H&#8208;bonding network is proposed to explore the multi&#8208;color stimuli&#8208;responsive chiral afterglow by doping a self&#8208;designed chiral phosphorescent chromophore into a polyvinyl alcohol matrix. A stimuli&#8208;responsive deep blue chiral afterglow system with a lifetime of up to 3.35 s, quantum yield of 25.0%, and luminescent dissymmetry factor of up to 0.05 is achieved through reversible formation and breakdown of the H&#8208;bonding network upon thermal&#8208;heating and water&#8208;fumigating. Moreover, multi&#8208;color stimuli&#8208;responsive chiral afterglow can be obtained by chiral and afterglow energy transfer, allowing the establishment of afterglow information displays and high&#8208;level 4D encryption. This work not only offers a facile platform to develop advanced stimuli&#8208;responsive materials but also opens a new avenue for developing next&#8208;generation optical information technology with enhanced functionality and responsiveness.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven, Reversible Spatiotemporal Control of Dynamic Covalent Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoswitchable nitrogen superbase is utilized for the reversible spatiotemporal activation of dynamic bond exchange in a covalently cross&#8208;linked polymer. The reorganization rate of the network structure is controlled by the exposure to UV or visible light, which enables advanced applications such as spatially resolved, reversible reshaping as well as micro&#8208;imprinting over multiple steps.








Abstract
Dynamic covalent polymer networks exhibit a cross&#8208;linked structure like conventional thermosets and elastomers, although their topology can be reorganized through externally triggered bond exchange reactions. This characteristic enables a unique combination of repairability, recyclability and dimensional stability, crucial for a sustainable industrial economy. Herein the application of a photoswitchable nitrogen superbase is reported for the spatially resolved and reversible control over dynamic bond exchange within a thiol&#8208;ene photopolymer. By the exposure to UV or visible light, the associative exchange between thioester links and thiol groups is successfully gained control over, and thereby the macroscopic mechanical material properties, in a locally controlled manner. Consequently, the resulting reorganization of the global network topology enables to utilize this material for previously unrealizable advanced applications such as spatially resolved, reversible reshaping as well as micro&#8208;imprinting over multiple steps. Finally, the presented concept contributes fundamentally to the evolution of dynamic polymers and provides universal applicability in covalent adaptable networks relying on a base&#8208;catalyzed exchange mechanism.

         <title>Asymmetrically Coordinated Cu Dual&#8208;Atom&#8208;Sites Enables Selective CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetrically coordinated Cu dual&#8208;atom sites with CuN2&#8208;CuNS moiety exhibits excellent electrocatalytic CO2RR performances. The asymmetrical electron cloud distribution around the CuN2&#8208;CuNS of the asymmetrically coordinated Cu dual&#8208;atom catalyst destabilizes the ethylene reaction intermediates and thereby promotes ethanol production.








Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to value&#8208;added liquid fuels is a highly attractive solution for carbon&#8208;neutral recycling, especially for C2+ products. However, the selectivity control to preferable products is a great challenge due to the complex multi&#8208;electron proton transfer process. In this work, a series of Cu atomic dispersed catalysts are synthesized by regulating the coordination structures to optimize the CO2RR selectivity. Cu2&#8208;SNC catalyst with a uniquely asymmetrical coordinated CuN2&#8208;CuNS site shows high ethanol selective with the FE of 62.6% at &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus RHE and 60.2% at 0.9&#160;V versus RHE in H&#8208;Cell and Flow&#8208;Cell test, respectively. Besides, the nest&#8208;like structure of Cu2&#8208;SNC is beneficial to the mass transfer process and the selection of catalytic products. In situ experiments and theory calculations reveal the reaction mechanisms of such high selectivity of ethanol. The S atoms weaken the bonding ability of the adjacent Cu to the carbon atom, which accelerates the selection from *CHCOH to generate *CHCHOH, resulting in the high selectivity of ethanol. This work indicates a promising strategy in the rational design of asymmetrically coordinated single, dual, or tri&#8208;atom catalysts and provides a candidate material for CO2RR to produce ethanol.

&lt;p&gt;The asymmetrically coordinated Cu dual-atom sites with CuN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CuNS moiety exhibits excellent electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR performances. The asymmetrical electron cloud distribution around the CuN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CuNS of the asymmetrically coordinated Cu dual-atom catalyst destabilizes the ethylene reaction intermediates and thereby promotes ethanol production.

This work proposed a strategy to seamlessly integrate the essential functions of multiple sensory, heat regulation, and impact protection into a thin, soft, lightweight, non&#8208;woven textile for smart sportswear via facile coaxial electrospinning technology.








Abstract
Smart textiles with a high level of personal protection, health monitoring, physical comfort, and wearing durability are highly demanded in clothing for harsh application scenarios, such as modern sportswear. However, seamlessly integrating such a smart clothing system has been a long&#8208;sought but challenging goal. Herein, based on coaxial electrospinning techniques, a smart non&#8208;woven textile (Smart&#8208;NT) integrated with high impact resistance is developed, multisensory functions, and radiative cooling effects. This Smart&#8208;NT is comprised of core&#8208;shell nanofibers with an ionic conductive polymer sheath and an impact&#8208;stiffening polymer core. The soft smart textile, with a thickness of only 800&#160;&#181;m, can attenuate over 60% of impact force, sense pressure stimulus with sensitivity up to 201.5 kPa&#8722;1, achieve temperature sensing resolution of 0.1&#160;&#176;C, and reduce skin temperature by &#8776;17&#160;&#176;C under a solar intensity of 1&#160;kW&#160;m&#8722;2. In addition, the stretchable Smart&#8208;NT is highly durable and robust, retaining its multifunction features over 10&#160;000 bending and multiple washing cycles. Finally, application scenarios are demonstrated for real&#8208;time health monitoring, body protection, and physical comfort of smart sportswear based on Smart&#8208;NT for outdoor sports. The strategy opens a new avenue for seamless integration of smart clothing systems.

         <title>Blueprints of Architected Materials: A Guide to Metamaterial Design for Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical metamaterials are architected structures with extraordinary properties, which are defined by their unit cell geometry. Although metamaterials hold significant potential for tissue engineering, their complex design limits their wider use. This review acts as a guide detailing design principles and geometric parameters crucial for metamaterial design, while showcasing applications in tissue engineering, to facilitate metamaterial use in the field.








Abstract
Mechanical metamaterials are rationally designed structures engineered to exhibit extraordinary properties, often surpassing those of their constituent materials. The geometry of metamaterials&#8217; building blocks, referred to as unit cells, plays an essential role in determining their macroscopic mechanical behavior. Due to their hierarchical design and remarkable properties, metamaterials hold significant potential for tissue engineering; however their implementation in the field remains limited. The major challenge hindering the broader use of metamaterials lies in the complexity of unit cell design and fabrication. To address this gap, a comprehensive guide is presented detailing the design principles of well&#8208;established metamaterials. The essential unit cell geometric parameters and design constraints, as well as their influence on mechanical behavior, are summarized highlighting essential points for effective fabrication. Moreover, the potential integration of artificial intelligence techniques is explored in meta&#8208;biomaterial design for patient&#8208; and application&#8208;specific design. Furthermore, a comprehensive overview of current applications of mechanical metamaterials is provided in tissue engineering, categorized by tissue type, thereby showcasing the versatility of different designs in matching the mechanical properties of the target tissue. This review aims to provide a valuable resource for tissue engineering researchers and aid in the broader use of metamaterials in the field.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Actuated Ferroptosis Nanomotor for Enhanced Tumor Penetration and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIR&#8208;driven ROS self&#8208;supplying Z@P&#8208;F nanomotor with efficient lysosome escape and enhanced tumor penetration is successfully developed for synergistic tumor CDT/PTT. By releasing Fe2+ and H2O2 under NIR irradiation and acidic TME, Z@P&#8208;F nanomotors continuously generate large amounts of lipid ROS in the tumor and deplete intracellular GSH, thus facilitating Fe2+&#8208;mediated ferroptosis and eventually achieving effective tumor eradication.








Abstract
Ferroptosis nano&#8208;inducers have drawn considerable attention in the treatment of malignant tumors. However, low intratumoral hydrogen peroxide level and complex biological barriers hinder the ability of nanomedicines to generate sufficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) and achieve tumor penetration. Here a near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;driven ROS self&#8208;supplying nanomotor is successfully designed for synergistic tumor chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). Janus nanomotor is created by the asymmetrical modification of polydopamine (PDA) with zinc peroxide (ZnO2) and subsequent ferrous ion (Fe2+) chelation via the polyphenol groups from the PDA, here refer as ZnO2@PDA&#8208;Fe (Z@P&#8208;F). ZnO2 is capable of slowly releasing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into an acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) providing sufficient ingredients for the Fenton reaction necessary for ferroptosis. Upon NIR laser irradiation, the loaded Fe2+ is released and a thermal gradient is simultaneously formed owing to the asymmetric PDA coating, thus endowing the nanomotor with self&#8208;thermophoresis based enhanced diffusion for subsequent lysosomal escape and tumor penetration. Therefore, the release of ferrous ions (Fe2+), self&#8208;supplied H2O2, and self&#8208;thermophoresis of nanomotors with NIR actuation further improve the synergistic CDT/PTT efficacy, showing great potential for active tumor therapy.

         <title>Indirect&#8208;To&#8208;Direct Bandgap Crossover and Room&#8208;Temperature Valley Polarization of Multilayer MoS2 Achieved by Electrochemical Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study demonstrates highly electron&#8208;doped multi&#8208;monolayer 2H&#8208;MoS2&#160;through planar organic ion intercalation (1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium, EMIM+),&#160;maintaining a direct bandgap with high photoluminescence intensity, and stable valley polarization up to room temperature for future applications of valleytronics and spintronics.








Abstract
Monolayer (1L) group VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit broken inversion symmetry and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling, offering promising applications in optoelectronics and valleytronics. Despite their direct bandgap, high absorption coefficient, and spin&#8208;valley locking in K or K&#8217; valleys, the ultra&#8208;short valley lifetime limits their room&#8208;temperature applications. In contrast, multilayer TMDs, with more absorptive layers, sacrifice the direct bandgap and valley polarization upon gaining inversion symmetry from the bilayer structure. It is demonstrated that multilayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) can maintain 1) a structure with broken inversion symmetry and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling, 2) a direct bandgap with high photoluminescence (PL) intensity, and 3) stable valley polarization up to room temperature. Through the intercalation of organic 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium (EMIM+) ions, multilayer MoS2 not only exhibits layer decoupling but also benefits from an electron doping effect. This results in a hundredfold increase in PL intensity and stable valley polarization, achieving 55% and 16% degrees of valley polarization at 3 K and room temperature, respectively. The persistent valley polarization at room temperature, due to interlayer decoupling and trion dominance facilitated by a gate&#8208;free method, opens up potential applications in valley&#8208;selective optoelectronics and valley transistors.

         <title>Microenvironment&#8208;Activatable Probe for Precise NIR&#8208;II Monitoring and Synergistic Immunotherapy in Rheumatoid Arthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced nanoprobe that integrates activatable second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence imaging for precise rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosis with multi&#8208;pronged RA treatments is developed. It enables highly sensitive RA diagnosis and real&#8208;time therapeutic monitoring. And the combination of ROS scavenging, on&#8208;demand CO gas release, and IL&#8208;6 signaling blockade results in synergistic immunomodulation effect, significantly alleviating RA symptoms and preventing joint destruction.








Abstract
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) represents an insidious autoimmune inflammatory disorder that severely lowers the life quality by progressively destructing joint functions and eventually causing permanent disability, posing a serious public health problem. Here, an advanced theranostic probe is introduced that integrates activatable second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence imaging for precise RA diagnosis with multi&#8208;pronged RA treatments. A novel molecular probe comprising a long&#8208;wavelength aggregation&#8208;induced emission unit and a manganese carbonyl cage motif is synthesized, which enables NIR&#8208;II fluorescence activation and concurrently releasing therapeutic carbon monoxide (CO) gas in inflamed joint microenvironment. This molecular probe self&#8208;assembles into a biocompatible nanoprobe, which is subsequently conjugated with anti&#8208;IL&#8208;6R antibody to afford active&#8208;targeting ability of RA. The nanoprobe exhibits significant turn&#8208;on NIR&#8208;II fluorescence signal at the RA lesion, enabling highly sensitive RA diagnosis and real&#8208;time therapeutic monitoring. The combination of ROS scavenging, on&#8208;demand CO gas release, and IL&#8208;6 signaling blockade results in potent therapeutic effect and synergistic immunomodulation impact, significantly alleviating the RA symptoms and preventing joint destruction. This research introduces a novel paradigm for the development of high&#8208;performance, activatable theranostic strategies to facilitate precise detection and enhanced treatment of RA&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Rationally Designed Mo/Ru&#8208;Based Multi&#8208;Site Heterogeneous Electrocatalyst for Accelerated Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rationally designed Mo/Ru&#8208;based multi&#8208;site electrocatalyst enables ampere&#8208;level current density alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction under low overpotential. Rationally modulating the separate functions endows the higher valence state of interfacial Mo (MoO2) coupled with the lower valence state of interfacial Mo (Mo2C) for accelerating H2O dissociation, and the interfacial Ru for promoted H&#8211;H coupling and subsequent H2 evolution.








Abstract
The rational design of multi&#8208;site electrocatalysts with three different functions for facile H2O dissociation, H&#8211;H coupling, and rapid H2 release is desirable but difficult to achieve. This strategy can accelerate the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under alkaline conditions. To resolve this issue, a Mo/Ru&#8208;based catalyst with three different active sites (Ru/Mo2C/MoO2) is rationally designed and its performance in alkaline HER is evaluated. The experimental results and density functional theory calculations revealed that, at the heterogeneous Mo2C/MoO2 interface, the higher valence state of Mo (MoO2) and the lower valence state of Mo (Mo2C) exhibited strong OH&#8722; and H&#8722;binding energies, respectively, which accelerated H2O dissociation. Moreover, the interfacial Ru possessed an appropriate hydrogen binding energy for H&#8211;H coupling and subsequent H2 evolution. Thus, this catalyst significantly accelerated the Volmer step and the Tafel step and, consequently, HER kinetics. This catalyst also demonstrated low overpotentials of 19 and 160&#160;mV at current densities of 10 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, in alkaline media and long&#8208;term stability superior to that of most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art alkaline HER electrocatalysts. This work provides a rational design principle for advanced multi&#8208;site catalytic systems, which can realize multi&#8208;electron electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Scalable Atomic Arrays for Spin&#8208;Based Quantum Computers in Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>Ion&#8208;implanted silicon donor spin qubits afford exceptional quantum performance and show promise for the maturation to powerful quantum computers using standard semiconductor industry processes. This study presents a comprehensive technological suite for the scalable deterministic construction of donor&#8208;based qubit and qudit arrays that could be used as quantum processor architectures.








Abstract
Semiconductor spin qubits combine excellent quantum performance with the prospect of manufacturing quantum devices using industry&#8208;standard metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (MOS) processes. This applies also to ion&#8208;implanted donor spins, which further afford exceptional coherence times and large Hilbert space dimension in their nuclear spin. Here multiple strategies are demonstrated and integrated to manufacture scale&#8208;up donor&#8208;based quantum computers. 31PF2 molecule implants are used to triple the placement certainty compared to 31P ions, while attaining 99.99% confidence in detecting the implant. Similar confidence is retained by implanting heavier atoms such as 123Sb and 209Bi, which represent high&#8208;dimensional qudits for quantum information processing, while Sb2 molecules enable deterministic formation of closely&#8208;spaced qudits. The deterministic formation of regular arrays of donor atoms with 300&#160;nm spacing is demonstrated, using step&#8208;and&#8208;repeat implantation through a nano aperture. These methods cover the full gamut of technological requirements for the construction of donor&#8208;based quantum computers in silicon.

         <title>Ionic Covalent Organic Framework Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic covalent organic frameworks (ICOFs) are porous and crystalline materials with ionic moieties installed on the backbone. They can conduct ions selectively, rapidly, and reliably. Recent efforts to improve ionic conductivity, lower manufacturing cost, and reduce contact resistance will enable nicely balanced ICOF electrolytes for the next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable secondary batteries, widely used in modern technology, are essential for mobile and consumer electronic devices and energy storage applications. Lithium (Li)&#8208;ion batteries are currently the most popular choice due to their decent energy density. However, the increasing demand for higher energy density has led to the development of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Despite their potential, the commonly used liquid electrolyte&#8208;based LMBs present serious safety concerns, such as dendrite growth and the risk of fire and explosion. To address these issues, using solid&#8208;state electrolytes in batteries has emerged as a promising solution. In this Perspective, recent advancements are discussed in ionic covalent organic framework (ICOFs)&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes, identify current challenges in the field, and propose future research directions. Highly crystalline ion conductors with polymeric versatility show promise as the next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Specifically, the use of anionic or cationic COFs is examined for Li&#8208;based batteries, highlight the high interfacial resistance caused by the intrinsic brittleness of crystalline ICOFs as the main limitation, and presents innovative ideas for developing all&#8208; and quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries using ICOF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes.

&lt;p&gt;Ionic covalent organic frameworks (ICOFs) are porous and crystalline materials with ionic moieties installed on the backbone. They can conduct ions selectively, rapidly, and reliably. Recent efforts to improve ionic conductivity, lower manufacturing cost, and reduce contact resistance will enable nicely balanced ICOF electrolytes for the next-generation rechargeable batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rechargeable secondary batteries, widely used in modern technology, are essential for mobile and consumer electronic devices and energy storage applications. Lithium (Li)-ion batteries are currently the most popular choice due to their decent energy density. However, the increasing demand for higher energy density has led to the development of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Despite their potential, the commonly used liquid electrolyte-based LMBs present serious safety concerns, such as dendrite growth and the risk of fire and explosion. To address these issues, using solid-state electrolytes in batteries has emerged as a promising solution. In this Perspective, recent advancements are discussed in ionic covalent organic framework (ICOFs)-based solid-state electrolytes, identify current challenges in the field, and propose future research directions. Highly crystalline ion conductors with polymeric versatility show promise as the next-generation solid-state electrolytes. Specifically, the use of anionic or cationic COFs is examined for Li-based batteries, highlight the high interfacial resistance caused by the intrinsic brittleness of crystalline ICOFs as the main limitation, and presents innovative ideas for developing all- and quasi-solid-state batteries using ICOF-based solid-state electrolytes. With these considerations and further developments, the potential for ICOFs is optimistic about enabling the realization of high-energy-density all-solid-state LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Regarding the large&#8208;scale fabrication of sulfide all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), silicon anode and thin free&#8208;standing sulfide electrolyte membranes are employed simultaneously toward potentially practical application. Dual&#8208;function Li4.4Si modified nSi anode sheets are developed, in which Li4.4Si serves a dual role by not only providing additional Li+ but also stabilizing the anode structure with its low Young's modulus upon cycling.








Abstract
The silicon&#8208;based anodes are one of the promising anodes to achieve the high energy density of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). Nano silicon (nSi) is considered as a suitable anode material for assembling sheet&#8208;type sulfide ASSBs using thin free&#8208;standing Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) membrane without causing short circuit. However, nSi anodes face a significant challenge in terms of rapid capacity degradation during cycling. To address this issue, dual&#8208;function Li4.4Si modified nSi anode sheets are developed, in which Li4.4Si serves a dual role by not only providing additional Li+ but also stabilizing the anode structure with its low Young's modulus upon cycling. Sheet&#8208;type ASSBs equipped with the Li4.4Si modified nSi anode, thin LPSC membrane, and LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 (NCM811) cathode demonstrate exceptional cycle stability, with a capacity retention of 96.16% at 0.5 C (1.18&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) after 100 cycles and maintain stability for 400 cycles. Furthermore, a remarkable cell&#8208;level energy density of 303.9&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 is achieved at a high loading of 5.22 mAh cm&#8722;2, representing a leading level of sulfide ASSBs using electrolyte membranes at room temperature. Consequently, the chemically stable slurry process implemented in the fabrication of Li4.4Si&#8208;modified nSi anode sheet paves the way for scalable applications of high&#8208;performance sulfide ASSBs.

         <title>On the Topotactic Phase Transition Achieving Superconducting Infinite&#8208;Layer Nickelates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of many new complex oxides involves topotactic reduction&#8212;a process used to alter electronic structure through the removal of specific oxygen ions. The reaction can be damaging to the crystal lattice, however, and little is known about the reduction process in ultrathin films. Li et&#160;al. observed the reaction in situ using synchrotron X&#8208;ray methods to probe formation of the superconducting nickelate, Nd0.8 Sr0.2NiO2, providing key insights into the nature of the phase transition.








Abstract
Topotactic reduction is critical to a wealth of phase transitions of current interest, including synthesis of the superconducting nickelate Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2, reduced from the initial Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO3/SrTiO3 heterostructure. Due to the highly sensitive and often damaging nature of the topotactic reduction, however, only a handful of research groups have been able to reproduce the superconductivity results. A series of in situ synchrotron&#8208;based investigations reveal that this is due to the necessary formation of an initial, ultrathin layer at the Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO3 surface that helps to mediate the introduction of hydrogen into the film such that apical oxygens are first removed from the Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO3 / SrTiO3 (001) interface and delivered into the reducing environment. This allows the square&#8208;planar / perovskite interface to stabilize and propagate from the bottom to the top of the film without the formation of interphase defects. Importantly, neither geometric rotations in the square planar structure nor significant incorporation of hydrogen within the films is detected, obviating its need for superconductivity. These findings unveil the structural basis underlying the transformation pathway and provide important guidance on achieving the superconducting phase in reduced nickelate&#160;systems.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) is developed by integrating &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hydroxyl terminal&#8208;functionalized polyacrylate into the soft segment of traditional polyether polyol. This TPU exhibits exceptional toughness and self&#8208;healing properties, making it unique among standard TPUs. Furthermore, the inclusion of photo&#8208;crosslinkable moiety in the polyacrylate polyol has&#160;successfully demonstrated the first TPU that combines superior elastomeric qualities with photopatterning capabilities.








Abstract
Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) is an essential class of materials for demanding applications, from soft robotics and electronics to medical devices and batteries. However, traditional TPU development is primarily relied on specific soft segments, such as polyether, polyester, and polycarbonate polyols. Here, a novel method is introduced for developing TPU elastomers with enhanced performance and superior functionalities compared to conventional TPUs, achieved through the use of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hydroxyl end&#8208;functionalized polyacrylates. This approach involves a defect&#8208;free synthesis of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hydroxyl end&#8208;functionalized polyacrylates through visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoiniferter polymerization. By strategically blending these functionalized polyacrylates with conventional polyols, TPUs that exhibit exceptional toughness and notable self&#8208;healing capabilities, traits rarely found in existing TPUs are engineered. Furthermore, incorporating photo&#8208;crosslinkable acrylic monomers has enabled the creation of the first TPU with superior elastomeric properties and photopatterning capabilities. This approach paves the way for a new direction in polyurethane engineering, introducing a novel class of soft segments and unlocking the potential for a wide range of advanced applications.

         <title>Soft, Tough, Antifatigue Fracture Elastomer Composites with Low Thermal Resistance through Synergistic Crack Pinning and Interfacial Slippage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft, extreme fracture tough and antifatigue fracture polydimethylsiloxane/aluminum elastomer composite is developed by optimizing the dangling chains and spherical aluminum fillers, resulting in the combined effects of crack pinning and interfacial slippage. The elastomer composite also maintains low thermal resistance, which makes it highly promising for thermal interface applications in heat dissipation of electronic devices.








Abstract
Soft elastomer composites are promising functional materials for engineer interfaces, where the miniaturized electronic devices have triggered increasing demand for effective heat dissipation, high fracture energy, and antifatigue fracture. However, such a combination of these properties can be rarely met in the same elastomer composites simultaneously. Here a strategy is presented to fabricate a soft, extreme fracture tough (3316&#160;J m&#8722;2) and antifatigue fracture (1052.56&#160;J m&#8315;2) polydimethylsiloxane/aluminum elastomer composite. These outstanding properties are achieved by optimizing the dangling chains and spherical aluminum fillers, resulting in the combined effects of crack pinning and interfacial slippage. The dangling chains that lengthen the polymer chains between cross&#8208;linked points pin the cracks and the rigid fillers obstruct the cracks, enhancing the energy per unit area needed for fatigue failure. The dangling chains also promote polymer/filler interfacial slippage, enabling effective deflection and blunting of an advancing crack tip, thus enhancing mechanical energy dissipation. Moreover, the elastomer composite exhibits low thermal resistance (&#8776;0.12&#160;K cm2 W&#8722;1), due to the formation of a thermally conductive network.

     alt="Soft, Tough, Antifatigue Fracture Elastomer Composites with Low Thermal Resistance through Synergistic Crack Pinning and Interfacial Slippage"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A soft, extreme fracture tough and antifatigue fracture polydimethylsiloxane/aluminum elastomer composite is developed by optimizing the dangling chains and spherical aluminum fillers, resulting in the combined effects of crack pinning and interfacial slippage. The elastomer composite also maintains low thermal resistance, which makes it highly promising for thermal interface applications in heat dissipation of electronic devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soft elastomer composites are promising functional materials for engineer interfaces, where the miniaturized electronic devices have triggered increasing demand for effective heat dissipation, high fracture energy, and antifatigue fracture. However, such a combination of these properties can be rarely met in the same elastomer composites simultaneously. Here a strategy is presented to fabricate a soft, extreme fracture tough (3316&#160;J m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and antifatigue fracture (1052.56&#160;J m&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) polydimethylsiloxane/aluminum elastomer composite. These outstanding properties are achieved by optimizing the dangling chains and spherical aluminum fillers, resulting in the combined effects of crack pinning and interfacial slippage. The dangling chains that lengthen the polymer chains between cross-linked points pin the cracks and the rigid fillers obstruct the cracks, enhancing the energy per unit area needed for fatigue failure. The dangling chains also promote polymer/filler interfacial slippage, enabling effective deflection and blunting of an advancing crack tip, thus enhancing mechanical energy dissipation. Moreover, the elastomer composite exhibits low thermal resistance (&#8776;0.12&#160;K cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), due to the formation of a thermally conductive network. These remarkable characteristics render this elastomer composite promising for application as a thermal interface material in electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Critical&#8208;Layered MoS2 for the Enhancement of Supercontinuum Generation in Photonic Crystal Fibre</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid&#8208;state 2D optical layers with ultrahigh nonlinearity are subtly integrated into the commercial photonic crystal fiber to boost its supercontinuum generation efficiency. The hybrid MoS2&#8208;PCF demonstrates a 70% reduction of the threshold power for SCG with one octave spanning and manifests a critical&#8208;layered characteristic that only work under a real 2D regime.








Abstract
Supercontinuum generation (SCG) from silica&#8208;based photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) is of highly technological significance from microscopy to metrology, but has been hindered by silica's relatively low intrinsic optical nonlinearity. The prevailing approaches of filling PCF with nonlinear gases or liquids can endow fibre with enhanced optical nonlinearity and boosted SCG efficiency, yet these hybrids are easily plagued by fusion complexity, environmental incompatibility or transmission mode instability. Here this work presents&#160;a strategy of embedding solid&#8208;state 2D MoS2 atomic layers into the air&#8208;holes of PCF to efficiently enhance SCG. This work demonstrates a 4.8 times enhancement of the nonlinear coefficient and a 70% reduction of the threshold power for SCG with one octave spanning in the MoS2&#8208;PCF hybrid. Furthermore, this work finds that the SCG enhancement is highly layer&#8208;dependent, which only manifests for a real 2D regime within the thickness of five atomic layers. Theoretical calculations reveal that the critical thickness arises from the trade&#8208;off among the layer&#8208;dependent enhancement of the nonlinear coefficient, leakage of fundamental mode and redshift of zero&#8208;dispersion wavelength. This work provides significant advances toward efficient SCG, and highlights the importance of matching an appropriate atomic layer number in the design of functional 2D material optical fibers.

         <title>Concurrent Amorphization and Nanocatalyst Formation in Cu&#8208;Substituted Perovskite Oxide Surface: Effects on Oxygen Reduction Reaction at Elevated Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface amorphization and the nanocatalysts ex&#8208;solution are concurrently evolved on Cu&#8208;substituted La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3&#8208;&#948; through a straightforward reduction process with prolonged time. The investigation focuses on understanding the evolution process of these phenomena and identifying the factors that contribute to improvements in performance and durability. These findings offer a practical and novel strategy for designing catalysts with redox&#8208;dynamic perovskite oxide host materials.








Abstract
The activity and durability of chemical/electrochemical catalysts are significantly influenced by their surface environments, highlighting the importance of thoroughly examining the catalyst surface. Here, Cu&#8208;substituted La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3&#8208;&#948; is selected, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art material for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), to explore the real&#8208;time evolution of surface morphology and chemistry under a reducing atmosphere at elevated temperatures. Remarkably, in a pioneering observation, it is discovered that the perovskite surface starts to amorphize at an unusually low temperature of approximately 100 &#176;C and multicomponent metal nanocatalysts additionally form on the amorphous surface as the temperature raises to 400 &#176;C. Moreover, this investigation into the stability of the resulting amorphous layer under oxidizing conditions reveals that the amorphous structure can withstand a high&#8208;temperature oxidizing atmosphere (&#8805;650 &#176;C) only when it has undergone sufficient reduction for an extended period. Therefore, the coexistence of the active nanocatalysts and defective amorphous surface leads to a nearly 100% enhancement in the electrode resistance for the ORR over 200 h without significant degradation. These observations provide a new catalytic design strategy for using redox&#8208;dynamic perovskite oxide host materials.

         <title>Molecule Anchoring Strategy Promotes Vertically Homogeneous Crystallization and Aligned Interfaces for Efficient Pb&#8211;Sn Perovskite Solar Cells and Tandem Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecule anchoring strategy is proposed to construct Pb&#8211;Sn perovskite film with vertically aligned crystals and optimized interfaces, which produces narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells with a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.3% and a record&#8208;high fill factor of 82.14%. Corresponding four&#8208;terminal (4T) all&#8208;perovskite tandem device achieves a PCE of 27.1%.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) Pb&#8211;Sn perovskites are ideal candidates as rear subcell in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Because Pb&#8211;Sn perovskites contain multiple components, the rational regulation of vertical structure and both interfaces of the film is primarily crucial to achieve high&#8208;performing NBG perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a molecule anchoring strategy is developed to in situ construct Cs0.1MA0.3FA0.6Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 perovskite film with vertically aligned crystals and optimized interfaces. Specifically, l&#8208;alanine methyl ester is developed as an anchoring additive to induce the vertical crystal growth, while PEA2PbI3SCN film is introduced to promote the homogeneous crystallization at the buried interface via SCN&#8722; anchoring with cations. Further ethylenediamine dihalides (EDA(I/Cl)2) post&#8208;treatment leads to the gradient energy level alignment on the film surface. Pb&#8211;Sn PSCs based on such film show efficient charge transport and extraction, producing a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.3% with an impressive fill factor of 82.14%. Notably, combining with semitransparent 1.78 eV wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs, the four&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem device achieves a PCE of 27.1%. This work opens up a new pathway to boost the performance of Pb&#8211;Sn PSCs and their tandem devices.

         <title>A Degradable Bioelectronic Scaffold for Localized Cell Transfection toward Enhancing Wound Healing in a 3D Space</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The repair patch achieves synchronized healing of the epidermis and dermis layers of large skin wounds in a 3D space by providing a spatial distribution scaffold for repair&#8208;related cells and increasing the secretion of healing&#8208;related factors, and this repair method not only significantly shortens the healing time but also leads to skin characteristics that are more normal after healing.








Abstract
Large skin wounds, with extensive surface area and deep vertical full&#8208;thickness involvement, can pose significant challenges in clinical settings. Traditional routes for repairing skin wounds encompass three hallmarks: 1) scab formation for hemostasis; 2) proliferation and migration of epidermal cells for wound closure; 3) proliferation, migration, and functionalization of fibroblasts and endothelial cells for dermal remodeling. However, this route face remarkable challenges to healing large wounds, usually leading to disordered structures and loss of functions in the regenerated skin, due to limited control on the transition among the three stages. In this work, an implantable bioelectronics is developed that enables the synchronization of the three stages, offering accelerated and high&#8208;quality healing of large skin wounds. The system efficiently electro&#8208;transfect local cells near the wounds, forcing cellular proliferation, while providing a 3D porous environments for synchronized migration of epidermal and dermal cells. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the system achieved synchronous progression of multiple layers within the wounds, leading to the reconstruction of a complete skin structure similar to healthy skin, which presents a new avenue for the clinical translation of large wound healing.

&lt;p&gt;Large skin wounds, with extensive surface area and deep vertical full-thickness involvement, can pose significant challenges in clinical settings. Traditional routes for repairing skin wounds encompass three hallmarks: 1) scab formation for hemostasis; 2) proliferation and migration of epidermal cells for wound closure; 3) proliferation, migration, and functionalization of fibroblasts and endothelial cells for dermal remodeling. However, this route face remarkable challenges to healing large wounds, usually leading to disordered structures and loss of functions in the regenerated skin, due to limited control on the transition among the three stages. In this work, an implantable bioelectronics is developed that enables the synchronization of the three stages, offering accelerated and high-quality healing of large skin wounds. The system efficiently electro-transfect local cells near the wounds, forcing cellular proliferation, while providing a 3D porous environments for synchronized migration of epidermal and dermal cells. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the system achieved synchronous progression of multiple layers within the wounds, leading to the reconstruction of a complete skin structure similar to healthy skin, which presents a new avenue for the clinical translation of large wound healing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fourier Surfaces Reaching Full&#8208;Color Diffraction Limits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rising demand for transformative optical devices derives the importance of optical Fourier surfaces (OFSs) minimizing optical loss of diffraction. To address the current&#160;challenges of OFSs regarding scalability and full&#8208;color diffraction, an integrative manufacturing strategy is presented for the first realization of scalable and fully transparent OFSs reaching the fundamental diffraction limits at the full&#8208;visible regimes.








Abstract
Optical Fourier surfaces (OFSs), characterized by sinusoidally profiled diffractive optical elements, can outperform traditional binary&#8208;type counterparts by minimizing optical noise through selectively driving diffraction at desired frequencies. While scanning probe lithography (SPL), gray&#8208;scale electron beam lithography (EBL), and holographic inscriptions are effective for fabricating OFSs, achieving full&#8208;color diffractions at fundamental efficiency limits is challenging. Here, an integrated manufacturing process is presented, validated theoretically and experimentally, for fully transparent OFSs reaching the fundamental limit of diffraction efficiency. Leveraging holographic inscriptions and soft nanoimprinting, this approach effectively addresses challenges in conventional OFS manufacturing, enabling scalable production of noise&#8208;free and maximally efficient OFSs with record&#8208;high throughput (1010&#8211;1012 &#181;m2&#160;h&#8722;1), surpassing SPL and EBL by 1010 times. Toward this end, a wafer&#8208;scale OFSs array is demonstrated consisting of full&#8208;color diffractive gratings, color graphics, and microlenses by the one&#8208;step nanoimprinting, which is readily compatible with rapid prototyping of OFSs even on curved panels, demanding for transformative optical devices such as augmented and virtual reality displays.

         <title>Toward Predicting the Formation of Integral&#8208;Asymmetric, Isoporous Diblock Copolymer Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly and nonsolvent&#8208;induced phase separation (SNIPS) of block copolymers and solvents enable the fabrication of integral&#8208;asymmetric, isoporous membranes. Using large&#8208;scale particle simulations, the dependence of the membrane morphology on structural, thermodynamic (e.g., incompatibility between matrix&#8208;forming block and nonsolvent), kinetic (e.g., vitrification threshold), and process parameters (e.g., duration of EISA) is predicted. Examining the top layer and substructure,&#160;the findings are verified through experiment.








Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly and nonsolvent&#8208;induced phase separation (SNIPS) process of block copolymers and solvents enables the fabrication of integral&#8208;asymmetric, isoporous membranes. An isoporous top layer is formed by evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (EISA) and imparts selectivity for ultrafiltration of functional macromolecules or water purification. This selective layer is&#160;supported by a macroporous bottom structure that is formed by nonsolvent&#8208;induced phase separation (NIPS) providing mechanical stability. Thereby the permeability/selectivity tradeoff is optimized. The SNIPS fabrication involves various physical phenomena&#8212;e.g.,&#160;evaporation, self&#8208;assembly, macrophase separation, vitrification &#8211; and multiple structural, thermodynamic, kinetic, and process parameters. Optimizing membrane properties and rationally designing fabrication processes is a challenge which particle simulation can significantly contribute to. Using large&#8208;scale particle simulations, it is observed that 1) a small incompatibility between matrix&#8208;forming block of the copolymer and nonsolvent, 2) a glassy arrest that occurs at a smaller polymer concentration, or 3) a higher dynamical contrast between polymer and solvent results in a finer, spongy substructure, whereas the opposite parameter choice gives rise to larger macropores with an elongated shape. These observations are confirmed by comparison to experiments on polystyrene (PS)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) (P4VP) diblock copolymer membranes, varying the chemical nature of the coagulant or the temperature of coagulation&#160;bath.

         <title>Flexible Single Microwire X&#8208;Ray Detector with Ultrahigh Sensitivity for Portable Radiation Detection System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible X&#8208;ray detector based on a single Ga2O3:In microwire is demonstrated, which exhibits excellent sensitivity and low detection limits. Then, based on this, a portable X&#8208;ray detection system that can detect X&#8208;rays in real&#8208;time is prepared. This work is of great significance for the development of sensitive, stable, and low false alarm rate X&#8208;ray detector.








Abstract
Sensitive, flexible, and low false alarm rate X&#8208;ray detector is crucial for medical diagnosis, industrial inspection, and scientific research. However, most semiconductors for X&#8208;ray detectors are susceptible to interference from ambient light, and their high thickness hinders their application in wearable electronics. Herein, a flexible visible&#8208;blind and ultraviolet&#8208;blind X&#8208;ray detector based on Indium&#8208;doped Gallium oxide (Ga2O3:In) single microwire is prepared. Joint experiment&#8722;theory characterizations reveal that the Ga2O3:In microwire possess a high crystal quality, large band gap, and satisfactory stability, and reliability. On this basis, an extraordinary sensitivity of 5.9&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a low detection limit of 67.4&#160;nGyair&#160;s&#8722;1 are achieved based on the prepared Ag/Ga2O3:In/Ag device, which has outstanding operation stability and excellent high temperature stability. Taking advantage of the flexible properties of the single microwire, a portable X&#8208;ray detection system is demonstrated that shows the potential to adapt to flexible and lightweight formats. The proposed X&#8208;ray detection system enables real&#8208;time monitor for X&#8208;rays, which can be displayed on the user interface. More importantly, it has excellent resistance to natural light interference, showing a low false alarm rate. This work provides a feasible method for exploring high&#8208;performance flexible integrated micro/nano X&#8208;ray detection devices.

         <title>Achieving Super&#8208;Metallophobicity on Silicon&#8208;based Ceramics at High Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Super&#8208;metallophobivity is achieved on silicon&#8208;based ceramics at high temperature by various non&#8208;ferrous molten metals (T&gt; 523&#160;K). The extraordinary property is induced by distinctive thermodynamic and dynamic wetting behavior on micro&#8208;nanostructured surface of Si2N2O, which offers worthy insights for expansive applications such as metallurgy, 3D printing and semiconductor industry and so on.








Abstract
As a critical concept in physical chemistry, superwettability is widely concerned in both fundamental science and practical engineering in past few decades. Despite this, investigation on high temperature superwettability is still a void, which is significant both in scientific and industrial fields. Herein, a ceramic with specific high temperature non&#8208;wetting property, Si2N2O is proposed. Compared with other materials, Si2N2O is elucidated with better practical non&#8208;wetting property against various non&#8208;ferrous metals. Combining with micro&#8208;nanostructures, the metallophobicity is further improved (contact angle &gt;150&#176; and contact angle hysteresis &#8776;0&#176;). The extraordinary metal repellency is defined as &#8220;super&#8208;metallophobicity&#8221;, which is proved to be induced by distinctive thermodynamic and dynamic wetting behavior on the rough surface. The research of super&#8208;metallophobicity not only sheds light on superwettability at high temperature, but also offers worthy insights for future potential material design in a wide range of applications, such as metallurgy, 3D printing and semiconductor industry.

         <title>Blue Laser Triggered Hemostatic Peptide Hydrogel for Gastrointestinal Bleeding Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hemostatic peptide hydrogel (HPH) consists of a self&#8208;assembly peptide (PFV) and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) to induce ultrafast hemostasis. Moreover, HPH can be triggered by blue laser endoscopy (BLE) for nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding treatment.








Abstract
In an emergency, nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB), endoscopic hemostasis is considered the gold standard intervention. However, current endoscopic hemostasis is very challenging to manage bleeding in large&#8208;diameter or deep lesions highly prone to rebleeding risk. Herein, a novel hemostatic peptide hydrogel (HPH) is reported, consisting of a self&#8208;assembly peptide sequence CFLIVIGSIIVPGDGVPGDG (PFV) and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), which can be triggered by blue laser endoscopy (BLE) for nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding treatment without recurring bleeding concerns. Upon contact with GelMA solution, PFV immediately fibrillates into &#946;&#8208;sheet nanofiber and solvent&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly to form HPH gel. HPH nanofiber networks induced ultrafast coagulation by enveloping blood cells and activating platelets and coagulation factors even to the blood with coagulopathy. Besides its remarkable hemostatic performance in artery and liver injury models, HPH achieves instant bleeding management in porcine NVUGIB models within 60&#160;s by preventing the rebleeding risk. This work demonstrates an extraordinary hemostatic agent for NVUGIB intervention by BLE for the first time, broadening potential application scenarios, including patients with coagulopathy and promising clinical prospects.

         <title>3D&#8208;Mapping and Manipulation of Photocurrent in an Optoelectronic Diamond Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrical currents flowing inside diamond are detected in three dimensions using the charge state of nitrogen&#8208;vacancy (NV) defects, which act as a trip&#8208;wire detector for hole current. Time&#8208;resolved imaging and direct measurement of photocurrent is combined with optical engineering of nitrogen impurities to reveal the complex dynamics of charge transport in a wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductor.








Abstract
Establishing connections between material impurities and charge transport properties in emerging electronic and quantum materials, such as wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductors, demands new diagnostic methods tailored to these unique systems. Many such materials host optically&#8208;active defect centers which offer a powerful in situ characterization system, but one that typically relies on the weak spin&#8208;electric field coupling to measure electronic phenomena. In this work, charge&#8208;state sensitive optical microscopy is combined with photoelectric detection of an array of nitrogen&#8208;vacancy (NV) centers to directly image the flow of charge carriers inside a diamond optoelectronic device, in 3D and with temporal resolution. Optical control is used to change the charge state of background impurities inside the diamond on&#8208;demand, resulting in drastically different current flow such as filamentary channels nucleating from specific, defective regions of the device. Conducting channels that control carrier flow, key steps toward optically reconfigurable, wide&#8208;bandgap optoelectronics are then engineered using light. This work might be extended to probe other wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductors (SiC, GaN) relevant to present and emerging electronic and quantum&#160;technologies.

         <title>Impregnate Carbonation: CO2&#8208;Guided In Situ Growth of Robust Superhydrophobic Structures on Concrete Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by concrete carbonation phenomenon, a method for in situ growing superhydrophobic concrete surface is proposed: Concrete is impregnated in Mg2+&#8208;silane solution for carbonation. Mg2+ irregularly segments the morphology of CaCO3, and silane lowers the surface energy. The concrete by impregnate carbonation is divided into a three&#8208;layer structure of superhydrophobic&#8211;hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophilic, providing stable waterproof protection for the hydrophilic matrix.








Abstract
Superhydrophobic surfaces applying on concrete can greatly improve the durability of concrete by preventing the damage from water. However, traditional design of superhydrophobic concrete surfaces by external coating encounters to problems of flaking and poor surface robustness, while that by adding hydrophobic agents or particles faces the challenges of strength damage of concrete. Drawing inspiration from the carbonation phenomenon of concrete, here a new design of in situ growing superhydrophobic structures on concrete is proposed: The concrete sample is impregnated into Mg2+&#8208;containing silane&#8211;water system with continuous CO2 injection. The contact angle of the concrete surface achieves 171.9&#176; without obvious strength decrease after 120 min, which are mainly attributed to the formation of CaxMg1&#8722;xCO3 crystals with micro&#8208;nano&#8208;structures and the reduction of carbonates surface energy by silane. This superhydrophobic concrete structure can be divided into a superhydrophobic&#8211;hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophilic three layers structure, providing the stable water&#8208;proof protection under mechanical fatigue, capillary water absorption, UV aging, sulfate attack, and impurity water impact tests due to the in situ growing robust superhydrophobic structures. Furthermore, it captures 29.80&#160;g&#160;m&#8722;2 CO2 during the reaction process, providing new insights for the design and preparation of eco&#8208;friendly superhydrophobic concrete.

         <title>Direct Observations of Spontaneous In&#8208;Plane Electronic Polarization in 2D Te Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;element tellurium (Te) films are experimentally demonstrated to host an in&#8208;plane spontaneous electronic polarization, evident with reversed band&#8208;bending trends at opposite polarization edges in spatially resolved spectra and conductance mappings. The imaged moir&#233; superlattice can be effectively tuned at the polarization edges. The polarization can survive irrespective of the film thickness and supporting substrates, validating its robustness and universality.








Abstract
Single&#8208;element polarization in low dimensions is fascinating for constructing next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics with multiple functionalities, yet remains difficult to access with satisfactory performance. Here, spectroscopic evidences are presented for the spontaneous electronic polarization in tellurium (Te) films thinned down to bilayer, characterized by low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. The unique chiral structure and centrosymmetry&#8208;breaking character in 2D&#160;Te gives rise to sizable in&#8208;plane polarization with accumulated charges, which is demonstrated by the reversed band&#8208;bending trends at opposite polarization edges in spatially resolved spectra and conductance mappings. The polarity of charges exhibits intriguing influence on imaging the moir&#233; superlattice at the Te&#8208;graphene interface. Moreover, the plain spontaneous polarization robustly exists for various film thicknesses, and can universally preserve against different epitaxial substrates. The experimental validations of considerable electronic polarization in Te multilayers thus provide a realistic platform for promisingly facilitating reliable applications in microelectronic devices.

         <title>Realization of a 2D Lieb Lattice in a Metal&#8211;Inorganic Framework with Partial Flat Bands and Topological Edge States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flat bands, Dirac cones, and van Hove singularities in the Lieb lattice, unveiling a multitude of fascinating physical phenomena, are still highly sought. Here, theoretical analysis with experimental validation is combined to explore an innovative approach circumventing structural instability to realize a 2D Lieb lattice, showcasing its partial flat bands and topological edge states.









Abstract
Flat bands and Dirac cones in materials are the source of the exotic electronic and topological properties. The Lieb lattice is expected to host these electronic structures, arising from quantum destructive interference.

&lt;p&gt;Flat bands, Dirac cones, and van Hove singularities in the Lieb lattice, unveiling a multitude of fascinating physical phenomena, are still highly sought. Here, theoretical analysis with experimental validation is combined to explore an innovative approach circumventing structural instability to realize a 2D Lieb lattice, showcasing its partial flat bands and topological edge states.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flat bands and Dirac cones in materials are the source of the exotic electronic and topological properties. The Lieb lattice is expected to host these electronic structures, arising from quantum destructive interference. Nevertheless, the experimental realization of a 2D Lieb lattice remained challenging to date due to its intrinsic structural instability. After computationally designing a Platinum-Phosphorus (Pt-P) Lieb lattice, it has successfully overcome its structural instability and synthesized on a gold substrate via molecular beam epitaxy. Low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy verify the Lieb lattice's morphology and electronic flat bands. Furthermore, topological Dirac edge states stemming from pronounced spin-orbit coupling induced by heavy Pt atoms are predicted. These findings convincingly open perspectives for creating metal&#8211;inorganic framework-based atomic lattices, offering prospects for strongly correlated phases interplayed with topology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulation of Molecular Microheterogeneity in Electrolytes Enables Ampere&#8208;Hour&#8208;Level Aqueous LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimally regulating molecular microheterogeneity in aqueous&#8208;based electrolytes provides an effective means to reorganize the spatial distribution of H2O molecules, isolating H2O&#8208;rich microclusters. This reorganization significantly impedes H2O activity, enhancing electrochemical stability without compromising rapid transport of Li cations. With this electrolyte design, ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level aqueous LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 pouch cell exhibits high energy density and excellent cycling stability.








Abstract
Aqueous batteries are attractive due to their high safety and fast reaction kinetics, but the narrow electrochemical stability window of H2O limits their applications. It is a big challenge to broaden the electrochemical operation window of aqueous electrolytes while retaining fast reaction kinetics. Here, a new organic aqueous mixture electrolyte of manipulatable (3D)&#160;molecular microheterogeneity with H2O&#8208;rich and H2O&#8208;poor domains is demonstrated. H2O&#8208;poor domains molecularly surround the reformed microclusters of H2O molecules through interfacial H&#8208;bonds, which thus not only inhibit the long&#8208;range transfer of H2O but also allow fast and consecutive Li+ transport. This new design enables low&#8208;voltage anodes reversibly cycling with aqueous&#8208;based electrolytes and high ionic conductivity of 4.5 mS cm&#8722;1. LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 full cells demonstrate excellent cycling stability over 1000 cycles under various C rates and a low temperature of &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. 1 Ah pouch cell delivers a high energy density of 79.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and high Coulombic efficiency of 99.4% at 1 C over 200 cycles. This work provides new insights into the design of electrolytes based on the molecular microheterogeneity for rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Precise Lubrication and Protection of Cartilage Damage by Targeting Hydrogel Microsphere</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antibody&#8208;mediated targeting hydrogel microsphere is developed to specifically and precisely lubricate and protect the local injury site of early&#8208;stage osteoarthritis (OA). The in vivo experiments demonstrate that even with a single small dose injection, this precise lubrication strategy can effectively slow down the progression of early OA and alleviate the associated pain.








Abstract
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative bone and joint disease characterized by decreased cartilage lubrication, leading to continuous wear and ultimately irreversible damage. This situation is particularly challenging for early&#8208;stage OA, as current bio&#8208;lubricants lack precise targeting for small inflammatory lesions. In this work, an antibody&#8208;mediated targeting hydrogel microspheres (HMS) is developed to precisely lubricate the local injury site of cartilage and prevent the progression of early OA. Anti&#8208;Collagen type I (Anti&#8208;Col1) is an antibody that targets cartilage injury sites in early OA stages. It is anchored on a HMS matrix made of Gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) and poly (sulfobetaine methacrylate) (PSBMA) to create targeted HMS (T&#8208;G/S HMS). The T&#8208;G/S HMS's high hydrophilicity, along with the dynamic interaction between its surficial Anti&#8208;Col1 and the Col1 on cartilage injury site, ensures its precise and effective lubrication of early OA lesions. Consequently, injecting T&#8208;G/S HMS into rats with early OA significantly slows disease progression and reduces symptoms. In conclusion, the developed injectable targeted lubricating HMS and the precisely targeted lubrication strategy represent a promising, convenient technique for treating OA, particularly for slowing the early&#8208;stage OA progression.

         <title>Tailoring Polaron Dimensions in Lead&#8208;Tin Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two bottles represent the perovskite lattices of MAPbI3 and MASn0.25Pb0.75I3, respectively. Upon photoexcitation, polarons are generated within the perovskites. The various balls illustrate polarons with different sizes. In MAPbI3, the polaron size is larger, resulting in a significantly limited polaron density. Conversely, in MASn0.25Pb0.75I3, the smaller polaron size facilitates a much higher polaron density.








Abstract
Charge carriers in the soft and polar perovskite lattice form so&#8208;called polaron quasiparticles, charge carriers dressed with a lattice deformation. The spatial extent of a polaron is governed by the material's electron&#8208;phonon interaction strength, which determines charge carrier effective mass, mobility, and the so&#8208;called Mott polaron density, that is, the maximum stable density of charge carriers that a perovskite can support. Despite its significance, controlling polaron dimensions has been challenging. Here, experimental substantial tuning of polaron dimensions is reported by lattice engineering, through Pb/Sn substitution in CH3NH3SnxPb1&#8722;xI3. The polaron dimension is deduced from the Mott polaron density, which can be composition&#8208;tuned over an order of magnitude, while charge carrier mobility occurs through band transport, and remains substantial across all compositions, ranging from 10&#160;s to 100 s&#160;cm2&#160;V s&#8722;1 at room temperature. The effective modulation of polaron size can be understood by considering the bond asymmetry after carrier injection as well as the random spatial distribution of Pb/Sn ions. This study underscores the potential for tailoring polaron dimensions, which is crucial for optimizing applications prioritizing either high charge carrier density or high mobility.

         <title>Inducing One&#8208;Step Dehydrogenation of Magnesium Borohydride via Confinement in Robust Dodecahedral Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon Scaffold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dodecahedral activated N&#8208;doped porous carbon scaffold is synthesized and used for the nanoconfinement of Mg(BH4)2. Precise activation control enables a transformation from microporous carbon materials to mesoporous ones with extremely high specific surface area and pore volume, and hence the efficient nanoconfinement of Mg(BH4)2, realization of one&#8208;step dehydrogenation and superior reversibility.








Abstract
A dodecahedral activated N&#8208;doped porous carbon scaffold is synthesized and used for the nanoconfinement of Mg(BH4)2. The optimized mesoporous scaffold possesses an accumulated pore width of 2.65&#160;nm, high specific surface area (3955.9 m2&#160;g&#8722;1), and large pore volume (2.15 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1), providing ample space for the confinement of Mg(BH4)2 particles and numerous surface active sites for interactions with the same. The confined Mg(BH4)2 system features a dehydrogenation onset temperature of 81.5&#160;&#176;C, an extremely high capacity of 10.2 wt% H2, and an almost single&#8208;step dehydrogenation profile. Moreover, the system exhibits superior capacity retention of 82.7% after 20 cycles at a moderate temperature of 250&#160;&#176;C. Precise activation control enables a transformation from microporous carbon materials to mesoporous ones, and hence the efficient nanoconfinement of Mg(BH4)2 and realization of one&#8208;step dehydrogenation. The evolution of borohydride intermediates is systematically revealed throughout the cycling process. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate defective N heteroatoms within the scaffold are vital in reducing the strength of B&#9472;H bonds, and the N&#8208;doped carbon can facilitate decomposition of the irreversible MgB12H12 intermediate. This study opens up new avenues for designing robust carbon scaffolds doped with heteroatoms and analyzing intermediate evolution in nanoconfined Mg&#8208;based borohydride systems.

Precise activation control enables a transformation from microporous carbon materials to mesoporous ones with extremely high specific surface area and pore volume, and hence the efficient nanoconfinement of Mg(BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, realization of one-step dehydrogenation and superior reversibility.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dodecahedral activated N-doped porous carbon scaffold is synthesized and used for the nanoconfinement of Mg(BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The optimized mesoporous scaffold possesses an accumulated pore width of 2.65&#160;nm, high specific surface area (3955.9 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and large pore volume (2.15 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), providing ample space for the confinement of Mg(BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; particles and numerous surface active sites for interactions with the same. The confined Mg(BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system features a dehydrogenation onset temperature of 81.5&#160;&#176;C, an extremely high capacity of 10.2 wt% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and an almost single-step dehydrogenation profile. Moreover, the system exhibits superior capacity retention of 82.7% after 20 cycles at a moderate temperature of 250&#160;&#176;C. Precise activation control enables a transformation from microporous carbon materials to mesoporous ones, and hence the efficient nanoconfinement of Mg(BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and realization of one-step dehydrogenation. The evolution of borohydride intermediates is systematically revealed throughout the cycling process. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate defective N heteroatoms within the scaffold are vital in reducing the strength of B&#9472;H bonds, and the N-doped carbon can facilitate decomposition of the irreversible MgB&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate. This study opens up new avenues for designing robust carbon scaffolds doped with heteroatoms and analyzing intermediate evolution in nanoconfined Mg-based borohydride systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrostatically Designing Materials and Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>

Assembling polar entities in structures of various shapes promises the design of the electronic properties of materials outside the beaten paths. The current perspective article suggests strategies for the application of such polar layers at hybrid interfaces, in van der Waals heterostructures, in polar metal&#8208;organic frameworks, and in covalent organic frameworks comprising pores decorated with polar groups.








Abstract
Collective electrostatic effects arise from the superposition of electrostatic potentials of periodically arranged (di)polar entities and are known to crucially impact the electronic structures of hybrid interfaces. Here, it is discussed, how they can be used outside the beaten paths of materials design for realizing systems with advanced and sometimes unprecedented properties. The versatility of the approach is demonstrated by applying electrostatic design not only to metal&#8208;organic interfaces and adsorbed (complex) monolayers, but also to inter&#8208;layer interfaces in van der Waals heterostructures, to polar metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), and to the cylindrical pores of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The presented design ideas are straightforward to simulate and especially for metal&#8208;organic interfaces also their experimental implementation has been amply demonstrated. For van der Waals heterostructures, the needed building blocks are available, while the required assembly approaches are just being developed. Conversely, for MOFs the necessary growth techniques exist, but more work on advanced linker molecules is required. Finally, COF structures exist that contain pores decorated with polar groups, but the electrostatic impact of these groups has been largely ignored so far. All this suggest that the dawn of the age of electrostatic design is currently experienced with potential breakthroughs lying ahead.

         <title>Intelligent Supramolecular Modification for Implants: Endogenous Regulation of Bone Defect Repair in Osteoporosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intelligent supramolecular modified implant surface suitable for bone defect repair under iron&#8208;overloaded osteoporosis. This intelligent surface modification tailors bone repair to individual conditions, automatically realize multiple endogenous regulation once implanted, and truly realize spontaneous activation of a series of responses conducive to bone repair in vivo. It providing new ideas for the refinement and specialized modification of the implant surface.








Abstract
Addressing osteoporosis&#8208;related bone defects, a supramolecular strategy is innovated for modifying carbon fiber reinforced polyether ether ketone (CF/PEEK) composites. By covalently attaching intelligent macromolecules via in situ RAFT polymerization, leveraging the unique pathological microenvironment in patients with iron&#8208;overloaded osteoporosis, intelligent supramolecular modified implant surface possesses multiple endogenous modulation capabilities. After implantation, surface brush&#8208;like macromolecules initially resist macrophage adhesion, thereby reducing the level of immune inflammation. Over time, the molecular chains undergo conformational changes due to Fe (III) mediated supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, transforming into mechanistic signals. These signals are then specifically transmitted to pre&#8208;osteoblast cell through the binding capacity of the KRSR short peptide at the molecular terminus, induced their osteogenic differentiation via the YAP/&#946;&#8208;catenin signaling axis. Furthermore, osteoblasts secrete alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which significantly hydrolyzes phosphate ester bonds in surface macromolecular side groups, resulting in the release of alendronate (ALN). This process further improves the local osteoporotic microenvironment. This intelligent surface modification tailors bone repair to individual conditions, automatically realize multiple endogenous regulation once implanted, and truly realize spontaneous activation of a series of responses conducive to bone repair in vivo. It is evidenced by improved bone regeneration in iron&#8208;overloaded osteoporotic rabbits and supported by in vitro validations.

         <title>Flexible Terahertz Metasurface Absorbers Empowered by Bound States in the Continuum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study connects absorbers with bound states in the continuum by systematically exploring radiation properties from a perspective of lattice symmetry. A flexible terahertz absorber is demonstrated with stable and high absorption coefficient covering a large field of view, with tunable bandwidth, and multiband absorption. It would provide valuable insights for terahertz applications in communications, detection, sensing, and imaging.








Abstract
Terahertz absorbers are crucial to the cutting&#8208;edge techniques in the next&#8208;generation wireless communications, imaging, sensing, and radar stealth, as they fundamentally determine the performance of detectors and cloaking capabilities. It has long been a pressing task to find absorbers with customizable performance that can adapt to various environments with low cost and great flexibility. Here, perfect absorption empowered by bound states in the continuum (BICs)&#160;is demonstrated,&#160;allowing for the tailoring of absorption coefficient, bandwidth, and field of view. The one&#8208;port absorbers are interpreted using temporal coupled&#8208;mode theory highlighting the dominant role of BICs in the far&#8208;field radiation properties. Through a thorough investigation of BICs from the perspective of lattice symmetry, the radiation features of three BIC modes are unraveled using both multipolar and topological analysis. The versatile radiation capabilities of BICs provide ample freedom to meet specific requirements of absorbers, including tunable bandwidth, stable performance in a large field of view, and multiband absorption using a thin and flexible film without extreme geometric demands. These findings offer a systematic approach to developing optoelectronic devices and demonstrate the significant potential of BICs for optical and photonic applications, which will stimulate further studies on terahertz photonics and metasurfaces.

         <title>Efficient Generation of Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Polarized Spin Current in Polycrystalline Heavy Metal Devices with Broken Electric Symmetries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Z&#8208;spin current has the potential to enable energy&#8208;efficient switching of perpendicular magnetization in the absence of a magnetic field. The work by Lijun Zhu and co&#8208;workers reports the first universal, energy&#8208;efficient, integration&#8208;friendly approach to generate z&#8208;spin current by electric asymmetry design for dense and low&#8208;power spin&#8211;torque memory and computing technologies.








Abstract
Spin currents of perpendicularly polarized spins (z spins) have received blooming interest for the potential in energy&#8208;efficient spin&#8211;orbit torque switching of perpendicular magnetization in the absence of a magnetic field. However, generation of z spins is limited mainly to magnetically or crystallographically low&#8208;symmetry single crystals that are hardly compatible with the integration to semiconductor circuits. This work reports efficient generation of z spins in sputter&#8208;deposited polycrystalline heavy metal devices via a new mechanism of broken electric symmetries in both the transverse and perpendicular directions. Both the damping&#8208;like and field&#8208;like spin&#8211;orbit torques of z spins can be tuned significantly by varying the degree of the electric asymmetries via the length, width, and thickness of devices as well as by varying the type of the heavy metals. The presence of z spins also enables deterministic, nearly&#8208;full, external&#8208;magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;free switching of a uniform perpendicularly magnetized FeCoB layer, the core structure of magnetic tunnel junctions, with high coercivity at a low current density. These results establish the first universal, energy&#8208;efficient, integration&#8208;friendly approach to generate z&#8208;spin current by electric asymmetry design for dense and low&#8208;power spin&#8208;torque memory and computing technologies and will stimulate investigation of z&#8208;spin currents in various polycrystalline materials.

         <title>Edible Ultralong Organic Phosphorescent Excipient for Afterglow Visualizing the Quality of Tablets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An edible excipient with intrinsically multistimuli responsive ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) property is developed to achieve nondestructive detection of hardness with superb contrast (signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio up to 120) and moisture with improved sensitivity (5.0 times to conventional fluorescence) of drug tablets. The naked&#8208;eye visible UOP shows promise in both promoting continuous smart manufacturing and safe medicine for patients.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) materials that in response to external factors such as light, heat, and atmosphere have raised a tremendous research interest in fields of optoelectronics, anticounterfeiting labeling, biosensing, and bioimaging. However, for practical applications in life and health fields, some fundamental requirements such as biocompatibility and biodegradability are still challenging for conventional inorganic and aromatic&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive UOP systems. Herein, an edible excipient, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (SCC), of which UOP properties exhibit intrinsically multistimuli responses to excited wavelength, pressure, and moisture, is reported. Impressively, as a UOP probe, SCC enables nondestructive detection of hardness with superb contrast (signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio up to 120), while exhibiting a response sensitivity to moisture that is more than 5.0 times higher than that observed in conventional fluorescence. Additionally, its applicability for hardness monitoring and high&#8208;moisture warning for tablets containing a moisture&#8208;sensitive drug, with the quality of the drug being determinable through the naked&#8208;eye visible UOP, is demonstrated. This work not only elucidates the reason for stimulative corresponding properties in SCC but also makes a major step forward in extending the potential applications of stimuli&#8208;responsive UOP materials in manufacturing high&#8208;quality and safe medicine.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Intrinsically Stretchable Organic Photovoltaics Enabled by Robust Silver Nanowires/S&#8208;PH1000 Hybrid Transparent Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, superior stretchable transparent electrodes (STEs) that possess both high conductivity and stretchability are developed. The STEs enable intrinsically stretchable organic photovoltaics (is&#8208;OPVs) a remarkable PCE of 16.32% and commendable stretchability. Additionally, OPVs equipped with these STEs exhibit superior thermal stability compared to those using indium tin oxide electrode.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic photovoltaics (is&#8208;OPVs) hold significant promise for integration into self&#8208;powered wearable electronics. However, their potential is hindered by the lack of sufficient consistency between optoelectronic and mechanical properties. This is primarily due to the limited availability of stretchable transparent electrodes (STEs) that possess both high conductivity and stretchability. Here, a hybrid STE with exceptional conductivity, stretchability, and thermal stability is presented. Specifically, STEs are composed of the modified PH1000 (referred to as S&#8208;PH1000) and silver nanowires (AgNWs). The S&#8208;PH1000 endows the STE with good stretchability and smoothens the surface, while the AgNWs enhance the charge transport. The resulting hybrid STEs enable is&#8208;OPVs to a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.32%, positioning them among the top&#8208;performing is&#8208;OPVs. With 10% elastomer, the devices retain 82% of the initial PCE after 500 cycles at 20% strain. Additionally, OPVs equipped with these STEs exhibit superior thermal stability compared to those using indium tin oxide electrodes, maintaining 75% of the initial PCE after annealing at 85&#160;&#176;C for 390 h. The findings underscore the suitability of the designed hybrid electrodes for efficient and stable is&#8208;OPVs, offering a promising avenue for the future application of OPVs.

PVDF@PEI core&#8211;shell nanofibers are developed via symmetry&#8208;breaking design for efficient radiative cooling. The membranes show high thermal stability, hydrophobicity, UV protection, fluorescence enhancement, and breathability, enabling 8&#160;&#176;C daytime cooling. This innovation advances wearables and multifunctional materials research.








Abstract
Radiative cooling technology, which is renowned for its ability to dissipate heat without energy consumption, has garnered immense interest. However, achieving high performance, multifunctionality, and smart integration while addressing challenges such as film thickness and enhancing anisotropic light reflection remains challenging. In this study, a core&#8211;shell composite nanofiber, PVDF@PEI, is introduced and designed primarily from a symmetry&#8208;breaking perspective to develop highly efficient radiative cooling materials. Using a combination of solvent&#8208;induced phase separation (EIPS) inverse spinning and (aggregation) self&#8208;assembly methods (EISA or EIAA) and coaxial electrostatic spinning (ES), superconformal surface anisotropic porous nanofiber membranes are fabricated. These membranes exhibit exceptional thermal stability (up to 210&#160;&#176;C), high hydrophobicity (contact angle of 126&#176;), robust UV protection (exceeding 99%), a fluorescence multiplication effect (with a 0.6% increase in fluorescence quantum efficiency), and good breathability. These properties enable the material to excel in a wide range of application scenarios. Moreover, this material achieved a remarkable daytime cooling temperature of 8&#160;&#176;C. The development of this fiber membrane offers significant advancements in the field of wearables and the multifunctionality of materials, paving new paths for future research and innovation.

         <title>Crystalline Texture Reengineering of Zinc Powder&#8208;Based Fibrous Anode for Remarkable Mechano&#8208;Electrochemical Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wet&#8208;spinning technique is utilized to fabricate Zn@CNTs fiber for anode of fibrous Zn&#8208;ion battery with remarkable electrochemical performance after textural reengineering via thermal treatment. Fibrous Zn&#8208;ion battery equipped with derived fiber anode showcase exceptional chemical stability and fatigue resistance after long&#8208;term fibrous battery deformation.








Abstract
The challenge of inadequate mechano&#8208;electrochemical stability in rechargeable fibrous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (FZIBs) has emerged as a critical challenge for their broad applications. Traditional rigid Zn wires struggle to maintain a stable electrochemical interface when subjected to external mechanical stress. To address this issue, a wet&#8208;spinning technique has been developed to fabricate Zn powder based fibrous anode, while carbon nanotubes (CNTs) introduced to enhance the spinnability of Zn powder dispersion. The followed annealing treatment has been conducted to reengineer the Zn crystalline texture with CNTs assisted surface tension regulation to redirect (002) crystallographic textural formation. The thus&#8208;derived annealed Zn@CNTs fiber demonstrates great mechano&#8208;electrochemical stability after a long&#8208;term bending and electrochemical process. The fabricated FZIB demonstrates a remarkable durability, surpassing 800&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, with a marginal voltage hysteresis increase of 21.7&#160;mV even after 100 twisting cycles under 180 degree twisting angle. The assembled FZIB full cell displays an 88.6% capacity retention even after a long cycle of a series of bending, knotting, and straightening deformation. It has been also woven into a 200&#160;cm2 size textile to demonstrate its capability to integrate into smart textiles.

Abstract
Hematological malignancies (HM) like acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are often intractable. Cancer vaccines possibly inducing robust and broad anti&#8208;tumor immune responses may be a promising treatment option for HM. Few effective vaccines against blood cancers are, however, developed to date partly owing to insufficient stimulation of dendritic cells (DCs) in the body and lacking appropriate tumor antigens (Ags). Here it is found that systemic multifunctional nanovaccines consisting of nucleotide&#8208;binding oligomerization domain&#8208;containing protein 2 (NOD2) and Toll&#8208;like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonists &#8211; muramyl dipeptide (MDP) and CpG, and tumor cell lysate (TCL) as Ags (MCA&#8208;NV) induce potent and broad immunity against AML. MCA&#8208;NV show complementary stimulation of DCs and prime homing to lymphoid organs following systemic administration. Of note, in orthotopic AML mouse models, intravenous infusion of different vaccine formulations elicits substantially higher anti&#8208;AML efficacies than subcutaneous administration. Systemic MCA&#8208;NV cure 78% of AML mice and elicit long&#8208;term immune memory with 100% protection from rechallenging AML cells. Systemic MCA&#8208;NV can also serve as prophylactic vaccines against the same AML. These systemic nanovaccines utilizing patient TCL as Ags and dual adjuvants to elicit strong, durable, and broad immune responses can provide a personalized immunotherapeutic strategy against AML and other HM.

         <title>Above&#8208;Room&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectricity and Giant Second Harmonic Generation in 1D vdW NbOI3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1D vdW ferroelectric NbOI3 nanowires possess a high Curie temperature TC&#160;&gt; &#160;450&#160;K. Impressively, NbOI3 exhibits a giant second harmonic generation (SHG) effect with a susceptibility up to 1572&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1 at 810&#160;nm, and a further enhanced SHG susceptibility of 5582&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1 under the pressure of 2.06&#160;GPa.








Abstract
The realization of spontaneous ferroelectricity down to the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) limit is both fundamentally intriguing and practically appealing for high&#8208;density ferroelectric and nonlinear photonics. However, the 1D vdW ferroelectric materials are not discovered experimentally yet. Here, the first 1D vdW ferroelectric compound NbOI3 with a high Curie temperature TC&#160;&gt;&#160;450&#160;K and giant second harmonic generation (SHG) is reported. The 1D crystalline chain structure of the NbOI3 is revealed by cryo&#8208;electron microscopy, whereas the 1D ferroelectric order originated from the Nb displacement along the Nb&#8208;O chain (b&#8208;axis) is confirmed via obvious electrical and ferroelectric hysteresis loops. Impressively, NbOI3 exhibits a giant SHG susceptibility up to 1572&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1 at a fundamental wavelength of 810&#160;nm, and a further enhanced SHG susceptibility of 5582&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1 under the applied hydrostatic pressure of 2.06&#160;GPa. Combing in situ pressure&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectra measurements, and first&#8208;principles calculations, it is demonstrated that the O atoms shift along the Nb&#9472;O atomic chain under compression, which can lead to the increased Baur distortion of [NbO2I4] octahedra, and hence induces the enhancement of SHG. This work provides a 1D vdW ferroelectric system for developing novel ferroelectronic and photonic devices.

         <title>Water&#8208;Enhancing Gels Exhibiting Heat&#8208;Activated Formation of Silica Aerogels for Protection of Critical Infrastructure During Catastrophic Wildfire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic polymer&#8208;particle hydrogels are developed as sprayable water&#8208;enhancing hydrogels that transition into thermally insulative silica aerogels upon heat activation. These hydrogels exhibit superior viscoelastic properties, strong substrate adherence, and dramatically enhanced fire protection compared to commercial gels. This innovation significantly advances water&#8208;enhancing hydrogels, offering robust protection for critical infrastructure and homes during wildfires, thereby markedly improving wildfire prevention and mitigation strategies.








Abstract
A promising strategy to address the pressing challenges with wildfire, particularly in the wildland&#8208;urban interface (WUI), involves developing new approaches for preventing and controlling wildfire within wildlands. Among sprayable fire&#8208;retardant materials, water&#8208;enhancing gels have emerged as exceptionally effective for protecting civil infrastructure. They possess favorable wetting and viscoelastic properties that reduce the likelihood of ignition, maintaining strong adherence to a wide array of surfaces after application. Although current water&#8208;enhancing hydrogels effectively maintain surface wetness by creating a barricade, they rapidly desiccate and lose efficacy under high heat and wind typical of wildfire conditions. To address this limitation, unique biomimetic hydrogel materials from sustainable cellulosic polymers crosslinked by colloidal silica particles are developed that exhibit ideal viscoelastic properties and facile manufacturing. Under heat activation, the hydrogel transitions into a highly porous and thermally insulative silica aerogel coating in situ, providing a robust protective layer against ignition of substrates, even when the hydrogel fire suppressant becomes completely desiccated. By confirming the mechanical properties, substrate adherence, and enhanced substrate protection against fire, these heat&#8208;activatable biomimetic hydrogels emerge as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation water&#8208;enhancing fire suppressants. These advancements have the potential to dramatically improve the ability to protect homes and critical infrastructure during wildfire.

         <title>Synthesis of Heteromorphic Bi2WO6 Films With an Interpenetrate 1D/2D Network Structure for Efficient and Stable Photocatalytic Degradation of VOCs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Bi2WO6 (BWO) film with a network structure of 2D (NSs) penetrated with 1D nanofibers (NFs) is reported. BWO NSs can grow radially in an orderly spaced arrangement along BWO NFs during sintering, thereby forming 1D/2D BWO junctions like eucalyptus leaves, which can rapidly degrade acetaldehyde under visible light and shows superior stability for eight cycles without any decays.








Abstract
2D layered Bi2WO6 (BWO) is a widely used attractive photocatalyst for degrading VOCs, but the low visible&#8208;light utilization and the easy stacking 2D nanosheets&#160;(NSs) limit photocatalysis efficiency and stability. Here, inspired by Eucalyptus, a synergistic strategy of multiscale domain&#8208;confinement and electrostatic force action, based on electrospinning is proposed, for fabricating a heteromorphic BWO photocatalyst. It is found that BWO NSs can grow radially in an orderly spaced arrangement along BWO nanofibers (NFs) during sintering, thereby forming 1D/2D BWO junctions like eucalyptus leaves. This interpenetrating 1D/2D network structure not only solves the easy stacking problem of BWO NSs but also selectively exposes the {010} crystal planes that exhibit efficient hole oxidation. In addition, this peculiar structure enriches electrons at the 1D/2D interface to avoid carrier recombination, thus improving the photocatalytic activity. The photocatalyst material with a reduced bandgap width from 2.56 to 2.49&#160;eV can rapidly degrade 100% of acetaldehyde under visible light without using sacrificial agents and photosensitizers and shows superior stability for eight cycles without any decay. This study provides a feasible method to synthesize an efficient and stable BWO photocatalyst.

         <title>Porous Polymeric Electrodes for Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Capture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active porous polymeric electrodes (PPEs) are developed with promoted advective gas transport and enhanced gas&#8208;electrolyte contact adsorption area in a flow&#8208;through mode for high&#8208;efficiency carbon dioxide capture. This strategy offers new possibilities for manufacturing scalable and cost&#8208;effective electrodes and is anticipated to be transferable to general electrochemically mediated separation technologies.








Abstract
Carbon capture is a promising technology to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions to achieve net carbon neutrality. Electro&#8208;swing reactive adsorption has emerged as an attractive approach for sustainable decarbonization.

&lt;p&gt;Redox-active porous polymeric electrodes (PPEs) are developed with promoted advective gas transport and enhanced gas-electrolyte contact adsorption area in a flow-through mode for high-efficiency carbon dioxide capture. This strategy offers new possibilities for manufacturing scalable and cost-effective electrodes and is anticipated to be transferable to general electrochemically mediated separation technologies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon capture is a promising technology to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions to achieve net carbon neutrality. Electro-swing reactive adsorption has emerged as an attractive approach for sustainable decarbonization. However, current electrodes with limited gas transport present a major barrier that hinders their practical implementation. Herein, porous polymeric electrodes are developed to effectively enhance CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transport without the need for additional gas diffusion conduits. Such all-in-one porous electrodes also enable more accessible redox active sites (e.g., quinones) for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sorption, leading to an increased materials utilization efficiency of &#8776;90%. A continuous flow-through carbon capture and release operation with high Faradaic efficiency and excellent stability under practical working conditions is further demonstrated. Together with low cost and robust mechanical properties, the as-developed porous polymeric electrodes highlight the potential to advance the future implementation of electrochemical separation technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stiffness and Interface Engineered Soft Electronics with Large&#8208;Scale Robust Deformability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By simultaneously regulating stiffness and enhancing interfacial binding force, this work provides an efficient path to realize robust large&#8208;scale deformable electronic skins. Stiff and elastic areas of the designed substrate have nearly four orders of magnitudes modulus contrast and cross&#8208;linked interfaces. Electronic devices and liquid metal interconnects are conformally attached at the stiff and elastic areas, respectively, through hydrogen bonds.








Abstract
Skin&#8208;like stretchable electronics emerge as promising human&#8211;machine interfaces but are challenged by the paradox between superior electronic property and reliable mechanical deformability. Here, a general strategy is reported for establishing robust large&#8208;scale deformable electronics by effectively isolating strains and strengthening interfaces. A copolymer substrate is designed to consist of mosaic stiff and elastic areas with nearly four orders of magnitudes modulus contrast and cross&#8208;linked interfaces. Electronic functional devices and stretchable liquid metal (LM) interconnects are conformally attached at the stiff and elastic areas, respectively, through hydrogen bonds. As a result, functional devices are completely isolated from strains, and resistances of LM conductors change by less than one time when the substrate is deformed by up to 550%. By this strategy, solar cells, wireless charging antenna, supercapacitors, and light&#8208;emitting diodes are integrated into a self&#8208;powered electronic skin that can laminate on the human body and exhibit stable performances during repeated multimode deformations, demonstrating an efficient path for realizing highly deformable energy autonomous soft electronics.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II&#8208;Responsive Hybrid System Achieves Cascade&#8208;Augmented Antitumor Immunity via Genetic Engineering of Both Bacteria and Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) light&#8208;responsive genetic engineering of both bacteria and tumor cells is achieved by a hybrid therapeutic platform consisting of genetically engineered bacteria and photothermal nanoparticles for tumor&#8208;targeted and augmented immunotherapy of melanoma. A synergistic antitumor effect is achieved during the process of antioncogene transfection and NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;activated expression of the therapeutic immunomodulator.








Abstract
The combination of nanoparticles and tumor&#8208;targeting bacteria for cancer immunotherapy can overcome the shortcomings of poor nanoparticle accumulation, limited penetration, and restricted distribution. However, it remains a great challenge for the hybrid system to improve therapeutic efficacy through the simultaneous and controllable regulation of immune cells and tumor cells. Herein, a hybrid therapeutic platform is rationally designed to achieve immune cascade&#8208;augmented cancer immunotherapy. To construct the hybrids, photothermal nanoparticles responsive to light in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region are conjugated onto the surface of engineered bacteria through pH&#8208;responsive Schiff base bonds. Taking advantage of the hypoxia targeting and deep penetration characteristics of the bacteria, the hybrids can accumulate at tumor sites. Then nanoparticles detach from the bacteria to realize genetic engineering of tumor cells, which induces tumor cell apoptosis and down&#8208;regulate the expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 to alleviate immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The mild photothermal heating can not only induce tumor&#8208;associated antigen release, but also trigger sustainable expression of cytokine interleukin&#8208;2. Notably, a synergistic antitumor effect is achieved between the process of p53 transfection and NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;activated genetic engineering of bacteria. This work proposes a facile strategy for the construction of hybrid system to achieve cascade&#8208;augmented cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Photothermal Catalytic Reduction and Bone Tissue Engineering Towards a Three&#8208;in&#8208;One Therapy Strategy for Osteosarcoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;function 3D&#8208;printed bioscaffold equipped with CMB nanowheel crystals (CMB@BG) is designed and engineered for the comprehensive treatment of osteosarcoma. Due to their photothermally enhanced ROS&#8208;scavenging capacity, CMB@BG scaffolds exhibit exceptional NIR&#8208;II photothermal&#8208;conversion efficiency, osteogenic induction activity, and anti&#8208;inflammatory capabilities. Therefore, they are regarded as an ideal therapeutic strategy that balances clearance, protection, and repair for osteosarcoma.








Abstract
Osteosarcoma is one of the most dreadful bone neoplasms in young people, necessitating the development of innovative therapies that can effectively eliminate tumors while minimizing damage to limb function. An ideal therapeutic strategy should possess three essential capabilities: antitumor effects, tissue&#8208;protective properties, and the ability to enhance osteogenesis. In this study, self&#8208;assembled Ce&#8208;substituted molybdenum blue (CMB) nanowheel crystals are synthesized and loaded onto 3D&#8208;printed bioactive glass (CMB@BG) scaffolds to develop a unique three&#8208;in&#8208;one treatment approach for osteosarcoma. The CMB@BG scaffolds exhibit outstanding photothermally derived tumor ablation within the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II window due to the surface plasmon resonance properties of the CMB nanowheel crystals. Furthermore, the photothermally synergistic catalytic effect of CMB promotes the rapid scavenging of reactive oxygen species caused by excessive heat, thereby suppressing inflammation and protecting surrounding tissues. The CMB@BG scaffolds possess pro&#8208;proliferation and pro&#8208;differentiation capabilities that efficiently accelerate bone regeneration within bone defects. Altogether, the CMB@BG scaffolds that combine highly efficient tumor ablation, tissue protection based on anti&#8208;inflammatory mechanisms, and enhanced osteogenic ability are likely to be a point&#8208;to&#8208;point solution for the comprehensive therapeutic needs of osteosarcoma.

         <title>An Efficient Trifunctional Spinel&#8208;Based Electrode for Oxygen Reduction/Evolution Reactions and Nonoxidative Ethane Dehydrogenation on Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here a novel spinel&#8208;based composite of Mn0.9Cs0.1Co2O4&#8208;&#948; (MCCO)&#8208;Co3O4 (CO) (MCCO&#8208;CO, 8:2 in mass ratio) oxide is reported as a trifunctional electrode for electricity generation and ethylene electro&#8208;production on protonic ceramic electrochemical cells.








Abstract
Protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) have received considerable attention as they can directly generate electricity and/or produce chemicals. Development of the electrodes with the trifunctionalities of oxygen reduction/evolution and nonoxidative ethane dehydrogenation is yet challenging. Here these findings are reported in the design of trifunctional electrodes for PCECs with a detailed composition of Mn0.9Cs0.1Co2O4&#8208;&#948; (MCCO) and Co3O4 (CO) (MCCO&#8211;CO, 8:2 mass ratio). At 600&#160;&#176;C, the MCCO&#8211;CO electrode exhibits a low area&#8208;specific resistance of 0.382 &#937; cm2 and reasonable stability for &#8776;105&#160;h with no obvious degradation. The single cell with the MCCO&#8211;CO electrode shows an encouraging peak power density of 1.73&#160;W cm&#8722;2 in the fuel cell (FC) mode and a current density of &#8208;3.93 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.3&#160;V in the electrolysis cell (EC) mode at 700&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the MCCO&#8211;CO cell displays promising operational stability in FC mode (223&#160;h), EC mode (209&#160;h), and reversible cycling stability (52 cycles, 208&#160;h) at 650&#160;&#176;C. The MCCO&#8211;CO single cell shows an encouraging ethane&#160;conversion to ethylene (with a conversion of 40.3% and selectivity of 94%) and excellent H2 production rates of 4.65&#160;mL min&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at 1.5&#160;V and 700&#160;&#176;C, respectively, with reasonable Faradaic efficiencies.

Moreover, the MCCO&#8211;CO cell displays promising operational stability in FC mode (223&#160;h), EC mode (209&#160;h), and reversible cycling stability (52 cycles, 208&#160;h) at 650&#160;&#176;C. The MCCO&#8211;CO single cell shows an encouraging ethane&#160;conversion to ethylene (with a conversion of 40.3% and selectivity of 94%) and excellent H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rates of 4.65&#160;mL min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.5&#160;V and 700&#160;&#176;C, respectively, with reasonable Faradaic efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enriched Oxygen Coverage Localized within Ir Atomic Grids for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>

Atomic grid structure with high&#8208;density Ir sites (&#8776;10 atoms per nm2) on MnO2&#8211;x support realizes co&#8208;catalytic Ir&#8211;Mn interaction in water oxidation process, involving enriched oxygen coverage driven by Mn&#8208;Ov coordination defects to cooperate with highly electrophilic Ir&#8211;O(II&#8208;&#948;)&#8722; species, which facilitates intensive O&#8211;O radical direct coupling within the grids for performance enhancement.








Abstract
Inefficient active site utilization of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts have limited the energy efficiency of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Here, an atomic grid structure is demonstrated composed of high&#8208;density Ir sites (&#8776;10&#160;atoms per nm2) on reactive MnO2&#8211;x support which mediates oxygen coverage&#8208;enhanced OER process. Experimental characterizations verify the low&#8208;valent Mn species with decreased oxygen coordination in MnO2&#8211;x exert a pivotal impact in the enriched oxygen coverage on the surface during OER process, and the distributed Ir atomic grids, where highly electrophilic Ir&#9472;O(II&#8208;&#948;)&#8722; bonds proceed rapidly, render intense nucleophilic attack of oxygen radicals. Thereby, this metal&#8208;support cooperation achieves ultra&#8208;low overpotentials of 166&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 283&#160;mV at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, together with a striking mass activity which is 380 times higher than commercial IrO2 at 1.53&#160;V. Moreover, its high OER performance also markedly surpasses the commercial Ir black catalyst in PEM electrolyzers with long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Bio&#8208;inspired Mechanically Responsive Smart Windows for Visible and Near&#8208;Infrared Multiwavelength Spectral Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A feasible layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly strategy is proposed toward large&#8208;area fabricating mechanically responsive film for VIS and NIR multiwavelength spectral modulation smart windows. The excellent mechanical and optical cycling stability of the composite film provide a favorable basis for their practical applications. Furthermore, these spectral selective and dynamic smart windows will provide suitable solutions for the decarbonization of buildings.








Abstract
Mechanochromic light control technology that can dynamically regulate solar irradiation is recognized as one of the leading candidates for energy&#8208;saving windows. However, the lack of spectrally selective modulation ability still hinders its application for different scenarios or individual needs. Here, inspired by the generation of structure color and color change of living organisms, a simple layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly approach toward large&#8208;area fabricating mechanically responsive film for visible and near&#8208;infrared multiwavelength spectral modulation smart windows is reported here. The assembled SiO2 nanoparticles&#160;and W18O49 nanowires enable the film with an optical modulation rate of up to 42.4% at the wavelength of 550&#160;nm and 18.4% for the near&#8208;infrared region, separately, and the typical composite film under 50% stretching shows &#8776;41.6% modulation rate at the wavelength of 550&#160;nm with NIR modulation rate less than 2.7%. More importantly, the introduction of the multilayer assembly structure not only optimizes the film's optical modulation but also enables the film with high stability during 100&#160;000 stretching cycles. A cooling effect of 21.3 and 6.9 &#176;C for the blackbody and air inside a model house in the real environmental application is achieved. This approach provides theoretical and technical support for the new mechanochromic energy&#8208;saving windows.

         <title>Multifunctional Metamaterial with Reconfigurable Electromagnetic Scattering Properties for Advanced Stealth and Adaptive Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bistable condition of the curved beam and design is studied with wave&#8208;absorbing metamaterials. So it has the bistable characteristic and the ability to absorb bandwidth switching. The absorbing mechanism is explained through the macroscopic and microscopic levels. The adjustable form is enriched with digital coding and applied to the satellite configuration to realize the reconstruction function of electromagnetic scattering properties.








Abstract
The rapid development of radar detection systems has led to an increased sensitivity to the electromagnetic (EM) scattering properties of detected targets. Flexible and adaptable EM scattering properties significantly enhance the survivability of battlefield weapons. This paper presents the design of a novel multifunctional metamaterial with reconfigurable EM scattering properties based on a bistable curved beam. In addition to the cushioning and energy absorption properties of curved beams, the metamaterial achieves more than 90% EM absorption in the frequency range of 2.17&#8211;17.31&#160;GHz, with a relative thickness of only 0.09&#955;L. The bistable nature of the metamaterial allows it to switch between different states. Moreover, combined with the digital coding, this metamaterial can continuously adjust the absorbing bandwidth and further enhance the EM absorption rate within a specific frequency band range. If applied to satellite configurations, the developed metamaterial significantly reduces the radar cross section and offers potential applications in reconfiguring EM scattering properties, when applied to satellite configurations. By actively controller and reconstructing the EM scattering properties at certain frequency points, the metamaterial can achieve camouflage, providing innovative solutions for future stealth technology, electronic countermeasures, and deception jamming in radar detection.

         <title>Water&#8208;Templated Growth of Interfacial Superglue Polymers for Tunable Thin Films and In Situ Fluid Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
WRAPPINGS is an eco&#8208;friendly concept that delivers thin poly(cyanoacrylate) films with precisely engineered properties. Exposing a water surface containing cationic surfactants to superglue vapors results in a film with tailored thickness, shape, and color. Using drops and bubbles as templates for film growth, the in situ packaging of chemical and biological liquid cargos and the encapsulation of gases is demonstrated.








Abstract
Thin polymer films (TPFs) are indispensable elements in numerous technologies ranging from liquid encapsulation to biotechnology to electronics. However, their production typically relies on wet chemistry involving organic solvents or chemical vapor deposition, necessitating elaborate equipment and often harsh conditions. Here, an eco&#8208;friendly, fast, and facile synthesis of water&#8208;templated interfacial polymers based on cyanoacrylates (superglues, CAs) that yield thin films with tailored properties is demonstrated. Specifically, by exposing a cationic surfactant&#8208;laden water surface to cyanoacrylate vapors, surfactant&#8208;modulated anionic polymerization produces a manipulable thin polymer film with a thickness growth rate of 8&#160;nm&#160;min&#8722;1. Furthermore, the shape and color of the film are precisely controlled by the polymerization kinetics, wetting conditions, and/or exposure to patterned light. Using various interfaces as templates for film growth, including the free surface of drops and soap bubbles, the developed method advantageously enables in situ packaging of chemical and biological cargos in liquid phase as well as the encapsulation of gases within solidified bubbles. Simple, versatile, and biocompatible, this technology constitutes a potent platform for programmable coating and soft/smart encapsulation of fluids.

         <title>Uncovering the Intrinsic High Fracture Toughness of Titanium via Lowered Oxygen Impurity Content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here it is revealed that the low&#8208;oxygen titanium (Ti) has an intrinsic fracture toughness of 255 MPa m1/2. The low oxygen concentration promotes deformation twinning, and the numerous twin boundaries further stimulate the &#12296;c+a&#12297; slip at the crack tip. The operation of these two &#12296;c&#12297;&#8208;axis deformation modes enhances the uniform deformation abilities, resulting in a remarkable leap in fracture resistance of Ti.








Abstract
Titanium (Ti) and its alloys are known to exhibit room&#8208;temperature fracture toughness below 130 MPa m1/2, only about one half of the best austenitic stainless steels. It is purported that this is not the best possible fracture resistance of Ti, but a result of oxygen impurities that sensitively retard the activities of plasticity carriers in this hexagonal close&#8208;packed metal. By a reduction of oxygen content from the 0.14&#160;wt% in commercial purity Ti to 0.02&#160;wt%, the mode&#8208;&#921; fracture toughness of the low&#8208;oxygen Ti is measured to be as high as KJIc &#8776; 255 MPa m1/2, corresponding to J&#8208;integral&#8208;based crack&#8208;initiation toughness of up to JIc &#8776; 537&#160;kJ m&#8722;2. This extraordinary toughness, reported here for the first time for pure Ti, places Ti among the toughest known materials. The intrinsic high fracture resistance is attributed to the profuse plastic deformation in a significantly enlarged plastic zone, rendered by the pronounced deformation twinning ahead of the crack tip along with ample twin&#8208;stimulated &#12296;c+a&#12297; dislocation activities, in the absence of impeding oxygen. Controlling the content of a property&#8208;controlling impurity thus holds the promise to be a readily applicable strategy to reach for unprecedented damage tolerance in some other structural alloys.

         <title>SonoPrint: Acoustically Assisted Volumetric 3D Printing for Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
SonoPrint merges sound energy with volumetric printing to create composite materials with aligned reinforcement patterning. This innovative 3D printing technique embeds particles such as glass, metal, and polystyrene into photosensitive resin, forming intricate motifs and mechanically tunable geometries. Completing prints in minutes, SonoPrint enhances structural properties and advances applications in biohybrid robots, tissue engineering, and composite fabrication, broadening the horizons of volumetric printing.








Abstract
Advances in additive manufacturing in composites have transformed aerospace, medical devices, tissue engineering, and electronics. A key aspect of enhancing properties of 3D&#8208;printed objects involves fine&#8208;tuning the material by embedding and orienting reinforcement within the structure. Existing methods for orienting these reinforcements are limited by pattern types, alignment, and particle characteristics. Acoustics offers a versatile method to control the particles independent of their size, geometry, and charge, enabling intricate pattern formations. However, integrating acoustics into 3D printing has been challenging due to the scattering of the acoustic field between polymerized layers and unpolymerized resin, resulting in unwanted patterns. To address this challenge, SonoPrint, an innovative acoustically assisted volumetric 3D printer is developed that enables simultaneous reinforcement patterning and printing of the entire structure. SonoPrint generates mechanically tunable composite geometries by embedding reinforcement particles, such as microscopic glass, metal, and polystyrene, within the fabricated structure. This printer employs a standing wave field to create targeted particle motifs&#8208;including parallel lines, radial lines, circles, rhombuses, hexagons, and polygons&#8208;directly in the photosensitive resin, completing the print in just a few minutes. SonoPrint enhances structural properties and promises to advance volumetric printing, unlocking applications in tissue engineering, biohybrid robots, and composite fabrication.

         <title>Engineering Supramolecular Hydrogels via Reversible Photoswitching of Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Spiropyran Complexation Stoichiometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photoswitchable cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;spiropyran host&#8211;guest complex is designed to exhibit fast and reversible switching of binding ratios between 1:2 and 1:1 in response to UV and blue light. Such photoswitchable complexation stoichiometries are rationally exploited as (de)crosslinking units in multiple polymers for the design of supramolecular hydrogels displaying highly dynamic and switchable features that are spatiotemporally controlled by light.








Abstract
The integration of photoswitchable supramolecular units into hydrogels allows for spatiotemporal control over their nanoscale topological network and macroscale properties using light. Nevertheless, the current availability of photoswitchable supramolecular interactions for the development of such materials remains limited. Here, the molecular design of a novel photoswitchable cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;spiropyran host&#8211;guest complex exhibiting fast and reversible switching of binding ratios between 1:2 and 1:1 is reported. Photoswitchable complexation stoichiometries are rationally exploited as (de)crosslinking units in multiple polymers for the design of supramolecular hydrogels displaying highly dynamic and switchable features that are spatiotemporally controlled by light. The hydrogels exhibit rapid reversible mechanical softening&#8208;hardening upon alternating irradiation with blue and UV light, which is used to significantly accelerate and improve the efficiency of self&#8208;healing and shape&#8208;remolding of hydrogels. Furthermore, spiropyran endows such materials with unique reversible photochromic properties for reproducible patterning/erasing and information storage. Using a dual&#8208;light&#8208;assisted extrusion process, meter&#8208;scale hydrogel fibers with enhanced structural integrity and photoswitchable ionic conductivity are constructed and woven into various slidable knots and fluorescent shapes. This work represents an innovative molecular design strategy for advancing the development of spatiotemporally engineered supramolecular hydrogels using light and opens avenues for their prospective applications in dynamic materials and adaptive systems.

         <title>Biomimetic Nanomodulators With Synergism of Photothermal Therapy and Vessel Normalization for Boosting Potent Anticancer Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic nanomodulator Tm@PDA&#8208;GA with homologous targeting is developed for boosting potent anticancer immunity. Especially Tm@PDA&#8208;GA inhibits HSPs expression for chemo&#8208;photothermal synergetic anti&#8208;tumor and increases ICD to promote the maturation of dendritic cells. Additionally, it normalizes the vessels via HIF&#8208;1&#945; and VEGF inhibition to enhance immune infiltration. So Tm@PDA&#8208;GA combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 can effectively suppress tumor growth and lung metastasis.








Abstract
Combination therapy using photothermal therapy (PTT) and immunotherapy is one of the most promising approaches for eliciting host immune responses to ablate tumors. However, its therapeutic efficacy is limited due to inefficient immune cell infiltration and cellular immune responses. In this study, a biomimetic immunostimulatory nanomodulator, Tm@PDA&#8208;GA (4T1 membrane@polydopamine&#8208;gambogic acid), with homologous targeting is developed. The 4T1 membrane (Tm) coating reduced immunogenicity and facilitated uptake of Tm@PDA&#8208;GA by tumor cells. Polydopamine (PDA) as a drug carrier can induce PTT under near&#8208;infrared ray (NIR) irradiation and immunogenic cell death (ICD) to activate dendritic cells (DCs). Moreover, Tm@PDA&#8208;GA on&#8208;demand released gambogic acid (GA) in an acidic tumor microenvironment, inhibiting the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) for synergetic chemo&#8208;photothermal anti&#8208;tumor activity and increasing the ICD of 4T1 cells. More importantly, GA can normalize the vessels via HIF&#8208;1&#945; and VEGF inhibition to enhance immune infiltration and alleviate hypoxia stress. Thus, Tm@PDA&#8208;GA induced ICD, activated DCs, stimulated cytotoxic T cells, and suppressed Tregs. Moreover, Tm@PDA&#8208;GA is combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 to further augment the tumor immune response and effectively suppress tumor growth and lung metastasis. In conclusion, biomaterial&#8208;mediated PTT combined with vessel normalization is a promising strategy for effective immunotherapy of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC).

         <title>Direct Chiral Discrimination with NMR</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) elucidates molecular structures down to the atomic level. However, only with an auxiliary molecule, it is currently possible to distinguish the handedness of enantiomers directly with NMR. NMR is normally blind to chirality. A newly developed method now allows the distinction of enantiomers, just by using a standard NMR instrument, and without adulteration of the sample under investigation.








Abstract
Unaided nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is considered incapable of distinguishing enantiomers. However, as first derived by A.D. Buckingham, the tensor coupling the electric and magnetic dipoles is space&#8208;dependent, which varies according to the molecular structure, hence, would be different for two enantiomers. Exploiting the odd&#8208;parity coupling tensor, a new variant of a double&#8208;resonant radiofrequency (RF) NMR detector is developed, which is sensitive to both electric and magnetic dipoles. Using the detector, a new method for liquid&#8208;state NMR is developed and elaborated, with which two enantiomers are successfully discriminated.

         <title>Enhanced Self&#8211;Assembly and Spontaneous Separation for Ultrathin, Air&#8210;Floating Graphene Macrofilms and their Application in Ultrasensitive In&#8208;Site Growth Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By means of ethanol&#8208;based binary solution, the self&#8208;assembly performance of graphene oxide is enhanced dramatically at air&#8211;liquid interface, and the formed graphene oxide film first separates spontaneously from the solution to obtain an ultrathin air&#8210;floating graphene macrofilm (AGF). The in situ growth sensors based on AGFs are fabricated and show quick response and ultrahigh sensitivity for temperature and slight disturbance.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled graphene films at air&#8208;liquid interface have great potential for multiple applications. However, the large size and ultrathin thickness for graphene&#8208;based films are hardly achieved simultaneously because of poor assembly ability of graphene oxide (GO) and cautious film transfer process (FTP). Herein, the ethanol&#8208;based binary solution with supramolecular clusters and weak polarity is introduced to enhance the assembly performance of GO. In this regime, GO film is formed within 52 s, and its formation temperature can be as low as &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. More importantly, the attractive force between the formed GO film and this binary solution is 62% lower than that between GO film and traditional aqueous solution. On this basis, for the first time a spontaneous separation of the self&#8208;assembled GO film from solution is reported, and the air&#8210;floating graphene films (AGFs) with nanoscale thickness and centimeter&#8208;scale diameter are prepared without FTP. By means of this separation behavior, the in situ growth AGFs sensors are fabricated, and they express fast response and ultrahigh sensitivity to imperceptible change in temperature and disturbances that are hardly recognized by common sensors. Therefore, a new accessible strategy is demonstrated to prepare ultrathin graphene macrofilms, which can be the excellent candidates for multifunctional, ultrasensitive sensors.

         <title>Densification of Cathode/Electrolyte Interphase to Enhance Reversibility of LiCoO2 at 4.65&#160;V</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A progressively reinforced cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) is realized via constructing Zr&#9472;O deposits (ZrO2 and Li2ZrO3) on Z&#8208;LCO, i.e. the fluorination of Zr&#9472;O and densification of CEI layer driven by the chemical reaction between ZrOxFy and LiF, greatly reinforcing the toughness of CEI containing inorganic species. Consequently, Z&#8208;LCO achieve an enhanced and reversible O3/H1&#8208;3 phase transition and excellent electrochemical performance at 4.6/4.65 V.








Abstract
For LiCoO2 (LCO) operated beyond 4.55&#160;V (vs Li/Li+), it usually suffers from severe surface degradation. Constructing a robust cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) is effective to alleviate the above issues, however, the correlated mechanisms still remain vague. Herein, a progressively reinforced CEI is realized via constructing Zr&#9472;O deposits (ZrO2 and Li2ZrO3) on LCO surface (i.e., Z&#8208;LCO). Upon cycle, these Zr&#9472;O deposits can promote the decomposition of LiPF6, and progressively convert to the highly dispersed Zr&#9472;O&#9472;F species. In particular, the chemical reaction between LiF and Zr&#9472;O&#9472;F species further leads to the densification of CEI, which greatly reinforces its toughness and conductivity. Combining the robust CEI and thin surface rock&#8208;salt layer of Z&#8208;LCO, several benefits are achieved, including stabilizing the surface lattice oxygen, facilitating the interface Li+ transport kinetics, and enhancing the reversibility of O3/H1&#8208;3 phase transition, etc. As a result, the Z&#8208;LCO||Li cells exhibit a high capacity retention of 84.2% after 1000 cycles in 3&#8211;4.65&#160;V, 80.9% after 1500 cycles in 3&#8211;4.6&#160;V, and a high rate capacity of 160&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 16 C (1 C&#160;=&#160;200&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1). This work provides a new insight for developing advanced LCO cathodes.

         <title>Ultralong K0.5Mn0.75PS3 Nanowires Tailored by K&#8208;Ion Scissors for Extraordinary Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>

The concept of &#8220;K&#8208;ion scissors&#8221; is proposed for the first time to achieve rapid transformation of MnPS3 bulk to K0.5Mn0.75PS3 nanowires with extraordinary sodium storage performance.








Abstract
1D&#160;layered nanowires (NWs) are expected to be excellent electrode materials due to their efficient electron/ion transport and strain/stress relaxation. However, it is a great challenge to synthesize layered NWs by a top&#8208;down synthetic route. Herein, ultralong 1D layered K0.5Mn0.75PS3 NWs (length: &gt;100&#160;&#181;m; diameter: &#8776;300&#160;nm) are synthesized for the first time using &#8220;K&#8208;ion chemical scissors&#8221;, whose excellent sodium storage performance originates from the bifunctional structural unit, ingeniously combining the alloying energy storage functional unit (P&#8722;P dimer) with the quasi&#8208;intercalated functional unit ([MnS3]4&#8722; framework). Stress&#8208;driven K&#8208;ion scissors achieve the rapid transformation of MnPS3 bulk to K0.5Mn0.75PS3 NWs with directed tailoring. Compared to MnPS3, the NWs exhibit enlarged interlayer spacing (9.32 &#197;), enhanced electronic conductivity (8.17&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 S m&#8722;1 vs 4.47&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;10 S m&#8722;1), and high ionic conductivity (2.14 mS cm&#8722;1). As expected, the NWs demonstrate high capacity (709 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1) and excellent cycling performance (&#8776;100% capacity retention after 2500 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1), ranking among metal thiophosphates. A quasi&#8208;topological intercalation mechanism of the NWs is revealed through further characterizations. This work expands the top&#8208;down synthesis approach and offers innovative insights for the cost&#8208;effective and large&#8208;scale fabrication of NWs with outstanding electrochemical performance.

         <title>Leidenfrost Effect&#8208;Induced Chaotic Vortex Flow for Efficient Mixing of Highly Viscous Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;efficiency mixing of viscous liquids in microfluidics manipulation is a long&#8208;standing challenge because of unfavorable diffusion kinetics. Here, a peculiar Leidenfrost phenomenon, which can achieve mixing of viscous droplets within several hundred ms due to internal vortex motion, is resorted to. This new mixing mechanism can be used to synthesize nanoparticles of the desired morphology.








Abstract
Efficiently mixing highly viscous liquids in microfluidic systems is appealing for green chemistry such as chemical synthesis and catalysis, but it is a long&#8208;standing challenge owing to the unfavorable diffusion kinetics. In this work, a new strategy is explored for mixing viscous droplets by harnessing a peculiar Leidenfrost state, where the substrate temperature is above the boiling point of the liquid without apparent liquid evaporation. Compared to the control experiment where the droplet stays at a similar temperature but in the contact boiling regime, the mixing time can be reduced significantly. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the liquid mixing originates from the chaotic convection flow in the Leidenfrost droplet, characterized by the internal vortex motion evidenced by the microscale visualization. A correlation between mixing time and droplet volume is also proposed, showing a good agreement with experimental results. It is further shown that Leidenfrost droplets can be used to synthesize nanoparticles of the desired morphology, and it is anticipated that this simple and scalable fabrication approach will find applications in the biological, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries.

         <title>Anisotropic Superprotonic Conduction in a Layered Single&#8208;Component Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Multiple In&#8208;Plane Open Channels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered single&#8208;component hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF), HOF&#8208;TPB&#8208;A3, is prepared, which exhibited anisotropic superprotonic conduction via multiple in&#8208;plane open channels. A&#160;proton rectifier device is further demonstrated, highlighting the promise of HOFs as conducting media for ionic devices.








Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are promising proton conductive materials because of their inherent and abundant hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites. However, most superprotonic&#8208;conductive HOFs are constructed from multiple components to enable favorable framework architectures and structural integrity. In this contribution, layered HOF&#8208;TPB&#8208;A3 with a single component is synthesized and exfoliated. The exfoliated nanoplates exhibited anisotropic superprotonic conduction, with in&#8208;plane proton conductivities reaching 1.34&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1 at 296 K and 98% relative humidity (RH). This outperforms the previously reported single&#8208;component HOFs and is comparable with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multiple&#8208;component HOFs. The high and anisotropic proton conductive properties can be attributed to the efficient proton transport along multiple open channels parallel to their basal planes. Moreover, an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state (ASS) proton rectifier device is demonstrated by combining HOF&#8208;TPB&#8208;A3 and a hydroxide ion&#8208;conducting layered double hydroxide (LDH). This work suggests that single&#8208;component HOFs with multiple open channels offer more opportunities as versatile platforms for proton conductors, making them promising candidates for conducting media in protonic devices.

         <title>All&#8208;in&#8208;One 2D Molecular Crystal Optoelectronic Synapse for Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Neuromorphic Visual System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pioneering all&#8208;in&#8208;one 2D molecular crystal (2DMC) optoelectronic synapse for polarization&#8208;sensitive neuromorphic visual system is demonstrated. The synaptic phototransistor exhibits remarkable photoelectric performance and simulates biological synapse functions. The in&#8208;plane crystal anisotropy of 2DMC endows the synaptic phototransistor with polarization perception capabilities, which is successfully applied to noncontact fingerprint detection with a high recognition accuracy.








Abstract
Neuromorphic visual systems (NVSs) hold the potential to not only preserve but also enhance human visual capabilities. One such augmentation lies in harnessing polarization information from light reflected or scattered off surfaces like bees, which can disclose unique characteristics imperceptible to the human eyes. While creating polarization&#8208;sensitive optoelectronic synapses presents an intriguing avenue for equipping NVS with this capability, integrating functions like polarization sensitivity, photodetection, and synaptic operations into a singular device has proven challenging. This integration typically necessitates distinct functional components for each performance metric, leading to intricate fabrication processes and constraining overall performance. Herein, a pioneering linear polarized light sensitive synaptic organic phototransistor (OPT) based on 2D molecular crystals (2DMCs) with highly integrated, all&#8208;in&#8208;one functionality, is demonstrated. By leveraging the superior crystallinity and molecular thinness of 2DMC, the synaptic OPT exhibits comprehensive superior performance, including a linear dichroic ratio up to 3.85, a high responsivity of 1.47 &#215; 104 A W&#8722;1, and the adept emulation of biological synapse functions. A sophisticated application in noncontact fingerprint detection achieves a 99.8% recognition accuracy, further highlights its potential. The all&#8208;in&#8208;one 2DMC optoelectronic synapse for polarization&#8208;sensitive NVS marks a new era for intelligent perception systems.

         <title>A Biomimetic Autophagosomes&#8208;Based Nanovaccine Boosts Anticancer Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a biomimetic autophagosome&#8208;based (BAPs) personalized nanovaccine that integrates neoantigens sourced from tumor cell&#8208;derived autophagosomes, immunoadjuvants, and targeting nanovesicles to induce a potent tumor&#8208;specific immune response. The BAPs nanovaccine demonstrates significant efficacy in eradicating established tumors, providing comprehensive protection to mice against tumor rechallenges, and decreasing tumor incidence. This represents a highly versatile formulation for personalized cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Personalized cancer vaccines based on tumor cell lysates offer promise for cancer immunotherapy yet fail to elicit a robust therapeutic effect due to the weak immunogenicity of tumor antigens. Autophagosomes, obtained from pleural effusions and ascites of cancer patients, have been identified as abundant reservoirs of tumor neoantigens that exhibit heightened immunogenicity. However, their potential as personalized cancer vaccines have been constrained by suboptimal lymphatic&#8208;targeting performances and challenges in antigen&#8208;presenting cell endocytosis. Here,a reinforced biomimetic autophagosome&#8208;based (BAPs) nanovaccine generated by precisely amalgamating autophagosome&#8208;derived neoantigens and two types of adjuvants capable of targeting lymph nodes is developed to potently elicit antitumor immunity. The redox&#8208;responsive BAPs facilitate cytosolic vaccine opening within antigen&#8208;presenting cells, thereby exposing adjuvants and antigens to stimulate a strong immune response. BAPs evoke broad&#8208;spectrum T&#8208;cell responses, culminating in the effective eradication of 71.4% of established tumors. Notably, BAPs vaccination triggers enduring T&#8208;cell responses that confer robust protection, with 100% of mice shielded against tumor rechallenge and a significant reduction in tumor incidence by 87.5%. Furthermore, BAPs synergize with checkpoint blockade therapy to inhibit tumor growth in the poorly immunogenic breast cancer model. The biomimetic approach presents a powerful nanovaccine formula with high versatility&#160;for personalized cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Simultaneous Color&#8208; and Dose&#8208;Controlled Thiol&#8211;Ene Resins for Multimodulus 3D Printing with Programmable Interfacial Gradients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exposing a novel multifunctional resin to different colors and intensities of light enables 3D printing of high&#8208;resolution objects with programmable stiffness gradients that are mimetic of structures found in nature.








Abstract
Drawing inspiration from nature's own intricate designs, synthetic multimaterial structures have the potential to offer properties and functionality that exceed those of the individual components. However, several contemporary hurdles, from a lack of efficient chemistries to processing constraints, preclude the rapid and precise manufacturing of such materials. Herein, the development of a photocurable resin comprising color&#8208;selective initiators is reported, triggering disparate polymerization mechanisms between acrylate and thiol functionality. Exposure of the resin to UV light (365&#160;nm) leads to the formation of a rigid, highly crosslinked network via a radical chain&#8208;growth mechanism, while violet light (405&#160;nm) forms a soft, lightly crosslinked network via an anionic step&#8208;growth mechanism. The efficient photocurable resin is employed in multicolor digital light processing 3D printing to provide structures with moduli spanning over two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, local intensity (i.e., grayscale) control enables the formation of programmable stiffness gradients with &#8776;150&#215; change in modulus occurring across sharp (&#8776;200&#160;&#181;m) and shallow (&#8776;9&#160;mm) interfaces, mimetic of the human knee entheses and squid beaks, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;Exposing a novel multifunctional resin to different colors and intensities of light enables 3D printing of high-resolution objects with programmable stiffness gradients that are mimetic of structures found in nature.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing inspiration from nature's own intricate designs, synthetic multimaterial structures have the potential to offer properties and functionality that exceed those of the individual components. However, several contemporary hurdles, from a lack of efficient chemistries to processing constraints, preclude the rapid and precise manufacturing of such materials. Herein, the development of a photocurable resin comprising color-selective initiators is reported, triggering disparate polymerization mechanisms between acrylate and thiol functionality. Exposure of the resin to UV light (365&#160;nm) leads to the formation of a rigid, highly crosslinked network via a radical chain-growth mechanism, while violet light (405&#160;nm) forms a soft, lightly crosslinked network via an anionic step-growth mechanism. The efficient photocurable resin is employed in multicolor digital light processing 3D printing to provide structures with moduli spanning over two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, local intensity (i.e., grayscale) control enables the formation of programmable stiffness gradients with &#8776;150&#215; change in modulus occurring across sharp (&#8776;200&#160;&#181;m) and shallow (&#8776;9&#160;mm) interfaces, mimetic of the human knee entheses and squid beaks, respectively. This study provides composition&#8211;processing&#8211;property relationships to inform advanced manufacturing of next-generation multimaterial objects having a myriad of applications from healthcare to education.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Implantable Microneedle&#8208;Mediated Eradication of Postoperative Tumor Foci Mitigates Glioblastoma Relapse</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biodegradable and immunomodulatory microneedle (GMAN@CMN) is reported in this work. As an adjunctive strategy for the treatment of GBM, GMAN@CMN initiates anti&#8208;tumor immunity and effectively prevents GBM postoperative relapse. The implantable microneedle even holds potential when the tumor invades vital regions that cannot be surgically resected.








Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains incurable despite multimodal treatments after surgical debulking. Almost all patients with GBM relapse within a narrow margin (2&#8211;3&#160;cm) of the initial resected lesion due to the unreachable residual cancerous cells. Here, a completely biodegradable microneedle for surgical cavity delivery glioblastoma&#8208;associated macrophages (GAMs)&#8208;activating immune nano&#8208;stimulator that mitigates glioblastoma relapse is reported. The residual tumor lesion&#8208;directed biocompatible microneedle releases the nano&#8208;stimulator and toll&#8208;like receptor 9 agonist in a controlled manner until the microneedles completely degrade over 1 week, efferently induce in situ phonotypic shifting of GAMs from anti&#8208; to pro&#8208;inflammatory and the tumor recurrence is obviously inhibited. The implantable microneedles offer a significant improvement over conventional transdermal ones, as they are 100% degradable, ensuring safe application within surgical cavities. It is also revealed that the T cells are recruited to the tumor niche as the GAMs initiate anti&#8208;tumor response and eradicate residual GBM cells. Taken together, this work provides a potential strategy for immunomodulating the postoperative tumor niche to mitigate tumor relapse in GBM patients, which may have broad applications in other malignancies with surgical intervention.

         <title>Achieving Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphorescence Supramolecular Hydrogel Based on Amphiphilic Bromonaphthalimide Pyridinium Hierarchical Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient near&#8208;infrared phosphorescence supramolecular hydrogel is constructed based on amphiphilic bromonaphthalimide pyridinium hierarchical assembly in aqueous medium, which exhibits long&#8208;lived photoluminescence at 823&#160;nm with ultralarge Stokes shift and is successfully applied for cell labeling.








Abstract
Phosphorescent supramolecular hydrogels are currently a prevalent topic for their great promise in various photonic applications. Herein, an efficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphorescence supramolecular hydrogel is reported via the hierarchical assembly strategy in aqueous solution, which is fabricated from amphiphilic bromonaphthalimide pyridinium derivative (G), exfoliated Laponite (LP) nanosheets, and polymeric polyacrylamide (PAAm). Initially, G spontaneously self&#8208;aggregates into spherical nanoparticles covered with positively charged pyridinium units and emits single fluorescence at 410&#160;nm. Driven by electrostatic interactions with negatively charged nanosheets, the nanoparticles subsequently function as the cross&#8208;linked binders and coassemble with LP into supramolecular hydrogels with an engendered red room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) up to 620&#160;nm. Benefiting from hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions&#8208;mediated physical cross&#8208;linkage, the further introduction of PAAm not only significantly elevates the mechanical strength of the hydrogels showing fast self&#8208;healing capability, but also increases phosphorescence lifetime from 2.49&#160;to 4.20&#160;ms, especially generating phosphorescence at even higher temperature (&#964;
363 K = 2.46&#160;ms). Additionally, efficient RTP energy transfer occurs after doping a small amount of organic dye heptamethine cyanine (IR780) as an acceptor into hydrogels, resulting in a long&#8208;lived NIR emission at 823&#160;nm with a high donor/acceptor ratio, which is successfully applied for cell labeling in the NIR window.

         <title>In&#8208;Materia Annealing and Combinatorial Optimization Based on Vertical Memristive Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilizes the inter&#8208;layer interference of a vertically stacked memristive crossbar array as an annealing method for combinatorial optimization problems. When these problems are mapped into the CBA's configuration layer, decaying annealing profiles are generated in the adjacent noise layers. The annealing profiles can be controlled electrically, offering material&#8208;based noise to solve the problems efficiently. 








Abstract
Due to its area and energy efficiency, a memristive crossbar array (CBA) has been extensively studied for various combinatorial optimization applications, from network problems to circuit design. However, conventional approaches include heavily burdening software fine&#8208;tuning for the annealing process. Instead, this study introduces the &#8220;in&#8208;materia annealing&#8221; method, where the inter&#8208;layer interference of vertically stacked memristive CBA is utilized as an annealing method. When mapping combinatorial optimization problems into the configuration layer of the CBA, exponentially decaying annealing profiles are generated in nearby noise layers. Moreover, in&#8208;materia annealing profiles can be controlled by changing compliance current, read voltage, and read pulse width. Therefore, the annealing profiles can be arbitrarily controlled and generated individually for each cell, providing rich noise sources to solve the problem efficiently. Consequently, the experimental and simulation of Max&#8208;Cut and weighted Max&#8208;Cut problems achieve notable results with the minimum software burden.

         <title>Cu&#8208;In Dual Sites with Sulfur Defects toward Superior Ethanol Electrosynthesis from CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To concurrently improve the yield of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol and catalyst stability, electro&#8208;driven intercalation is employed to form Cu&#8208;In dual&#8208;active sites with sulfur vacancies for the simultaneous adsorption of *H and *CO intermediates. This catalyst facilitates the rate&#8208;limiting step of *CHO formation for the key *OCHCHO* intermediate of ethanol production, delivering a stable and high rate of ethanol formation from CO2 electrolysis.








Abstract
The electrosynthesis of multi&#8208;carbon chemicals from excess carbon dioxide (CO2) is an area of great interest for research and commercial applications. However, improving both the yield of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion and the stability of the catalyst at the same time is proving to be a challenging issue. Here it is proposed to stabilize active Cu(I) and In dual sites with sulfur defects through an electro&#8208;driven intercalation strategy, which leads to the delocalization of electron density that enhances orbital hybridizations between the Cu&#8208;C and In&#8208;H bonds. Hence, the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;limiting *CHO formation step is reduced toward the key *OCHCHO* formation during ethanol production, which is also facilitated by the combined Cu site enabling C&#8208;C coupling and In site with a higher oxygen affinity based on both thermodynamic and kinetic calculations. Accordingly, such dual&#8208;site catalyst achieves a high partial current density toward ethanol of 409 &#177; 15&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8315;2 for over 120 h. Furthermore, a scaled&#8208;up flow cell is assembled with an industrial&#8208;relevant current of 5.7 A for over 36 h, in which the carbon loss is less than 2.5% and single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency is &#8776;19%.

         <title>Toward Thin&#8208;Film Laser Diodes with Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Perspective discusses fundamental material limitations and device integration challenges that need to be addressed to bring metal halide perovskite thin&#8208;film devices from lasing under optical pumping to electrical pumping. These aspects include optical gain mechanisms, carrier recombination dynamics, electroluminescence efficiency roll&#8208;off, thermal runaway, and low&#8208;optical&#8208;loss layouts with compatible resonant cavity integration methods.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite semiconductors hold a strong promise for enabling thin&#8208;film laser diodes. Perovskites distinguish themselves from other non&#8208;epitaxial media primarily through their ability to maintain performance at high current densities, which is a critical requirement for achieving injection lasing. Coming in a wide range of varieties, numerous perovskites delivered low&#8208;threshold optical amplified spontaneous emission and optically pumped lasing when combined with a suitable optical cavity. A progression toward electrically pumped lasing requires the development of efficient light&#8208;emitting structures with reduced optical losses and high radiative efficiency at lasing&#8208;level current densities. This involves a set of important trade&#8208;offs in terms of material choice, stack and waveguide design, as well as resonator integration. In this Perspective, the key milestones are highlighted that have been achieved in the study of passive optical waveguides and light&#8208;emitting diodes, and these learnings are translated toward more complex laser diode architectures. Finally, a novel resonator integration route is proposed that is capable of relaxing optical and electrical design constraints.

         <title>Atto&#8208;Scale Noise Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Photodetectors Enabled by Controlling Interfacial Energetic Offset through Enhanced Anchoring Ability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study examines the JD and noise equiv. power (NEP) in NIR OPDs with varying electron blocking layers (EBLs). A newly synthesized EBL (named 3PAFBr) is introduced via a JD generation mechanism, significantly impacting NEP. The 3PAFBr&#8208;based OPD demonstrates a noise current of 852 aA (JD = 12.3 fA&#160;cm&#8315;2 at V &#8594; &#8722;0.1 V) and achieves several femtowatt&#8208;scale NEPs.








Abstract
The near&#8208;infrared (NIR) sensor technology is crucial for various applications such as autonomous driving and biometric tracking. Silicon photodetectors (SiPDs) are widely used in NIR applications; however, their scalability is limited by their crystalline properties. Organic photodetectors (OPDs) have attracted attention for NIR applications owing to their scalability, low&#8208;temperature processing, and notably low dark current density (JD), which is similar to that of SiPDs. However, the still high JD (at NIR band) and few measurements of noise equivalent powers (NEPs) pose challenges for accurate performance comparisons. This study addresses these issues by quantitatively characterizing the performance matrix and JD generation mechanism using electron&#8208;blocking layers (EBLs) in OPDs. The energy offset at an EBL/photosensitive layer interface determines the thermal activation energy and directly affects JD. A newly synthesized EBL (3PAFBr) substantially enhances the interfacial energy barrier by forming a homogeneous contact owing to the improved anchoring ability of 3PAFBr. As a result, the OPD with 3PAFBr yields a noise current of 852 aA (JD = 12.3 fA&#160;cm&#8315;2 at V &#8594; &#8722;0.1&#160;V) and several femtowatt&#8208;scale NEPs. As far as it is known, this is an ultralow of&#160;JD in NIR OPDs. This emphasizes the necessity for quantitative performance characterization.

         <title>Activated Co in Thiospinel Boosting Li2CO3 Decomposition in Li&#8722;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By Ni substitution in the tetrahedral sites of Co&#8208;based thiospinel, Co atoms are activated to construct catalytic domain with multiple active sites. Resultant adsorption configuration leads to enhanced interaction between Li2CO3 and NiCo2S4, which result in reduced energy barrier for Li2CO3 decomposition and excellent catalytic activity to CO2 evolution reaction. As a result, the charge voltage is significantly reduced.








Abstract
Catalytic reactions mainly depend on the adsorption properties of reactants on the catalyst, which provides a perspective for the design of reversible lithium&#8722;carbon dioxide (Li&#8722;CO2) batteries including CO2 reduction (CO2RR) and CO2 evolution (CO2ER) reactions. However, due to the complex reaction process, the relationship between the adsorption configuration and CO2RR/CO2ER catalytic activity is still unclear in Li&#9472;CO2 batteries. Herein, taking Co3S4 as a model system, nickel (Ni&#160;substitution in the tetrahedral site to activate cobalt (Co) atom for forming multiatom catalytic domains in NiCo2S4 is utilized. Benefiting from the special geometric and electronic structures, NiCo2S4 exhibits an optimized adsorption configuration of lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), promoting its effective activation and decomposition. As a result, the Li&#8722;CO2 batteries with NiCo2S4 cathode exhibit remarkable electrochemical performance in terms of low potential gap of 0.42&#160;V and high energy efficiency of 88.7%. This work provides a unique perspective for the development of highly efficient catalysts in Li&#8722;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Inhibited Passivation by Bioinspired Cell Membrane Zn Interface for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries with Extended Temperature Adaptability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bioinspired cell membrane Zn|electrolyte interface inhibits the growth rate of the passivation layer on the Zn surface of Zn&#8211;air batteries, thereby increasing the charge transfer dynamics at the Zn interface. The robust cycling stability of corresponding bioinspired Zn&#8211;air batteries from 25 to &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C is achieved, which is almost three times that of unmodified Zn&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Due to the slow dynamics of mass and charge transfer at Zn|electrolyte interface, the stable operation of Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) is challenging, especially at low temperature. Herein, inspired by cell membrane, a hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic dual modulated Zn|electrolyte interface is constructed. This amphiphilic design enables the quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state (QSS) ZABs to display a long&#8208;term cyclability of 180 h@50&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 25&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, a record&#8208;long time of 173 h@4&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C is also achieved, which is almost threefolds of untreated QSS ZABs. Control experiments and (in situ) characterization reveal that the growth of insulating ZnO passivation layers is largely inhibited by tuned hydrophilic&#8211;hydrophobic behavior. Thus, the enhanced transfer dynamic of Zn2+ at Zn|electrolyte interface from 25 to &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C is attained. As an extension, the QSS Al&#8208;air batteries (AABs) with bioinspired interface also show unprecedented discharge stability of 420 h@1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8208;40&#160;&#176;C, which is about two times of untreated QSS AABs. This bioinspired&#8208;hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic dual modulation strategy may provide a reference for energy transform and storage devices with broad temperature adaptability.

This bioinspired-hydrophilic-hydrophobic dual modulation strategy may provide a reference for energy transform and storage devices with broad temperature adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Surface Amorphization
In article number 2404103, WooChul Jung, Bong&#8208;Joong Kim, Jongsu Seo, Scott A. Barnett, and their research team successfully induced simultaneous surface amorphization and nanocatalyst ex&#8208;solution on perovskite oxides through a simple hydrogen heat treatment. This surface reconstruction leads to a highly reactive and stable solid oxide fuel cell cathode, demonstrating its potential applicability to a full cell system. The cover image illustrates this surface reconstruction process, showing how hydrogen gas creates an amorphous surface and facilitates nanocatalyst ex&#8208;solution.

Hemostatic Peptide Hydrogel
The immemorial Chinese fairy tale &#8220;Nuwa fixing the sky&#8221; is used to metaphor the hemostatic process of hemostatic peptide hydrogel (HPH) in article number 2405290 by Chaoqiang Fan, Malcolm Xing, Shiming Yang, and co&#8208;workers. The hole in the sky and the pouring flood from Tianhe River are metaphors for the wound and severe hemorrhage. The goddess Nuwa is using colorful stones which represent HPH, triggered by the blue laser to halt bleeding and saving lives.

Spontaneous Separation for Air&#8208;Floating Graphene Macrofilms
By means of ethanol&#8208;based binary solution, the self&#8208;assembly performance of graphene oxide is enhanced dramatically at air&#8208;liquid interface, and the formed graphene oxide film first separates spontaneously from the solution to obtain an ultrathin air&#8208;floating graphene macrofilm (AGF). The in situ growth sensors based on AGFs are fabricated and show quick response and ultrahigh sensitivity for temperature and slight disturbance. More details can be found in article number 2408550 by Guomin Ding, Bowen Yang, Qilin Mei, and co&#8208;workers.

Porous Carbon Scaffolds
A dodecahedral activated N&#8208;doped porous carbon scaffold is synthesized and used for the nanoconfinement of Mg(BH4)2. Precise activation control enables a transformation from microporous carbon materials to mesoporous ones with extremely high specific surface area and pore volume, and hence the efficient nanoconfinement of Mg(BH4)2, realization of one&#8208;step dehydrogenation and superior reversibility. More details can be found in article number 2406152 by Lixian Sun, Lixin Chen, Xuezhang Xiao, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Delivery Systems Developed for Treatment Combinations to Improve Adoptive Cell Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of various delivery strategies for combination cell therapy and their application in the clinic. Furthermore, the remaining challenges and opportunities in this emerging field are disscussed in detial, with the hope of accelerating the clinical translation of adoptive cell therapy for solid tumour.








Abstract
Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) has shown great success in the clinic for treating hematologic malignancies. However, solid tumor treatment with ACT monotherapy is still challenging, owing to insufficient expansion and rapid exhaustion of adoptive cells, tumor antigen downregulation/loss, and dense tumor extracellular matrix. Delivery strategies for combination cell therapy have great potential to overcome these hurdles. The delivery of vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors, cytokines, chemotherapeutics, and photothermal reagents in combination with adoptive cells, have been shown to improve the expansion/activation, decrease exhaustion, and promote the penetration of adoptive cells in solid tumors. Moreover, the delivery of nucleic acids to engineer immune cells directly in vivo holds promise to overcome many of the hurdles associated with the complex ex vivo cell engineering strategies. Here, these research advance, as well as the opportunities and challenges for integrating delivery technologies into cell therapy s are discussed, and the outlook for these emerging areas are criticlly analyzed.

         <title>Enabling Sustainable Ammonia Synthesis: From Nitrogen Activation Strategies to Emerging Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>

This review offers a comprehensive overview of the development of new materials and strategies aimed at enhancing N2 activation and NH3 formation in thermal catalysis. It highlights recent mechanisms, including self&#8208;electron donation, hydride fixation, promotion of anionic vacancies, and hydridic hydrogen reduction. Furthermore, the review discusses future challenges and opportunities for achieving sustainable ammonia synthesis.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is one of the most important precursors of various chemicals and fertilizers. Given that ammonia synthesis via the traditional Haber&#8211;Bosch process requires high temperatures and pressures, it is critical to explore effective strategies and catalysts for ammonia synthesis under mild reaction conditions. Although electrocatalysis and photocatalysis can convert N2 to NH3 under mild conditions, their efficiencies and production scales are still far from the requirements for industrialization. Thermal catalysis has been proven to be the most direct and effective approach for ammonia synthesis. Over the past few decades, significant efforts have been made to develop novel catalysts capable of nitrogen fixation and ammonia generation via thermal catalytic processes. In parallel with catalyst exploration, new strategies such as self&#8208;electron donation, hydride fixation, hydridic hydrogen reduction, and anionic vacancy promotion have also been explored to moderate the operating conditions and improve the catalytic efficiency of ammonia synthesis. In this review, the emergence of new materials and strategies for promoting N2 activation and NH3 formation during thermal catalysis is briefly summarized. Moreover, challenges and prospects are proposed for the future development of thermal catalytic ammonia synthesis.

         <title>Nanoengineering&#8208;Enhanced Capillary Cooling Achieves Sustained Thermal Protection for Ultra&#8208;High Heat Flux and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extreme thermal conditions with heat flux densities exceeding 1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2 or temperatures reaching up to 1000 &#176;C are prevalent in various situations. However, the ability of thermal protection either depends on specialized materials or is currently limited with existing cooling schemes. Herein, we propose an innovative cooling scheme that relies on evaporation&#8208;driven capillary flow enhanced by nanoengineering&#8208;designed porous structures with common materials. Experimentally&#8208;obtained capillary flow cooling curve identifies critical heat flux corresponding to evaporation&#8208;driven flow stage, where coolants cool the surface and subsequent vapor impedes heat transfer from thermal boundaries. Nanoengineering provides opportunities for enhanced capillary flow, which proves to endow bronze, TC4, and Al2O3 with thermal protection ability 50%&#8722;180% higher than that without nanoengineering&#8208;designed. Our scheme achieves critical heat flux up to 2.0&#8208;3.1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2, and performs thermal dissipation capacity almost twice higher than inherent latent heat of coolant. Furthermore, in a supersonic wind tunnel with total temperature reaching up to 1792 K, our scheme effectively protects surfaces by cooling them to surface temperatures below 500 K. Nanoengineering&#8208;enhanced capillary cooling gives access to the application of common materials for high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;heat&#8208;flux environments and paves the way for the development of lightweight, long&#8208;lasting, and large&#8208;scale solutions for thermal protection.

Liquid crystal (LC) is a self&#8208;organized soft matter with anisotropic molecular alignment. Due to the sensitivity to various external stimulations, LC has been considered as an emerging and appealing responsive building block to construct intelligent materials and advanced devices. Recently, mechanochromic LC materials have becoming a hot topic in multi fields from flexible artificial skins to visualized sensors and smart biomimetic devices. In this review, the recent progress of mechanochromic LCs is comprehensively summarized. Firstly, the mechanism and functionalities of mechanochromic LC is introduced, followed by preparation of various functional materials based on mechanochromic LCs. Then the applications of mechanochromic LCs are provided. Finally, the conclusion and outlooks of this field is given. This overview is hoped to provide inspiration in fabrication of advanced functional soft materials for scientists and engineers from multidisciplines including materials science, elastomers, chemistry and physical science.

         <title>A Topological Parametric Phonon Oscillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological bosonic systems have recently aroused intense interests in exploring exotic phenomena that have no counterparts in electronic systems. The squeezed bosonic interaction in these systems is particularly interesting, because it can modify the vacuum fluctuations of topological states, drive them into instabilities, and lead to topological parametric oscillators. However, these phenomena remain experimentally elusive because of limited nonlinearities in most existing topological bosonic systems. Here, a topological parametric phonon oscillator is experimentally realized based on a nonlinear nanoelectromechanical Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity with strong squeezed interaction. Specifically, the Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity is parametrically driven to provide phase&#8208;sensitive amplification for topological phonons, leading to the observation of coherent parametric phonon oscillation above the threshold. Additionally, it is confirmed that the random frequency variation caused by fabrication disorders can be suppressed effectively by increasing the cavity size, while the free spectral range reduces at a much slower rate, which benefit the realization of large&#8208;area single&#8208;mode lasers. Our results represent an important advance in experimental investigations of topological physics with large bosonic nonlinearities and parametric gain.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated DNA Nanotechnology in 3D: Structural Library by Templated Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
DNA double helices containing metal&#8208;mediated DNA (mmDNA) base pairs have been constructed from Ag+ and Hg2+ ions between pyrimidine:pyrimidine pairs with the promise of nanoelectronics. Rational design of mmDNA nanomaterials has been impractical without a complete lexical and structural description. Here, we explore the programmability of structural DNA nanotechnology toward its founding mission of self&#8208;assembling a diffraction platform for biomolecular structure determination. We employed the tensegrity triangle to build a comprehensive structural library of mmDNA pairs via X&#8208;ray diffraction and elucidated generalized design rules for mmDNA construction. We uncovered two binding modes: N3&#8208;dominant, centrosymmetric pairs and major groove binders driven by 5&#8208;position ring modifications. Energy gap calculations showed additional levels in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of mmDNA structures, rendering them attractive molecular electronic candidates.
