         <title>Anisotropically Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fatigue&#8208;resistant hydrogels are fabricated through synergistically engineering the preferentially aligned microstructures and nanocrystalline domains, enabling application as load&#8208;bearing components in underwater robots.








Abstract
Nature builds biological materials from limited ingredients, however, with unparalleled mechanical performances compared to artificial materials, by harnessing inherent structures across multi&#8208;length&#8208;scales. In contrast, synthetic material design overwhelmingly focuses on developing new compounds, and fails to reproduce the mechanical properties of natural counterparts, such as fatigue resistance. Here, a simple yet general strategy to engineer conventional hydrogels with a more than 100&#8208;fold increase in fatigue thresholds is reported. This strategy is proven to be universally applicable to various species of hydrogel materials, including polysaccharides (i.e., alginate, cellulose), proteins (i.e., gelatin), synthetic polymers (i.e., poly(vinyl alcohol)s), as well as corresponding polymer composites. These fatigue&#8208;resistant hydrogels exhibit a record&#8208;high fatigue threshold over most synthetic soft materials, making them low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance, and durable alternatives to soft materials used in those circumstances including robotics, artificial muscles,&#160;etc.

         <title>Direct Integration of Strained&#8208;Pt Catalysts into Proton&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Fuel Cells with Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designer electrocatalysts can be deposited via atomic layer deposition onto support structures for performance evaluation under various platforms. In this example, strained platinum catalysts are formed by dissolving cobalt oxide from the Pt/CoOx core&#8211;shell structure. Performance enhancement seen on the rotating disk electrode is validated in the membrane electrode assembly.








Abstract
The design and fabrication of lattice&#8208;strained platinum catalysts achieved by removing a soluble core from a platinum shell synthesized via atomic layer deposition, is reported. The remarkable catalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), measured in both half&#8208;cell and full&#8208;cell configurations, is attributed to the observed lattice strain. By further optimizing the nanoparticle geometry and ionomer/carbon interactions, mass activity close to 0.8&#160;A&#160;mgPt&#8722;1 @0.9&#160;V iR&#8208;free is achievable in the membrane electrode assembly. Nevertheless, active catalysts with high ORR activity do not necessarily lead to high performance in the high&#8208;current&#8208;density (HCD) region. More attention shall be directed toward HCD performance for enabling high&#8208;power&#8208;density hydrogen fuel cells.

         <title>Sphingosine 1&#8208;Phosphate Liposomes for Targeted Nitric Oxide Delivery to Mediate Anticancer Effects against Brain Glioma Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phospholipid&#8208;signaling sphingolipid hybrid and glutathione S&#8208;transferase (GST)&#8208;responsive liposome is successfully developed, which is able to specifically and safely deliver the therapeutic prodrug JS&#8208;K into glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors. Nitric oxide (NO) production in the tumor microenvironment is quantified by ultrasound imaging visualization. This study validates S1P liposomes as an effective drug delivery system for carcinomas.








Abstract
Specifically targeting glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) blood vessels and actively enhancing the permeability of the brain&#8211;blood&#8211;tumor barrier (BBTB) are two extremely difficult challenges currently hindering the development of effective therapies against GBM. Herein, a liposome drug delivery system (S1P/JS&#8208;K/Lipo) is described, which delivers the nitric oxide (NO) prodrug JS&#8208;K, O2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;dinitrophenyl) 1&#8208;[(4&#8208;ethoxycarbonyl) piperazin&#8208;1&#8208;yl] diazen&#8208;1&#8208;ium&#8208;1,2&#8208;diolate, to GBM tumors using sphingosine&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate (S1P)&#8208;signaling molecules as active targeting lipid ligands. It is revealed that S1P/JS&#8208;K/Lipo actively penetrates the BBTB, aided by caveolin&#8208;1&#8208;mediated transcytosis, and it is demonstrated that the system specifically interacts with S1P receptors (S1PRs), which are highly expressed on GBM cells. Nondestructive ultrasound imaging in GBM mouse models is also utilized to observe microsized NO bubble production from JS&#8208;K, as catalyzed by the glutathione S&#8208;transferases (GSTs) resident in GBM cells. Given that these NO bubbles strongly promote GBM cell death in vivo, the S1PR&#8208;targeted liposome delivery system&#8212;which successfully achieves BBTB penetration and tumor targeted delivery of a complex multicomponent drug regimen&#8212;represents a promising approach for targeted therapies against GBM and other carcinomas characterized by elevated S1PR expression.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Quantum Memories Based on Molecular Electron Spin Ensembles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ensembles of weakly exchange coupled organic radicals form strongly coupled systems with 3D microwave resonators. Time&#8208;domain pulsed microwave investigations reveal long, largely temperature&#8208;independent quantum coherence times. The room&#8208;temperature storage and retrieval of microwave pulses is demonstrated.








Abstract
Whilst quantum computing has recently taken great leaps ahead, the development of quantum memories has decidedly lagged behind. Quantum memories are essential devices in the quantum technology palette and are needed for intermediate storage of quantum bit states and as quantum repeaters in long&#8208;distance quantum communication. Current quantum memories operate at cryogenic, mostly sub&#8208;Kelvin temperatures and require extensive and costly peripheral hardware. It is demonstrated that ensembles of weakly coupled molecular spins show long coherence times and can be used to store microwave pulses of arbitrary phase. These studies exploit strong coupling of the spin ensemble to special 3D microwave resonators. Most importantly, these systems operate at room temperature.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Induced Cell Membrane Disruptions Enable Direct Cytosolic Delivery of Membrane&#8208;Impermeable Cargo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crosslinked cationic dextran nanogels are identified as unique polycationic nanomaterials capable of mediating direct cytosolic delivery of membrane&#8208;impermeable cargo. The efficient delivery of various macromolecules in HeLa cells and primary cells is demonstrated. Moreover, this approach outperforms state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electroporation for the delivery of neutral macromolecules and the MRI contrast agent gadobutrol in primary human T cells.








Abstract
Intracellular delivery of membrane&#8208;impermeable cargo offers unique opportunities for biological research and the development of cell&#8208;based therapies. Despite the breadth of available intracellular delivery tools, existing protocols are often suboptimal and alternative approaches that merge delivery efficiency with both biocompatibility, as well as applicability, remain highly sought after. Here, a comprehensive platform is presented that exploits the unique property of cationic hydrogel nanoparticles to transiently disrupt the plasma membrane of cells, allowing direct cytosolic delivery of uncomplexed membrane&#8208;impermeable cargo. Using this platform, which is termed Hydrogel&#8208;enabled nanoPoration or HyPore, the delivery of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)&#8211;dextran macromolecules in various cancer cell lines and primary bovine corneal epithelial cells is convincingly demonstrated. Of note, HyPore demonstrates efficient FITC&#8208;dextran delivery in primary human T cells, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electroporation&#8208;mediated delivery. Moreover, the HyPore platform enables cytosolic delivery of functional proteins, including a histone&#8208;binding nanobody as well as the enzymes granzyme A and Cre&#8208;recombinase. Finally, HyPore&#8208;mediated delivery of the MRI contrast agent gadobutrol in primary human T cells significantly improves their T1&#8208;weighted MRI signal intensities compared to electroporation. Taken together, HyPore is proposed as a straightforward, highly versatile, and cost&#8208;effective technique for high&#8208;throughput, ex vivo manipulation of primary cells and cell lines.

Moreover, the HyPore platform enables cytosolic delivery of functional proteins, including a histone-binding nanobody as well as the enzymes granzyme A and Cre-recombinase. Finally, HyPore-mediated delivery of the MRI contrast agent gadobutrol in primary human T cells significantly improves their &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted MRI signal intensities compared to electroporation. Taken together, HyPore is proposed as a straightforward, highly versatile, and cost-effective technique for high-throughput, ex vivo manipulation of primary cells and cell lines.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>In Situ TEM Imaging of Solution&#8208;Phase Chemical Reactions Using 2D&#8208;Heterostructure Mixing Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 2D&#8208;heterostructure mixing cell allows sub&#8208;nanometer resolution characterization of calcium carbonate precipitation via nonclassical nucleation using scanning transmission electron microscopy. A trigger&#8208;based mixing mechanism using controlled damage to the MoS2 membrane enables visualization of the entire reaction timeline with high spatial resolution, including liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation, formation of amorphous calcium carbonate, and crystallization.








Abstract
Liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy is used to study a wide range of chemical processes, where its unique combination of spatial and temporal resolution provides countless insights into nanoscale reaction dynamics. However, achieving sub&#8208;nanometer resolution has proved difficult due to limitations in the current liquid cell designs. Here, a novel experimental platform for in situ mixing using a specially developed 2D heterostructure&#8208;based liquid cell is presented. The technique facilitates in situ atomic resolution imaging and elemental analysis, with mixing achieved within the immediate viewing area via controllable nanofracture of an atomically thin separation membrane. This novel technique is used to investigate the time evolution of calcium carbonate synthesis, from the earliest stages of nanodroplet precursors to crystalline calcite in a single experiment. The observations provide the first direct visual confirmation of the recently developed liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation theory, while the technological advancements open an avenue for many other studies of early stage solution&#8208;phase reactions of great interest for both the exploration of fundamental science and developing applications.

         <title>Emerging 2D Memory Devices for In&#8208;Memory Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;memory computing that performs computations in situ within a nonvolatile memory unit is considered as one of the mainstream hardware implementations for future data&#8208;intensive computing applications. The recent progress from 2D memory devices to their applications for in&#8208;memory computing is summarized, and the current challenges and potential strategies in this exciting field are proposed.








Abstract
It is predicted that the conventional von Neumann computing architecture cannot meet the demands of future data&#8208;intensive computing applications due to the bottleneck between the processing and memory units. To try to solve this problem, in&#8208;memory computing technology, where calculations are carried out in situ within each nonvolatile memory unit, has been intensively studied. Among various candidate materials, 2D layered materials have recently demonstrated many new features that have been uniquely exploited to build next&#8208;generation electronics. Here, the recent progress of 2D memory devices is reviewed for in&#8208;memory computing. For each memory configuration, their operation mechanisms and memory characteristics are described, and their pros and cons are weighed. Subsequently, their versatile applications for in&#8208;memory computing technology, including logic operations, electronic synapses, and random number generation are presented. Finally, the current challenges and potential strategies for future 2D in&#8208;memory computing systems are also discussed at the material, device, circuit, and architecture levels. It is hoped that this manuscript could give a comprehensive review of 2D memory devices and their applications in in&#8208;memory computing, and be helpful for this exciting research area.

         <title>Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescence from an Exciplex&#8208;Based Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In an ordinal exciplex&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED), injected holes and electrons immediately recombine to emit light. Meanwhile, an organic long&#8208;persistent luminescent (OLPL) system can store holes and electrons for a long time and exhibit luminescence by recombination. By optimizing the light&#8208;emitting layer of the exciplex&#8208;based OLED, OLPL from an OLED is achieved.








Abstract
Organic long&#8208;persistent luminescent systems (OLPLs) exhibiting long&#8208;lasting emission after photoexcitation consist of organic electron donors and acceptors, that are widely used in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Although OLPLs and OLEDs include very similar excitonic processes, long&#8208;lasting emission has never been observed in OLEDs. This study confirms the presence of long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) under electrical excitation.

         <title>Heterochromatic Nonlinear Optical Responses in Upconversion Nanoparticles for Super&#8208;Resolution Nanoscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diverse photoresponses from different energy levels in lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles are proposed to simultaneously generate multiple point spread functions for improving the super&#8208;resolution imaging quality. The method requires only one doughnut&#8208;shaped scanning excitation beam that extends the capabilities of the engineered point spread functions to cover both low&#8208; and high&#8208;frequency information for optimizing the averaged resolution.








Abstract
Point spread function (PSF) engineering by an emitter's response can code higher&#8208;spatial&#8208;frequency information of an image for microscopy to achieve super&#8208;resolution. However, complexed excitation optics or repetitive scans are needed, which explains the issues of low speed, poor stability, and operational complexity associated with the current laser scanning microscopy approaches. Here, the diverse emission responses of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are reported for super&#8208;resolution nanoscopy to improve the imaging quality and speed. The method only needs a doughnut&#8208;shaped scanning excitation beam at an appropriate power density. By collecting the four&#8208;photon emission of single UCNPs, the high&#8208;frequency information of a super&#8208;resolution image can be resolved through the doughnut&#8208;emission PSF. Meanwhile, the two&#8208;photon state of the same nanoparticle is oversaturated, so that the complementary lower&#8208;frequency information of the super&#8208;resolution image can be simultaneously collected by the Gaussian&#8208;like emission PSF. This leads to a method of Fourier&#8208;domain heterochromatic fusion, which allows the extended capability of the engineered PSFs to cover both low&#8208; and high&#8208;frequency information to yield optimized image quality. This approach achieves a spatial resolution of 40&#160;nm, 1/24th of the excitation wavelength. This work suggests a new scope for developing nonlinear multi&#8208;color emitting probes in super&#8208;resolution nanoscopy.

         <title>Design of Chemically Stable Organic Perovskite Quantum Dots for Micropatterned Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes through Kinetic Control of a Cross&#8208;Linkable Ligand System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fast degradation of perovskite quantum dots (QDs) prevents the development of multicolor patterning technologies using these materials. Therefore, novel ligand systems for microsized EL device fabrication, which protect perovskite QDs from degradation through the binding kinetic control of surface ligands, are developed. The present system remains stable in various chemical environments, without critical deterioration of optical and electrical properties.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dot (QD) light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are ideal for next&#8208;generation display applications because of their excellent color purity, high efficiency, and cost&#8208;effective fabrication. However, developing a technology for high&#8208;resolution multicolor patterning of perovskite QDs remains challenging, owing to the chemical instability of these materials. To overcome these issues, in this work, the generation of surface defects is prevented by controlling the ligand&#8208;binding kinetics using a stable ligand system (Stable LS). The crystalline reconstruction of perovskite QDs after addition of the Stable LS results in an &#8776;18% increase in their photoluminescence quantum yield in solution and it also improves the ambient stability of the perovskite QD solution. Moreover, the perovskite QDs with Stable LS can undergo cross&#8208;linking under UV irradiation. The tightly bridged perovskite QDs effectively prevent moisture&#8208;assisted ligand dissociation in film state due to the increased hydrophobicity and restricted movement of the cross&#8208;linked surface ligands. Thus, the cross&#8208;linked perovskite QD film shows improved chemical/environmental stability without substantial deterioration in optoelectrical properties. As a result, a white electroluminescent device with high resolution (&#8776;1 &#956;m) is successfully fabricated by inkjet printing using green and red perovskite QDs.

To overcome these issues, in this work, the generation of surface defects is prevented by controlling the ligand-binding kinetics using a stable ligand system (Stable LS). The crystalline reconstruction of perovskite QDs after addition of the Stable LS results in an &#8776;18% increase in their photoluminescence quantum yield in solution and it also improves the ambient stability of the perovskite QD solution. Moreover, the perovskite QDs with Stable LS can undergo cross-linking under UV irradiation. The tightly bridged perovskite QDs effectively prevent moisture-assisted ligand dissociation in film state due to the increased hydrophobicity and restricted movement of the cross-linked surface ligands. Thus, the cross-linked perovskite QD film shows improved chemical/environmental stability without substantial deterioration in optoelectrical properties. As a result, a white electroluminescent device with high resolution (&#8776;1 &#956;m) is successfully fabricated by inkjet printing using green and red perovskite QDs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Simultaneously Toughening and Stiffening Elastomers with Octuple Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired multifunctional elastomer with both high fracture toughness and high Young's modulus is designed, breaking through the current trade&#8208;off present in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. The octuple hydrogen bonding promotes the formation of ultrastrong nanodomains, which, together with a soft poly(dimethylsiloxane)&#8208;rich phase, form a bicontinuous network structure. Such hierarchical networks with ultrastrong nanodomains enhance the mechanical properties.








Abstract
Current synthetic elastomers suffer from the well&#8208;known trade&#8208;off between toughness and stiffness. By a combination of multiscale experiments and atomistic simulations, a transparent unfilled elastomer with simultaneously enhanced toughness and stiffness is demonstrated. The designed elastomer comprises homogeneous networks with ultrastrong, reversible, and sacrificial octuple hydrogen bonding (HB), which evenly distribute the stress to each polymer chain during loading, thus enhancing stretchability and delaying fracture. Strong HBs and corresponding nanodomains enhance the stiffness by restricting the network mobility, and at the same time improve the toughness by dissipating energy during the transformation between different configurations. In addition, the stiffness mismatch between the hard HB domain and the soft poly(dimethylsiloxane)&#8208;rich phase promotes crack deflection and branching, which can further dissipate energy and alleviate local stress. These cooperative mechanisms endow the elastomer with both high fracture toughness (17016 J m&#8722;2) and high Young's modulus (14.7&#160;MPa), circumventing the trade&#8208;off between toughness and stiffness. This work is expected to impact many fields of engineering requiring elastomers with unprecedented mechanical performance.

         <title>Microchannel and Nanofiber Array Morphology Enhanced Rapid Superspreading on Animals&#8217; Corneas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The respective roles of nanoscale and microscale structures in the rapid superspreading effect are explicitly clarified: the superspreading is induced by in&#8208;/out&#8208;of&#8208;plane nanocapillary forces among the nanofiber array; the microchannel is responsible for tremendously speeding up the superspreading process.








Abstract
The dynamic spreading phenomenon of liquids is vital for both understanding wetting mechanisms and visual reaction time&#8208;related applications. However, how to control and accelerate the spreading process is still an enormous challenge. Here, a unique microchannel and nanofiber array morphology enhanced rapid superspreading (RSS) effect on animals&#8217; corneas with a superspreading time (ST) of 830 ms is found, and the respective roles of the nanofiber array and the microchannel in the RSS effect are explicitly demonstrated. Specifically, the superspreading is induced by in&#8208;/out&#8208;of&#8208;plane nanocapillary forces among the nanofiber array; the microchannel is responsible for tremendously speeding up the superspreading process. Inspired by the RSS strategy, not only is an RSS surface fabricated with an ST of only 450 ms, which is, respectively, more than 26 and 1.8 times faster than conventional superamphiphilic surfaces and animal's corneas and can be applied as RSS surfaces on video monitors to record clear videos, but also it is demonstrated that the RSS effect has tremendous potential as advanced ophthalmic material surfaces to enhance its biocompatibility for clear vision.

         <title>Amorphous Domains in Black Titanium Dioxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the diffusion of oxygen vacancies from the surface to inside, the regional dual structure with anisotropic oxygen vacancies at both the surface and in the interior of TiO2 is obtained by constructing amorphous domains. The as&#8208;prepared sample exhibits superior catalytic activity, which can immediately degrade rhodamine B solution to colorless with a shake.








Abstract
Although oxygen vacancies (Ovs) play a critical role for many applications of metal oxides, a controllable synthetic strategy for anisotropic Ovs remains a great challenge. Here, a novel strategy is proposed to achieve the regional dual structure with anisotropic Ovs at both the surface and in the interior of TiO2 by constructing amorphous domains. The as&#8208;prepared black TiO2 with amorphous domains exhibits superior activity in degrading rhodamine B (RhB) solutions, which can instantly decompose RhB with just a shake. First&#8208;principle simulations reveal that subsurface Ovs in TiO2 are energetically favored, resulting in the formation of amorphous domains in the interior region via diffusion of surface&#8208;formed Ovs into the subsurface. The stable Ov&#8208;induced amorphous domains in TiO2 with enhanced catalytic performances provide a scalable strategy to practical Ov engineering in functional metal oxides.

         <title>General Synthesis of Ultrafine Monodispersed Hybrid Nanoparticles from Highly Stable Monomicelles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of ultrasmall hybrid nanoparticles with great uniformity, monodispersity, and tunable shell thickness is successfully synthesized by a facile thermo&#8208;kinetics&#8208;mediated copolymer monomicelle approach. This monomicelle with a solidified polystyrene core has ultrahigh thermodynamic stability. Combined with a unique core&#8211;shell&#8211;corona structure, this monomicelle is a very general template to synthesize various ultrasmall, monodispersed hybrid nanoparticles with excellent uniformity.








Abstract
Ultrafine nanoparticles with organic&#8211;inorganic hybridization have essential roles in myriad applications. Over the past three decades, although various efforts on the formation of organic or inorganic ultrasmall nanoparticles have been made, ultrafine organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanoparticles have scarcely been achieved. Herein, a family of ultrasmall hybrid nanoparticles with a monodisperse, uniform size is synthesized by a facile thermo&#8208;kinetics&#8208;mediated copolymer monomicelle approach. These thermo&#8208;kinetics&#8208;mediated monomicelles with amphiphilic ABC triblock copolymers are structurally robust due to their solidified polystyrene core, endowing them with ultrahigh thermodynamic stability, which is difficult to achieve using Pluronic surfactant&#8208;based micelles (e.g., F127). This great stability combined with a core&#8211;shell&#8211;corona structure makes the monodispersed monomicelles a robust template for the precise synthesis of ultrasmall hybrid nanoparticles with a highly uniform size. As a demonstration, the obtained micelles/SiO2 hybrid nanoparticles display ultrafine sizes, excellent uniformity, monodispersity, and tunable structural parameters (diameters: 24&#8211;47 nm and thin shell thickness: 2.0&#8211;4.0 nm). Notably, this approach is universal for creating a variety of multifunctional ultrasmall hybrid nanostructures, involving organic/organic micelle/polymers (polydopamine) nanoparticles, organic/inorganic micelle/metal oxides (ZnO, TiO2, Fe2O3), micelle/hydroxides (Co(OH)2), micelle/noble metals (Ag), and micelle/TiO2/SiO2 hybrid composites. As a proof of concept, the ultrasmall micelle/SiO2 hybrid nanoparticles demonstrate superior toughness as biomimetic materials.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered In Situ Gelation of Hydrogels using 2D Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS2) Nanoassemblies as Crosslink Epicenter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;triggered in situ gelation of nanoengineered hydrogels using 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoassemblies is demonstrated. The in situ gelation of nanoengineered hydrogels has strong potential for a range of biomedical applications, including phototherapy, 3D printing, and therapeutic delivery.








Abstract
Light&#8208;responsive biomaterials are an emerging class of materials used for developing noninvasive, noncontact, precise, and controllable biomedical devices. Long&#8208;wavelength near&#8208;infrared (NIR) radiation is an attractive light source for in situ gelation due to its higher penetration depth and minimum side effects. The conventional approach to obtain crosslinked biomaterials relies heavily on the use of a photoinitiator by generating reactive species when exposed to short&#8208;wavelength radiation, which is detrimental to surrounding cells and tissue. Here, a new class of NIR&#8208;triggered in situ gelation system based on defect&#8208;rich 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoassemblies and thiol&#8208;functionalized thermoresponsive polymer in the absence of a photoinitiator is introduced. Exposure to NIR radiation activates the dynamic polymer&#8211;nanomaterials interactions by leveraging the photothermal characteristics of MoS2 and intrinsic phase transition ability of the thermoresponsive polymer. Specifically, upon NIR exposure, MoS2 acts as a crosslink epicenter by connecting with multiple polymeric chains via defect&#8208;driven click chemistry. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the utility of NIR&#8208;triggered in situ gelation is demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, the crosslinked gel exhibits the potential for NIR light&#8208;responsive release of encapsulated therapeutics. These light&#8208;responsive biomaterials have strong potential for a range of biomedical applications, including artificial muscle, smart actuators, 3D/4D printing, regenerative medicine, and therapeutic delivery.

         <title>Stereoisomerization during Molecular Packing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new isomerization phenomenon occurring during molecular packing is reported. Such a new type of isomerization tends to offer tight molecular packing with fewer voids in stacking, resulting in unique packing with abundant CH&#8230;&#960; interactions. The unique packing in the solid state favors the restriction of intramolecular motion, resulting in highly efficient organic solids with quantum yields approaching unity.








Abstract
Isomerization is an essential chemical process that often evokes dramatic change of chemical, physical, or biological properties. For a long time, isomerization has been known as a transformation that is induced by certain external energy such as light, heat, or mechanical force. Herein, a new isomerization phenomenon is described, which does not require external energy but simply occurs during molecular packing. The proposed isomerization is demonstrated by a series of symmetric donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) molecules, the donor of which may adopt two different stereoisomeric forms. Based on the evidence of the asymmetric isomers in crystals, the occurrence of isomerization during molecular packing is proved. Moreover, the unique asymmetric geometry in the solid state favors the restriction of intramolecular motion, resulting in highly efficient organic solids with quantum yields approaching unity.

         <title>Mechanism and Timescales of Reversible p&#8208;Doping of Methylammonium Lead Triiodide by Oxygen</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylammonium lead triiodide thin films exhibit intrinsic semiconductor electronic properties in the absence of oxygen. Exposure to oxygen or air leads to pronounced p&#8208;doping throughout the films, predominantly due to molecular oxygen substitution of iodine vacancies. This mechanism is reversible, and oxygen&#8208;doped films return to intrinsic upon storage in ultrahigh vacuum.








Abstract
Understanding and controlling the energy level alignment at interfaces with metal halide perovskites (MHPs) is essential for realizing the full potential of these materials for use in optoelectronic devices. To date, however, the basic electronic properties of MHPs are still under debate. Particularly, reported Fermi level positions in the energy gap vary from indicating strong n&#8208; to strong p&#8208;type character for nominally identical materials, raising serious questions about intrinsic and extrinsic defects as dopants. &#8203;In this work, photoemission experiments demonstrate that thin films of the prototypical methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) behave like an intrinsic semiconductor in the absence of oxygen. Oxygen is then shown to be able to reversibly diffuse into and out of the MAPbI3 bulk, requiring rather long saturation timescales of &#8776;1 h (in: ambient air) and over 10 h (out: ultrahigh vacuum), for few 100&#160;nm thick films. Oxygen in the bulk leads to pronounced p&#8208;doping, positioning the Fermi level universally &#8776;0.55&#160;eV above the valence band maximum. The key doping mechanism is suggested to be molecular oxygen substitution of iodine vacancies, supported by density functional theory calculations. This insight rationalizes previous and future electronic property studies of MHPs and calls for meticulous oxygen exposure protocols.

         <title>A Quinoxaline&#8208;Based D&#8211;A Copolymer Donor Achieving 17.62% Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two D&#8211;A copolymers, PBQ5 and PBQ6, are designed and synthesized based on difluoroquinoxaline (DFQ) units with different side chains. The organic solar cell (OSC) based on PBQ6 as donor and Y6 as acceptor achieves a high power conversion efficiency of 17.62%, which is one of the highest efficiencies for binary OSCs with a polymer donor and Y6 acceptor.








Abstract
Side&#8208;chain engineering has been an effective strategy in tuning electronic energy levels, intermolecular interaction, and aggregation morphology of organic photovoltaic materials, which is very important for improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, two D&#8211;A copolymers, PBQ5 and PBQ6, are designed and synthesized based on bithienyl&#8208;benzodithiophene (BDTT) as the donor (D) unit, difluoroquinoxaline (DFQ) with different side chains as the acceptor (A) unit, and thiophene as the &#960;&#8208;bridges. PBQ6 with two alkyl&#8208;substituted fluorothiophene side chains on the DFQ units possesses redshifted absorption, stronger intermolecular interaction, and higher hole mobility than PBQ5 with two alkyl side chains on the DFQ units. The blend film of the PBQ6 donor with the Y6 acceptor shows higher and balanced hole/electron mobilities, less charge carrier recombination, and more favorable aggregation morphology. Therefore, the OSC based on PBQ6:Y6 achieves a PCE as high as 17.62% with a high fill factor of 77.91%, which is significantly higher than the PCE (15.55%) of the PBQ5:Y6&#8208;based OSC. The PCE of 17.62% is by far one of the highest efficiencies for the binary OSCs with polymer donor and Y6 acceptor.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanometer Nanobelts Based on Titanium Dioxide/Zirconium Dioxide&#8211;Polyoxometalate Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZrO2&#8211;PMoO (PMZ) sub&#8208;nanobelts (SNBs) and TiO2&#8211;PMoO (PMT) SNBs are constructed through a nanoclusters gathering&#8211;transforming process, composed of ZrO2/TiO2 and polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters, showing high catalytic activity and stability in the oxidative desulfurization reaction at room temperature. The POM nanoclusters not only facilitate the formation of SNBs, but also perform as catalytic centers.








Abstract
In addition to offering conformational flexibility, sub&#8208;nanometer nanobelts (SNBs) also outperform many larger nanobelts with large size owing to their ultrathin morphologies. However, to date, only a few monocomponent SNBs have been synthesized. This study presents a facile method for synthesizing ZrO2&#8211;PMoO (PMZ) SNBs and TiO2&#8211;PMoO (PMT) SNBs with heterostructures. The SNBs comprise ZrO2/TiO2 and polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters, which are formed via the aggregation and subsequent transformation of nanoclusters. Significantly, these SNBs demonstrate high catalytic activity and stability in oxidative desulfurization reactions at room temperature. The impressive catalytic performance of the SNBs is aided by the POM nanoclusters, which not only coassemble with ZrO2/TiO2 nuclei to form building blocks of PMZ SNBs/PMT SNBs but also serve as catalytic centers. The catalytic performance is further enhanced by the ZrO2/TiO2 in the SNBs. Moreover, the proposed synthesis method can be utilized to produce other SNBs. Thus, this method provides valuable insights into the strong performance properties of SNBs created by combining metal oxides and POM nanoclusters into SNBs, which have great potential as redox catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;PMoO (PMZ) sub-nanobelts (SNBs) and TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;PMoO (PMT) SNBs are constructed through a nanoclusters gathering&#8211;transforming process, composed of ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters, showing high catalytic activity and stability in the oxidative desulfurization reaction at room temperature. The POM nanoclusters not only facilitate the formation of SNBs, but also perform as catalytic centers.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to offering conformational flexibility, sub-nanometer nanobelts (SNBs) also outperform many larger nanobelts with large size owing to their ultrathin morphologies. However, to date, only a few monocomponent SNBs have been synthesized. This study presents a facile method for synthesizing ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;PMoO (PMZ) SNBs and TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;PMoO (PMT) SNBs with heterostructures. The SNBs comprise ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters, which are formed via the aggregation and subsequent transformation of nanoclusters. Significantly, these SNBs demonstrate high catalytic activity and stability in oxidative desulfurization reactions at room temperature. The impressive catalytic performance of the SNBs is aided by the POM nanoclusters, which not only coassemble with ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nuclei to form building blocks of PMZ SNBs/PMT SNBs but also serve as catalytic centers. The catalytic performance is further enhanced by the ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the SNBs. Moreover, the proposed synthesis method can be utilized to produce other SNBs. Thus, this method provides valuable insights into the strong performance properties of SNBs created by combining metal oxides and POM nanoclusters into SNBs, which have great potential as redox catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Switching of a Magnet by Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque from a Topological Dirac Semimetal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature switching of magnetization in a CoFeB thin film by a spin&#8208;orbit torque from a neighboring topological Dirac semimetal &#945;&#8208;Sn thin film is reported. The &#945;&#8208;Sn film is grown by sputtering on a silicon substrate. The switching is driven mainly by the topological surface states in the &#945;&#8208;Sn. The switching efficiency is comparable to that in topological&#8208;insulator&#8208;based structures.








Abstract
Recent experiments show that topological surface states (TSS) in topological insulators (TI) can be exploited to manipulate magnetic ordering in ferromagnets. In principle, TSS should also exist for other topological materials, but it remains unexplored as to whether such states can also be utilized to manipulate ferromagnets. Herein, current&#8208;induced magnetization switching enabled by TSS in a non&#8208;TI topological material, namely, a topological Dirac semimetal &#945;&#8208;Sn, is reported. The experiments use an &#945;&#8208;Sn/Ag/CoFeB trilayer structure. The magnetization in the CoFeB layer can be switched by a charge current at room temperature, without an external magnetic field. The data show that the switching is driven by the TSS of the &#945;&#8208;Sn layer, rather than spin&#8208;orbit coupling in the bulk of the &#945;&#8208;Sn layer or current&#8208;produced heating. The switching efficiency is as high as in TI systems. This shows that the topological Dirac semimetal &#945;&#8208;Sn is as promising as TI materials in terms of spintronic applications.

         <title>Small&#8208;Scale Magnetic Actuators with Optimal Six Degrees&#8208;of&#8208;Freedom</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic miniature robots (MMRs) are small, untethered actuators that can be controlled by magnetic fields. This work introduces optimal MMRs that can display unprecedented dexterity, manipulation capabilities, and soft&#8208;bodied mechanical functionalities. It is envisioned that this work can inspire future MMRs to be significantly more competent across a vast range of applications in robotics, materials science, and biomedicine.








Abstract
Magnetic miniature robots (MMRs) are small&#8208;scale, untethered actuators which can be controlled by magnetic fields. As these actuators can non&#8208;invasively access highly confined and enclosed spaces; they have great potential to revolutionize numerous applications in robotics, materials science, and biomedicine. While the creation of MMRs with six&#8208;degrees&#8208;of&#8208;freedom (six&#8208;DOF) represents a major advancement for this class of actuators, these robots are not widely adopted due to two critical limitations: i) under precise orientation control, these MMRs have slow sixth&#8208;DOF angular velocities (4&#160;degree s&#8722;1) and it is difficult to apply desired magnetic forces on them; ii) such MMRs cannot perform soft&#8208;bodied functionalities. Here a fabrication method that can magnetize optimal MMRs to produce 51&#8211;297&#8208;fold larger sixth&#8208;DOF torque than existing small&#8208;scale, magnetic actuators is introduced. A universal actuation method that is applicable for rigid and soft MMRs with six&#8208;DOF is also proposed. Under precise orientation control, the optimal MMRs can execute full six&#8208;DOF motions reliably and achieve sixth&#8208;DOF angular velocities of 173&#160;degree s&#8722;1. The soft MMRs can display unprecedented functionalities; the six&#8208;DOF jellyfish&#8208;like robot can swim across barriers impassable by existing similar devices and the six&#8208;DOF gripper is 20&#8208;folds quicker than its five&#8208;DOF predecessor in completing a complicated, small&#8208;scale assembly.

         <title>Enhancing Light&#8211;Matter Interactions in MoS2 by Copper Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intercalation of uniformly distributed copper into the van der Waals gap of vertically aligned MoS2 grown by chemical vapor deposition improves photodiode device performance. The intercalated MoS2 remains semiconducting and possesses a unique plasmon resonance at an energy of &#8776;1&#160;eV. Remarkably enhanced photoresponse from the ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared regime is presented.








Abstract
The intercalation of layered compounds opens up a vast space of new host&#8211;guest hybrids, providing new routes for tuning the properties of materials. Here, it is shown that uniform and continuous layers of copper can be intercalated within the van der Waals gap of bulk MoS2 resulting in a unique Cu&#8211;MoS2 hybrid. The new Cu&#8211;MoS2 hybrid, which remains semiconducting, possesses a unique plasmon resonance at an energy of &#8776;1eV, giving rise to enhanced optoelectronic activity. Compared with high&#8208;performance MoS2 photodetectors, copper&#8208;enhanced devices are superior in their spectral response, which extends into the infrared, and also in their total responsivity, which exceeds 104 A W&#8722;1. The Cu&#8211;MoS2 hybrids hold promise for supplanting current night&#8208;vision technology with compact, advanced multicolor night vision.

         <title>Thickness&#8208;Dependent Elastic Softening of Few&#8208;Layer Free&#8208;Standing MoSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8208;plane elastic constants of a few&#8208;layer suspended 2H&#8208;MoSe2 soften about 30% while decreasing the thickness from bulk to three&#8208;layers. The results obtained employing the contactless technique indicate the so&#8208;called negative elastic size&#8208;effect.








Abstract
Few&#8208;layer van der Waals (vdW) materials have been extensively investigated in terms of their exceptional electronic, optoelectronic, optical, and thermal properties. Simultaneously, a complete evaluation of their mechanical properties remains an undeniable challenge due to the small lateral sizes of samples and the limitations of experimental tools. In particular, there is no systematic experimental study providing unambiguous evidence on whether the reduction of vdW thickness down to few layers results in elastic softening or stiffening with respect to the bulk. In this work, micro&#8208;Brillouin light scattering is employed to investigate the anisotropic elastic properties of single&#8208;crystal free&#8208;standing 2H&#8208;MoSe2 as a function of thickness, down to three molecular layers. The so&#8208;called elastic size effect, that is, significant and systematic elastic softening of the material with decreasing numbers of layers is reported. In addition, this approach allows for a complete mechanical examination of few&#8208;layer membranes, that is, their elasticity, residual stress, and thickness, which can be easily extended to other vdW materials. The presented results shed new light on the ongoing debate on the elastic size&#8208;effect and are relevant for performance and durability of implementation of vdW materials as resonators, optoelectronic, and thermoelectric&#160;devices.

         <title>Electronic and Magnetic Characterization of Epitaxial CrBr3 Monolayers on a Superconducting Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic and magnetic properties of a 2D monolayer ferromagnet on a layered superconducting substrate are studied using different experimental techniques and theoretical calculations. It is confirmed that the chromium tribromide monolayer retains its ferromagnetic order and induces proximitized magnetism on the underlying superconductor niobium diselenide. The results contribute to the broader framework of exploiting proximity effects to realize novel phenomena in 2D heterostructures.








Abstract
The ability to imprint a given material property to another through a proximity effect in layered 2D materials has opened the way to the creation of designer materials. Here, molecular&#8208;beam epitaxy is used for direct synthesis of a superconductor&#8211;ferromagnet heterostructure by combining superconducting niobium diselenide (NbSe2) with the monolayer ferromagnetic chromium tribromide (CrBr3). Using different characterization techniques and density&#8208;functional theory calculations, it is confirmed that the CrBr3 monolayer retains its ferromagnetic ordering with a magnetocrystalline anisotropy favoring an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin orientation. Low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy measurements show a slight reduction of the superconducting gap of NbSe2 and the formation of a vortex lattice on the CrBr3 layer in experiments under an external magnetic field. The results contribute to the broader framework of exploiting proximity effects to realize novel phenomena in 2D&#160;heterostructures.

         <title>mRNA Delivery of a Bispecific Single&#8208;Domain Antibody to Polarize Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages and Synergize Immunotherapy against Liver Malignancies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative single&#8208;domain antibody that bispecifically binds and neutralizes CCL2 and CCL5 (BisCCL2/5i) is evolved using yeast surface display. mRNAs encoding BisCCL2/5i or a PD&#8208;1 ligand inhibitor (PD&#8208;Li) are encapsulated and delivered via clinically amenable lipid nanoparticles. Combination of BisCCL2/5i with PD&#8208;Li achieves long&#8208;term survival in mouse models of primary liver cancer and liver metastasis of colorectal and pancreatic cancers.








Abstract
Liver malignancies are among the tumor types that are resistant to immune checkpoint inhibition therapy. Tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) are highly enriched and play a major role in inducing immunosuppression in liver malignancies. Herein, CCL2 and CCL5 are screened as two major chemokines responsible for attracting TAM infiltration and inducing their polarization toward cancer&#8208;promoting M2&#8208;phenotype. To reverse this immunosuppressive process, an innovative single&#8208;domain antibody that bispecifically binds and neutralizes CCL2 and CCL5 (BisCCL2/5i) with high potency and specificity is directly evolved. mRNA encoding BisCCL2/5i is encapsulated in a clinically approved lipid nanoparticle platform, resulting in a liver&#8208;homing biomaterial that allows transient yet efficient expression of BisCCL2/5i in the diseased organ in a multiple dosage manner. This BisCCL2/5i mRNA nanoplatform significantly induces the polarization of TAMs toward the antitumoral M1 phenotype and reduces immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. The combination of BisCCL2/5i with PD&#8208;1 ligand inhibitor (PD&#8208;Li) achieves long&#8208;term survival in mouse models of primary liver cancer and liver metastasis of colorectal and pancreatic cancers. The work provides an effective bispecific targeting strategy that could broaden the PD&#8208;Li therapy to multiple types of malignancies in the human liver.

         <title>Disorder&#8208;Induced Material&#8208;Insensitive Optical Response in Plasmonic Nanostructures: Vibrant Structural Colors from Noble Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optical response of materials, either at the macroscale or the nanoscale, is determined by their unique dielectric functions. Assisted by intrinsic disorder in fabrication, material&#8208;insensitive reflection is achieved from plasmonic nanostructures composed of different noble metals. The disorder&#8208;induced disentanglement between the optical response and the material properties may inspire novel applications ranging from photocatalysis to Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Materials show various responses to incident light, owing to their unique dielectric functions. A well&#8208;known example is the distinct colors displayed by metals, providing probably the simplest method to identify gold, silver, and bronze since ancient times. With the advancement of nanotechnology, optical structures with feature sizes smaller than the optical wavelength have been routinely achieved. In this regime, the optical response is also determined by the geometry of the nanostructures, inspiring flourishing progress in plasmonics, photonic crystals, and metamaterials. Nevertheless, the nature of the materials still plays a decisive role in light&#8211;matter interactions, and this material&#8208;dependent optical response is widely accepted as a norm in nanophotonics. Here, a counterintuitive system&#8212;plasmonic nanostructures composed of different materials but exhibiting almost identical reflection&#8212;is proposed and realized. The geometric disorder embedded in the system overwhelms the contribution of the material properties to the electrodynamics. Both numerical simulations and experimental results provide concrete evidence of the insensitivity of the optical response to different plasmonic materials. The same optical response is preserved with various materials, providing great flexibility of freedom in material selection. As a result, the proposed configuration may shed light on novel applications ranging from Raman spectroscopy, photocatalysis, to nonlinear&#160;optics.

         <title>Atomically Thin Sheets of Lead&#8208;Free 1D Hybrid Perovskites Feature Tunable White&#8208;Light Emission from Self&#8208;Trapped Excitons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin crystals of the 1D organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite [C7H10N]3[BiCl5]Cl featuring covalent bonds only in one direction are exfoliated down to single layers. The unique 1D&#8211;2D structure enables self&#8208;trapped excitons with white&#8208;light emission and an extremely strong shift of the emission energy as a result of the thickness dependence of the exciton self&#8208;trapping.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites synergize the virtues of two unique classes of materials featuring intriguing possibilities for next&#8208;generation optoelectronics: they offer tailorable building blocks for atomically thin, layered materials while providing the enhanced light&#8208;harvesting and emitting capabilities of hybrid perovskites. This work goes beyond the paradigm that atomically thin materials require in&#8208;plane covalent bonding and reports single layers of the 1D organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite [C7H10N]3[BiCl5]Cl. Its unique 1D&#8211;2D structure enables single layers and the formation of self&#8208;trapped excitons, which show white&#8208;light emission. The thickness dependence of the exciton self&#8208;trapping causes an extremely strong shift of the emission energy. Thus, such 2D perovskites demonstrate that already 1D covalent interactions suffice to realize atomically thin materials and provide access to unique exciton physics. These findings enable a much more general construction principle for tailoring and identifying 2D materials that are no longer limited to covalently bonded 2D sheets.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of a Durable and Liquid&#8208;Repellent Poly(dimethylsiloxane) Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;stick coating with autophobicity is fabricated by a one&#8208;step grafting&#8208;from approach for poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) brushes on surfaces. Independent of surface tension, liquid droplets can easily slide on such surfaces.








Abstract
Coatings with low sliding angles for liquid drops have a broad range of applications. However, it remains a challenge to have a fast, easy, and universal preparation method for coatings that are long&#8208;term stable, robust, and environmentally friendly. Here, a one&#8208;step grafting&#8208;from approach is reported for poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) brushes on surfaces through spontaneous polymerization of dichlorodimethylsilane fulfilling all these requirements. Drops of a variety of liquids slide off at tilt angles below 5&#176;. This non&#8208;stick coating with autophobicity can reduce the waste of water and solvents in cleaning. The strong covalent attachment of the PDMS brush to the substrate makes them mechanically robust and UV&#8208;tolerant. Their resistance to high temperatures and to droplet sliding erosion, combined with the low film thickness (&#8776;8 nm) makes them ideal candidates to solve the long&#8208;term degradation issues of coatings for heat&#8208;transfer surfaces.

         <title>Liquid Wells as Self&#8208;Healing, Functional Analogues to Solid Vessels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water can act as a solid&#8208;like wall to contain organic liquids. The resulting liquid wells possess a range of unique and interesting properties, such as being dynamic, self&#8208;healing, and functional. Because the liquid&#8208;water wall can be removed and re&#8208;formed at will, these liquid wells can serve as sacrificial templates for polymer synthesis.








Abstract
Liquids are traditionally handled and stored in solid vessels. Solid walls are not functional, adaptive, or self&#8208;repairing, and are difficult to remove and re&#8208;form. Liquid walls can overcome these limitations, but cannot form free&#8208;standing 3D walls. Herein, a liquid analogue of a well, termed a &#8220;liquid well&#8221; is introduced. Water tethered to a surface with hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophilic core&#8211;shell patterns forms stable liquid walls capable of containing another immiscible fluid, similar to fluid confinement by solid walls. Liquid wells with different liquids, volumes, and shapes are prepared and investigated by confocal and Raman microscopy. The confinement of various low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids (LSTLs) on surfaces by liquid wells can compete with or be complementary to existing confinement strategies using perfluorinated surfaces, for example, in terms of the shape and height of the confined LSTLs. Liquid wells show unique properties arising from their liquid aggregate state: they are self&#8208;healing, dynamic, and functional, that is, not restricted to a passive confining role. Water walls can be easily removed and re&#8208;formed, making them interesting as sacrificial templates. This is demonstrated in a process termed water&#8208;templated polymerization (WTP). Numerical phase&#8208;field model simulations are performed to scrutinize the conditions required for the formation of stable liquid wells.

         <title>MIL&#8208;101&#8208;Derived Mesoporous Carbon Supporting Highly Exposed Fe Single&#8208;Atom Sites as Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe SAC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;T) are successfully synthesized using NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Al)&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped carbon as supports. The abundant mesopores in the supports promote mass transport during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and ensure a high proportion of FeNx sites are accessible. Fe SAC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;1000 demonstrates outstanding activity for ORR and excellent performance in both aqueous and solid&#8208;state zinc&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe SACs) with atomic FeNx active sites are very promising alternatives to platinum&#8208;based catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The pyrolysis of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is a common approach for preparing Fe SACs, though most MOF&#8208;derived catalysts reported to date are microporous and thus suffer from poor mass transfer and a high proportion of catalytically inaccessible FeNx active sites. Herein, NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Al), a MOF possessing a mesoporous cage architecture, is used as the precursor to prepare a series of N&#8208;doped carbon supports (denoted herein as NC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;T) with a well&#8208;defined mesoporous structure at different pyrolysis temperatures. The NC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;T supports are then impregnated with a Fe(II)&#8208;phenanthroline complex, and heated again to yield Fe SAC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;T catalysts rich in accessible FeNx single atom sites. The best performing Fe SAC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;1000 catalyst offers outstanding ORR activity in alkaline media, evidenced by an ORR half&#8208;wave potential of 0.94&#160;V (vs RHE) in 0.1 m KOH, as well as excellent performance in both aqueous primary zinc&#8211;air batteries (a near maximum theoretical energy density of 984.2&#160;Wh kgZn&#8722;1) and solid&#8208;state zinc&#8211;air batteries (a peak power density of 50.6&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and a specific capacity of 724.0 mAh kgZn&#8722;1).

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Stretchable Ag2S Semiconductor Thin Films for Wearable Self&#8208;Powered Nonvolatile Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;processed synthesis of intrinsically stretchable Ag2S thin films for fabrication of self&#8208;powered stretchable resistive memory devices is presented. The device exhibits excellent switching characteristics and mechanical stretchability (52%), and extremely high thermal and environmental durability (168 h in 85 &#176;C/85% relative humidity). A self&#8208;powered memory combined with motion sensors for use as a wearable healthcare monitoring system is demonstrated.








Abstract
Compared with the large plastic deformation observed in ductile metals and organic materials, inorganic semiconductors have limited plasticity (&lt;0.2%) due to their intrinsic bonding characters, restricting their widespread applications in stretchable electronics. Herein, the solution&#8208;processed synthesis of ductile &#945;&#8208;Ag2S thin films and fabrication of all&#8208;inorganic, self&#8208;powered, and stretchable memory devices, is reported. Molecular Ag2S complex solution is synthesized by chemical reduction of Ag2S powder, fabricating wafer&#8208;scale highly crystalline Ag2S thin films. The thin films show stretchability due to the intrinsic ductility, sustaining the structural integrity at a tensile strain of 14.9%. Moreover, the fabricated Ag2S&#8208;based resistive random access memory presents outstanding bipolar switching characteristics (Ion/Ioff ratio of &#8776;105, operational endurance of 100 cycles, and retention time &gt;106 s) as well as excellent mechanical stretchability (no degradation of properties up to stretchability of 52%). Meanwhile, the device is highly durable under diverse chemical environments and temperatures from &#8722;196 to 300 &#176;C, especially maintaining the properties for 168 h in 85% relative humidity and 85 &#176;C. A self&#8208;powered memory combined with motion sensors for use as a wearable healthcare monitoring system is demonstrated, offering the potential for designing high&#8208;performance wearable electronics that are usable in daily life in a real&#8208;world setting.

         <title>2D Materials: Thickness&#8208;Dependent Elastic Softening of Few&#8208;Layer Free&#8208;Standing MoSe2 (Adv. Mater. 23/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolayer graphene is stronger than bulk graphite: the elastic properties of graphene are such that it could hypothetically withstand an elephant balancing on a pencil. A contactless optical technique, reported by Bartlomiej Graczykowski and co&#8208;workers in article number 2008614 now shows that this is not the case for MoSe2, an attractive semiconducting 2D material. This material becomes significantly softer by reducing its thickness from bulk to a few layers.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2100518, Johanna Heine and co&#8208;workers report tunable white&#8208;light emission from atomically thin sheets of the 1D hybrid perovskite [C7H10N]3[BiCl5]Cl. The unique structure enables self&#8208;trapped&#8208;exciton formation with white&#8208;light emission, and reveals the thickness dependence of the exciton self&#8208;trapping. This enables facile control of the emission color in next&#8208;generation lighting and display technologies.

The diverse photoresponses from different energy levels in lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles enables simultaneous generation of multiple point&#8208;spread functions with one doughnut&#8208;shaped excitation beam. In article number 2008847, Fan Wang, Dayong Jin, and co&#8208;workers explore a new imaging modality to extend the capabilities of the engineered point&#8208;spread functions to cover both low&#8208; and high&#8208;frequency information for optimizing the averaged resolution.

         <title>Engineering Hydrogel&#8208;Based Biomedical Photonics: Design, Fabrication, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current panorama of hydrogel&#8208;based photonics and advances in fabrication techniques toward functional optical architectures are reviewed, evaluating their capabilities in the biomedical field. Further, the future potential for hydrogel photonic constructs to integrate into live tissues, advanced biosensing platforms, microrobotics, photomedicine, and lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip technologies are discussed.








Abstract
Light guiding and manipulation in photonics have become ubiquitous in events ranging from everyday communications to complex robotics and nanomedicine. The speed and sensitivity of light&#8211;matter interactions offer unprecedented advantages in biomedical optics, data transmission, photomedicine, and detection of multi&#8208;scale phenomena. Recently, hydrogels have emerged as a promising candidate for interfacing photonics and bioengineering by combining their light&#8208;guiding properties with live tissue compatibility in optical, chemical, physiological, and mechanical dimensions. Herein, the latest progress over hydrogel photonics and its applications in guidance and manipulation of light is reviewed. Physics of guiding light through hydrogels and living tissues, and existing technical challenges in translating these tools into biomedical settings are discussed. A&#160;comprehensive and thorough overview of materials, fabrication protocols, and design architectures used in hydrogel photonics is provided. Finally, recent examples of applying structures such as hydrogel optical fibers, living photonic constructs, and their use as light&#8208;driven hydrogel robots, photomedicine tools, and organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip models are described. By providing a critical and selective evaluation of the field's status, this work sets a foundation for the next generation of hydrogel photonic research.

         <title>Halide Perovskites: A New Era of Solution&#8208;Processed Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites show high promise for electronic devices owing to exceptional electrical, optical, and structural properties. The latest breakthroughs in structural, interface, defect engineering, and pattering techniques as applied to halide perovskite transistors, memories and to improve stability issues in perovskites are reviewed. Lastly, the existing challenges and outline for future research directions are provided.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic mixed halide perovskites have emerged as an excellent class of materials with a unique combination of optoelectronic properties, suitable for a plethora of applications ranging from solar cells to light&#8208;emitting diodes and photoelectrochemical devices. Recent works have showcased hybrid perovskites for electronic applications through improvements in materials design, processing, and device stability. Herein, a comprehensive up&#8208;to&#8208;date review is presented on hybrid perovskite electronics with a focus on transistors and memories. These applications are supported by the fundamental material properties of hybrid perovskite semiconductors such as tunable bandgap, ambipolar charge transport, reasonable mobility, defect characteristics, and solution processability, which are highlighted first. Then, recent progresses on perovskite&#8208;based transistors are reviewed, covering aspects of fabrication process, patterning techniques, contact engineering, 2D versus 3D material selection, and device performance. Furthermore, applications of perovskites in nonvolatile memories and artificial synaptic devices are presented. The ambient instability of hybrid perovskites and the strategies to tackle this bottleneck are also discussed. Finally, an outlook and opportunities to develop perovskite&#8208;based electronics as a competitive and feasible technology are highlighted.

         <title>Engineering Biomolecular Self&#8208;Assembly at Solid&#8211;Liquid Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent achievements in the self&#8208;assembly of diverse 2D biomolecular architectures at solid&#8211;liquid interfaces achieved by programming interactions acting over multiple scales are summarized. Recent advances in the physical understanding of the assembly dynamics obtained via in situ atomic force microscopy are also discussed. Finally, potential applications and critical unresolved obstacles in achieving them are highlighted.








Abstract
Biomolecular self&#8208;assembly is a key process used by life to build functional materials from the &#8220;bottom up.&#8221; In the last few decades, bioengineering and bionanotechnology have borrowed this strategy to design and synthesize numerous biomolecular and hybrid materials with diverse architectures and properties. However, engineering biomolecular self&#8208;assembly at solid&#8211;liquid interfaces into predesigned architectures lags the progress made in bulk solution both in practice and theory. Here, recent achievements in programming self&#8208;assembly of peptides, proteins, and peptoids at solid&#8211;liquid interfaces are summarized and corresponding applications are described. Recent advances in the physical understandings of self&#8208;assembly pathways obtained using in situ atomic force microscopy are also discussed. These advances will lead to novel strategies for designing biomaterials organized at and interfaced with inorganic surfaces.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of the magnetism dynamics of magnetic nanoparticles and its relevance to optimizing and further developing biomedical applications is presented, with a specific focus on the applications of magnetic particle imaging and magnetic fluid hyperthermia. A summary of historical and current theoretical and computational models of nanoparticle dynamics is given.








Abstract
Magnetic nanoparticles are currently the focus of investigation for a wide range of biomedical applications that fall into the categories of imaging, sensing, and therapeutics. A deep understanding of nanoparticle magnetization dynamics is fundamental to optimization and further development of these applications. Here, a summary of theoretical models of nanoparticle dynamics is presented, and computational nonequilibrium models are outlined, which currently represent the most sophisticated methods for modeling nanoparticle dynamics. Nanoparticle magnetization response is explored in depth; the effect of applied field amplitude, as well as nanoparticle size, on the resulting rotation mechanism and timescale is investigated. Two applications in biomedicine, magnetic particle imaging and magnetic fluid hyperthermia, are highlighted.

         <title>Iron Oxide Nanoparticles as T1 Contrast Agents for Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Fundamentals, Challenges, Applications, and Prospectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamentals of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) as T1 contrast agents, the past advances, and current challenges in developing IONPs are reviewed. The key material properties and environmental variables influencing T1 and T2 contrast, and their relationships are discussed. Strategies for improving T1 contrast enhancement and directions for future research are provided.








Abstract
Gadolinium&#8208;based chelates are a mainstay of contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the clinic. However, their toxicity elicits severe side effects and the Food and Drug Administration has issued many warnings about their potential retention in patients&#8217; bodies, which causes safety concerns. Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) are a potentially attractive alternative, because of their nontoxic and biodegradable nature. Studies in developing IONPs as T1 contrast agents have generated promising results, but the complex, interrelated parameters influencing contrast enhancement make the development difficult, and IONPs suitable for T1 contrast enhancement have yet to make their way to clinical use. Here, the fundamental principles of MRI contrast agents are discussed, and the current status of MRI contrast agents is reviewed with a focus on the advantages and limitations of current T1 contrast agents and the potential of IONPs to serve as safe and improved alternative to gadolinium&#8208;based chelates. The past advances and current challenges in developing IONPs as a T1 contrast agent from a materials science perspective are presented, and how each of the key material properties and environment variables affects the performance of IONPs is assessed. Finally, some potential approaches to develop high&#8208;performance and clinically relevant T1 contrast agents are discussed.

         <title>Quantum Point Defects for Solid&#8208;State Laser Refrigeration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of point defects in realizing solid&#8208;state laser refrigeration is discussed with an emphasis on the fundamental physical phenomena and quantized electronic transitions. Lanthanide&#8208;doping&#8208;based point defects, which have advanced solid&#8208;state laser refrigeration, along with potential color centers based on fluoride vacancies and color centers in diamonds, are also addressed.








Abstract
Herein, the role that point defects have played over the last two decades in realizing solid&#8208;state laser refrigeration is discussed. A brief introduction to the field of solid&#8208;state laser refrigeration is given with an emphasis on the fundamental physical phenomena and quantized electronic transitions that have made solid&#8208;state laser&#8208;cooling possible. Lanthanide&#8208;based point defects, such as trivalent ytterbium ions (Yb3+), have played a central role in the first demonstrations and subsequent development of advanced materials for solid&#8208;state laser refrigeration. Significant discussion is devoted to the quantum mechanical description of optical transitions in lanthanide ions, and their influence on laser cooling. Transition&#8208;metal point defects have been shown to generate substantial background absorption in ceramic materials, decreasing the overall efficiency of a particular laser refrigeration material. Other potential color centers based on fluoride vacancies with multiple potential charge states are also considered. In conclusion, novel materials for solid&#8208;state laser refrigeration, including color centers in diamond that have recently been proposed to realize the solid&#8208;state laser refrigeration of semiconducting materials, are discussed.

         <title>Convergence of Machine Vision and Melt Electrowriting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Taylor cone volume is discovered to be a readily measurable and important signature process for melt electrowriting. Machine vision of the Taylor cone during processing gives essential information on process stability, including fiber pulsing, and correlates to the fiber diameter. When adopted to tubular melt electrowriting, exceptionally large volume prints can be manufactured that demonstrate elastic snap&#8208;through behavior.








Abstract
Melt electrowriting (MEW) is a high&#8208;resolution additive manufacturing technology that balances multiple parametric variables to arrive at a stable fabrication process. The better understanding of this balance is underscored here using high&#8208;resolution camera vision of jet stability profiles in different electrical fields. Complementing this visual information are fiber&#8208;diameter measurements obtained at precise points, allowing the correlation to electrified jet properties. Two process signatures&#8212;the jet angle and for the first time, the Taylor cone area&#8212;are monitored and analyzed with a machine vision system, while SEM imaging for diameter measurement correlates real&#8208;time information. This information, in turn, allows the detection and correction of fiber pulsing for accurate jet placement on the collector, and the in&#8208;process assessment of the fiber diameter. Improved process control is used to successfully fabricate collapsible MEW tubes; structures that require exceptional accuracy and printing stability. Using a precise winding angle of 60&#176; and 300 layers, the resulting 12 mm&#8208;thick tubular structures have elastic snap&#8208;through instabilities associated with mechanical metamaterials. This study provides a detailed analysis of the fiber pulsing occurrence in MEW and highlights the importance of real&#8208;time monitoring of the Taylor cone volume to better understand, control, and predict printing instabilities.

         <title>Facile Transformation of Murine and Human Primary Dendritic Cells into Robust and Modular Artificial Antigen&#8208;Presenting Systems by Intracellular Hydrogelation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial antigen cell is prepared by directly transforming live dendritic cells into a cell&#8211;gel hybrid construct by photoactivated intracellular radical polymerization, enabling the preparation of a highly robust and modular cell&#8208;mimicking biomaterial for immunoengineering. The gelated dendritic cells can be stored by lyophilization and effectively expand antigen&#8208;specific T cells for anticancer adoptive cell therapy.








Abstract
The growing enthusiasm for cancer immunotherapies and adoptive cell therapies has prompted increasing interest in biomaterials development mimicking natural antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) for T&#8208;cell expansion. In contrast to conventional bottom&#8208;up approaches aimed at layering synthetic substrates with T&#8208;cell activation cues, transformation of live dendritic cells (DCs) into artificial APCs (aAPCs) is demonstrated herein using a facile and minimally disruptive hydrogelation technique. Through direct intracellular permeation of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEG&#8208;DA) hydrogel monomer and UV&#8208;activated radical polymerization, intracellular hydrogelation is rapidly accomplished on DCs with minimal influence on cellular morphology and surface antigen display, yielding highly robust and modular cell&#8211;gel hybrid constructs amenable to peptide antigen exchange, storable by freezing and lyophilization, and functionalizable with cytokine&#8208;releasing carriers for T&#8208;cell modulation. The DC&#8208;derived aAPCs are shown to induce prolonged T&#8208;cell expansion and improve anticancer efficacy of adoptive T&#8208;cell therapy in mice compared to nonexpanded control T cells, and the gelation technique is further demonstrated to stabilize primary DCs derived from human donors. The work presents a versatile approach for generating a new class of cell&#8208;mimicking biomaterials and opens new venues for immunological interrogation and immunoengineering.

         <title>Design and Use of a Thermogelling Methylcellulose Nanoemulsion to Formulate Nanocrystalline Oral Dosage Forms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new thermogelling nanoemulsion is developed to formulate composite drug products with well&#8208;controlled active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) nanocrystals embedded in a methylcellulose matrix. The thermally gelled nanoemulsion is directly dried with the precise formation of stable API nanocrystals templated by the nanodroplets in situ. The thermogelling nanoemulsion is formulated into various dosage forms (particle, nanoparticle suspension, drug tablet, and oral thin film).








Abstract
Oral drug products have become indispensable in modern medicine because of their exceptional patient compliance. However, poor bioavailability of ubiquitous low&#8208;water&#8208;soluble active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and lack of efficient oral drug formulations remain as significant challenges. Nanocrystalline formulations are an attractive route to increase API solubility, but typically require abrasive mechanical milling and several processing steps to create an oral dosage form. Using the dual amphiphilic and thermoresponsive properties of methylcellulose (MC), a new thermogelling nanoemulsion and a facile thermal dripping method are developed for efficient formulation of composite particles with the MC matrix embedded with precisely controlled API nanocrystals. Moreover, a fast and tunable release performance is achieved with the combination of a fast&#8208;eroding MC matrix and fast&#8208;dissolving API nanocrystals. Using the versatile thermal processing approach, the thermogelling nanoemulsion is easily formulated into a wide variety of dosage forms (nanoparticle suspension, drug tablet, and oral thin film) in a manner that avoids nanomilling. Overall, the proposed thermogelling nanoemulsion platform not only broadens the applications of thermoresponsive nanoemulsions but also shows great promise for more efficient formulation of oral drug products with high quality and tunable fast release.

         <title>Advances in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: From Academic Research to Commercial Viability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The major developments and advancements of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries over the past 60 years are presented. The prospects and an outlook on the future development of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries for large&#8208;scale practical applications are also discussed.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which have revolutionized portable electronics over the past three decades, were eventually recognized with the 2019 Nobel Prize in chemistry. As the energy density of current lithium&#8208;ion batteries is approaching its limit, developing new battery technologies beyond lithium&#8208;ion chemistry is significant for next&#8208;generation high energy storage. Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, which rely on the reversible redox reactions between lithium and sulfur, appears to be a promising energy storage system to take over from the conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries for next&#8208;generation energy storage owing to their overwhelming energy density compared to the existing lithium&#8208;ion batteries today. Over the past 60 years, especially the past decade, significant academic and commercial progress has been made on Li&#8211;S batteries. From the concept of the sulfur cathode first proposed in the 1960s to the current commercial Li&#8211;S batteries used in unmanned aircraft, the story of Li&#8211;S batteries is full of breakthroughs and back tracing steps. Herein, the development and advancement of Li&#8211;S batteries in terms of sulfur&#8208;based composite cathode design, separator modification, binder improvement, electrolyte optimization, and lithium metal protection is summarized. An outlook on the future directions and prospects for Li&#8211;S batteries is also offered.

Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, which rely on the reversible redox reactions between lithium and sulfur, appears to be a promising energy storage system to take over from the conventional lithium-ion batteries for next-generation energy storage owing to their overwhelming energy density compared to the existing lithium-ion batteries today. Over the past 60 years, especially the past decade, significant academic and commercial progress has been made on Li&#8211;S batteries. From the concept of the sulfur cathode first proposed in the 1960s to the current commercial Li&#8211;S batteries used in unmanned aircraft, the story of Li&#8211;S batteries is full of breakthroughs and back tracing steps. Herein, the development and advancement of Li&#8211;S batteries in terms of sulfur-based composite cathode design, separator modification, binder improvement, electrolyte optimization, and lithium metal protection is summarized. An outlook on the future directions and prospects for Li&#8211;S batteries is also offered.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Pd&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Coordinated Biocatalysts for Chem&#8208;/Sono&#8208;/Photo&#8208;Trimodal Tumor Therapies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precisely designed Pd single&#8208;atom coordinated biocatalyst (Pd&#8208;Pta/Por) is synthesized for achieving chem&#8208;/sono&#8208;/photo&#8208;trimodal dynamic tumor therapies. Experimental results and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the Pd&#8208;Pta/Por biocatalyst consists of atomic Pd&#8208;N coordination active sites and owns efficient catalytic yield of reactive oxygen species (ROS) for highly synergistic antitumor therapies, which takes an essential step toward developing ROS&#8208;related therapeutic and biological applications.








Abstract
The diversity, complexity, and heterogeneity of malignant tumor seriously undermine the efficiency of mono&#8208;modal treatment. Recently, multi&#8208;modal therapeutics with enhanced antitumor efficiencies have attracted increasing attention. However, designing a nanotherapeutic platform with uniform morphology in nanoscale that integrates with efficient chem&#8208;/sono&#8208;/photo&#8208;trimodal tumor therapies is still a great challenge. Here, new and facile Pd&#8208;single&#8208;atom coordinated porphyrin&#8208;based polymeric networks as biocatalysts, namely, Pd&#8208;Pta/Por, for chem&#8208;/sono&#8208;/photo&#8208;trimodal tumor therapies are designed. The atomic morphology and chemical structure analysis prove that the biocatalyst consists of atomic Pd&#8208;N coordination networks with a Pd&#8208;N2&#8208;Cl2 catalytic center. The characterization of peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic activities displays that the Pd&#8208;Pta/Por can generate abundant &#8226;OH radicals for chemodynamic therapies. The ultrasound irradiation or laser excitation can significantly boost the catalytic production of 1O2 by the porphyrin&#8208;based sono&#8208;/photosensitizers to achieve combined sono&#8208;/photodynamic therapies. The superior catalytic production of &#8226;OH is further verified by density functional theory calculation. Finally, the corresponding in vitro and in vivo experiments have demonstrated their synergistic chem&#8208;/sono&#8208;/photo&#8208;trimodal antitumor efficacies. It is believed that this study provides new promising single&#8208;atom&#8208;coordinated polymeric networks with highly efficient biocatalytic sites and synergistic trimodal therapeutic effects, which may inspire many new findings in reactive oxygen species&#8208;related biological applications across broad therapeutics and biomedical fields.

         <title>2D NbOI2: A Chiral Semiconductor with Highly In&#8208;Plane Anisotropic Electrical and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NbOI2 has a strong in&#8208;plane structural anisotropy, where the [NbO2I4] octahedra are connected through I&#8211;I edges along the c&#8208;axis and cornered O atoms along the b&#8208;axis. The I anions with weaker electronegativity contribute to the electrons near the Fermi surface, leading to the highly anisotropic dispersion of band structures along the c&#8208;axis. Hence, NbOI2 exhibits large anisotropic factor of 1.75 and 1.7 for optical absorbance and photoresponsivity, which makes it a promising platform for novel polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection applications.








Abstract
Exploring in&#8208;plane anisotropic 2D materials is of great significance to the fundamental studies and further development of polarizationsensitive optoelectronics. Herein, chiral niobium oxide diiodide (NbOI2) is introduced into the intriguing anisotropic 2D family with the experimental demonstration of anisotropic optical and electrical properties. 2D NbOI2 crystals exhibit highly anisotropic dispersed band structures around the Fermi surface and strong in&#8208;plane anisotropy of phonon vibrations owing to the different bonding modes of Nb atoms along the b&#8208; and c&#8208;axes. Consequently, the anisotropic factors of optical absorbance and photoresponsivity in 2D NbOI2 crystals reach up to 1.75 and 1.7, respectively. These anisotropic properties make 2D NbOI2 an interesting platform for novel polarization&#8208;sensitive optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Tailoring of White Luminescence in a NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ Phosphor Containing Broad&#8208;Band Defect&#8208;Induced Charge&#8208;Transfer Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;component white emitter is developed by introducing defect&#8208;associated charge&#8208;transfer emission in a NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ phosphor via a facile composition modification strategy. An extra broadband yellow peak (585&#160;nm) appears in addition to the narrow&#8208;band blue emission (472&#160;nm). A single&#8208;component white light&#8208;emitting diode with color&#8208;rendering index of 82.9 is fabricated using the white phosphor.








Abstract
Single&#8208;component materials with white&#8208;light emission are ideal for lighting applications. However, it is very challenging to achieve white luminescence in single&#8208;dopant activated solid phosphors. Herein, white NaLi3Si1&#8722;xO4:Eu2+ materials are designed via defect engineering and synthesized by reducing the Si content (0.15 &#8804; x&#160;&#8804; 0.25). Stochiometric NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ exhibits a narrow&#8208;band blue emission at 469&#160;nm, ascribed to the 5d &#8594; 4f transition of Eu2+ at highly symmetric cuboid Na sites, while samples with Si content reduced by 15&#8211;25% display white emission with two peaks at 472&#160;nm and 585&#160;nm. The newly appeared broadband yellow peak arises from charge&#8208;transfer transitions involving Eu2+ and nearby defects, as verified by an unusual bandwidth, a large Stokes shift, and a long decay time. A single&#8208;component white light&#8208;emitting diode device is fabricated by employing a white phosphor to demonstrate a color&#8208;rendering index of 82.9. This result provides a new design strategy for single&#8208;component white&#8208;light materials with broad&#8208;band defect&#8208;induced charge&#8208;transfer emission.

         <title>Pattern&#8208;Potential&#8208;Guided Growth of Textured Macromolecular Films on Graphene/High&#8208;Index Copper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A patterned potential is constructed on graphene/Cu(122) and employed to guide the highly ordered growth of ferroelectric polymer films over a large area (&#8776;5 cm &#215; 5 cm), resulting in an enhancement of ferroelectric and mechanical property. In situ SEM and MD simulations reveal that an electrostatic interaction is crucial for the formation of oriented film. Such a strategy is also demonstrated to be applicable to other polar macromolecules.








Abstract
Macromolecular films are crucial functional materials widely used in the fields of mechanics, electronics, optoelectronics, and biology, due to their superior properties of chemical stability, small density, high flexibility, and solution&#8208;processing ability. Their electronic and mechanical properties, however, are typically much lower than those of crystalline materials, as the macromolecular films have no long&#8208;range structural ordering. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art for producing highly ordered macromolecular films is still facing a great challenge due to the complex interactions between adjacent macromolecules. Here, the growth of textured macromolecular films on a designed graphene/high&#8208;index copper (Cu) surface is demonstrated. This successful growth is driven by a patterned potential that originates from the different amounts of charge transfer between the graphene and Cu surfaces with, alternately, terraces and step edges. The textured films exhibit a remarkable improvement in remnant ferroelectric polarization and fracture strength. It is also demonstrated that this growth mechanism is universal for different macromolecules. As meter&#8208;scale graphene/high&#8208;index Cu substrates have recently become available, the results open a new regime for the production and applications of highly ordered macromolecular films with obvious merits of high production and low cost.

         <title>A High&#8208;Efficiency Wavelength&#8208;Tunable Monolayer LED with Hybrid Continuous&#8208;Pulsed Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolayer WS2 light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) operate in a hybrid mode of continuous&#8208;pulsed injection, which has a high emission efficiency and tunable emission wavelength. The negatively charged defect electroluminescence emission has a large quantum efficiency and can be visualized and distinguished in real space. This work is aimed at inspiring further high&#8208;performance and wavelength&#8208;tunable LED devices for future advanced optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency and wavelength&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) devices will play an important role in future advanced optoelectronic systems. Traditional semiconductor LED devices typically have a fixed emission wavelength that is determined by the energy of the emission states. Here, a novel high&#8208;efficiency and wavelength&#8208;tunable monolayer WS2 LED device, which operates in the hybrid mode of continuous&#8208;pulsed injection, is developed. This hybrid injection enables highly enhanced emission efficiency (&gt;20 times) and effective size of emission area (&gt;5 times) at room temperature. The emission wavelength of the WS2 monolayer LED device can be tuned over more than 40&#160;nm by driving AC voltages, from exciton emission to trion emission, and further to defect emission. The quantum efficiency of defect electroluminescence (EL) emission is measured to be more than 24.5 times larger than that from free exciton and trion EL emission. The separate carrier injection in the LED also demonstrates advantages in allowing defect species to be visualized and distinguished in real space. Those defects are assigned to be negatively charged defects. The results open a new route to develop high&#8208;performance and wavelength&#8208;tunable LED devices for future advanced optoelectronic applications.

         <title>DNA Origami Penetration in Cell Spheroid Tissue Models is Enhanced by Wireframe Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To probe the potential for DNA&#8208;origami&#8208;based delivery devices, the authors study the effect of the folding arrangement of the DNA, on passive uptake and penetration. Despite almost identical composition and shape of the structures, wireframe&#8208;style origami penetrates deeper in tumor models than classical origami and this is likely an effect due to differences in scavenger receptor mediated uptake.








Abstract
As DNA origami applications in biomedicine are expanding, more knowledge is needed to assess these structures&#8217; interaction with biological systems. Here, uptake and penetration in cell and cell spheroid tissue models (CSTMs) are studied to elucidate whether differences in internal structure can be a factor in the efficacy of DNA&#8208;origami&#8208;based delivery. Two structures bearing largely similar features in terms of both geometry and molecular weight, but with different internal designs&#8212;being either compact, lattice&#8208;based origami or following an open, wireframe design&#8212;are designed. In CSTMs, wireframe rods are able to penetrate deeper than close&#8208;packed rods. Moreover, doxorubicin&#8208;loaded wireframe rods show a higher cytotoxicity in CSTMs. These results can be explained by differences in structural mechanics, local deformability, local material density, and accessibility to cell receptors between these two DNA origami design paradigms. In particular, it is suggested that the main reason for the difference in penetration dynamic arises from differences in interaction with scavenger receptors where lattice&#8208;based structures appear to be internalized to a higher degree than polygonal structures of the same size and shape. It is thus argued that the choice of structural design method constitutes a crucial parameter for the application of DNA origami in drug delivery.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide perovskite nanocrystal (PNC)/polymer nanocomposites that combine unique optoelectronic properties of PNCs and outstanding stability, flexibility, and processability enabled by polymers are an appealing class of material with many promising applications. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic strategies and intriguing properties of PNC/polymer nanocomposites, as well as their wide&#8208;ranging applications in light emision, sensing, and energy conversion areas are summarized.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) have recently garnered tremendous research interest due to their unique optoelectronic properties and promising applications in photovoltaics and optoelectronics. Metal halide PNCs can be combined with polymers to create nanocomposites that carry an array of advantageous characteristics. The polymer matrix can bestow stability, stretchability, and solution&#8208;processability while the PNCs maintain their size&#8208;, shape&#8208; and composition&#8208;dependent optoelectronic properties. As such, these nanocomposites possess great promise for next&#8208;generation displays, lighting, sensing, biomedical technologies, and energy conversion. The recent advances in metal halide PNC/polymer nanocomposites are summarized here. First, a variety of synthetic strategies for crafting PNC/polymer nanocomposites are discussed. Second, their array of intriguing properties is examined. Third, the broad range of applications of PNC/polymer nanocomposites is highlighted, including light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, and scintillators. Finally, an outlook on future research directions and challenges in this rapidly evolving field are presented.

         <title>Memory Seeds Enable High Structural Phase Purity in 2D Perovskite Films for High&#8208;Efficiency Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fabrication of phase&#8208;pure films of 2D perovskites using a novel, simple and scalable method, referred to as the phase&#8208;selective method, is demonstrated. Phase&#8208;purity is enabled by the presence of sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;sized seeds in the precursor&#8208;solution that preserves the memory of the dissolved single&#8208;crystals. A photovoltaic efficiency of 17.1% with a VOC of 1.20 V and stability T97.5 = 800 h at MPP is reported.








Abstract
2D perovskites are a class of halide perovskites offering a pathway for realizing efficient and durable optoelectronic devices. However, the broad chemical phase space and lack of understanding of film formation have led to quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films with polydispersity in perovskite layer thicknesses, which have hindered device performance and stability. Here, a simple and scalable approach is reported, termed as the &#8220;phase&#8208;selective method&#8221;, to fabricate 2D perovskite thin films with homogenous layer thickness (phase purity). The phase&#8208;selective method involves the dissolution of single&#8208;crystalline powders with a homogeneous perovskite layer thickness in desired solvents to fabricate thin films. In situ characterizations reveal the presence of sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;sized seeds in solution that preserve the memory of the dissolved single crystals and dictate the nucleation and growth of grains with an identical thickness of the perovskite layers in thin films. Photovoltaic devices with a p&#8211;i&#8211;n architecture are fabricated with such films, which yield an efficiency of 17.1% enabled by an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.20 V,&#160;while preserving 97.5% of their peak performance after 800 h under illumination without any external thermal management.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to achieve simulated microgravity conditions on Earth? The art of growing and processing 2D porous crystalline molecular frameworks in simulated microgravity is presented.








Abstract
To date, crystallization studies conducted in space laboratories, which are prohibitively costly and unsuitable to most research laboratories, have shown the valuable effects of microgravity during crystal growth and morphogenesis. Herein, an easy and highly efficient method is shown to achieve space&#8208;like experimentation conditions on Earth employing custom&#8208;made microfluidic devices to fabricate 2D porous crystalline molecular frameworks. It is confirmed that experimentation under these simulated microgravity conditions has unprecedented effects on the orientation, compactness and crack&#8208;free generation of 2D porous crystalline molecular frameworks as well as in their integration and crystal morphogenesis. It is believed that this work will provide a new &#8220;playground&#8221; to chemists, physicists, and materials scientists that desire to process unprecedented 2D functional materials and devices.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Molecular Detection by Imaging of Centimeter&#8208;Scale Metasurfaces with a Deterministic Gradient Geometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive sensor that can detect an angstrom&#8208;thick layer of adsorbed molecules by imaging of centimeter&#8208;scale plasmonic metasurface is demonstrated. This novel sensing scheme is expected to be a promising platform for point&#8208;of&#8208;care and lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip applications, which can be realized using off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf monochromatic light sources and commercial image sensors.








Abstract
Highly sensitive detection of trace amounts of substances is crucial for broad applications in healthcare, environmental monitoring, antiterrorism, etc., where cost effectiveness and portability are often demanded. Here, an ultrasensitive sensor is reported that can detect an angstrom&#8208;thick layer of adsorbed molecules through image acquisition and processing. The sensor features a centimeter&#8208;scale plasmonic metasurface with spatially varying geometry, where the light scattering is dependent on both the adsorbed substances and spatial locations. When illuminated with narrowband light (such as from a light emitting diode), the intensity pattern recorded on the metasurface changes with the surface&#8208;adsorbed molecules, enabling label&#8208;free, sensitive, and spectrometer&#8208;free molecular detection. The centimeter&#8208;scale size of the sensing area interfaces well with consumer&#8208;level imaging sensors on mobile devices without the need for microscopic optics and offers a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio by leveraging the multimillion pixels for noise reduction. It is experimentally demonstrated that a single layer of Al2O3 molecules deposited on the sensor, with a thickness of approximately one angstrom, can be detected by analyzing the images taken of the sensing chip. Furthermore, by integrating the sensor into a microfluidic setup, quantitative detection of BSA/anti&#8208;BSA immune complex formation events is demonstrated, which agrees well with the Langmuir isotherm model.

         <title>Programmable Assembly of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated polymer properties depend intrinsically on polymer order, including crystallinity, orientation, morphology, domain size, and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Order can be programmed through covalent bonding, i.e., molecular design, or through processing techniques in solution or solid&#8208;state. This perspective serves as a guide to directing &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer assembly, control polymer order, and thereby control its optical, electronic, and mechanical properties.








Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated polymers have numerous applications due to their advantageous optoelectronic and mechanical properties. These properties depend intrinsically on polymer ordering, including crystallinity, orientation, morphology, domain size, and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Programming, or deliberately controlling the composition and ordering of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers by well&#8208;defined inputs, is a key facet in the development of organic electronics. Here, &#960;&#8208;conjugated programming is described at each stage of material development, stressing the links between each programming mode. Covalent programming is performed during polymer synthesis such that complex architectures can be constructed, which direct polymer assembly by governing polymer orientation, &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, and morphological length&#8208;scales. Solution programming is performed in a solvated state as polymers dissolve, aggregate, crystallize, or react in solution. Solid&#8208;state programming occurs in the solid state and is governed by polymer crystallization, domain segregation, or gelation. Recent progress in programming across these stages is examined, highlighting order&#8208;dependent features and assembly techniques that are unique to &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers. This should serve as a guide for delineating the many ways of directing &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer assembly to control ordering, structure, and function, enabling the further development of organic electronics.

         <title>Complex Metal Nanostructures with Programmable Shapes from Simple DNA Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile construction kit for the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of complex metal nanostructures with programmable shapes is presented. It uses different DNA elements that can be docked together to produce hollow mold superstructures for metal filling. Electrical and optical characterizations of the obtained metallic nanostructures explore their potential for the self&#8208;assembly of nanoelectronic and nanooptic devices.








Abstract
Advances in DNA nanotechnology allow the design and fabrication of highly complex DNA structures, uisng specific programmable interactions between smaller nucleic acid building blocks. To convey this concept to the fabrication of metallic nanoparticles, an assembly platform is developed based on a few basic DNA structures that can serve as molds. Programming specific interactions between these elements allows the assembly of mold superstructures with a range of different geometries. Subsequent seeded growth of gold within the mold cavities enables the synthesis of complex metal structures including tightly DNA&#8208;caged particles, rolling&#8208;pin&#8208; and dumbbell&#8208;shaped particles, as well as T&#8208;shaped and loop particles with high continuity. The method further supports the formation of higher&#8208;order assemblies of the obtained metal geometries. Based on electrical and optical characterizations, it is expected that the developed platform is a valuable tool for a self&#8208;assembly&#8208;based fabrication of nanoelectronic and nanooptic devices.

         <title>Design Principles and Applications of Next&#8208;Generation High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Batteries Based on Liquid Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of applications on low&#8208;melting&#8208;temperature liquid metals in next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries is presented in this review. Starting from the theoretical basis of materials properties and electrochemical features with liquid metals and alloys, reported applications are summarized by working mechanisms, critically evaluated with strengths and issues, and proposed with future development directions in the field.








Abstract
Increasing need for the renewable energy supply accelerated the thriving studies of Li&#8208;ion batteries, whereas if the high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li as well as alkali metals should be adopted as battery electrodes is still under fierce debate for safety concerns. Recently, a group of low&#8208;melting temperature metals and alloys that are in liquid phase at or near room&#8208;temperature are being reported for battery applications, by which the battery energy could be improved without significant dendrite issue. Besides the dendrite&#8208;free feature, liquid metals can also promise various high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery designs on the basis of unique materials properties. In this review, the design principles for liquid metals&#8208;based batteries from mechanical, electrochemical, and thermodynamical aspects are provided. With the understanding of the theoretical basis, currently reported relevant designs are summarized and analyzed focusing on the working mechanism, effectiveness evaluation, and novel application. An overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art liquid metal battery developments and future prospects is also provided in the end as a reference for further research explorations.

         <title>Nanostructure Engineering and Modulation of (Oxy)Nitrides for Application in Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of bulk structure, size, morphology, and surface/interface properties on the basic processes, particularly for the charge separation of (oxy)nitride&#8208;based nanophotocatalysts, are systematically described, with the aim of understanding the development of methodologies and strategies for modulating the bulk and composite nanostructures to improve the solar energy conversion efficiencies of the (oxy)nitrides.








Abstract
(Oxy)nitride&#8208;based nanophotocatalysts have been extensively investigated for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion, and not only allow wide spectral utilization to achieve high theoretical energy conversion efficiency but also exhibit suitable conduction and valence band positions for robust reduction and oxidation of water. During the past decades, a few reviews on the research progress in designing and synthesizing new visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive semiconductors for various applications in solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion have been published. However, those on the effects of their bulk and composite (surface/interface) nanostructures on basic processes as well as solar water splitting performances to produce hydrogen are still limited. In this review, a brief introduction on the relationship between the nanostructure photocatalytic properties is included. Three main processes of solar water splitting are involved, allowing the elucidation of the correlation with the nanostructural properties of the photocatalyst such as surface/interface, size, morphology, and bulk structure. Subsequently, the development of methodologies and strategies for modulating the bulk and composite structures to improve the efficiencies of the basic processes, particularly charge separation, is summarized in detail. Finally, the prospects of (oxy)nitride&#8208;based photocatalysts such as controlled synthesis, modulation of 1D/2D morphology, exposed facet regulation, heterostructure formation, theoretical simulation, and time&#8208; and space&#8208;resolved spectroscopy are discussed.

Conductive polymers (CPs) exhibit the characteristics of conventional polymers and the electrical properties of metals. This review covers the recent advances in the development and utilization of CPs for energy, sensing, and bioapplications. Particular emphasis is given on the tuning of their structural parameters to optimize their performance. Finally, the current challenges and future outlook in this field are summarized.








Abstract
Conductive polymers (CPs) integrate the inherent characteristics of conventional polymers and the unique electrical properties of metals. They have aroused tremendous interest over the last decade owing to their high conductivity, robust and flexible properties, facile fabrication, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Compared to bulk CPs, porous CPs with well&#8208;defined nano&#8208; or microstructures possess open porous architectures, high specific surface areas, more exposed reactive sites, and remarkably enhanced activities. These attractive features have led to their applications in sensors, energy storage and conversion devices, biomedical devices, and so on. In this review article, the different strategies for synthesizing porous CPs, including template&#8208;free and template&#8208;based methods, are summarized, and the importance of tuning the morphology and pore structure of porous CPs to optimize their functional performance is highlighted. Moreover, their representative applications (energy storage devices, sensors, biomedical devices, etc.) are also discussed. The review is concluded by discussing the current challenges and future development&#160;trend&#160;in&#160;this&#160;field.

         <title>Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Loss in Lead Chalcogenide Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current high&#8208;efficiency lead chalcogenide colloidal quantum dot solar cells still have high Voc loss, which places great restrictions on the performance enhancement. The origin of Voc loss from solar absorber and interface is discussed in detail and various strategies for reducing the loss are summarized. Moreover, promising research directions are provided to further improve the solar cell performance.








Abstract
Lead chalcogenide colloidal quantum dot solar cells (CQDSCs) have received considerable attention due to their broad and tunable absorption and high stability. Presently, lead chalcogenide CQDSC has achieved a power conversion efficiency of &#8776;14%. However, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lead chalcogenide CQDSC still has an open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) loss of &#8776;0.45&#160;V, which is significantly higher than those of c&#8208;Si and perovskite solar cells. Such high Voc loss severely limits the performance improvement and commercialization of lead chalcogenide CQDSCs. In this review, the Voc loss is first analyzed via detailed balance theory and the origin of Voc loss from both solar absorber and interface is summarized. Subsequently, various strategies for improving the Voc from the solar absorber, including the passivation strategies during the synthesis and ligand exchange are overviewed. The great impact of the ligand exchange process on CQD passivation is highlighted and the corresponding strategies to further reduce the Voc loss are summarized. Finally, various strategies are discussed to reduce interface Voc loss from charge transport layers. More importantly, the great potential of achieving performance breakthroughs via various organic hole transport layers is highlighted and the existing challenges toward commercialization are discussed.

         <title>Multifunctional Crosslinking&#8208;Enabled Strain&#8208;Regulating Crystallization for Stable, Efficient &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universality strain&#8208;regulation approach&#8212;crosslinking&#8208;enabled strain&#8208;regulating crystallization (CSRC)&#8212;is introduced to eliminate intrinsic tensile strain in perovskite film, which significantly boosts the perovskite solar cells&#8217; (PSCs) stability and performance. The CSRC approach precisely modulates the perovskite film strain through synchronous cooperation of perovskite crystallization manipulation and in situ chemical crosslinking process, as showcased with several types of crosslinking agents.







&#8203;

Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Formamidinium lead triiodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) but experiences intrinsic thermally induced tensile strain due to a higher phase&#8208;converting temperature, which is a critical instability factor. An in situ crosslinking&#8208;enabled strain&#8208;regulating crystallization (CSRC) method with trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMTA) is introduced to precisely regulate the top section of perovskite film where the largest lattice distortion occurs. In CSRC, crosslinking provides in situ perovskite thermal&#8208;expansion confinement and strain regulation during the annealing crystallization process, which is proven to be much more effective than the conventional strain&#8208;compensation (post&#8208;treatment) method. Moreover, CSRC with TMTA successfully achieves multifunctionality simultaneously: the regulation of tensile strain, perovskite defects passivation with an enhanced open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC&#160;= 50&#160;mV), and enlarged perovskite grain size. The CSRC approach gives significantly enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.39% in &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3&#8208;based PSC versus 20.29% in the control case. More importantly, the control PSCs&#8217; instability factor&#8212;residual tensile strain&#8212;is regulated into compression strain in the CSRC perovskite film through TMTA crosslinking, resulting in not only the best PCE but also outstanding device stability in both long&#8208;term storage (over 4000 h with 95% of initial PCE) and light soaking (1248 h with 80% of initial PCE) conditions.

         <title>Cells in Slow Motion: Apparent Undercooling Increases Glassy Behavior at Physiological Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heavy water (D2O) reversibly slows down cells, retards cell invasion, and drastically impacts cell mechanics possibly prolonging storage times for biological materials. Cellular dynamics transform into slow motion, which can be captured via the time&#8211;temperature superposition principle, where temperature is replaced by D2O. Induced changes are fully reversible and effects are independent of signaling/expression.








Abstract
Solvent conditions are unexpectedly sufficient to drastically and reversibly slow down cells. In vitro on the molecular level, protein&#8211;solvent interactions drastically change in the presence of heavy water (D2O) and its stronger hydrogen bonds. Adding D2O to the cell medium of living cells increases the molecular intracellular viscosity. While cell morphology and phenotype remain unchanged, cellular dynamics transform into slow motion in a changeable manner. This is exemplified in the slowdown of cell proliferation and migration, which is caused by a reversible gelation of the cytoplasm. In analogy to the time&#8211;temperature superposition principle, where temperature is replaced by D2O, an increase in viscosity slows down the effective time. Actin networks, crucial structures in the cytoplasm, switch from a power&#8208;law&#8208;like viscoelastic to a more rubber&#8208;like elastic behavior. The resulting intracellular resistance and dissipation impair cell movement. Since cells are highly adaptive non&#8208;equilibrium systems, they usually respond irreversibly from a thermodynamic perspective. D2O induced changes, however, are fully reversible and their effects are independent of signaling as well as expression. The stronger hydrogen bonds lead to glass&#8208;like, drawn&#8208;out intramolecular dynamics, which may facilitate longer storage times of biological matter, for instance, during transport of organ transplants.

         <title>Extreme Biomimetics: Designing of the First Nanostructured 3D Spongin&#8211;Atacamite Composite and its Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extreme biomimetics key way for designing of multifunctional macroporous 3D atacamite&#8208;based composites using the renewable biopolymer spongin is proposed. Neutron diffraction, X&#8208;ray diffraction, selected&#8208;area electron diffraction, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, and near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy provide insights, which help to understand a mechanism for its formation from a model solution that simulates the highly toxic copper&#8208;containing waste generated in the production of printed circuit boards worldwide.








Abstract
The design of new composite materials using extreme biomimetics is of crucial importance for bioinspired materials science. Further progress in research and application of these new materials is impossible without understanding the mechanisms of formation, as well as structural features at the molecular and nano&#8208;level. It presents a challenge to obtain a holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying the interaction of organic and inorganic phases under conditions of harsh chemical reactions for biopolymers. Yet, an understanding of these mechanisms can lead to the development of unusual&#8212;but functional&#8212;hybrid materials. In this work, a key way of designing centimeter&#8208;scale macroporous 3D composites, using renewable marine biopolymer spongin and a model industrial solution that simulates the highly toxic copper&#8208;containing waste generated in the production of printed circuit boards worldwide, is proposed. A new spongin&#8211;atacamite composite material is developed and its structure is confirmed using neutron diffraction, X&#8208;ray diffraction, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy/selected&#8208;area electron diffraction, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The formation mechanism for this material is also proposed. This study provides experimental evidence suggesting multifunctional applicability of the designed composite in the development of 3D constructed sensors, catalysts, and antibacterial filter systems.

     alt="Extreme Biomimetics: Designing of the First Nanostructured 3D Spongin&#8211;Atacamite Composite and its Application"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An extreme biomimetics key way for designing of multifunctional macroporous 3D atacamite-based composites using the renewable biopolymer spongin is proposed. Neutron diffraction, X-ray diffraction, selected-area electron diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy provide insights, which help to understand a mechanism for its formation from a model solution that simulates the highly toxic copper-containing waste generated in the production of printed circuit boards worldwide.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design of new composite materials using extreme biomimetics is of crucial importance for bioinspired materials science. Further progress in research and application of these new materials is impossible without understanding the mechanisms of formation, as well as structural features at the molecular and nano-level. It presents a challenge to obtain a holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying the interaction of organic and inorganic phases under conditions of harsh chemical reactions for biopolymers. Yet, an understanding of these mechanisms can lead to the development of unusual&#8212;but functional&#8212;hybrid materials. In this work, a key way of designing centimeter-scale macroporous 3D composites, using renewable marine biopolymer spongin and a model industrial solution that simulates the highly toxic copper-containing waste generated in the production of printed circuit boards worldwide, is proposed. A new spongin&#8211;atacamite composite material is developed and its structure is confirmed using neutron diffraction, X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy/selected-area electron diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The formation mechanism for this material is also proposed. This study provides experimental evidence suggesting multifunctional applicability of the designed composite in the development of 3D constructed sensors, catalysts, and antibacterial filter systems.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dual&#8208;Encryption in a Shape&#8208;Memory Hydrogel with Tunable Fluorescence and Reconfigurable Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reprogrammable dual&#8208;encryption of information storage is realized in a tough hydrogel with good shape&#8208;memory ability and phototunable fluorescence, enabling reconfigured 3D architectures and rewritable 2D fluorescent patterns, respectively. The encrypted information in the architectured hydrogel becomes readable only after sequential shape recovery and UV light irradiation, affording improved security and reuse of information materials in aqueous environments.








Abstract
Materials capable of shape&#8208;morphing and/or fluorescence imaging have practical significances in the fields of anti&#8208;counterfeiting, information display, and information protection. However, it's challenging to realize these functions in hydrogels due to the poor mechanical properties and lack of tunable fluorescence. A tough hydrogel with good shape&#8208;memory ability and phototunable fluorescence is reported here, which affords reprogrammable shape designing and information encoding for dual&#8208;encryption. This hydrogel is prepared by incorporating donor&#8211;acceptor chromophore units into a poly(1&#8208;vinylimidazole&#8208;co&#8208;methacrylic acid) network, in which the dense intra&#8208; and interchain hydrogen bonds lead to desirable features including high stiffness, high toughness, and temperature&#8208;mediated shape&#8208;memory property. Additionally, the hydrogel shows photomediated tunable fluorescence through a unimer&#8208;to&#8208;dimer transformation of the chromophores. By combining photolithography and origami/kirigami designs, hydrogel sheets encoded with fluorescent patterns can deform into specific 3D configurations. The geometrically encrypted fluorescent information in the architected hydrogels is readable only after sequential shape recovery and UV light irradiation. As demonstrated by proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiments, both the fluorescent pattern and the 3D configuration are reprogrammable, facilitating repeated information protection and display. The design of tough hydrogels with rewritable fluorescent patterns and reconfigurable shapes should guide the future development of smart materials with improved security and wider applications in aqueous environments.

         <title>Ultrathin Yet Robust Single Lithium&#8208;Ion Conducting Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Polymer&#8208;Brush Electrolytes Enable Ultralong&#8208;Life and Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Ultrathin, robust, and porous quasisolid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (QSPEs) are developed to achieve ultralong&#8208;life and dendrite&#8208;free lithium&#8208;metal batteries. The key to the QSPEs lies in utilization of superstructured polymer brushes, which have rigid bacterial cellulose nanofibril cores and soft single lithium&#8208;ion conducting polymer shells to well balance the mechanical strength and ion conductivity of the electrolytes in the presence of plasticizers.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes are one of the most promising candidates for long&#8208;life lithium&#8208;metal batteries. However, introduction of plasticizers for high ion conductivity at room temperature inevitably gives rise to poor mechanical strength and requires a very thick electrolyte membrane, which is detrimental to safety and energy density of the batteries. Herein, inspired by tube brushes coupling hardness with softness, a novel superstructured polymer bottlebrush BC&#8208;g&#8208;PLiSTFSI&#8208;b&#8208;PEGM (BC = bacterial cellulose; PLiSTFSI = poly(lithium 4&#8208;styrenesulfonyl&#8208;(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide); PEGM = poly(diethylene glycol monomethyl ether methacrylate)) with a hard nanofibril backbone and soft functional polymer side&#8208;chains is reported as an effective strategy to well balance the mechanical strength and ion conductivity of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes. The resulting single lithium&#8208;ion conducting quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer&#8208;brush electrolytes (SLIC&#8208;QSPBEs) integrate the features of the ultrathin membrane thickness (10&#160;&#181;m), the nanofibril backbone&#8208;strengthened porous nanonetwork (Young's modulus = 1.9&#160;GPa), and the high&#8208;rate single lithium&#8208;ion conducting diblock copolymer brushes. As a result, the ultrathin yet robust SLIC&#8208;QSPBEs enable ultralong&#8208;term (over 3300 h) reversible and stable lithium plating/stripping in Li/Li symmetrical cell at a current density of 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for lithium anode. This work affords a promising strategy to develop advanced electrolytes for solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Multiterminal Quantized Conductance in InSb Nanocrosses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods for growth of high quality InSb nanocrosses by molecular beam epitaxy are developed, and electrical measurements at low temperature demonstrate ballistic transport in the individual nanowire terminals and through the junction.








Abstract
By studying the time&#8208;dependent axial and radial growth of InSb nanowires (NWs), the conditions for the synthesis of single&#8208;crystalline InSb nanocrosses (NCs) by molecular beam epitaxy are mapped. Low&#8208;temperature electrical measurements of InSb NC devices with local gate control on individual terminals exhibit quantized conductance and are used to probe the spatial distribution of the conducting channels. Tuning to a situation where the NC junction is connected by few&#8208;channel quantum point contacts in the connecting NW terminals, it is shown that transport through the junction is ballistic except close to pinch&#8208;off. Combined with a new concept for shadow&#8208;epitaxy of patterned superconductors on NCs, the structures reported here show promise for the realization of non&#8208;trivial topological states in multi&#8208;terminal Josephson junctions.

         <title>Gallium Plasmonic Nanoantennas Unveiling Multiple Kinetics of Hydrogen Sensing, Storage, and Spillover</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gallium nanoparticles represent a novel interesting plasmon photocatalysis system for hydrogen dissociation, sensing, and storage applications. Ga NPs have never been considered previously for photocatalysis. With respect to this, a novel vision is offered, which can represent breakthroughs in the plasmon&#8208;activated photocatalysis as well as in hydrogen science and technology.








Abstract
Hydrogen is the key element to accomplish a carbon&#8208;free based economy. Here, the first evidence of plasmonic gallium (Ga) nanoantennas is provided as nanoreactors supported on sapphire (&#945;&#8208;Al2O3) acting as direct plasmon&#8208;enhanced photocatalyst for hydrogen sensing, storage, and spillover. The role of plasmon&#8208;catalyzed electron transfer between hydrogen and plasmonic Ga nanoparticle in the activation of those processes is highlighted, as opposed to conventional refractive index&#8208;change&#8208;based sensing. This study reveals that, while temperature selectively operates those various processes, longitudinal (LO&#8208;LSPR) and transverse (TO&#8208;LSPR) localized surface plasmon resonances of supported Ga nanoparticles open selectivity of localized reaction pathways at specific sites corresponding to the electromagnetic hot&#8208;spots. Specifically, the TO&#8208;LSPR couples light into the surface dissociative adsorption of hydrogen and formation of hydrides, whereas the LO&#8208;LSPR activates heterogeneous reactions at the interface with the support, that is, hydrogen spillover into &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 and reverse&#8208;oxygen spillover from &#945;&#8208;Al2O3. This Ga&#8208;based plasmon&#8208;catalytic platform expands the application of supported plasmon&#8208;catalysis to hydrogen technologies, including reversible fast hydrogen sensing in a timescale of a few seconds with a limit of detection as low as 5 ppm&#160;and in a broad temperature range from room&#8208;temperature up to 600 &#176;C while remaining stable and reusable over an extended period of time.

         <title>A Harmless&#8211;Harmful Switchable and Uninterrupted Laccase&#8208;Instructed Killer for Activatable Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A harmless&#8211;harmful switchable and uninterrupted laccase (LAC)&#8208;instructed killer (HULK) is designed as a chemodynamic therapy (CDT) agent, which is the first CDT agent accelerated by LAC&#8208;instructed superoxide radical (O2&#8722;&#8226;) generation and possesses harmless&#8211;harmful switchable effect because of the photodegradation of O2&#8722;&#8226; scavenger Fe&#8208;chlorin e6, showing great potential as a safe and effective CDT agent.








Abstract
Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) employs Fenton catalysts to kill cancer cells by converting intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into hydroxyl radicals (OH&#8226;). Although many studies on H2O2 supplementation have been conducted to improve the therapeutic effect of CDT, few studies have focused on the application of superoxide radical (O2&#8722;&#8226;) in CDT, which may result in better efficacy. A major concern about O2&#8722;&#8226;&#8208;mediated CDT is its tendency to induce serious oxidative damage to normal tissues, which may be addressed by using a degradable O2&#8722;&#8226; scavenger. Here, a harmless&#8208;harmful switchable and uninterrupted laccase (LAC)&#8208;instructed killer (HULK) is constructed, which is the first CDT agent accelerated by LAC&#8208;instructed O2&#8722;&#8226; generation and possesses a harmless&#8208;harmful switchable effect because of the photodegradation of the O2&#8722;&#8226; scavenger iron&#8208;chlorin e6 (FeCe6). LAC&#8208;instructed substrate oxidation effectively catalyzes O2&#8722;&#8226; production with the help of intracellular reduction, thereby promoting the conversion of Fe3+ to Fe2+, accelerating the generation of OH&#8226;, and inducing tumor cell apoptosis and necrosis. The introduced O2&#8722;&#8226; scavenger FeCe6 is quickly photodegraded during irradiation, while LAC&#8208;instructed O2&#8722;&#8226; generation proceeds as before, resulting in activatable CDT. This work not only provides the first strategy for LAC&#8208;instructed O2&#8722;&#8226; generation but also presents new insight into activatable CDT.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Hybrid Dielectric for Capacitive and Triboelectric Tactile Sensors with High Sensitivity and Ultrawide Linearity Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skin&#8208;inspired hybrid dielectric with gradient compressibility and dielectric property is presented based on the combined low&#8208;permittivity (low&#8208;k) micro&#8208;cilia array and high&#8208;permittivity (high&#8208;k) rough surface and micro&#8208;dome array. The derived linear elastic modulus and effective dielectric constant enable the ultra&#8208;wide linear sensing range (0&#8211;1000&#160;kPa) and enhanced sensitivity for capacitive/triboelectric tactile sensors.








Abstract
The trade&#8208;off between sensitivity and linearity is critical for preserving the high pressure&#8208;resolution over a broad range and simplifying the signal processing/conversion of flexible tactile sensors. Conventional dielectrics suffer from the difficulty of quantitatively controlling the interacted mechanical and dielectric properties, thus causing the restricted sensitivity and linearity of capacitive sensors. Herein, inspired by human skin, a novel hybrid dielectric composed of a low&#8208;permittivity (low&#8208;k) micro&#8208;cilia array, a high&#8208;permittivity (high&#8208;k) rough surface, and micro&#8208;dome array is developed. The pressure&#8208;induced series&#8208;parallel conversion between the low&#8208;k and high&#8208;k components of the hybrid dielectric enables the linear effective dielectric constant and controllable initial/resultant capacitance. The gradient compressibility of the hybrid dielectric enables the linear behavior of elastic modulus with pressures, which derives the capacitance variation determined by the effective dielectric constant. Therefore, an ultrawide linearity range up to 1000&#160;kPa and a high sensitivity of 0.314 kPa&#8211;1 are simultaneously achieved by the optimized hybrid dielectric. The design is also applicable for triboelectric tactile sensors, which realizes the similar linear behavior of output voltage and enhanced sensitivity. With the high pressure&#8208;resolution across a broad range, potential applications such as healthcare monitoring in diverse scenarios and control command conversion via a single sensor are demonstrated.

         <title>Multi&#8208;State Heterojunction Transistors Based on Field&#8208;Effect Tunneling&#8211;Transport Transitions</title>

         <dc:description>
A new design of the monolithic ternary logic transistor is presented to boost the breakthrough of the semiconductor technology beyond the Moore's law. A vertically stacked double n&#8208;type semiconductor heterostructure enables an equiprobable and distinctive manifestation of multiple logic states in the conventional MOSFET architecture, through the chemical&#8208;turning of electrical transitions between onsets of field&#8208;effect charge transport and tunneling behaviors.








Abstract
A monolithic ternary logic transistor based on a vertically stacked double n&#8208;type semiconductor heterostructure is presented. Incorporation of the organic heterostructure into the conventional metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistor (MOSFET) architecture induces the generation of stable multiple logic states in the device; these states can be further optimized to be equiprobable and distinctive, which are the most desirable and requisite properties for multivalued logic devices. A systematic investigation reveals that the electrical properties of the device are governed by not only the conventional field&#8208;effect charge transport but also the field&#8208;effect charge tunneling at the heterointerfaces, and thus, an intermediate state can be finely tuned by independently controlling the transition between the onsets of these two mechanisms. The achieved device performance agrees with the results of a numerical simulation based on a pseudo&#8208;metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;metal model; the obtained findings therefore provide rational criteria for material selection in a simple energetic perspective. The operation of various ternary logic circuits based on the optimized multistate heterojunction transistors, including the NMIN and NMAX gates, is also demonstrated.

         <title>Healable and Recyclable Elastomers with Record&#8208;High Mechanical Robustness, Unprecedented Crack Tolerance, and Superhigh Elastic Restorability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Healable and recyclable elastomers with superhigh strength (tensile strength &#8776;75.6&#160;MPa, true stress at break &#8776;1.21&#160;GPa) and ultrahigh toughness (&#8776;390.2&#160;MJ m&#8722;3) are reported. The elastomer has unprecedented crack tolerance with fracture energy of 215.2&#160;kJ m&#8722;2 that even exceeds that of metals and alloys. The elastomer exhibits superhigh elastic restorability allowing dimensional recovery from elongation over 12 times.








Abstract
Spider silk is one of the most robust natural materials, which has extremely high strength in combination with great toughness and good elasticity. Inspired by spider silk but beyond it, a healable and recyclable supramolecular elastomer, possessing superhigh true stress at break (1.21&#160;GPa) and ultrahigh toughness (390.2&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), which are, respectively, comparable to and &#8776;2.4 times higher than those of typical spider silk, is developed. The elastomer has the highest tensile strength (ultimate engineering stress, 75.6&#160;MPa) ever recorded for polymeric elastomers, rendering it the strongest and toughest healable elastomer thus far. The hyper&#8208;robust elastomer exhibits superb crack tolerance with unprecedentedly high fracture energy (215.2&#160;kJ m&#8722;2) that even exceeds that of metals and alloys, and superhigh elastic restorability allowing dimensional recovery from elongation over 12 times. These extraordinary mechanical performances mainly originate from the meticulously engineered hydrogen&#8208;bonding segments, consisting of multiple acylsemicarbazide and urethane moieties linked with flexible alicyclic hexatomic spacers. Such hydrogen&#8208;bonding segments, incorporated between extensible polymer chains, aggregate to form geometrically confined hydrogen&#8208;bond arrays resembling those in spider silk. The hydrogen&#8208;bond arrays act as firm but reversible crosslinks and sacrificial bonds for enormous energy dissipation, conferring exceptional mechanical robustness, healability, and recyclability on the elastomer.

A scalable approach is developed to achieve ferroelectric polymer P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) thin films composed of close&#8208;packed crystalline nanowires with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polar axis via interface&#8208;epitaxy with 1T&#8242;&#8208;ReS2, which leads to over six orders of magnitude higher ferroelectric field effect modulation in ReS2 transistors and coercive voltages as low as 0.1&#160;V, making them viable for large&#8208;scale, low&#8208;power, high&#8208;performance device applications.








Abstract
The flexible, transparent, and low&#8208;weight nature of ferroelectric polymers makes them promising for wearable electronic and optical applications. To reach the full potential of the polarization&#8208;enabled device functionalities, large&#8208;scale fabrication of polymer thin films with well&#8208;controlled polar directions is called for, which remains a central challenge. The widely exploited Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett, spin&#8208;coating, and electrospinning methods only yield polymorphous or polycrystalline films, where the net polarization is compromised. Here, an easily scalable approach is reported to achieve poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) thin films composed of close&#8208;packed crystalline nanowires via interface&#8208;epitaxy with 1T&#8242;&#8208;ReS2. Upon controlled thermal treatment, uniform P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) films restructure into about 10 and 35 nm&#8208;wide (010)&#8208;oriented nanowires that are crystallographically aligned with the underlying ReS2, as revealed by high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy. Piezoresponse force microscopy studies confirm the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polar axis of the nanowire films and reveal coercive voltages as low as 0.1 V. Reversing the polarization can induce a conductance switching ratio of &gt;108 in bilayer ReS2, over six orders of magnitude higher than that achieved by an untreated polymer gate. This study points to a cost&#8208;effective route to large&#8208;scale processing of high&#8208;performance ferroelectric polymer thin films for flexible energy&#8208;efficient nanoelectronics.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Gain Organic Electrochemical Transistor Chemosensors Based on Self&#8208;Curled Nanomembranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have attracted growing interest due to their physical, chemical, and mechanical versatility. Simultaneously, strain&#8208;engineered nanomembranes are well recognized to allow integration and property tailorability to numerous electronic and electrochemical miniaturized systems. By employing self&#8208;curled nanomembranes to advance the current liquid&#8208;gated transistor technology, unique characteristics arise in a pioneering ultrahigh&#8208;gain OECT platform.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are technologically relevant devices presenting high susceptibility to physical stimulus, chemical functionalization, and shape changes&#8212;jointly to versatility and low production costs. The OECT capability of liquid&#8208;gating addresses both electrochemical sensing and signal amplification within a single integrated device unit. However, given the organic semiconductor time&#8208;consuming doping process and their usual low field&#8208;effect mobility, OECTs are frequently considered low&#8208;end category devices. Toward high&#8208;performance OECTs, microtubular electrochemical devices based on strain&#8208;engineering are presented here by taking advantage of the exclusive shape features of self&#8208;curled nanomembranes. Such novel OECTs outperform the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic liquid&#8208;gated transistors, reaching lower operating voltage, improved ion doping, and a signal amplification with a &gt;104&#160;intrinsic gain. The multipurpose OECT concept is validated with different electrolytes and distinct nanometer&#8208;thick molecular films, namely, phthalocyanine and thiophene derivatives. The OECTs are also applied as transducers to detect a biomarker related to neurological diseases, the neurotransmitter dopamine. The self&#8208;curled OECTs update the premises of electrochemical energy conversion in liquid&#8208;gated transistors, yielding a substantial performance improvement and new chemical sensing capabilities within picoliter sampling volumes.

         <title>Upregulating Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Nanoparticles with Blood&#8211;Tumor&#8208;Barrier Permeability for Precise Photothermal Eradication of Brain Tumors and Induction of Local Immune Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional biocompatible nanoplatform based on bradykinin (BK) aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission nanoparticles (BK@AIE NPs) can specifically target brain tumors, penetrate through the blood&#8211;tumor barrier, perform photothermal therapy (PTT), and simultaneously activate the local immune system for very effective synergetic brain cancer therapy. Moreover, BK@AIE NPs&#8208;mediated PTT can eliminate cancer stem cells&#8217; recurrence associated with conventional therapy, for cancer treatment with highly improved efficacy.








Abstract
Compared to other tumors, glioblastoma (GBM) is extremely difficult to treat. Recently, photothermal therapy (PTT) has demonstrated advanced therapeutic efficacy; however, because of the relatively low tissue&#8208;penetration efficiency of laser light, its application in deep&#8208;seated tumors remains challenging. Herein, bradykinin (BK) aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission nanoparticles (BK@AIE NPs) are synthesized; these offer selective penetration through the blood&#8211;tumor barrier (BTB) and strong absorbance in the near&#8208;infrared region (NIR). The BK ligand can prompt BTB adenosine receptor activation, which enhances transportation and accumulation inside tumors, as confirmed by T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance and fluorescence imaging. The BK@AIE NPs exhibit high photothermal conversion efficiency under 980&#160;nm NIR laser irradiation, facilitating the treatment of deep&#8208;seated tumors. Tumor progression can be effectively inhibited to extend the survival span of mice after spatiotemporal PTT. NIR irradiation can eradicate tumor tissues and release tumor&#8208;associated antigens. It is observed that the PTT treatment of GBM&#8208;bearing mice activates natural killer cells, CD3+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and M1 macrophages in the GBM area, increasing the therapeutic efficacy. This study demonstrates that NIR&#8208;assisted BK@AIE NPs represent a promising strategy for the improved systematic elimination of GBMs and the activation of local brain immune privilege.

         <title>A Bottom&#8208;Up Approach to Red&#8208;Emitting Molecular&#8208;Based Nanoparticles with Natural Stealth Properties and their Use for Single&#8208;Particle Tracking Deep in Brain Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent organic nanoparticles displaying intrinsic stealth properties toward biological membranes are prepared by nanoprecipitation of a hydrophobic, conjugated, red&#8208;emitting quadrupolar dye. The excellent brightness, stability, and size control down to &#8776;10&#160;nm of these nanoparticles allow for single&#8208;particle tracking deep in brain tissue. These findings point to a novel route for the bottom&#8208;up molecular design of the nano&#8211;bio interface.








Abstract
Fluorescent nanoparticles dedicated to bioimaging applications should possess specific properties that have to be maintained in the aqueous, reactive, and crowded biological environment. These include chemical and photostability, small size (on the scale of subcellular structures), biocompatibility, high brightness, and good solubility. The latter is a major challenge for inorganic nanoparticles, which require surface coating to be made water soluble. Molecular&#8208;based fluorescent organic nanoparticles (FONs) may prove a promising, spontaneously water&#8208;soluble alternative, whose bottom&#8208;up design allows for the fine&#8208;tuning of individual properties. Here, the critical challenge of controlling the interaction of nanoparticles with cellular membranes is addressed. This is a report on bright, size&#8208;tunable, red&#8208;emitting, naturally stealthy FONs that do not require the use of antifouling agents to impede interactions with cellular membranes. As a proof of concept, single FONs diffusing up to 150&#160;&#181;m deep in brain tissue are imaged and tracked.

A universal solution&#8208;processed bottom&#8208;up quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth of highly oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite film is achieved through the synergetic effect of methylammonium chloride and a large&#8208;organic cation.

Abstract
Epitaxial growth gives the highest&#8208;quality crystalline semiconductor thin films for optoelectronic devices. Here, a universal solution&#8208;processed bottom&#8208;up quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth of highly oriented &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead triiodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) perovskite film via a two&#8208;step method is reported, in which the crystal orientation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 film is precisely controlled through the synergetic effect of methylammonium chloride and the large&#8208;organic cation butylammonium bromide. In situ GIWAXS visualizes the BA&#8208;related intermediate phase formation at the bottom of film, which serves as a guiding template for the bottom&#8208;up quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth in the subsequent annealing process. The template&#8208;guided epitaxially grown BAFAMA perovskite film exhibits increased crystallinity, preferred crystallographic orientation, and reduced defects.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epitaxial growth gives the highest-quality crystalline semiconductor thin films for optoelectronic devices. Here, a universal solution-processed bottom-up quasi-epitaxial growth of highly oriented &#945;-formamidinium lead triiodide (&#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) perovskite film via a two-step method is reported, in which the crystal orientation of &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; film is precisely controlled through the synergetic effect of methylammonium chloride and the large-organic cation butylammonium bromide. In situ GIWAXS visualizes the BA-related intermediate phase formation at the bottom of film, which serves as a guiding template for the bottom-up quasi-epitaxial growth in the subsequent annealing process. The template-guided epitaxially grown BAFAMA perovskite film exhibits increased crystallinity, preferred crystallographic orientation, and reduced defects. Moreover, the BAFAMA perovskite solar cells demonstrate decent stability, maintaining 95% of their initial power conversion efficiency after 2600&#160;h ambient storage, and 4-time operation condition lifetime enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Cross&#8208;Substitution Promoted Ultrawide Bandgap up to 4.5&#160;eV in a 2D Semiconductor: Gallium Thiophosphate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cross&#8208;substitution process is used to design 2D ultrawide&#8208;bandgap semiconductor GaPS4 by employing GeS2 as a similar structural model. Monolayer GaPS4 exhibits an ultrawide optical bandgap of 4.50&#160;eV. The polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors based on the GaPS4 material display high selectivity and linear dichroic ratio in the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet region.








Abstract
Exploring 2D ultrawide bandgap semiconductors (UWBSs) will be conductive to the development of next&#8208;generation nanodevices, such as deep&#8208;ultraviolet photodetectors, single&#8208;photon emitters, and high&#8208;power flexible electronic devices. However, a gap still remains between the theoretical prediction of novel 2D UWBSs and the experimental realization of the corresponding materials. The cross&#8208;substitution process is an effective way to construct novel semiconductors with the favorable parent characteristics (e.g., structure) and the better physicochemical properties (e.g., bandgap). Herein, a simple case is offered for rational design and syntheses of 2D UWBS GaPS4 by employing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art GeS2 as a similar structural model. Benefiting from the cosubstitution of Ge with lighter Ga and P, the GaPS4 crystals exhibit sharply enlarged optical bandgaps (few&#8208;layer: 3.94&#160;eV and monolayer: 4.50&#160;eV) and superior detection performances with high responsivity (4.89 A W&#8722;1), high detectivity (1.98&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones), and high quantum efficiency (2.39&#160;&#215;&#160;103%) in the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet region. Moreover, the GaPS4&#8208;based photodetector exhibits polarization&#8208;sensitive photoresponse with a linear dichroic ratio of 1.85 at 254&#160;nm, benefitting from its in&#8208;plane structural anisotropy. These results provide a pathway for the discovery and fabrication of 2D UWBS anisotropic materials, which become promising candidates for future solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet and polarization&#8208;sensitive sensors.

         <title>Engineering a Hydrogen&#8208;Sulfide&#8208;Based Nanomodulator to Normalize Hyperactive Photothermal Immunogenicity for Combination Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photothermal therapy (PTT), one of the most&#8208;potent cancer therapeutic strategies known, suffers from hyperactive immunity&#8208;related permanent tissue injury and high&#8208;profile tumor regeneration. In this scenario, a hydrogen sulfide donor to PTT via an amphiphilic conjugated polymer (CP) (2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl tetrasulfide@CP&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol)) is integrated, for advanced NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;guided inflammatory modulation. The regulated inflammation preserves photothermal immunogenicity and promotes hyperthermia&#8208;induced wound healing concurrently.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT), one of the most&#8208;potent cancer therapeutic strategies known, is highlighted with excessive inflammatory response, while ablating cancer with immunogenic death. This hyperactive immune response may override PTT&#8208;triggered immunogenicity, exacerbate skin empyrosis, and incur permanent tissue injury and high&#8208;profile tumor regeneration. Therefore, an anticancer balance between pathological and protective immune response is urgently needed for an advanced photothermal therapeutic tactic. Herein, a gas&#8208;modulated photothermal immunogenicity strategy is proposed by integrating an amphiphilic&#8208;conjugated polymer with a polysulfide&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor (2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl tetrasulfide@CP&#8208;PEG) (where CP = conjugated polymer and PEG = poly(ethylene glycol)). The CP is endowed with NIR&#8208;II fluorescence capacity and favorable photothermal effect, tracing the tumor for precise therapeutics. The polysulfide donor can release H2S triggered by intracellular glutathione, which elicits mitochondrial dysfunction and robust anti&#8208;inflammation effect. Ultimately, this gas&#8208;modulated PTT strategy inhibits tumor growth remarkably and limits the magnitude of PTT&#8208;induced proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor&#8208;alpha (TNF&#8208;&#945;), interleukin&#8208;6 (IL&#8208;6), and interleukin&#8208;1beta (IL&#8208;1&#946;) cytokines. Moreover, the regulated inflammation accelerates PTT&#8208;induced wound healing. A H2S&#8208;modulated PTT with adaptive immune response is thus recommended as an advanced strategy to cancer therapeutics.

         <title>Poor Stability of Li2CO3 in the Solid Electrolyte Interphase of a Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode Revealed by Cryo&#8208;Electron Microscopy</title>

Sulfur&#8208;containing additives cause the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in lithium&#8208;metal batteries to preferentially generate Li2SO4 and overlithiated lithium sulfate and lithium oxide, which encapsulates lithium carbonate in the middle, limiting SEI thickening and enhancing battery life by a factor of ten.








Abstract
The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) dictates the cycling stability of lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Here, direct atomic imaging of the SEI's phase components and their spatial arrangement is achieved, using ultralow&#8208;dosage cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. The results show that, surprisingly, a lot of the deposited Li metal has amorphous atomic structure, likely due to carbon and oxygen impurities, and that crystalline lithium carbonate is not stable and readily decomposes when contacting the lithium metal. Lithium carbonate distributed in the outer SEI also continuously reacts with the electrolyte to produce gas, resulting in a dynamically evolving and porous SEI. Sulfur&#8208;containing additives cause the SEI to preferentially generate Li2SO4 and overlithiated lithium sulfate and lithium oxide, which encapsulate lithium carbonate in the middle, limiting SEI thickening and enhancing battery life by a factor of ten. The spatial mapping of the SEI gradient amorphous (polymeric &#8594; inorganic &#8594; metallic) and crystalline phase components provides guidance for designing electrolyte additives.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A top&#8208;level design strategy assisted by density functional theory is reported to guide and design advanced high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts and their enhanced catalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance is successfully predicted. A new low&#8208;temperature electrochemical reconstruction method is developed to fabricate the as&#8208;predicted high&#8208;entropy catalysts. The as&#8208;prepared high&#8208;entropy Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalyst exhibits exceptional electrocatalytic OER performance, consistent with theory calculations.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials are new&#8208;generation electrocatalysts for water splitting due to their excellent reactivity and highly tailorable electrochemical properties. Herein, a powerful top&#8208;level design strategy is reported to guide and design advanced high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts by establishing reaction models (e.g., reaction energy barrier, conductivity, adsorption geometries for intermediates, and rate&#8208;determining step) to predict performance with the help of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Accordingly, novel high&#8208;entropy Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalysts are fabricated by a new low&#8208;temperature electrochemical reconstruction method and their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties are thoroughly characterized.

     alt="Top-Level Design Strategy to Construct an Advanced High-Entropy Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Mo (Oxy)Hydroxide Electrocatalyst for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A top-level design strategy assisted by density functional theory is reported to guide and design advanced high-entropy electrocatalysts and their enhanced catalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance is successfully predicted. A new low-temperature electrochemical reconstruction method is developed to fabricate the as-predicted high-entropy catalysts. The as-prepared high-entropy Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalyst exhibits exceptional electrocatalytic OER performance, consistent with theory calculations.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-entropy materials are new-generation electrocatalysts for water splitting due to their excellent reactivity and highly tailorable electrochemical properties. Herein, a powerful top-level design strategy is reported to guide and design advanced high-entropy electrocatalysts by establishing reaction models (e.g., reaction energy barrier, conductivity, adsorption geometries for intermediates, and rate-determining step) to predict performance with the help of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Accordingly, novel high-entropy Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalysts are fabricated by a new low-temperature electrochemical reconstruction method and their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties are thoroughly characterized. These as-prepared quaternary metallic (oxy)hydroxides present much better OER performance than ternary Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide, Co&#8211;Fe&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide, and other counterparts, and are demonstrated with a low overpotential of 199&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a 48.8&#160;mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; Tafel slope in 1 &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; KOH and excellent stability without decay over 72 h. The performance enhancement mechanism is also unraveled by synchrotron radiation. The work verifies the usefulness of high-entropy design and the great synergistic effect on OER performance by the incorporation of four elements, and also provides a new method for the construction of advanced high-entropy materials for energy conversion and storage.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Polymeric Microparticles Generated via Confinement&#8208;Free Fluid Instability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexplored facile and scalable polymeric microparticle fabrication strategy via confinement&#8208;free fluid instability induced by an ultralow&#8208;surface&#8208;energy layer is reported. This method can be applied to a variety of polymers with a wide range of sizes. This research introduces an intriguing phenomenon in fluid dynamics on superamphiphobic surfaces, which should lead to more exciting discoveries in the future.








Abstract
In&#8208;fiber fluid instability can be harnessed to realize scalable microparticles fabrication with tunable sizes and multifunctional characteristics making it competitive in comparison to conventional microparticles fabrication methods. However, since in&#8208;fiber fluid instability has to be induced via thermal annealing and the resulting microparticles can only be collected after dissolving the fiber cladding, obtaining contamination&#8208;free particles for high&#8208;temperature incompatible materials remains great challenge. Herein, confinement&#8208;free fluid instability is demonstrated to fabricate polymeric microparticles in a facile manner induced by the ultralow surface energy of the superamphiphobic surface. The polymer solution columns break up into uniform droplets then form spherical particles spontaneously in seconds at ambient temperature. This method can be applied to a variety of polymers spanning an exceptionally wide range of sizes: from 1&#160;mm down to 1&#160;&#181;m. With the aid of microfluidic spinning instrument, a large quantity of microparticles can be obtained, making this method promising for scaling up production. Notably, through simple modification of the feed solution configuration, composite/structured micromaterials can also be produced, including quantum&#8208;dots&#8208;labeled fluorescent particles, magnetic particles, core&#8211;shell particles, microcapsules, and necklace&#8208;like microfibers. This method, with general applicability and facile control, is envisioned to have great prospects in the field of polymer microprocessing.

         <title>Flexible Self&#8208;Powered Integrated Sensing System with 3D Periodic Ordered Black Phosphorus@MXene Thin&#8208;Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>

An MXene/BP&#8208;based self&#8208;powered smart sensor system can be created by integrating a flexible pressure sensor with direct&#8208;laser&#8208;writing micro&#8208;supercapacitors and solar cells. The smart sensor system exhibits a detection capability for the state of the human heart under physiological conditions. The MXene materials design and system integration developed in this work offers a general platform for next&#8208;generation self&#8208;powered electronics.








Abstract
Accurate and continuous detection of physiological signals without the need for an external power supply is a key technology for realizing wearable electronics as next&#8208;generation biomedical devices. Herein, it is shown that a MXene/black phosphorus (BP)&#8208;based self&#8208;powered smart sensor system can be designed by integrating a flexible pressure sensor with direct&#8208;laser&#8208;writing micro&#8208;supercapacitors and solar cells. Using a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) self&#8208;assembly process to form a periodic interleaving MXene/BP lamellar structure results in a high energy&#8208;storage capacity in a direct&#8208;laser&#8208;writing micro&#8208;supercapacitor to drive the operation of sensors and compensate the intermittency of light illumination. Meanwhile, with MXene/BP as the sensitive layer in a flexible pressure sensor, the pressure sensitivity of the device can be improved to 77.61 kPa&#8211;1 at an optimized elastic modulus of 0.45&#160;MPa. Furthermore, the smart sensor system with fast response time (10.9&#160;ms) shows a real&#8208;time detection capability for the state of the human heart under physiological conditions. It is believed that the proposed study based on the design and integration of MXene materials will provide a general platform for next&#8208;generation self&#8208;powered electronics.

         <title>Capillary&#8208;Force&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly of 4D&#8208;Printed Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible and bidirectional self&#8208;assembly of microstructures is realized by two&#8208;photon&#8208;lithography&#8208;based 4D microprinting for reversible pattern/encapsulation, switchable wetting, and the dynamic actuation of microrobots/micromachines. In different evaporating solvents, the 4D&#8208;printed microstructures can exhibit three reversible geometries: (I) curved state, (II) distance&#8208;dependent coalesced clusters via traditional self&#8208;assembly, and (III) distance&#8208;independent arbitrary self&#8208;assemblies (4D self&#8208;assemblies) toward the curving directions.








Abstract
Capillary&#8208;force&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly is emerging as a significant approach for the massive manufacture of advanced materials with novel wetting, adhesion, optical, mechanical, or electrical properties. However, academic value and practical applications of the self&#8208;assembly are greatly restricted because traditional micropillar self&#8208;assembly is always unidirectional. In this work, two&#8208;photon&#8208;lithography&#8208;based 4D microprinting is introduced to realize the reversible and bidirectional self&#8208;assembly of microstructures. With asymmetric crosslinking densities, the printed vertical microstructures can switch to a curved state with controlled thickness, curvature, and smooth morphology that are impossible to replicate by traditional 3D&#8208;printing technology. In different evaporating solvents, the 4D&#8208;printed microstructures can experience three states: (I) coalesce into clusters from original vertical states via traditional self&#8208;assembly, (II) remain curved, or (III) arbitrarily self&#8208;assemble (4D self&#8208;assembly) toward the curving directions. Compared to conventional approaches, this 4D self&#8208;assembly is distance&#8208;independent, which can generate varieties of assemblies with a yield as high as 100%. More importantly, the three states can be reversibly switched, allowing the development of many promising applications such as reversible micropatterns, switchable wetting, and dynamic actuation of microrobots, origami, and encapsulation.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Like Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Melamine&#8211;Cyanuric Acid Supramolecular Nanosheets as Pseudo&#8208;Porous Catalyst Support</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular network consisting of melamine and cyanuric acid is fabricated as ultrathin nanosheets with extraordinary stability at pH = 0, serving as a pseudo&#8208;porous catalyst support to simultaneously give remarkable enhancement in the catalytic stability and activity of metal phosphides for the hydrogen evolution reaction in strong acidic conditions.








Abstract
Behaving as structural protectors and electronic modulators, catalyst supports such as graphene derivatives are generally constructed by covalent bonds. Here, hydrogen&#8208;bonded ultrathin nanosheets are reported as a new type of catalyst support. Melamine (M) and cyanuric acid (CA) molecules self&#8208;assemble to form the graphite&#8208;like hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystal M&#8208;CA, which can be easily exfoliated by ultrasonic treatment to yield ultrathin nanosheets with thickness of &#8776;1.6 nm and high stability at pH = 0. The dynamic nanosheets form adaptive defects/pores in the synthetic process of CoP nanoparticles, giving embedded composite with high hydrogen evolution activity (overpotential of 66 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2) and stability. Computational calculations, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy unveil the electron modulation effects of the nanosheets. This pseudo&#8208;porous catalyst support also can be applied to other metal phosphides.

Melamine (&lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;) and cyanuric acid (&lt;b&gt;CA&lt;/b&gt;) molecules self-assemble to form the graphite-like hydrogen-bonded co-crystal &lt;b&gt;M-CA&lt;/b&gt;, which can be easily exfoliated by ultrasonic treatment to yield ultrathin nanosheets with thickness of &#8776;1.6 nm and high stability at pH = 0. The dynamic nanosheets form adaptive defects/pores in the synthetic process of CoP nanoparticles, giving embedded composite with high hydrogen evolution activity (overpotential of 66 mV at 10 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and stability. Computational calculations, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy unveil the electron modulation effects of the nanosheets. This pseudo-porous catalyst support also can be applied to other metal phosphides.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>From Chaos to Control: Programmable Crack Patterning with Molecular Order in Polymer Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cracks are normally classified as material failures to be prevented. A crack patterning strategy is described that allows freely programmable patterns of cracks guided by the alignment of liquid crystal polymer networks. This programmable cracking enables high&#8208;resolution patterning in a high&#8208;throughput manner without the use of expensive lithography procedures and may serve as an alternative fabrication strategy for various applications.








Abstract
Cracks are typically associated with the failure of materials. However, cracks can also be used to create periodic patterns on the surfaces of materials, as observed in the skin of crocodiles and elephants. In synthetic materials, surface patterns are critical to micro&#8208; and nanoscale fabrication processes. Here, a strategy is presented that enables freely programmable patterns of cracks on the surface of a polymer and then uses these cracks to pattern other materials. Cracks form during deposition of a thin film metal on a liquid crystal polymer network (LCN) and follow the spatially patterned molecular order of the polymer. These patterned sub&#8208;micrometer scale cracks have an order parameter of 0.98&#160;&#177; 0.02 and form readily over centimeter&#8208;scale areas on the flexible substrates. The patterning of the LCN enables cracks that turn corners, spiral azimuthally, or radiate from a point. Conductive inks can be filled into these oriented cracks, resulting in flexible, anisotropic, and transparent conductors. This materials&#8208;based processing approach to patterning cracks enables unprecedented control of the orientation, length, width, and depth of the cracks without costly lithography methods. This approach promises new architectures of electronics, sensors, fluidics, optics, and other devices with micro&#8208; and nanoscale features.

         <title>Resonant Spin Transmission Mediated by Magnons in a Magnetic Insulator Multilayer Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By developing an epitaxial magnetic insulator heterotructure, the magnon&#8208;mediated resonant spin transmission enhancement effect is achieved, where transmission of magnon spin current can be increased by more than 1000% at selected frequencies. This novel effect can provide useful mechanisms for building future magnonic devices similar to their photonic counterparts such as antireflection coatings and Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavities.








Abstract
While being electrically insulating, magnetic insulators can behave as good spin conductors by carrying spin current with excited spin waves. So far, magnetic insulators are utilized in multilayer heterostructures for optimizing spin transport or to form magnon spin valves for reaching controls over the spin flow. In these studies, it remains an intensively visited topic as to what the corresponding roles of coherent and incoherent magnons are in the spin transmission. Meanwhile, understanding the underlying mechanism associated with spin transmission in insulators can help to identify new mechanisms that can further improve the spin transport efficiency. Here, by studying spin transport in a magnetic&#8208;metal/magnetic&#8208;insulator/platinum multilayer, it is demonstrated that coherent magnons can transfer spins efficiently above the magnon bandgap of magnetic insulators. Particularly the standing spin&#8208;wave mode can greatly enhance the spin flow by inducing a resonant magnon transmission. Furthermore, within the magnon bandgap, a shutdown of spin transmission due to the blocking of coherent magnons is observed. The demonstrated magnon transmission enhancement and filtering effect provides an efficient method for modulating spin current in magnonic devices.

         <title>Polymer Dielectrics with Simultaneous Ultrahigh Energy Density and Low Loss</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zwitterion&#8208;functionalized polymers are synthsized with a record&#8208;high breakdown strength of 1300 MV&#160;m&#8722;1, energy density above 35 J&#160;cm&#8722;3, and charge&#8211;discharge efficiency of &gt;90%, taking advantage of the covalent&#8208;bonding&#8208;restricted ion polarization and the charge trapping of the ion cluster phase.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics are highly desirable in capacitor applications due to their low cost, high breakdown strength, and unique self&#8208;healing capability. However, existing polymer dielectrics suffer from either a low energy density or a high dielectric loss, thereby hindering the development of compact, efficient, and reliable power electronics. Here, a novel type of polymer dielectrics simultaneously exhibiting an extraordinarily high recoverable energy density of 35 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and a low dielectric loss is reported. It is synthesized by grafting zwitterions onto the short side chains of a poly(4&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;pentene) (PMP)&#8208;based copolymer, which increases its dielectric constant from &#8776;2.2 to &#8776;5.2 and significantly enhances its breakdown strength from &#8776;700 MV&#160;m&#8722;1 to &#8776;1300 MV&#160;m&#8722;1 while maintaining its low dielectric loss of &lt;0.002 and high charge&#8211;discharge efficiency of &gt;90%. Based on a combination of the phase&#8208;field method description of mesoscale structures, Maxwell equations, and theoretical analysis, it is demonstrated that the outstanding combination of high energy density and low dielectric loss of zwitterions&#8208;grafted copolymers is attributed to the covalent&#8208;bonding restricted ion polarization and the strong charge trapping by the zwitterions. This work represents a new strategy in polymer dielectrics for achieving simultaneous high energy density and low dielectric loss.

         <title>An Inorganic/Organic S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction H2&#8208;Production Photocatalyst and its Charge Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of a CdS/PT inorganic/organic S&#8208;scheme heterojunction not only leads to efficient charge separation and transfer, but also increased redox ability and enhanced stability for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Inspired by natural photosynthesis, constructing inorganic/organic heterojunctions is regarded as an effective strategy to design high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts. Herein, a step (S)&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst is prepared by in situ growth of an inorganic semiconductor firmly on an organic semiconductor. A new pyrene&#8208;based conjugated polymer, pyrene&#8208;alt&#8208;triphenylamine (PT), is synthesized via the typical Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reactions, and then employed as a substrate to anchor CdS nanocrystals. The optimized CdS/PT composite, coupling 2 wt% PT with CdS, exhibits a robust H2 evolution rate of 9.28 mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 with continuous release of H2 bubbles, as well as a high apparent quantum efficiency of 24.3%, which is &#8776;8 times that of pure CdS. The S&#8208;scheme charge transfer mechanism between PT and CdS, is systematically demonstrated by photoirradiated Kelvin probe measurement and in situ irradiated X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. This work provides a protocol for preparing specific S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts on the basis of inorganic/organic coupling.

         <title>Observation of Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov States in Superconducting Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The realization of Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov (YSR) states in graphene, a non&#8208;superconducting 2D material, and without the participation of magnetic atoms, is shown. Graphene is made superconducting by the proximity effect with Pb islands. These scanning tunneling microscopy experiments reveal the very special nature of these YSR states and constitute an unequivocal demonstration of carbon magnetism at graphene grain boundaries.








Abstract
When magnetic atoms are inserted inside a superconductor, the superconducting order is locally depleted as a result of the antagonistic nature of magnetism and superconductivity. Thereby, distinctive spectral features, known as Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states, appear inside the superconducting gap. The search for Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states in different materials is intense, as they can be used as building blocks to promote Majorana modes suitable for topological quantum computing. Here, the first observation of Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states in graphene, a non&#8208;superconducting 2D material, and without the participation of magnetic atoms, is reported. Superconductivity in graphene is induced by proximity effect brought by adsorbing nanometer&#8208;scale superconducting Pb islands. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy the superconducting proximity gap is measured in graphene, and Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states are visualized in graphene grain boundaries. The results reveal the very special nature of those Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states, which extends more than 20&#160;nm away from the grain boundaries. These observations provide the long&#8208;sought experimental confirmation that graphene grain boundaries host local magnetic moments and constitute the first observation of Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states in a chemically pure system.

         <title>Spontaneous Pillaring of Pentasil Zeolites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spontaneous formation of self&#8208;pillared pentasil zeolites in the absence of any template is demonstrated via heterogeneous nucleation of sequentially branched nanosheets from amorphous precursors. These hierarchical zeolites have a large external surface area and high percentages of external acid sites, which markedly improves their catalytic performance. These findings highlight a facile method to reduce mass&#8208;transport limitations in nanoporous zeolites.








Abstract
Conventional methods to prepare hierarchical zeolites depend upon the use of organic structure&#8208;directing agents and often require multiple synthesis steps with limited product yield and Br&#248;nsted acid concentration. Here, it is shown that the use of MEL&#8208; or MFI&#8208;type zeolites as crystalline seeds induces the spontaneous formation of self&#8208;pillared pentasil zeolites, thus avoiding the use of any organic or branching template for the crystallization of these hierarchical structures. The mechanism of formation is evaluated by time&#8208;resolved electron microscopy to provide evidence for the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of sequentially branched nanosheets from amorphous precursors. The resulting hierarchical zeolites have large external surface area and high percentages of external acid sites, which markedly improves their catalytic performance in the Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation and methanol to hydrocarbons reactions. These findings highlight a facile, commercially viable synthesis method to reduce mass&#8208;transport limitations and improve the performance of zeolite catalysts.

         <title>Single&#8208;Cell Immunoblotting based on a Photoclick Hydrogel Enables High&#8208;Throughput Screening and Accurate Profiling of Exogenous Gene Expression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;cell transfection analysis chip (scTAC) is developed for expression screening, precise positioning of transfected cells, and immunoblotting analysis of multi&#8208;target proteins. scTAC allows for true single&#8208;cell up&#8208;sampling and enables the acquisition of continuous single&#8208;cell protein expression even in low co&#8208;expression scenarios. scTAC provides a powerful tool for the analysis of biological pathways after transfection of rare cells.








Abstract
Fast and accurate profiling of exogenous gene expression in host cells is crucial for studying gene function in cellular and molecular biology, but still faces the challenge of incomplete co&#8208;expression of reporter genes and target genes. Here, a single&#8208;cell transfection analysis chip (scTAC) is presented, which is based on the in situ microchip immunoblotting method, for rapid and accurate analysis of exogenous gene expression in thousands of individual host cells. scTAC not only can assign information of exogenous gene activity to specific transfected cells, but enables the acquisition of continuous protein expression even in low co&#8208;expression scenarios. It is demonstrated that scTAC can reveal the relationship of expression level between reporter genes and target genes, which is helpful for evaluating transient transfection strategy efficiency. The advantages of this method for the study of fusion protein expression and downstream protein expression in signaling pathway in rare cells are shown. Empirically, an EGFP&#8208;TSPAN8 fusion plasmid is transfected into MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells and the expressions of two cancer stemness biomarkers (ALDHA1 and SOX2) are analyzed. The scTAC method clearly reveals an interesting phenomenon that transfected adherent MCF&#8208;7 cells exhibit some stem cell characteristics, but they do not have stem cell appearance.

         <title>Multivalent Nanosheet Antibody Mimics for Selective Microbial Recognition and Inactivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent nanosheet artificial antibodies with high selectivity and strong binding affinity to pathogenic bacteria are created by spontaneous assembly of various tripeptide recognition phases on transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets. The luminescent antibody mimics can detect pathogenic bacteria at a single&#8208;cell level from human serum and urine and effectively inactivate them on wounds of infected mice for healing.








Abstract
Antibodies are widely used as recognition elements in sensing and therapy, but they suffer from poor stability, long discovery time, and high cost. Herein, a facile approach to create antibody mimics with flexible recognition phases and luminescent rigid scaffolds for the selective recognition, detection, and inactivation of pathogenic bacteria is reported. Tripeptides with a nitriloacetate&#8208;Cu group are spontaneously assembled on transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanosheets via coordination bonding, providing a diversity of TMD&#8208;tripeptide assembly (TPA) antibody mimics. TMD&#8208;TPA antibody mimics can selectively recognize various pathogenic bacteria with nanomolar affinities. The bacterial binding sites for TMD&#8208;TPA are identified by experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, revealing that the dynamic and multivalent interactions of artificial antibodies play a crucial role for their recognition selectivity and affinity. The artificial antibodies allow the rapid and selective detection of pathogenic bacteria at single copy in human serum and urine, and their effective inactivation for therapy of infected mice. This work demonstrates the potential of TMD&#8208;TPA antibody mimics as an alternative to natural antibodies for sensing and therapy.

         <title>Improving Image&#8208;Guided Surgical and Immunological Tumor Treatment Efficacy by Photothermal and Photodynamic Therapies Based on a Multifunctional NIR AIEgen</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrated surgery and phototheranostics employing nanoparticles based on a near&#8208;infrared aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) for image&#8208;guided synergistic tumor therapy are explored to overcome respective limitations and realize maximized therapeutic outcomes and minimized recurrences. Moreover, the combined treatment of AIEgen&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;mediated phototheranostics and programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 antibody significantly induces tumor elimination by enhancing the effect of immunotherapy.








Abstract
Multimodal therapy is attracting increasing attention to improve tumor treatment efficacy, but generally requires various complicated ingredients combined within one theranostic system to achieve multiple functions. Herein, a multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform based on a single aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogen (AIEgen), DDTB, is designed to integrate near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence, photothermal, photodynamic, and immunological effects. Intravenously injected AIEgen&#8208;based nanoparticles can efficiently accumulate in tumors with NIR fluorescence to provide preoperative diagnosis. Most of the tumors are excised under intraoperative fluorescence navigation, whereafter, some microscopic residual tumors are completely ablated by photodynamic and photothermal therapies for maximally killing the tumor cells and tissues. Up to 90% of the survival rate can be achieved by this synergistic image&#8208;guided surgery and photodynamic and photothermal therapies. Importantly, the nanoparticles&#8208;mediated photothermal/photodynamic therapy plus programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 antibody significantly induce tumor elimination by enhancing the effect of immunotherapy. This theranostic strategy on the basis of a single AIEgen significantly improves the survival of cancer mice with maximized therapeutic outcomes, and holds great promise for clinical cancer treatment.

A new wide&#8208;bandgap conjugated polymer, PBQx&#8208;TCl, exhibits 18% efficiency for outdoor application and 28.5% efficiency for indoor application. Simultaneously, the PBQx&#8208;TCl&#8208;based device also shows light&#8208;emitting function with broad emission ranges from 630 to 1000 nm and moderate external quantum efficiency approaching 0.2%.








Abstract
Exploring the intriguing bifunctional nature of organic semiconductors and investigating the feasibility of fabricating bifunctional devices are of great significance in realizing various applications with one device. Here, the design of a new wide&#8208;bandgap polymer named PBQx&#8208;TCl (optical bandgap of 2.05&#160;eV) is reported, and its applications in photovoltaic and light&#8208;emitting devices are studied. By fabricating devices with nonfullerene acceptors BTA3 and BTP&#8208;eC9, it is shown that the devices exhibit a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.0% under air mass 1.5G illumination conditions and an outstanding PCE of 28.5% for a 1 cm2 device and 26.0% for a 10 cm2 device under illumination from a 1000 lux light&#8208;emitting diode. In addition, the PBQx&#8208;TCl:BTA3&#8208;based device also demonstrates a moderate organic light&#8208;emitting diode performance with an electroluminescence external quantum efficiency approaching 0.2% and a broad emission range of 630&#8211;1000&#160;nm. These results suggest that the polymer PBQx&#8208;TCl&#8208;based devices exhibit outstanding photovoltaic performance and potential light&#8208;emitting functions.

         <title>Crack Programming: From Chaos to Control: Programmable Crack Patterning with Molecular Order in Polymer Substrates (Adv. Mater. 22/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cracking is typically an uncontrolled material failure process. In article number 2008434, Hyun Kim, Taylor H. Ware, and co&#8208;workers describe a process that enables unprecedented control of crack formation. By depositing thin&#8208;film chromium on photoaligned liquid&#8208;crystal polymer networks, patterns of cracks on the surface of a polymer can be freely programmed in a high&#8208;resolution and high&#8208;throughput manner. This crack programming process provides new opportunities for unconventional microfabrication. The image depicts light transmitted through a polymer film coated with chromium with azimuthally patterned cracks.

         <dc:description>
In article number 2008761, Congxin Xia, Zhongming Wei, and co&#8208;workers describe substitution with lighter elements significantly increasing the bandgap of GaPS4, and simultaneously inheriting its in&#8208;plain anisotropy. GaPS4 thus becomes a promising candidate material for solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet and polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors. The balance demonstrates the main idea of the cross&#8208;substitution, with edge&#8208;sharing [GeS4]&#8211;[GeS4] atomic packing in the left pan and the tetrahedra centered by lighter elements (Ga and P) forming the [GaS4]&#8211;[PS4] motif in the right pan.

         <title>Superconductivity in Graphene: Observation of Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov States in Superconducting Graphene (Adv. Mater. 22/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene is made superconducting with Pb islands by Iv&#225;n Brihuega and co&#8208;workers, as detailed in article number 2008113. At the same time, magnetic moments are introduced using naturally existing graphene grain boundaries. They show that both superconductivity and magnetism can coexist in graphene, generating exotic Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states. Those states provide a starting point to ultimately create graphene topological qubits, putting forward graphene as a potential platform for topological quantum computing.

         <title>Polyphenol&#8208;Containing Nanoparticles: Synthesis, Properties, and Therapeutic Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, properties, and biomedical applications of polyphenol&#8208;containing nanomaterials are comprehensively reviewed. The problems in the current polyphenol&#8208;based nanosystems and the future research directions in this field are also discussed.








Abstract
Polyphenols, the phenolic hydroxyl group&#8208;containing organic molecules, are widely found in natural plants and have shown beneficial effects on human health. Recently, polyphenol&#8208;containing nanoparticles have attracted extensive research attention due to their antioxidation property, anticancer activity, and universal adherent affinity, and thus have shown great promise in the preparation, stabilization, and modification of multifunctional nanoassemblies for bioimaging, therapeutic delivery, and other biomedical applications. Additionally, the metal&#8722;polyphenol networks, formed by the coordination interactions between polyphenols and metal ions, have been used to prepare an important class of polyphenol&#8208;containing nanoparticles for surface modification, bioimaging, drug delivery, and disease treatments. By focusing on the interactions between polyphenols and different materials (e.g., metal ions, inorganic materials, polymers, proteins, and nucleic acids), a comprehensive review on the synthesis and properties of the polyphenol&#8208;containing nanoparticles is provided. Moreover, the remarkable versatility of polyphenol&#8208;containing nanoparticles in different biomedical applications, including biodetection, multimodal bioimaging, protein and gene delivery, bone repair, antibiosis, and cancer theranostics is also demonstrated. Finally, the challenges faced by future research regarding the polyphenol&#8208;containing nanoparticles are discussed.

         <title>Atomically Thin Quantum Spin Hall Insulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically thin quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators&#8212;a class of 2D topological insulators&#8212;promises to radically transform classical and quantum electronic device concepts. Advances in materials science and engineering are surveyed, alongside a theoretical description, and the future perspectives for electronic applications are discussed, including the quest to realizing Majorana&#8208;based topological quantum computing&#8212;the next frontier in QSH materials research.








Abstract
Atomically thin topological materials are attracting growing attention for their potential to radically transform classical and quantum electronic device concepts. Among them is the quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator&#8212;a 2D state of matter that arises from interplay of topological band inversion and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, with large tunable bulk bandgaps up to 800 meV and gapless, 1D edge states. Reviewing recent advances in materials science and engineering alongside theoretical description, the QSH materials library is surveyed with focus on the prospects for QSH&#8208;based device applications. In particular, theoretical predictions of nontrivial superconducting pairing in the QSH state toward Majorana&#8208;based topological quantum computing are discussed, which are the next frontier in QSH materials research.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Enhance Biomimetic Cascade Catalysis for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research progress on the design and construction of biomimetic cascade reaction systems that incorporate metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF), for signal amplification in biosensing, is summarized. Notably, the mechanisms for the improvement of catalytic activity and selectivity of the MOF&#8208;involving cascade systems are discussed in detail. In addition, the challenges and opportunities in the way of the further design and applications of cascade systems with MOFs are briefly put forward.








Abstract
Multiple enzymes&#8208;induced biological cascade catalysis guides efficient and selective substrate transformations in vivo. The biomimetic cascade systems, as ingenious strategies for signal transduction and amplification, have a wide range of applications in biosensing. However, the fragile nature of enzymes greatly limits their wide applications. In this regard, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with porous structures, unique nano/microenvironments, and good biocompatibility have been skillfully used as carriers to immobilize enzymes for shielding them against hash surroundings and improving the catalytic efficiency. For another, nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like properties and brilliant stabilities (nanozymes), have been widely applied to ameliorate the low stability of the enzymes. Inheriting the abovementioned merits of MOFs, the performances of MOFs&#8208;immboilized nanozymes could be significantly enhanced. Furthermore, in addition to carriers, some MOFs can also serve as nanozymes, expanding their applications in cascade systems. Herein, recent advances in the fabrication of efficient MOFs&#8208;involving enzymes/nanozymes cascade systems and biosensing applications are highlighted. Integrating diversified signal output modes, including colorimetry, electrochemistry, fluorescence, chemiluminescence, and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering, sensitive detection of various targets (including biological molecules, environmental pollutants, enzyme activities, and so on) are realized. Finally, challenges and opportunities about further constructions and applications of MOFs&#8208;involving cascade reaction systems are briefly put forward.

The biomimetic cascade systems, as ingenious strategies for signal transduction and amplification, have a wide range of applications in biosensing. However, the fragile nature of enzymes greatly limits their wide applications. In this regard, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with porous structures, unique nano/microenvironments, and good biocompatibility have been skillfully used as carriers to immobilize enzymes for shielding them against hash surroundings and improving the catalytic efficiency. For another, nanomaterials with enzyme-like properties and brilliant stabilities (nanozymes), have been widely applied to ameliorate the low stability of the enzymes. Inheriting the abovementioned merits of MOFs, the performances of MOFs-immboilized nanozymes could be significantly enhanced. Furthermore, in addition to carriers, some MOFs can also serve as nanozymes, expanding their applications in cascade systems. Herein, recent advances in the fabrication of efficient MOFs-involving enzymes/nanozymes cascade systems and biosensing applications are highlighted. Integrating diversified signal output modes, including colorimetry, electrochemistry, fluorescence, chemiluminescence, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering, sensitive detection of various targets (including biological molecules, environmental pollutants, enzyme activities, and so on) are realized. Finally, challenges and opportunities about further constructions and applications of MOFs-involving cascade reaction systems are briefly put forward.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Micro&#8208;Bio&#8208;Chemo&#8208;Mechanical&#8208;Systems: Micromotors, Microfluidics, and Nanozymes for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micromotors, microfluidics, and nanozymes originated as independent disciplines&#8212;today, their convergence can help solve each discipline's challenges and lead to essential advantages in bioapplications. Nanozymes significantly expand the scope of chemical reactions and fuels of catalytic micromotors with integrated dynamic responses. Microfluidics is used to mass&#8208;produce micromotors with optimal size, compositions, and core&#8211;shell properties for biomedical imaging and theranostics.








Abstract
Wireless nano&#8208;/micromotors powered by chemical reactions and/or external fields generate motive forces, perform tasks, and significantly extend short&#8208;range dynamic responses of passive biomedical microcarriers. However, before micromotors can be translated into clinical use, several major problems, including the biocompatibility of materials, the toxicity of chemical fuels, and deep tissue imaging methods, must be solved. Nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like characteristics (e.g., catalase, oxidase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase), that is, nanozymes, can significantly expand the scope of micromotors&#8217; chemical fuels. A convergence of nanozymes, micromotors, and microfluidics can lead to a paradigm shift in the fabrication of multifunctional micromotors in reasonable quantities, encapsulation of desired subsystems, and engineering of FDA&#8208;approved core&#8211;shell structures with tuneable biological, physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. Microfluidic methods are used to prepare stable bubbles/microbubbles and capsules integrating ultrasound, optoacoustic, fluorescent, and magnetic resonance imaging modalities. The aim here is to discuss an interdisciplinary approach of three independent emerging topics: micromotors, nanozymes, and microfluidics to creatively: 1) embrace new ideas, 2) think across boundaries, and 3) solve problems whose solutions are beyond the scope of a single discipline toward the development of micro&#8208;bio&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical&#8208;systems for diverse bioapplications.

         <title>Interphases, Interfaces, and Surfaces of Active Materials in Rechargeable Batteries and Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfaces provide reactive zones and interphases stabilize electronic device operation. Understanding and designing interfaces and interphases represents an effective and efficient way for developing high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries and perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;increasing demand for clean sustainable energy has driven tremendous worldwide investment in the design and exploration of new active materials for energy conversion and energy&#8208;storage devices. Tailoring the surfaces of and interfaces between different materials is one of the surest and best studied paths to enable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries and high&#8208;efficiency solar cells. Metal&#8208;halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are one of the most promising photovoltaic materials due to their unprecedented development, with their record power conversion efficiency (PCE) rocketing beyond 25% in less than 10 years. Such progress is achieved largely through the control of crystallinity and surface/interface defects. Rechargeable batteries (RBs) reversibly convert electrical and chemical potential energy through redox reactions at the interfaces between the electrodes and electrolyte. The (electro)chemical and optoelectronic compatibility between active components are essential design considerations to optimize power conversion and energy storage performance. A focused discussion and critical analysis on the formation and functions of the interfaces and interphases of the active materials in these devices is provided, and prospective strategies used to overcome current challenges are described. These strategies revolve around manipulating the chemical compositions, defects, stability, and passivation of the various interfaces of RBs and PSCs.

Recent advancements in the development of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) in the field of nanomedicine are reviewed. Following an overview of the properties of GQDs, progress in top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up synthesis methods is presented. Application of GQDs in various modes of bioimaging, biosensing, and therapy are also discussed, with a subsequent discussion of future directions.








Abstract
Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are carbon&#8208;based, nanoscale particles that exhibit excellent chemical, physical, and biological properties that allow them to excel in a wide range of applications in nanomedicine. The unique electronic structure of GQDs confers functional attributes onto these nanomaterials such as strong and tunable photoluminescence for use in fluorescence bioimaging and biosensing, a high loading capacity of aromatic compounds for small&#8208;molecule drug delivery, and the ability to absorb incident radiation for use in the cancer&#8208;killing techniques of photothermal and photodynamic therapy. Recent advances in the development of GQDs as novel, multifunctional biomaterials are presented with a focus on their physicochemical, electronic, magnetic, and biological properties, along with a discussion of technical progress in the synthesis of GQDs. Progress toward the application of GQDs in bioimaging, biosensing, and therapy is reviewed, along with a discussion of the current limitations and future directions of this exciting material.

Abstract
Recent studies of the optical properties of 2D materials have reported unique phenomena and features that are absent in conventional bulk semiconductors. Many of these interesting properties, such as enhanced light&#8208;matter coupling, gate&#8208;tunable photoluminescence, and unusual excitonic optical selection rules arise from the nature of the two&#8208; and multi&#8208;particle excited states such as strongly bound Wannier excitons and charged excitons. The theory, modeling, and ab initio calculations of these optically excited states in 2D materials are reviewed. Several analytical and ab initio approaches are introduced. These methods are compared with each other, revealing their relative strength and limitations. Recent works that apply these methods to a variety of 2D materials and material&#8208;defect systems are then highlighted. Understanding of the optically excited states in these systems is relevant not only for fundamental scientific research of electronic excitations and correlations, but also plays an important role in the future development of quantum information science and nano&#8208;photonics.

&lt;p&gt;Recent studies of the optical properties of 2D materials have reported unique phenomena and features that are absent in conventional bulk semiconductors. Many of these interesting properties, such as enhanced light-matter coupling, gate-tunable photoluminescence, and unusual excitonic optical selection rules arise from the nature of the two- and multi-particle excited states such as strongly bound Wannier excitons and charged excitons. The theory, modeling, and ab initio calculations of these optically excited states in 2D materials are reviewed. Several analytical and ab initio approaches are introduced. These methods are compared with each other, revealing their relative strength and limitations. Recent works that apply these methods to a variety of 2D materials and material-defect systems are then highlighted. Understanding of the optically excited states in these systems is relevant not only for fundamental scientific research of electronic excitations and correlations, but also plays an important role in the future development of quantum information science and nano-photonics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Visco&#8208;Poroelastic Electrochemiluminescence Skin with Piezo&#8208;Ionic Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material platform capable of transducing mechanical stimuli into visual readout is presented. The material platform contains liquid state electrochemiluminescence (ECL) active materials within rubbery polymer matrix, which undergoes visco&#8208;poroelastic response to mechanical stress. Incorporating this visco&#8208;poroelastic material into a simple electronic device, which is termed &#8220;ECL skin&#8221;, locally applied stress is spatially resolved and visualized.








Abstract
Following early research efforts devoted to achieving excellent sensitivity of electronic skins, recent design schemes for these devices have focused on strategies for transduction of spatially resolved sensing data into straightforward user&#8208;adaptive visual signals. Here, a material platform capable of transducing mechanical stimuli into visual readout is presented. The material layer comprises a mixture of an ionic transition metal complex luminophore and an ionic liquid (capable of producing electrochemiluminescence (ECL)) within a thermoplastic polyurethane matrix. The proposed material platform shows visco&#8208;poroelastic response to mechanical stress, which induces a change in the distribution of the ionic luminophore in the film, which is referred to as the piezo&#8208;ionic effect. This piezo&#8208;ionic effect is exploited to develop a simple device containing the composite layer sandwiched between two electrodes, which is termed &#8220;ECL skin&#8221;. Emission from the ECL skin is examined, which increases with the applied normal/tensile stress. Additionally, locally applied stress to the ECL skin is spatially resolved and visualized without the use of spatially distributed arrays of pressure sensors. The simple fabrication and unique operation of the demonstrated ECL skin are expected to provide new insights into the design of materials for human&#8211;machine interactive electronic skins.

         <title>Alternative Lone&#8208;Pair ns2&#8208;Cation&#8208;Based Semiconductors beyond Lead Halide Perovskites for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of recent progress on emerging Pb&#8208;free semiconductors containing lone&#8208;pair ns2 cations is provided, with the purpose of providing valid insights for discovering auspicious optoelectronic materials other than lead halide perovskites. The issues hindering performance enhancement and the design strategies of novel ns2&#8208;cation&#8208;based optoelectronic semiconductors are discussed.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskites have emerged in the last decade as advantageous high&#8208;performance optoelectronic semiconductors, and have undergone rapid development for diverse applications such as solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes , and photodetectors. While material instability and lead toxicity are still major concerns hindering their commercialization, they offer promising prospects and design principles for developing promising optoelectronic materials. The distinguished optoelectronic properties of lead halide perovskites stem from the Pb2+ cation with a lone&#8208;pair 6s2 electronic configuration embedded in a mixed covalent&#8211;ionic bonding lattice. Herein, we&#160;summarize alternative Pb&#8208;free semiconductors containing lone&#8208;pair ns2 cations, intending to offer insights for developing potential optoelectronic materials other than lead halide perovskites. We&#160;start with the physical underpinning of how the ns2 cations within the material lattice allow for superior optoelectronic properties. We&#160;then review the emerging Pb&#8208;free semiconductors containing ns2 cations in terms of structural dimensionality, which is crucial for optoelectronic performance. For each category of materials, the research progresses on crystal structures, electronic/optical properties, device applications, and recent efforts for performance enhancements are overviewed. Finally, the issues hindering the further developments of studied materials are surveyed along with possible strategies to overcome them, which also provides an outlook on the future research in this field.

         <title>Tough&#8208;Hydrogel Reinforced Low&#8208;Tortuosity Conductive Networks for Stretchable and High&#8208;Performance Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultratough hydrogel reinforcement coating enables a tough and stretchable isotopically low tortuous conductive network. The micro&#8208;open&#8208;porous material demonstrates simultaneously high mechanical robustness, high capacitance, energy and power density when applied as capacitive electrodes. The presented strategy promotes the development of stretchable energy storage devices and opens up new possibilities for the application of tough hydrogels.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state supercapacitors are seeing emerging applications in flexible and stretchable electronics. Supercapacitors with high capacitance, high power density, simple form factor, and good mechanical robustness are highly desired, which demands electrode materials with high surface area, high mass loading, good conductivity, larger thickness, low tortuosity, and high toughness. However, it has been challenging to simultaneously realize them in a single material. By compositing a superficial layer of tough hydrogel on conductive and low tortuous foams, a thick capacitor electrode with large capacitance (5.25 F cm&#8208;2), high power density (41.28&#160;mW cm&#8208;2), and good mechanical robustness (&#949;&#160;= 140%, &#915;&#160;= 1000 J m&#8208;2) is achieved. The tough hydrogel serves as both a load&#8208;bearing layer to maintain structural integrity during deformation and a permeable binder to allow interaction between the conductive electrode and electrolyte. It is shown that the tough hydrogel reinforcement is beneficial for both electrical and mechanical stability. With a simple design and facile fabrication, this strategy is generalizable for various conductive materials.

         <title>Co3Se4 Quantum Dots as an Ultrastable Host Material for Potassium&#8208;Ion Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co3Se4 quantum dots encapsulated by N&#8208;doped carbon (CSC) are reported as an anode material for potassium&#8208;ion batteries, in which a morphology change process occurs. The unique core&#8211;shell&#8208;like structure anode demonstrates greatly enhanced electrochemical performance, especially long&#8208;term cyclic performance at various current densities. Density functional theory calculations, in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, and ex situ transmission electron microscopy further reveal the working mechanism of CSC anode during potassiation/depotassiation.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) are receiving increased attention due to their cost&#8208;effective and similar energy&#8208;storage mechanism to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the lack of appropriate electrode materials is still hampered for their development, which is mainly caused by the large size of the potassium ions (1.38&#160;&#197;) including low structural stability and poor electrochemical redox reaction kinetics. Herein, Co3Se4 quantum dots (QD) encapsulated by N&#8208;doped carbon (CSC) are reported as an anode material for KIBs, in which a morphology change process occurs. Benefiting from the unique uniform nanostructure reducing the ion&#8208;diffusion length, the improved electronic conductivity, and the enhanced protective effect of N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) alleviating volume fluctuation, the CSC demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance. The core&#8211;shell&#8208;like CSC composite demonstrates remarkable discharge capacity (410&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 after 550 cycles, 360&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 after 3200 cycles) and excellent cyclic performance over 10&#160;000&#160;cycles at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Density functional theory calculations show a larger reaction energy of Co3Se4 QD than bulk Co3Se4, a lower barrier of K atom migration in Co3Se4 QD than bulk Co3Se4, and also favor the intercalation reaction rather than replacement reaction. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex situ transmission electron microscopy are further used to evaluate potassiation/depotassiation phenomena.

         <title>An Efficient Narrowband Near&#8208;Infrared at 1040&#160;nm Organic Photodetector Realized by Intermolecular Charge Transfer Mediated Coupling Based on a Squaraine Dye</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Narrowband near&#8208;infrared organic photodiodes are reported based on a dipolar squaraine dye. J&#8208;type coupling in the solid state allows SQ&#8208;H thin films to combine favorable NIR absorption at 1040&#160;nm and charge carrier mobility. The bulk&#8208;heterojunction with PC61BM yields an organic photodiode with external quantum efficiency of 12.3% at 1050&#160;nm with a full&#8208;width half&#8208;maximum of 85&#160;nm under short&#8208;circuit condition.








Abstract
A highly sensitive short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR, &#955;&#160;&gt; 1000 nm) organic photodiode (OPD) is described based on a well&#8208;organized nanocrystalline bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) active layer composed of a dicyanovinyl&#8208;functionalized squaraine dye (SQ&#8208;H) donor material in combination with PC61BM. Through thermal annealing, dipolar SQ&#8208;H chromophores self&#8208;assemble in a nanoscale structure with intermolecular charge transfer mediated coupling, resulting in a redshifted and narrow absorption band at 1040 nm as well as enhanced charge carrier mobility. The optimized OPD exhibits an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 12.3% and a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of only 85 nm (815 cm&#8722;1) at 1050 nm under 0 V, which is the first efficient SWIR OPD based on J&#8208;type aggregates. Photoplethysmography application for heart&#8208;rate monitoring is successfully demonstrated on flexible substrates without applying reverse bias, indicating the potential of OPDs based on short&#8208;range coupled dye aggregates for low&#8208;power operating wearable applications.

         <title>Uniform Magnesium Electrodeposition via Synergistic Coupling of Current Homogenization, Geometric Confinement, and Chemisorption Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a synergistic coupling of homogenizing current distribution, geometric confinement, and chemisorptive interaction, a 3D vertically aligned nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber array structure on carbon cloth can regulate the uniform Mg electrodeposition and realize a reversible magnesium&#8208;metal anode with high areal capacity, much better kinetics, and improved cycle life.








Abstract
Unevenly distributed magnesium (Mg) electrodeposits have emerged as a major obstacle for Mg&#8208;metal batteries. A comprehensive design matrix is reported for 3D magnesiophilic hosts, which regulate the uniform Mg electrodeposition through a synergistic coupling of homogenizing current distribution, geometric confinement, and chemisorptive interaction. Vertically aligned nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber arrays on carbon cloth (denoted as &#8220;VNCA@C&#8221;) are developed as a proof of concept. The evenly arranged short nanoarray architecture helps to homogenize the surface current density and the microchannels built in this 3D host allow the preferential nucleation of Mg due to their geometrical confinement effect. Besides, the nitrogen&#8208;/oxygen&#8208;doped carbon species exhibit strong chemisorptive interaction toward Mg atoms, providing preferential nucleation sites as demonstrated by first&#8208;principle calculation results. Electrochemical analysis reveals a peculiar yet highly reversible microchannel&#8208;filling growth&#160;behavior of Mg metals, which empowers the delicately designed VNCA@C host with the ability to deliver a reduced nucleation overpotential of 429&#160;mV at 10.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and an elongated Mg plating/stripping cycle life (110 cycles) under high current density of 10.0 mA cm&#8722;2. The proposed design matrix can be extended to other metal anodes (such as lithium and zinc) for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Formulation of a Composite Nasal Spray Enabling Enhanced Surface Coverage and Prophylaxis of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There&#160;is a high risk of transmission of airborne pathogens through the nasal epithelium. This study reports a novel nasal spray, which is designed to maximize surface coverage and prevent infection through physical entrapment and inhibition of infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2).








Abstract
Airborne pathogens pose high risks in terms of both contraction and transmission within the respiratory pathways, particularly the nasal region. However, there is little in the way of adequate intervention that can protect an individual or prevent further spread. This study reports on a nasal formulation with the capacity to combat such challenges, focusing on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2). Formulation of a polysaccharide&#8208;based spray, known for its mucoadhesive properties, is undertaken and it is characterized for its mechanical, spray distribution, and antiviral properties. The ability to engineer key mechanical characteristics such as dynamic yield stresses and high coverage is shown, through systematic understanding of the composite mixture containing both gellan and &#955;&#8208;carrageenan. Furthermore, the spray systems demonstrate highly potent capacities to prevent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection in Vero cells, resulting in complete inhibition when either treating, the cells, or the virus, prior to challenging for infection. From this data, a mechanism for both prophylaxis and prevention is proposed; where entrapment within a polymeric coating sterically blocks virus uptake into the cells, inactivating the virus, and allowing clearance within the viscous medium. As such, a fully preventative spray is formulated, targeted at protecting the lining of the upper respiratory pathways against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>HCl&#8208;Based Hydrothermal Etching Strategy toward Fluoride&#8208;Free MXenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of etching various MAX materials in HCl solution influenced by temperature and pressure is simulated. Fluoride&#8208;free Mo2CTx MXenes are obtained with high quality and efficiency via a controllable HCl&#8208;hydrothermal etching method. Mo2CTx exhibits an excellent rate performance in supercapacitors owing to the unique surface terminations that significantly change the energy&#8208;storage mechanism compared with F&#8208;terminated MXenes.








Abstract
Due to their ultrathin layered structure and rich elemental variety, MXenes are emerging as a promising electrode candidate in energy generation and storage. MXenes are generally synthesized via hazardous fluoride&#8208;containing reagents from robust MAX materials, unfortunately resulting in plenty of inert fluoride functional groups on the surface that noticeably decline their performance. Density functional theory calculations are used to show the etching feasibility of hydrochloric acid (HCl) on various MAX phases. Based on this theoretical guidance, fluoride&#8208;free Mo2C MXenes with high efficiency about 98% are experimentally demonstrated. The Mo2C electrodes produced by this process exhibit high electrochemical performance in supercapacitors and sodium&#8208;ion batteries owing to the chosen surface functional groups created via the HCl etch process. This strategy enables the development of fluoride&#8208;free MXenes and opens a new window to explore their potential in energy&#8208;storage applications.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processable Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets with Variable Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct, scalable, and surfactant&#8208;free synthesis of metal&#8211;organic framework suspensions encompassing exceptionally large NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets with variable functionalities and excellent solution processability is presented. Relevant monoliths, aero&#8208; and xerogels, and large&#8208;area textured films with a great homogeneity, controllable thickness, and appreciable mechanical properties can be facilely fabricated. The sensors coated with NUS&#8208;8 possessing variable functionalities exhibit distinguishable sensing behaviors toward acetone.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) intrinsically lack fluidity and thus solution processability. Direct synthesis of MOFs exhibiting solution processability like polymers remains challenging but highly sought&#8208;after for multitudinous applications. Herein, a one&#8208;pot, surfactant&#8208;free, and scalable synthesis of highly stable MOF suspensions composed of exceptionally large (average area &gt;&#160;15&#160;000 &#181;m2) NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets with variable functionalities and excellent solution processability is presented. This is achieved by adding capping molecules during the synthesis, and by judicious controls of precursor concentration and MOF nanosheet&#8211;solvent interactions. The resulting 2D NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets with variable functionalities exhibit excellent solution processability. As such, relevant monoliths, aero&#8208; and xerogels, and large&#8208;area textured films with a great homogeneity, controllable thickness, and appreciable mechanical properties can be facilely fabricated. Additionally, from both the molecular&#8208; and chip&#8208;level it is demonstrated that capacitive sensors integrated with NUS&#8208;8 films functionalized with different terminal groups exhibit distinguishable sensing behaviors toward acetone due to their disparate host&#8211;guest interactions. It is envisioned that this simple approach will greatly facilitate the integration of MOFs in miniaturized electronic devices and benefit their mass production.

         <title>Double&#8208;Gate MoS2 Field&#8208;Effect Transistors with Full&#8208;Range Tunable Threshold Voltage for Multifunctional Logic Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;gate MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistor is designed for potential applications in multifunctional reconfigurable logic circuits. Featuring the feasible tuning of threshold voltage and optimizing of subthreshold swing of the transistors, the system can both function well as full logic swing binary logic with high noise margin and be dynamically reconfigured between binary and ternary logic.








Abstract
Multifunctional reconfigurable devices, with higher information capacity, smaller size, and more functions, are urgently needed and draw most attention in frontiers in information technology. 2D semiconductors, ascribing to ultrathin body and easy electrostatic control, show great potential in developing reconfigurable functional units. This work proposes a novel double&#8208;gate field&#8208;effect transistor architecture with equal top and bottom gate (TG and BG) and realizes flexible optimization of the subthreshold swing (SS) and threshold voltage (VTH). While the TG and BG are used simultaneously, as a single gate to drive the transistor, ultralow average SS value of 65.5 mV dec&#8722;1 can be obtained in a large current range over 104, enabling the application in high gain inverter. While one gate is used to initialize the channel doping, full logic swing inverter circuit with high noise margin (over 90%) is demonstrated. Such device prototype is further extended for designing reconfigurable logic applications and can be dynamically switched and well maintained between binary and ternary logics. This study provides important concept and device prototype for future multifunctional logic applications.

         <title>40.1% Record Low&#8208;Light Solar&#8208;Cell Efficiency by Holistic Trap&#8208;Passivation using Micrometer&#8208;Thick Perovskite Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The involvement of guanidinium in perovskite bulk film and CH3O&#8208;PEABr passivation on the perovskite surface synergistically suppresses the trap states. The charge carrier lifetimes of perovskite films increase by tenfold and fivefold to 981 ns and 8.02 &#181;s at the crystal surface and in its bulk, respectively. The decreased nonradiative recombination loss translates to a record efficiency of 40.1%.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells exhibit not only high efficiency under full AM1.5 sunlight, but also have great potential for applications in low&#8208;light environments, such as indoors, cloudy conditions, early morning, late evening, etc. Unfortunately, their performance still suffers from severe trap&#8208;induced nonradiative recombination, particularly under low&#8208;light conditions. Here, a holistic passivation strategy is developed to reduce traps both on the surface and in the bulk of micrometer&#8208;thick perovskite film, leading to a record efficiency of 40.1% under 301.6 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 warm light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) light for low&#8208;light solar&#8208;cell applications. The involvement of guanidinium into the perovskite bulk film and 2&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)ethylamine hydrobromide (CH3O&#8208;PEABr) passivation on the perovskite surface synergistically suppresses the trap states. The charge carrier lifetimes of the perovskite film increase by tenfold and fivefold to 981&#160;ns and 8.02 &#181;s at the crystal surface and in its bulk, respectively. The decreased nonradiative recombination loss translates to a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.00&#160;V, a high short&#8208;circuit current (Jsc) of 152.10 &#181;A cm&#8722;2, and a fill factor (FF) of 79.52%. Note that this performance also stands as the highest among all photovoltaics measured under indoor light illumination. This work of trap passivation for micrometer&#8208;thick perovskite film paves a way for high&#8208;performance, self&#8208;powered IoT devices.

         <title>Innervated, Self&#8208;Sensing Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuators with Closed Loop Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;sensing, innervated liquid crystal elastomers in both fiber and square spiral motifs (shown) are produced by core&#8211;shell 3D printing. Printed core&#8211;shell filaments consist of a liquid metal core surrounded by a liquid crystal elastomer shell. When Joule heated above their nematic&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic transition temperature, these self&#8208;sensing architectures exhibit actuation and large work output, which can be regulated via closed loop control.







&#8203;

Abstract
The programmable assembly of innervated LCE actuators (iLCEs) with prescribed contractile actuation, self&#8208;sensing, and closed loop control via core&#8211;shell 3D printing is reported. This extrusion&#8208;based direct ink writing method enables coaxial filamentary features composed of pure LM core surrounded by an LCE shell, whose director is aligned along the print path. Specifically, the thermal response of the iLCE fiber&#8208;type actuators is programmed, measured, and modeled during Joule heating, including quantifying the concomitant changes in fiber length and resistance that arise during simultaneous heating and self&#8208;sensing. Due to their reversible, high&#8208;energy actuation and their resistive feedback, it is also demonstrated that iLCEs can be regulated with closed loop control even when perturbed with large bias loads. Finally, iLCE architectures capable of programmed, self&#8208;sensing 3D shape change with closed loop control are fabricated.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis and Integration of&#160;Highly Conductive PdTe2&#160;with Low&#8208;Dimensional Semiconductors for p&#8208;Type Transistors with Low Contact Barriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The patterned synthesis of high&#8208;quality 2D PdTe2 is demonstrated. The as&#8208;grown PdTe2 exhibits high electrical and thermal conductivities, showing the potential as an ideal contact material in nanoelectronics. Based on the nondestructive synthesis of PdTe2 patterns directly on various low&#8208;dimensional semiconductors, high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) with reduced contact barriers are chemically constructed.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional semiconductors provide promising ultrathin channels for constructing more&#8208;than&#8208;Moore devices. However, the prominent contact barriers at the semiconductor&#8211;metal electrodes interfaces greatly limit the performance of the obtained devices. Here, a chemical approach is developed for the construction of p&#8208;type field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) with low contact barriers by achieving the simultaneous synthesis and integration of 2D PdTe2 with various low&#8208;dimensional semiconductors. The 2D PdTe2 synthesized through a quasi&#8208;liquid process exhibits high electrical conductivity (&#8776;4.3 &#215; 106 S m&#8722;1) and thermal conductivity (&#8776;130 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), superior to other transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and even higher than some metals. In addition, PdTe2 electrodes with desired geometry can be synthesized directly on 2D MoTe2 and other semiconductors to form high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type FETs without any further treatment. The chemically derived atomically ordered PdTe2&#8211;MoTe2 interface results in significantly reduced contact barrier (65 vs 240 meV) and thus increases the performance of the obtained devices. This work demonstrates the great potential of 2D PdTe2 as contact materials and also opens up a new avenue for the future device fabrication through the chemical construction and integration of 2D components.

         <title>Electric&#8208;Field Control of Propagating Spin Waves by Ferroelectric Domain&#8208;Wall Motion in a Multiferroic Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electric&#8208;field control of propagating spin waves in a Fe/BaTiO3 multiferroic heterostructure is demonstrated experimentally. The underlying mechanism involves the concurrent motion of strain&#8208;coupled ferroelectric domain walls and magnetic anisotropy boundaries and allows reversible tuning of the spin&#8208;wave amplitude and phase. The results provide a new route toward energy&#8208;efficient reconfigurable magnonics.








Abstract
Magnetoelectric coupling in multiferroic heterostructures offers a promising platform for electric&#8208;field control of magnonic devices based on low&#8208;power spin&#8208;wave transport. Here, electric&#8208;field manipulation of the amplitude and phase of propagating spin waves in a ferromagnetic Fe film on top of a ferroelectric BaTiO3 substrate is demonstrated experimentally. Electric&#8208;field effects in this composite material system are mediated by strain coupling between alternating ferroelectric stripe domains with in&#8208;plane and perpendicular polarization and fully correlated magnetic anisotropy domains with differing spin&#8208;wave transport properties. The propagation of spin waves across the strain&#8208;induced magnetic anisotropy domains of the Fe film is directly imaged and it is shown how reversible electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven motion of ferroelectric domain walls and pinned anisotropy boundaries turns the spin&#8208;wave signal on and off. Furthermore, linear electric&#8208;field tuning of the spin&#8208;wave phase by altering the width of strain&#8208;coupled stripe domains is demonstrated. The results provide a new route toward energy&#8208;efficient reconfigurable&#160;magnonics.

         <title>Bubble Forming Films for Spatial Selective Cell Killing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymeric films embedding iron oxide nanoparticles as photosensitizers are designed. Irradiation of the films with pulsed&#8208;laser light generates water vapor bubbles at their surface. Cells located close to the films can be killed due to mechanical forces which arise when the bubbles collapse. Local irradiation of bubble&#8208;films allows for spatial selective single cell killing at the surface of the eye.








Abstract
Photodynamic and photothermal cell killing at the surface of tissues finds applications in medicine. However, a lack of control over heat dissipation following a treatment with light might damage surrounding tissues. A new strategy to kill cells at the surface of tissues is reported. Polymeric films are designed in which iron oxide nanoparticles are embedded as photosensitizers. Irradiation of the films with pulsed laser light generates water vapor bubbles at the surface of the films. It is found that &#8220;bubble&#8208;films&#8221; can kill cells in close proximity to the films due to mechanical forces which arise when the bubbles collapse. Local irradiation of bubble&#8208;films allows for spatial selective single cell killing. As nanosurgery becomes attractive in ophthalmology to remove superficial tumors, bubble&#8208;films are applied on the cornea and found that irradiation of the bubble&#8208;films allows spatial and selective killing of corneal cells. As i) the photosensitizer is embedded in the films, which reduces its uptake by cells and spreading into tissues and ii) the bubble&#8208;films can be removed from the tissue after laser treatment, while iii) a low laser fluence is sufficient to generate vapor bubbles, it is foreseen that bubble&#8208;films might become promising for safe resection of superficial tumors.

         <title>Emerging Materials and Technologies with Applications in Flexible Neural Implants: A Comprehensive Review of Current Issues with Neural Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible implants have attracted increasing interest mainly to overcome the mechanical mismatch between rigid materials and soft neural tissues, enabling precise measurements of neural signals from conformal contact. The current issues of flexible neural implants are summarized by presenting material candidates and designs to address challenges. Furthermore, the latest investigations associated with each issue are also introduced.








Abstract
Neuroscience is an essential field of investigation that reveals the identity of human beings, with a comprehensive understanding of advanced mental activities, through the study of neurobiological structures and functions. Fully understanding the neurotransmission system that allows for connectivity among neuronal circuits has paved the way for the development of treatments for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and depression. The field of flexible implants has attracted increasing interest mainly to overcome the mechanical mismatch between rigid electrode materials and soft neural tissues, enabling precise measurements of neural signals from conformal contact. Here, the current issues of flexible neural implants (chronic device failure, non&#8208;bioresorbable electronics, low&#8208;density electrode arrays, among others are summarized) by presenting material candidates and designs to address each challenge. Furthermore, the latest investigations associated with the aforementioned issues are also introduced, including suggestions for ideal neural implants. In terms of the future direction of these advances, designing flexible devices would provide new opportunities for the study of brain&#8211;machine interfaces or brain&#8211;computer interfaces as part of locomotion through brain signals, and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

         <dc:description>
Photothermal conjugated polymer films are reviewed along with their emerging applications from the perspective of their working principles.

Abstract
With the growth of photoenergy harvesting and thermal engineering, photothermal materials (PTMs) have attracted substantial interest due to their unique functions such as localized heat generation, spatiotemporal thermal controllability, invisibility, and light harvesting capabilities. In particular, &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic PTMs show advantages over inorganic or metallic PTMs in thin film applications due to their large light absorptivity, ease of synthesis and tunability of molecular structures for realizing high NIR absorption, flexibility, and solution processability. This review is intended to provide an overview of organic PTMs, including both molecular and polymeric PTMs. A description of the photothermal (PT) effect and conversion efficiency (&#951;PT) for organic films is provided. After that, the chemical structure and optical properties of organic PTMs are discussed. Finally, emerging applications of organic PT films from the perspective of spatiotemporal thermal engineering principles are illustrated.

         <title>Harnessing Innate Immunity Using Biomaterials for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomaterial&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy has recently drawn significant attention due to the enhanced therapeutic efficacy without adverse effects. A comprehensive overview of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biomaterials reinforcing innate immunity in diverse manners is provided. The future perspective of harnessing biomaterials for enhanced cancer immunotherapy is also discussed.








Abstract
The discovery of immune checkpoint blockade has revolutionized the field of immuno&#8208;oncology and established the foundation for developing various new therapies that can surpass conventional cancer treatments. Most recent immunotherapeutic strategies have focused on adaptive immune responses by targeting T cell&#8208;activating pathways, genetic engineering of T cells with chimeric antigen receptors, or bispecific antibodies. Despite the unprecedented clinical success, these T cell&#8208;based treatments have only benefited a small proportion of patients. Thus, the need for the next generation of cancer immunotherapy is driven by identifying novel therapeutic molecules or new immunoengineered cells. To maximize the therapeutic potency via innate immunogenicity, the convergence of innate immunity&#8208;based therapy and biomaterials is required to yield an efficient index in clinical trials. This review highlights how biomaterials can efficiently reprogram and recruit innate immune cells in tumors and ultimately initiate activation of T cell immunity against advanced cancers. Moreover, the design and specific biomaterials that improve innate immune cells&#8217; targeting ability to selectively activate immunogenicity with minimal adverse effects are discussed.

&lt;p&gt;The discovery of immune checkpoint blockade has revolutionized the field of immuno-oncology and established the foundation for developing various new therapies that can surpass conventional cancer treatments. Most recent immunotherapeutic strategies have focused on adaptive immune responses by targeting T cell-activating pathways, genetic engineering of T cells with chimeric antigen receptors, or bispecific antibodies. Despite the unprecedented clinical success, these T cell-based treatments have only benefited a small proportion of patients. Thus, the need for the next generation of cancer immunotherapy is driven by identifying novel therapeutic molecules or new immunoengineered cells. To maximize the therapeutic potency via innate immunogenicity, the convergence of innate immunity-based therapy and biomaterials is required to yield an efficient index in clinical trials. This review highlights how biomaterials can efficiently reprogram and recruit innate immune cells in tumors and ultimately initiate activation of T cell immunity against advanced cancers. Moreover, the design and specific biomaterials that improve innate immune cells&#8217; targeting ability to selectively activate immunogenicity with minimal adverse effects are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Comprehensive Understandings into Complete Reconstruction of Precatalysts: Synthesis, Applications, and Characterizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comprehensive understandings into complete reconstruction of precatalysts are summarized, mainly including its fundamental understandings, advantages, and features of completely reconstructed catalysts, design principles/strategies, extensive electrocatalysis applications, and advanced characterizations. This review is expected to arouse attention on the complete reconstruction materials for multifunctional applications in energy storage and conversion.








Abstract
Reconstruction induced by external environment (such as applied voltage bias and test electrolytes) changes catalyst component and catalytic behaviors. Investigations of complete reconstruction in energy conversion recently receive intensive attention, which promote the targeted design of top&#8208;performance materials with maximum component utilization and good stability. However, the advantages of complete reconstruction, its design strategies, and extensive applications have not achieved the profound understandings and summaries it deserves. Here, this review systematically summarizes several important advances in complete reconstruction for the first time, which includes 1) fundamental understandings of complete reconstruction, the characteristics and advantages of completely reconstructed catalysts, and their design principles, 2) types of reconstruction&#8208;involved precatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction catalysis in wide pH solution, and origins of limited reconstruction degree as well as design strategies/principles toward complete reconstruction, 3) complete reconstruction for novel material synthesis and other electrocatalysis fields, and 4) advanced in situ/operando or multiangle/level characterization techniques to capture the dynamic reconstruction processes and real catalytic contributors. Finally, the existing major challenges and unexplored/unsolved issues on studying the reconstruction chemistry are summarized, and an outlook for the further development of complete reconstruction is briefly proposed. This review will arouse the attention on complete reconstruction materials and their applications in diverse fields.
