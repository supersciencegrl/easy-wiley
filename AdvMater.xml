         <title>Non&#8208;Invasive Photodelamination of van der Waals Semiconductors for High&#8208;Performance Electronics</title>

Abstract
Atomically thin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) van der Waals semiconductors are promising candidate materials for post&#8208;silicon electronics. However, it remains challenging to attain completely uniform monolayer semiconductor wafers free of over&#8208;grown islands. Here, we report the observation of the energy funneling effect and ambient photodelamination phenomenon in inhomogeneous few&#8208;layer WS2 flakes under low illumination fluencies down to several nW/&#956;m2 and its potential as a non&#8208;invasive post&#8208;etching strategy for selectively stripping the local excessive overlying islands. Photoluminescent tracking on the photoetching traces reveals relatively fast etching rates around 0.3&#8722;0.8&#160;&#956;m/min at varied temperatures and an activation energy of 1.7&#160;eV. By using crystallographic and electronic characterization, we also confirm the non&#8208;invasive nature of the low&#8208;power photodelamination and the highly preserved lattice quality in the as&#8208;etched monolayer products, featuring a comparable average density of atomic defects (&#8764;4.2&#215;1013 cm&#8722;2) to pristine flakes and a high electron mobility up to 80 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at room temperature. This approach opens a non&#8208;invasive photoetching route for thickness uniformity management in 2D van der Waals semiconductor wafers for electronic applications.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Light Accelerated Prodrug Reduction of Pt(IV)&#8208;Incorporating Pseudo&#8208;Semiconducting Polymers for Robust Degradation and Maximized Photothermal/Chemo&#8208;immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Selective activation of Pt(IV) prodrugs within tumors is particularly attractive because of their low damage to normal tissues. However, current common activation via chemical/photo&#8208;reduction of Pt(IV) prodrugs into Pt(II) counterparts is limited by undesirable spatial&#8208;temporal control over this reduction process and the ineffective tissue penetration depth of undesirable light. Here, a pseudo&#8208;conjugated polymer was designed via Stille polymerization, resulting in PSP&#8208;Pt with a Pt(IV) prodrug of oxaliplatin (Oxa(IV)) in the polymer main chain that can be activated by NIR&#8208;II light. PSP&#8208;Pt can co&#8208;assemble with a commercially available lipid polymer, namely mPEG2k&#8208;DSPE, into NPPSP&#8208;Pt. Under 1064&#160;nm light irradiation, NPPSP&#8208;Pt can be photo&#8208;activated to accelerate the Pt(IV) reduction to release oxaliplatin, thereby killing the cancer cells by photothermal effect and chemo&#8208;immunotherapy inside a mouse model with CT26 colon cancer. This work reports the application of NIR&#8208;II light for the first time for accelerating Pt(IV) reduction for cancer tumor therapy.

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Driven Coordination Fields Altering Single Cerium Atom Sites for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
For current single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), modulating the coordination environments of rare earth (RE) single atoms with complex electronic orbital and flexible chemical states is still limited. Herein, we report cerium (Ce) SAs supported on the P, S, and N co&#8208;doped hollow carbon substrate (Ce SAs/PSNC) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The as&#8208;prepared Ce SAs/PSNC possessed a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.90&#160;V, a turnover frequency value of 52.2 s&#8722;1 at 0.85&#160;V, and excellent stability for ORR, which far exceeds the commercial Pt/C and most recent SACs. The Ce SAs/PSNC&#8208;based liquid zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) exhibited a high and stable open circuit voltage of 1.49&#160;V and a maximum power density of 212&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. As the catalyst of air cathode, it also displayed remarkable performances in flexible electronic devices. Theoretical calculations have revealed that the introduction of S and P sites has induced significant electronic modulations to the Ce SA active sites. The P and S dopings promote the electroactivity of Ce SAs and improve the overall site&#8208;to&#8208;site electron transfer within the Ce SAs/PSNC. This work can offer a unique perspective for modulating RE&#8208;based SACs in a complex coordination environment towards superior electrocatalysis and broad applications in energy conversion and storage devices.

         <title>Sodium&#8208;based Concave Metasurfaces for High Performing Plasmonic Optical Filters by Templated Spin&#8208;on&#8208;sodiophobic&#8208;glass</title>

Abstract
Optical filters have aroused tremendous excitement in advanced photonic instruments and modern digital displays due to their flexible capability of spectrum manipulation. Plasmonic metasurfaces of narrow bandwidth, high spectral contrast and robust structure tolerance are highly desired for optical filtration (especially in the visible regime) but rather challenging as large spectral broadening from intrinsic ohmic loss and design/fabrication deviations. Here we demonstrate the high&#8208;performing sodium&#8208;based metasurfaces for optical filtration across 450 to 750&#160;nm by unique structure design of spatially decoupled concave surfaces and precise fabrication through templated solidification of liquid metals. Thanks to the distinct suppression of metallic loss as well as fabrication tolerance of interfacial structures, the as&#8208;prepared concave metasurfaces enable a minimum linewidth of &#8764; 15&#160;nm, a maximal optical contrast of &#8764; 93% and a high measure&#8208;to&#8208;design spectral match ratio &#8764; 1500. These results have for the first time pushed the operation wavelengths of sodium&#8208;based plasmonic devices from infrared to visible which in turn demonstrates the capability of filling the blank of commercial dielectric optical filters thus far.

         <title>Solvation Structure Modulation Of High&#8208;Voltage Electrolyte For High&#8208;Performance K&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Graphite Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Due to the advantages of dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) and abundant resources, potassium&#8208;based dual&#8208;carbon batteries (K&#8208;DCBs) have wide application prospects. However, conventional carbonate ester&#8208;based electrolyte systems have obvious drawbacks such as poor oxidation resistance and difficulty in sustaining the anion intercalation process at high voltages, which seriously affect the capacity and cycle performance of K&#8208;DCBs. Therefore, a rational design of more efficient novel electrolyte systems is urgently required to realize high&#8208;performance K&#8208;DCBs. Herein, we report a solvation structure modulation strategy for the K&#8208;DCB electrolyte systems. Consequently, substantial K+ ion storage improvement at the graphite anode and enhanced FSI&#8722; intercalation capacity at the graphite cathode are successfully realized simultaneously. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the assembled K&#8208;DCB exhibited a discharge capacity of 103.4 mAh g&#8722;1, and after 400 cycles, approximately 90% capacity retention was observed. Moreover, the energy density of the K&#8208;DCB full cell reached 157.6&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, which is the best performance in reported K&#8208;DCBs till date. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of solvation modulation in improving the performance of K&#8208;DCBs.

However, conventional carbonate ester-based electrolyte systems have obvious drawbacks such as poor oxidation resistance and difficulty in sustaining the anion intercalation process at high voltages, which seriously affect the capacity and cycle performance of K-DCBs. Therefore, a rational design of more efficient novel electrolyte systems is urgently required to realize high-performance K-DCBs. Herein, we report a solvation structure modulation strategy for the K-DCB electrolyte systems. Consequently, substantial K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion storage improvement at the graphite anode and enhanced FSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation capacity at the graphite cathode are successfully realized simultaneously. As a proof-of-concept, the assembled K-DCB exhibited a discharge capacity of 103.4 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and after 400 cycles, approximately 90% capacity retention was observed. Moreover, the energy density of the K-DCB full cell reached 157.6&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the best performance in reported K-DCBs till date. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of solvation modulation in improving the performance of K-DCBs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>High&#8208;Contrast Bidirectional Optoelectronic Synapses based on 2D Molecular Crystal Heterojunctions for Motion Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Light&#8208;stimulated optoelectronic synaptic devices are fundamental compositions of the neuromorphic vision system. However, there are still huge challenges to achieving both bidirectional synaptic behaviors under light stimuli and high performance. Herein, a bilayer 2D molecular crystal (2DMC) p&#8208;n heterojunction is developed to achieve high&#8208;performance bidirectional synaptic behaviors. The 2DMC heterojunction&#8208;based field effect transistor (FET) devices exhibit typical ambipolar properties and remarkable responsivity (R) of 3.58&#215;104 A W&#8722;1 under weak light as low as 0.008&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic behaviors are successfully realized by the same light stimuli under different gate voltages. Moreover, a superior contrast ratio (CR) of 1.53&#215;103 is demonstrated by the ultrathin and high&#8208;quality 2DMC heterojunction, which transcends previous optoelectronic synapses and enables application for the motion detection of the pendulum. Furthermore, a motion detection network based on the device is developed to detect and recognize classic motion vehicles in road traffic with an accuracy exceeding 90%. This work provides an effective strategy for developing high&#8208;contrast bidirectional optoelectronic synapses and shows great potential in the intelligent bionic device and future artificial vision.

         <title>Atomic Insights into the Cu Species Supported on Zeolite for Direct Oxidation of Methane to Methanol via Low&#8208;Damage HAADF&#8208;STEM</title>

Abstract
Precise determination of the structure&#8208;property relationship of zeolite&#8208;based metal catalysts is critical for the development toward practical applications. However, the scarcity of real&#8208;space imaging of zeolite&#8208;based low&#8208;atomic&#8208;number (LAN) metal materials due to the electron&#8208;beam sensitivity of zeolites has led to continuous debates regarding the exact LAN metal configurations. Here, a low&#8208;damage high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM) imaging technique is employed for direct visualization and determination of LAN metal (Cu) species in ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite frameworks. The structures of the Cu species are revealed based on the microscopy evidence and also proved by the complementary spectroscopy results. The correlation between the characteristic Cu size in Cu/ZSM&#8208;5 catalysts and their direct oxidation of methane to methanol reaction properties is unveiled. As a result, the mono&#8208;Cu species stably anchored by Al pairs inside the zeolite channels are identified as the key structure for higher C1 oxygenates yield and methanol selectivity for direct oxidation of methane. Meanwhile, the local topological flexibility of the rigid zeolite frameworks induced by the Cu agglomeration in the channels is also revealed. This work exemplifies the combination of microscopy imaging and spectroscopy characterization serves as a complete arsenal for revealing structure&#8208;property relationships of the supported metal&#8208;zeolite catalysts.

         <title>Graphene Spin Valves&#160;for Spin Logic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of spin logic devices and spin&#8208;FETs in graphene marks an important step for the future development of spin&#8208;based computing technology. Their low on/off switching energy, low Joule heating losses, and scalability are attractive features from a device perspective. The non&#8208;volatile nature of graphene spin logic devices can be exploited for logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory applications for neuromorphic computing architectures.








Abstract
An alternative to charge&#8208;based electronics identifies the spin degree of freedom for information communication and processing. The long spin&#8208;diffusion length in graphene at room temperature demonstrates its ability for highly scalable spintronics. The development of the graphene spin valve (SV) has inspired spin devices in graphene including spin field&#8208;effect transistors and spin majority logic gates. A comprehensive picture of spin transport in graphene SVs is required for further development of spin logic. This review examines the advances in graphene SVs and their role in the development of spin logic devices. Different transport and scattering mechanisms in charge and spin are discussed. Furthermore, the on/off switching energy between graphene SVs and charge&#8208;based FETs is compared to highlight their prospects for low&#8208;power devices. The challenges and perspectives that need to be addressed for the future development of spin logic devices are then outlined.

         <title>Biosystem&#8208;Inspired Engineering of Nanozymes for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent advances in the engineering of biosystem&#8208;inspired nanozymes, by leveraging the refined catalytic structure of natural enzymes, simulating the behavior changes of natural enzymes in the catalytic process, mimicking the specific biological processes or living organisms, as well as their biomedical applications, are reviewed.








Abstract
Nanozymes with intrinsic enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities have shown great potential to become surrogates of natural enzymes in many fields by virtue of their advantages of high catalytic stability, ease of functionalization, and low cost. However, due to the lack of predictable descriptors, most of the nanozymes reported in the past have been obtained mainly through trial&#8208;and&#8208;error strategies, and the catalytic efficacy, substrate specificity, as well as practical application effect under physiological conditions, are far inferior to that of natural enzymes. To optimize the catalytic efficacies and functions of nanozymes in biomedical settings, recent studies have introduced biosystem&#8208;inspired strategies into nanozyme design. In this review, recent advances in the engineering of biosystem&#8208;inspired nanozymes by leveraging the refined catalytic structure of natural enzymes, simulating the behavior changes of natural enzymes in the catalytic process, and mimicking the specific biological processes or living organisms, are introduced. Furthermore, the currently involved biomedical applications of biosystem&#8208;inspired nanozymes are summarized. More importantly, the current opportunities and challenges of the design and application of biosystem&#8208;inspired nanozymes are discussed. It is hoped that the studies of nanozymes based on bioinspired strategies will be beneficial for constructing the new generation of nanozymes and broadening their biomedical applications.

         <title>Convective Thermal Metamaterials: Exploring High&#8208;Efficiency, Directional, and Wave&#8208;Like Heat Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Providing a new knob for controlling heat transfer, convective effects have gained significant interest in the design of thermal metamaterials. With the introduced efficient, directional, and wave&#8208;like heat transfer, many novel phenomena are observed in dissipative regime. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advancements in this emerging field are brought under the same umbrella, and a future perspective on promising directions is provided.








Abstract
Convective thermal metamaterials are artificial structures where convection dominates in the thermal process. Due to the field coupling between velocity and temperature, convection provides a new knob for controlling heat transfer beyond pure conduction, thus allowing active and robust thermal modulations. With the introduced convective effects, the original parabolic Fourier heat equation for pure conduction can be transformed to hyperbolic. Therefore, the hybrid diffusive system can be interpreted in a wave&#8208;like fashion, reviving many wave phenomena in dissipative diffusion. Here, recent advancements in convective thermal metamaterials are reviewed and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art discoveries are classified into the following four aspects, enhancing heat transfer, porous&#8208;media&#8208;based thermal effects, nonreciprocal heat transfer, and non&#8208;Hermitian phenomena. Finally, a prospect is cast on convective thermal metamaterials from two aspects. One is to utilize the convective parameter space to explore topological thermal effects. The other is to further broaden the convective parameter space with spatiotemporal modulation and multi&#8208;physical effects.

         <title>Intrinsic Optical Properties and Emerging Applications of Gold Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in nanoscience and technology have been promoted to reveal the physical origin of the intrinsic optical properties of gold nanostructures with consideration of size, shape, phase, composition, hybridization, assembly, and nanopatterning. The perspectives on the future developments, challenges, and opportunities of gold nanostructures are discussed to provide insights for improving their optical properties and performance in various applications.








Abstract
The collective oscillation of free electrons at the nanoscale surface of gold nanostructures is closely modulated by tuning the size, shape/morphology, phase, composition, hybridization, assembly, and nanopatterning, along with the surroundings of the plasmonic surface located at a dielectric interface with air, liquid, and solid. This review first introduces the physical origin of the intrinsic optical properties of gold nanostructures and further summarizes stimuli&#8208;responsive changes in optical properties, metal&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced optical signals, luminescence spectral shaping, chiroptical response, and photogenerated hot carriers. The current success in the landscape of nanoscience and nanotechnology mainly originates from the abundant optical properties of gold nanostructures in the thermodynamically stable face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phase. It has been further extended by crystal phase engineering to prepare thermodynamically unfavorable phases (e.g., kinetically stable) and heterophases to modulate their intriguing phase&#8208;dependent optical properties. A broad range of promising applications, including but not limited to full&#8208;color displays, solar energy harvesting, photochemical reactions, optical sensing, and microscopic/biomedical imaging, have fostered parallel research on the multitude of physical effects occurring in gold nanostructures.

         <title>Molecular Electronics: Creating and Bridging Molecular Junctions and Promoting Its Commercialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive investigation of nanogap electrode fabrication protocols according to new classification principles is provided. How to integrate molecules into nanogap electrodes to form molecular junctions and highlight recent efforts toward the commercialization of molecular circuits are summarized, eventually overcoming the Achilles&#8217; heel of molecular electronics as a whole.








Abstract
Molecular electronics is driven by the dream of expanding Moore's law to the molecular level for next&#8208;generation electronics through incorporating individual or ensemble molecules into electronic circuits. For nearly 50 years, numerous efforts have been made to explore the intrinsic properties of molecules and develop diverse fascinating molecular electronic devices with the desired functionalities. The flourishing of molecular electronics is inseparable from the development of various elegant methodologies for creating nanogap electrodes and bridging the nanogap with molecules. This review first focuses on the techniques for making lateral and vertical nanogap electrodes by breaking, narrowing, and fixed modes, and highlights their capabilities, applications, merits, and shortcomings. After summarizing the approaches of growing single molecules or molecular layers on the electrodes, the methods of constructing a complete molecular circuit are comprehensively grouped into three categories: 1) directly bridging one&#8208;molecule&#8211;electrode component with another electrode, 2) physically bridging two&#8208;molecule&#8211;electrode components, and 3) chemically bridging two&#8208;molecule&#8211;electrode components. Finally, the current state of molecular circuit integration and commercialization is discussed and perspectives are provided, hoping to encourage the community to accelerate the realization of fully scalable molecular electronics for a new era of integrated microsystems and applications.

         <title>Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficiency of proton exchange membrane based electrolyzers is highly dependent on the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode. The recent progress on the design of acidic OER electrocatalysts is reviewed, along with theoretical and experimental studies on the intrinsic mechanisms. Furthermore, some unresolved but urgent questions and the perspectives regarding future research for acidic OER electrocatalysts are provided.








Abstract
The well&#8208;established proton exchange membrane (PEM)&#8208;based water electrolysis, which operates under acidic conditions, possesses many advantages compared to alkaline water electrolysis, such as compact design, higher voltage efficiency, and higher gas purity. However, PEM&#8208;based water electrolysis is hampered by the low efficiency, instability, and high cost of anodic electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this review, the recently reported acidic OER electrocatalysts are comprehensively summarized, classified, and discussed. The related fundamental studies on OER mechanisms and the relationship between activity and stability are particularly highlighted in order to provide an atomistic&#8208;level understanding for OER catalysis. A stability test protocol is suggested to evaluate the intrinsic activity degradation. Some current challenges and unresolved questions, such as the usage of carbon&#8208;based materials and the differences between the electrocatalyst performances in acidic electrolytes and PEM&#8208;based electrolyzers are also discussed. Finally, suggestions for the most promising electrocatalysts and a perspective for future research are outlined. This review presents a fresh impetus and guideline to the rational design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance acidic OER electrocatalysts for PEM&#8208;based water electrolysis.

         <title>Molecular Complementarity of Proteomimetic Materials for Target&#8208;Specific Recognition and Recognition&#8208;Mediated Complex Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In nature, proteins perform various recognition&#8208;mediated molecular functions relying on the principle of molecular complementarity. This review introduces how diverse synthesizable and modifiable materials with elaborate structural and molecular designs can achieve the molecular complementarity in mediating complex protein&#8208;like functions, such as allosteric regulation, signal transduction, enzymatic reactions, and stimuli&#8208;responsive motions, expanding the landscape of their proteomimetic applications.








Abstract
As biomolecules essential for sustaining life, proteins are generated from long chains of 20 different &#945;&#8208;amino acids that are folded into unique 3D structures. In particular, many proteins have molecular recognition functions owing to their binding pockets, which have complementary shapes, charges, and polarities for specific targets, making these biopolymers unique and highly valuable for biomedical and biocatalytic applications. Based on the understanding of protein structures and microenvironments, molecular complementarity can be exhibited by synthesizable and modifiable materials. This has prompted researchers to explore the proteomimetic potentials of a diverse range of materials, including biologically available peptides and oligonucleotides, synthetic supramolecules, inorganic molecules, and related coordination networks. To fully resemble a protein, proteomimetic materials perform the molecular recognition to mediate complex molecular functions, such as allosteric regulation, signal transduction, enzymatic reactions, and stimuli&#8208;responsive motions; this can also expand the landscape of their potential bio&#8208;applications. This review focuses on the recognitive aspects of proteomimetic designs derived for individual materials and their conformations. Recent progress provides insights to help guide the development of advanced protein mimicry with material heterogeneity, design modularity, and tailored functionality. The perspectives and challenges of current proteomimetic designs and tools are also discussed in relation to future applications.

         <title>Ferroelectric Transistors for Memory and Neuromorphic Device Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments in hafnia&#8208;based ferroelectric materials and their applications are comprehensively reviewed, with an in&#8208;depth analysis of ferroelectric transistors and their array structures. The relevant technological issues and their solutions are also discussed. This review provides a roadmap for the development of high&#8208;performance ferroelectric memory and neuromorphic devices based on ferroelectric transistors.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials have been intensively investigated for high&#8208;performance nonvolatile memory devices in the past decades, owing to their nonvolatile polarization characteristics. Ferroelectric memory devices are expected to exhibit lower power consumption and higher speed than conventional memory devices. However, non&#8208;complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility and degradation due to fatigue of traditional perovskite&#8208;based ferroelectric materials have hindered the development of high&#8208;density and high&#8208;performance ferroelectric memories in the past. The recently developed hafnia&#8208;based ferroelectric materials have attracted immense attention in the development of advanced semiconductor devices. Because hafnia is typically used in CMOS processes, it can be directly incorporated into current semiconductor technologies. Additionally, hafnia&#8208;based ferroelectrics show high scalability and large coercive fields that are advantageous for high&#8208;density memory devices. This review summarizes the recent developments in ferroelectric devices, especially ferroelectric transistors, for next&#8208;generation memory and neuromorphic applications. First, the types of ferroelectric memories and their operation mechanisms are reviewed. Then, issues limiting the realization of high&#8208;performance ferroelectric transistors and possible solutions are discussed. The experimental demonstration of ferroelectric transistor arrays, including 3D ferroelectric NAND and its operation characteristics, are also reviewed. Finally, challenges and strategies toward the development of next&#8208;generation memory and neuromorphic applications based on ferroelectric transistors are outlined.

The short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) is an underexploited portion of the electromagnetic spectrum in metasurface&#8208;based nanophotonics despite its strategic importance in sensing and imaging applications. This is mainly attributed to the lack of material systems to tailor light&#8208;matter interactions in this range. Herein, we&#160;address this limitation and demonstrate an all&#8208;dielectric silicon&#8208;integrated metasurface enabling polarization&#8208;induced Fano resonance control at SWIR frequencies. The platform consists of a two&#8208;dimensional Si/Ge0.9Sn0.1 core/shell nanowire array on a silicon wafer. By tuning the light polarization, we&#160;show that the metasurface reflectance can be efficiently engineered due to Fano resonances emerging from the electric and magnetic dipoles competition. The interference of optically induced dipoles in high&#8208;index nanowire arrays offers additional degrees of freedom to tailor the directional scattering and the flow of light while enabling sharp polarization&#8208;modulated resonances. This tunablity is harnessed in nanosensors yielding an efficient detection of 10&#8722;2 changes in the refractive index of the surrounding medium.

         <title>Enabling Future Closed&#8208;loop Recycling of Spent Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries: Direct Cathode Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The rapid proliferation of electric vehicles equipped with lithium&#8208;ion batteries presents serious waste management challenges and environmental hazards for recyclers after scrap. Closed&#8208;loop recycling contributes to the sustainable development of batteries and plays an important role in mitigating raw material shortages and supply chain risks. Herein, we outline and evaluate current direct cathode regeneration methods for industrialized recycling. Different regeneration methods for spent cathode materials are summarized, which provide a new perspective for realizing closed&#8208;loop recycling of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. A reference recycling route for retrofitting existing cathode production lines is proposed and minimizes the costs. In addition to promoting the industrialization of direct cathode recycling, the environmental, economic, and political benefits of battery recycling are also highlighted.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Liquid&#8208;Phase Molecular Separations: State of the Field, Common Pitfalls, and Future Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) are attractive candidates for next&#8208;generation membrane active layers due to their robust linkages and uniform, tunable pores. Many publications have claimed to achieve selective molecular transport through 2D COF membranes, but reported performance metrics for similar networks vary dramatically, and in several cases the reported experiments are inadequate to support such conclusions. These issues require a reevaluation of the literature. Published examples of 2D COF membranes for liquid&#8208;phase separations can be broadly divided into two categories, each with common performance characteristics: polycrystalline COF films (most &gt;1&#160;&#956;m thick) and weakly crystalline or amorphous films (most &lt;500&#160;nm thick). The former exhibit high solvent permeance, and most, if not all, function as selective adsorbents rather than membranes. The latter behave as membranes with lower permeance in line with conventional reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes but have amorphous or ambiguous long&#8208;range order that precludes conclusions about separations occurring via selective transport through the COF pores. So far, neither category has demonstrated consistent relationships between the designed COF pore structure and separation performance, suggesting that these imperfect materials do not sieve molecules through uniform pores. In this perspective, we describe rigorous characterization practices that should be applied to both COF membrane structure and separation performance, which will facilitate their development toward molecularly precise membranes capable of performing previously unrealized chemical separations. In the absence of this more rigorous standard of proof, reports of COF&#8208;based membranes should be treated with skepticism. As methods to control 2D polymerization and 2D polymer processing improve, we anticipate that precise 2D polymer membranes will exhibit exquisite and energy efficient performance relevant for contemporary separation challenges.

         <title>CoTe2: A Quantum Critical Dirac Metal with Strong Spin Fluctuations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CoTe2 crystallizes in an orthorhombic marcasite structure. Calculations and transport measurements show presence of multiple nodal Dirac lines extending through the Fermi surface. Magnetic properties reveal this compound to be close to ferromagnetism, suppressed by spin fluctuations. This compound harbors a rare combination of proximity to quantum criticality and Dirac topology.








Abstract
Quantum critical points separating weak ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases trigger many novel phenomena. Dynamical spin fluctuations not only suppress the long&#8208;range order, but can also lead to unusual transport and even superconductivity. Combining quantum criticality with topological electronic properties presents a rare and unique opportunity. Here, by means of ab initio calculations and magnetic, thermal, and transport measurements, it is&#160;shown that the orthorhombic CoTe2 is close to ferromagnetism, which appears suppressed by spin fluctuations. Calculations and transport measurements reveal nodal Dirac lines, making it a rare combination of proximity to quantum criticality and Dirac&#160;topology.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Device&#8208;level TEM Characterization Based on Ultra&#8208;flexible Multilayer MoS2 Micro&#8208;cantilever</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in&#8208;situ TEM characterization technology has been capable of statically or dynamically nanorobotic manipulating specimens, affording abundant atom&#8208;level material attributes. However, an insurmountable barrier between material attributes investigations and device&#8208;level application explorations exists due to the lack of mature in&#8208;situ TEM manufacturing technology and sufficient external coupled stimulus. These limitations seriously prevent the development of in&#8208;situ device&#8208;level TEM characterization. Herein, a representative in&#8208;situ opto&#8208;electromechanical TEM characterization platform was put forward by integrating an ultra&#8208;flexible micro&#8208;cantilever chip with multi&#8208;physical coupling fields (optical, mechanical, and electrical fields) for the first time. On this platform, static and dynamic in&#8208;situ device&#8208;level TEM characterizations were implemented by utilizing 2D multilayer MoS2 nanoflake as channel material. E&#8208;beam modulation behavior in MoS2 transistors was demonstrated at ultra&#8208;high e&#8208;beam acceleration voltage (300&#160;kV), stemming from inelastic scattering electron doping into MoS2 nanoflakes. Moreover, in&#8208;situ dynamic bending MoS2 nanodevices without/with laser irradiation revealed asymmetric piezoresistive properties based on electromechanical effects and secondary enhanced photocurrent based on opto&#8208;electromechanical coupling effects, accompanied by real&#8208;time monitoring atom&#8208;level characterization. Our approach provides a step towards advanced in&#8208;situ device&#8208;level TEM characterization technology with excellent perception ability and inspires the further application of in&#8208;situ TEM characterization with ultra&#8208;sensitive force feedback, light sensing, and so on.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Based Growth Factor Delivery Platforms: Strategies and Recent Advances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Growth factors play a crucial role in regulating a broad variety of biological processes and have been regarded as powerful therapeutic agents in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine in the past decades. However, their application is limited by their short half&#8208;lives and potential side effects in physiological environments. Hydrogels have been identified as having the promising potential to prolong the half&#8208;lives of growth factors and mitigate their adverse effects by restricting them within the matrix to reduce their rapid proteolysis, burst release, and unwanted diffusion. This review discusses recent progress in the development of growth factor&#8208;containing hydrogels for various biomedical applications, including wound healing, brain tissue repair, cartilage and bone regeneration, and spinal cord injury repair. In addition, the review introduces strategies for optimizing growth factor releases including affinity&#8208;based delivery, carrier&#8208;assisted delivery, stimuli&#8208;responsive delivery, spatial structure&#8208;based delivery, and cellular system&#8208;based delivery. Finally, the review presents current limitations and future research directions for growth factor&#8208;delivering hydrogels.

         <title>A Liquid Metal Microdroplets Initialized Biopolymer Composite for 3D Printing Anode Host in Zn&#8208;ion Battery</title>

Abstract
Maintaining a steady affinity between gallium&#8208;based liquid metals (LM) and polymer binders, particularly under continuous mechanical deformation, such as extrusion&#8208;based 3D printing or Zn2+ plating/stripping, is very challenging. Here, a LM&#8208;initialized polyacrylamide&#8208;hemicellulose/EGaIn microdroplets hydrogel is used as a multifunctional ink to 3D&#8208;print self&#8208;standing scaffolds and anode hosts for Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The LM microdroplets initiate acrylamide polymerization without additional initiators and cross&#8208;linkers, forming a double&#8208;covalent hydrogen&#8208;bonded network. The hydrogel acts as a framework for stress dissipation, enabling a recovery from structural damage due to the cyclic plating/stripping of Zn2+. The LM&#8208;microdroplet&#8208;initialized polymerization could facilitate the production of 3D printable inks for energy storage devices.

         <title>Extraordinary Ionic Conductivity Excited by Hierarchical Ion Transport Pathways in MOF&#8208;based Quasi&#8208;solid Electrolytes</title>

Abstract
Liquid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;laden metal&#8208;organic frameworks (LE&#8208;laden MOFs) are promising quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes (QSEs) for metal anode batteries. To achieve a high ionic conductivity, considerable efforts have been devoted to designing continuous and compact LE&#8208;laden MOF layer. Surprisingly, an extraordinarily high ionic conductivity (1.02 mS cm&#8722;1) is observed in a LE&#8208;laden MOF electrolyte with abundant interstices and cracks in this work. Herein, various macroscopic and mesoscopic pore structures of Li&#8208;LE&#8208;laden HKUST&#8208;1 QSEs are prepared via morphology control and different cold&#8208;pressing procedures. Thereinto, Li&#8208;LE laden cuboctahedron HKUST&#8208;1 prepared under 150&#160;MPa cold&#8208;pressing with an optimal hierarchical pore structure (Li&#8208;Cuboct&#8208;H) exhibits the highest ambient ionic conductivity (1.02 mS cm&#8722;1). We find that interstices and cracks in electrolytes construct a set of interconnected Li&#8208;LE networks with innate MOF channels and facilitate Li+ transfer in the hybrid ion transport pathways. he Li/LiFePO4 cells based on Li&#8208;Cuboct&#8208;H deliver a splendid capacity retention of 93% over 210 cycles at 1 C. Meanwhile, the high ionic conductivities (higher than 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1) can be achieved in different ion conductor systems (Na, Mg and Al) under the same guideline. This work redefines the understanding of ion transport in MOF&#8208;based QSEs and breaks the bottleneck of MOF&#8208;based QSEs.

         <title>Deciphering Structural Origins of Highly Reversible Lithium Storage in High Entropy Oxides with In Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, distinct reaction dynamics and phase transformations during (de)lithiation of rocksalt high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) are visualized by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methodology, revealing composition&#8208;dependent conversion/alloying reaction kinetics and spatiotemporal variations of valence states. Unexpectedly, the post&#8208;lithiation polyphase can be fully and reversibly recovered to the original rocksalt structure upon delithiation. These findings afford valuable guidelines to compositionally engineer novel HEO electrodes.








Abstract
Configurational entropy&#8208;stabilized single&#8208;phase high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) have been considered revolutionary electrode materials with both reversible lithium storage and high specific capacity that are difficult to fulfill simultaneously by conventional electrodes. However, precise understanding of lithium storage mechanisms in such HEOs remains controversial due to complex multi&#8208;cationic oxide systems. Here, distinct reaction dynamics and structural evolutions in rocksalt&#8208;type HEOs upon cycling are carefully studied by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) including imaging, electron diffraction, and electron energy loss spectroscopy at atomic scale. The mechanisms of composition&#8208;dependent conversion/alloying reaction kinetics along with spatiotemporal variations of valence states upon lithiation are revealed, characterized by disappearance of the original rocksalt phase. Unexpectedly, it is found from the first visualization evidence that the post&#8208;lithiation polyphase state can be recovered to the original rocksalt&#8208;structured HEOs via reversible and symmetrical delithiation reactions, which is unavailable for monometallic oxide systems. Rigorous electrochemical tests coupled with postmortem ex situ TEM and bulk&#8208;level phase analyses further validate the crucial role of structural recovery capability in ensuring the reversible high&#8208;capacity Li&#8208;storage in HEOs. These findings can provide valuable guidelines to design compositionally engineer HEOs for almighty electrodes of next&#8208;generation long&#8208;life energy storage devices.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Radiotherapy Remodels the Tumor Microenvironment to Enhance Antitumor Efficacy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The principles of radiotherapy (RT) and radiosensitization, the mechanisms of radio&#8208;resistance and immune suppression, and the use of various nanoparticles to sensitize RT are discussed and tumor microenvironments (TMEs) for enhanced antitumor efficacy are remodeled. The challenges in clinical translation of multifunctional TME&#8208;remodeling nanoradiosensitizers are also highlighted.








Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) uses ionizing radiation to eradicate localized tumors and, in rare cases, control tumors outside of the irradiated fields via stimulating an antitumor immune response (abscopal effect). However, the therapeutic effect of RT is often limited by inherent physiological barriers of the tumor microenvironment (TME), such as hypoxia, abnormal vasculature, dense extracellular matrix (ECM), and an immunosuppressive TME. Thus, it is critical to develop new RT strategies that can remodel the TME to overcome radio&#8208;resistance and immune suppression. In the past decade, high&#8208;Z&#8208;element nanoparticles have been developed to increase radiotherapeutic indices of localized tumors by reducing X&#8208;ray doses and side effects to normal tissues and enhance abscopal effects by activating the TME to elicit systemic antitumor immunity. In this review, the principles of RT and radiosensitization, the mechanisms of radio&#8208;resistance and immune suppression, and the use of various nanoparticles to sensitize RT and remodel TMEs for enhanced antitumor efficacy are discussed. The challenges in clinical translation of multifunctional TME&#8208;remodeling nanoradiosensitizers are also highlighted.

         <title>RNA&#8208;Targeting Carbon Dots for Live&#8208;Cell Imaging of Granule Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNA&#8208;targeting, red&#8208;emissive carbon dots&#160;(M&#8208;CDs)&#160;are synthesized, microwave&#8208;assisted, by elaborately choosing precursors and spatial organization of the emission centers and recognition motifs. The as&#8208;synthesized M&#8208;CDs show bulk RNA binding and labeling capability in live cells and are further utilized for high&#8208;resolution spatiotemporal imaging of granules dynamics under oxidative stress.








Abstract
It is significant to monitor the different RNA granules dynamics and phase separation process inside cells under various stresses, for example, oxidative stress. The current small&#8208;molecule RNA probes work well only in fixed cells and usually encounter problems such as insufficient stability and biocompatibility, and thus a specific RNA&#8208;targeting fluorescent nanoprobe that&#160;can be used in the living cells is urgently desired. Here, the de novo design and microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis of a novel RNA&#8208;targeting, red&#8208;emissive carbon dots (named as M&#8208;CDs) are reported by choosing neutral red and levofloxacin as precursors. The as&#8208;synthesized M&#8208;CDs is water&#8208;soluble with a high fluorescence quantum yield of 22.83% and can selectively bind to RNA resulting in an enhanced red fluorescence.

&lt;p&gt;RNA-targeting, red-emissive carbon dots&#160;(M-CDs)&#160;are synthesized, microwave-assisted, by elaborately choosing precursors and spatial organization of the emission centers and recognition motifs. The as-synthesized M-CDs show bulk RNA binding and labeling capability in live cells and are further utilized for high-resolution spatiotemporal imaging of granules dynamics under oxidative stress.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is significant to monitor the different RNA granules dynamics and phase separation process inside cells under various stresses, for example, oxidative stress. The current small-molecule RNA probes work well only in fixed cells and usually encounter problems such as insufficient stability and biocompatibility, and thus a specific RNA-targeting fluorescent nanoprobe that&#160;can be used in the living cells is urgently desired. Here, the de novo design and microwave-assisted synthesis of a novel RNA-targeting, red-emissive carbon dots (named as M-CDs) are reported by choosing neutral red and levofloxacin as precursors. The as-synthesized M-CDs is water-soluble with a high fluorescence quantum yield of 22.83% and can selectively bind to RNA resulting in an enhanced red fluorescence. More interestingly, such an RNA-targeting, red-emissive M-CDs can be fast internalized into cells within 5&#160;s and thus used for real-time imaging the dynamic process of intracellular stress granules under oxidative stress, revealing some characteristics of granules that have not been identified by previously reported RNA and protein biomarkers. This research paves a new pathway for visualizing bulk RNA dynamics and studying phase-separation behaviors in living cells by rational design of the fluorescent carbon dots in terms of structure and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulations in Superconductors: Probes of Underlying Physics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulations in superconductors are summarized comprehensively, which includes state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques and those established methods. The significance of modulations in exploring the superconductivity is highlighted by applications into several newly discovered superconductors. Three directions for development of modulations are also outlined.








Abstract
The importance of modulations is elevated to an unprecedented level, due to the delicate conditions required to bring out exotic phenomena in quantum materials, such as topological materials, magnetic materials, and superconductors. Recently, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art modulation techniques in material science, such as electric&#8208;double&#8208;layer transistor, piezoelectric&#8208;based strain apparatus, angle twisting, and nanofabrication, have been utilized in superconductors. They not only efficiently increase the tuning capability to the broader ranges but also extend the tuning dimensionality to unprecedented degrees of freedom, including quantum fluctuations of competing phases, electronic correlation, and phase coherence essential to global superconductivity. Here, for a comprehensive review, these techniques together with the established modulation methods, such as elemental substitution, annealing, and polarization&#8208;induced gating, are contextualized. Depending on the mechanism of each method, the modulations are categorized into stoichiometric manipulation, electrostatic gating, mechanical modulation, and geometrical design. Their recent advances are highlighted by applications in newly discovered superconductors, e.g., nickelates, Kagome metals, and magic&#8208;angle graphene. Overall, the review is to provide systematic modulations in emergent superconductors and serve as the coordinate for future investigations, which can stimulate researchers in superconductivity and other fields to perform various modulations toward a thorough understanding of quantum materials.

         <title>Toward Rapid and Accurate Molecular Diagnostics at Home</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advancements in integrated sample preparations and nucleic acid (NA) detection are reported for rapid and accurate home diagnostics. Automated sample preparation methods of blood, urine, nasal swabs, saliva, or stool that can be integrated with NA amplification on a single device are highlighted. Recent progress, challenges, and perspectives of user&#8208;friendly integrated molecular diagnostics at home are discussed.








Abstract
The global outbreaks of infectious diseases have significantly driven an imperative demand for rapid and accurate molecular diagnostics. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) feature high sensitivity and high specificity; however, the labor&#8208;intensive sample preparation and nucleic acid amplification steps remain challenging in order to carry out rapid and precision molecular diagnostics at home. This review discusses the advances and challenges of automatic solutions of sample preparation integrated with on&#8208;chip nucleic acid amplification for effective and accurate molecular diagnostics at home. The sample preparation methods of whole blood, urine, saliva/nasal swab, and stool on chip are examined. Then, the repurposable integrated sample preparation on a chip using various biological samples is investigated. Finally, the on&#8208;chip NAATs that can be integrated with automated sample preparation are evaluated. The user&#8208;friendly approaches with combined sample preparation and NAATs can be the game changers for next&#8208;generation rapid and precision home diagnostics.

         <title>Oxidization&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Triggered Rapid Preparation of Large&#8208;Area Single&#8208;Crystal Cu(111) Foil</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through low&#8208;temperature oxidization of polycrystalline Cu foils, rapid preparation of large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) (up to 320 cm2) is achieved within 60 min, thanks to the transformation of the thin CuxO layer to a Cu(111) seed layer. Large&#8208;size high&#8208;quality graphene films are synthesized on the single&#8208;crystal Cu(111), and the graphene/Cu(111) composites exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity and ductility compared to their polycrystalline counterpart.








Abstract
The controlled preparation of single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) is intensively investigated owing to the superior properties of Cu(111) and its advantages in synthesizing high&#8208;quality 2D materials, especially graphene. However, the accessibility of large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) is still hindered by time&#8208;consuming, complicated, and high&#8208;cost preparation methods. Here, the oxidization&#8208;temperature&#8208;triggered rapid preparation of large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) in which an area up to 320 cm2 is prepared within 60 min, and where low&#8208;temperature oxidization of polycrystalline Cu foil surface plays a vital role, is reported. A mechanism is proposed, by which the thin CuxO layer transforms to a Cu(111) seed layer on the surface of Cu to induce the formation of a large&#8208;area Cu(111) foil, which is supported by both experimental data and molecular dynamics simulation results. In addition, a large&#8208;size high&#8208;quality graphene film is synthesized on the single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) foil surface and the graphene/Cu(111) composites exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity and ductility compared to their polycrystalline counterpart. This work, therefore, not only provides a new avenue toward the monocrystallinity of Cu with specific planes but also contributes to improving the mass production of high&#8208;quality 2D materials.

Abstract
3D topological spin textures&#8212;hopfions&#8212;are predicted in helimagnetic systems but are not experimentally confirmed thus far. By utilizing an external magnetic field and electric current in the present study, 3D topological spin textures are realized, including fractional hopfions with nonzero topological index, in a skyrmion&#8208;hosting helimagnet FeGe. Microsecond current pulses are employed to control the dynamics of the expansion and contraction of a bundle composed of a skyrmion and a fractional hopfion, as well as its current&#8208;driven Hall motion. This research approach has demonstrated the novel electromagnetic properties of fractional hopfions and their ensembles in helimagnetic systems.

         <title>Silk Fibroin and Sericin Differentially Potentiate the Paracrine and Regenerative Functions of Stem Cells Through Multiomics Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silk fibroin (SF) and sericin (SS), the two major proteins of silk, potentiate the paracrine functions of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) by differentially activating the integrin/PI3K/Akt and glycolysis signaling pathways. The SF&#8208; and SS&#8208;initiated paracrine signals of MSCs modulate the behaviors of multiple resident cells in the skin wound microenvironments and thereby improve skin regeneration with structural and functional recovery.








Abstract
Silk fibroin (SF) and sericin (SS), the two major proteins of silk, are attractive biomaterials with great potential in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, their biochemical interactions with stem cells remain unclear. In this study, multiomics are employed to obtain a global view of the cellular processes and pathways of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) triggered by SF and SS to discern cell&#8211;biomaterial interactions at an in&#8208;depth, high&#8208;throughput molecular level. Integrated RNA sequencing and proteomic analysis confirm that SF and SS initiate widespread but distinct cellular responses and potentiate the paracrine functions of MSCs that regulate extracellular matrix deposition, angiogenesis, and immunomodulation through differentially activating the integrin/PI3K/Akt and glycolysis signaling pathways. These paracrine signals of MSCs stimulated by SF and SS effectively improve skin regeneration by regulating the behavior of multiple resident cells (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages) in the skin wound microenvironment. Compared to SS, SF exhibits better immunomodulatory effects in vitro and in vivo, indicating its greater potential as a carrier material of MSCs for skin regeneration. This study provides comprehensive and reliable insights into the cellular interactions with SF and SS, enabling the future development of silk&#8208;based therapeutics for tissue engineering and stem cell therapy.

&lt;p&gt;Silk fibroin (SF) and sericin (SS), the two major proteins of silk, potentiate the paracrine functions of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) by differentially activating the integrin/PI3K/Akt and glycolysis signaling pathways. The SF- and SS-initiated paracrine signals of MSCs modulate the behaviors of multiple resident cells in the skin wound microenvironments and thereby improve skin regeneration with structural and functional recovery.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silk fibroin (SF) and sericin (SS), the two major proteins of silk, are attractive biomaterials with great potential in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, their biochemical interactions with stem cells remain unclear. In this study, multiomics are employed to obtain a global view of the cellular processes and pathways of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) triggered by SF and SS to discern cell&#8211;biomaterial interactions at an in-depth, high-throughput molecular level. Integrated RNA sequencing and proteomic analysis confirm that SF and SS initiate widespread but distinct cellular responses and potentiate the paracrine functions of MSCs that regulate extracellular matrix deposition, angiogenesis, and immunomodulation through differentially activating the integrin/PI3K/Akt and glycolysis signaling pathways. These paracrine signals of MSCs stimulated by SF and SS effectively improve skin regeneration by regulating the behavior of multiple resident cells (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages) in the skin wound microenvironment.

         <title>Ionic Liquid &#8220;Water Pocket&#8221; for Stable and Environment&#8208;Adaptable Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;hydrophobic ionic liquid binary system is found to experience spontaneous miscibility transition by introducing Zn salts bearing amphiphilic functional group, forming a novel class of aqueous electrolytes, in which the ionic liquid species function as a &#8220;water pocket&#8221; to envelop the highly active H2O&#8208;dominated Zn2+ solvates and protect them from parasitic reactions during the operation of zinc metal batteries.








Abstract
The strong reactivity of water in aqueous electrolytes toward metallic zinc (Zn), especially at aggressive operating conditions, remains the fundamental obstacle to the commercialization of aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs). Here, a water&#8208;immiscible ionic liquid diluent 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide (EmimFSI) is reported that can substantially suppress the water activity of aqueous electrolyte by serving as a &#8220;water pocket&#8221;, enveloping the highly active H2O&#8208;dominated Zn2+ solvates and protecting them from parasitic reactions. During Zn deposition, the cation Emim+ and anion FSI&#8722; function respectively in mitigating the tip effect and regulating the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), thereby favoring a smooth Zn deposition layer protected by inorganic species&#8208;enriched SEI featuring high uniformity and stability. Combined with the boosted chemical/electrochemical stability endowed by the intrinsic merits of ionic liquid, this ionic liquid&#8208;incorporated aqueous electrolyte (IL&#8208;AE) enables the stable operation of Zn||Zn0.25V2O5&#183;nH2O cells even at a challenging temperature of 60&#160;&#176;C (&gt;85% capacity retention over 400 cycles). Finally, as an incidental but practically valuable benefit, the near&#8208;zero vapor pressure nature of ionic liquid allows the efficient separation and recovery of high&#8208;value components from the spent electrolyte via a mild and green approach, promising the sustainable future of IL&#8208;AE in realizing practical AZMBs.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Scale Mechanical Metamaterial with a Controllable Transition in the Poisson's Ratio and Band Gap Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel micro&#8208;scale mechanical metamaterial is proposed that can undergo a magnetically induced transition from one type of configuration to another, with one configuration being strongly auxetic and the other having a highly positive Poisson's ratio. The system allows to also concurrently control the band gap formation.








Abstract
The ability to significantly change the mechanical and wave propagation properties of a structure without rebuilding it is currently one of the main challenges in the field of mechanical metamaterials. This stems from the enormous appeal that such tunable behavior may offer from the perspective of applications ranging from biomedical to protective devices, particularly in the case of micro&#8208;scale systems. In this work, a novel micro&#8208;scale mechanical metamaterial is proposed that can undergo a transition from one type of configuration to another, with one configuration having a very negative Poisson's ratio, corresponding to strong auxeticity, and the other having a highly positive Poisson's ratio. The formation of phononic band gaps can also be controlled concurrently which can be very useful for the design of vibration dampers and sensors. Finally, it is experimentally shown that the reconfiguration process can be induced and controlled remotely through application of a magnetic field by using appropriately distributed magnetic inclusions.

         <title>When Polymorphism in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Enables Water Sorption Profile Tunability for Enhancing Heat Allocation and Water Harvesting Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;&#181;&#8208;OH&#8208;connectivity in the corner&#8208;sharing chains of AlO6 octahedra in water stable microporous aluminum&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks leads to two polymorphs, which solely differ in the straight or helical&#8208;shape of the chains. This polymorphism is associated with a drastic change in their water sorption behavior in a view of tuning the heat allocation and water harvesting performances.








Abstract
The development of thermally driven water&#8208;sorption&#8208;based technologies relies on high&#8208;performing water vapor adsorbents. Here, polymorphism in Al&#8211;metal&#8211;organic frameworks is disclosed as a new strategy to tune the hydrophilicity of MOFs. This involves the formation of MOFs built from chains of either trans&#8208; or cis&#8208; &#181;&#8208;OH&#8208;connected corner&#8208;sharing AlO4(OH)2 octahedra. Specifically, [Al(OH)(muc)] or MIP&#8208;211, is made of trans, trans&#8208;muconate linkers, and cis&#8208;&#181;&#8208;OH&#8208;connected corner&#8208;sharing AlO4(OH)2 octahedra giving a 3D network with sinusoidal channels. The polymorph MIL&#8208;53&#8208;muc has a tiny change in the chain structure that results in a shift of the step position of the water isotherm from P/P0&#160;&#8776; 0.5 in MIL&#8208;53&#8208;muc, to P/P0&#160;&#8776; 0.3 in MIP&#8208;211. Solid&#8208;state NMR and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo reveal that the adsorption occurs initially between two hydroxyl groups of the chains, favored by the cis&#8208;positioning in MIP&#8208;211, resulting in a more hydrophilic behavior. Finally, theoretical evaluations show that MIP&#8208;211 would allow achieving a coefficient of performance for cooling (COPc) of 0.63 with an ultralow driving temperature of 60&#160;&#176;C, outperforming benchmark sorbents for small temperature lifts. Combined with its high stability, easy regeneration, huge water uptake capacity, green synthesis, MIP&#8208;211 is among the best adsorbents for adsorption&#8208;driven air conditioning and water harvesting from the air.

         <title>Dynamic Stabilization of Metastable States in Triple&#8208;Well Ferroelectric Sn2P2S6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic hysteresis loops in nanoscale volumes reveal the signatures of a triple potential well, wherein a transient metastable state with zero polarization separates the transition between stable polarization states. The zero state is distinct from a domain wall, and it enhances mem&#8208;capacitive behavior with voltage&#8208;history dependent change of local dielectric properties.








Abstract
Polarization dynamics in ferroelectric materials is governed by the effective potential energy landscape of the order parameter. The unique aspect of ferroelectrics compared to many other transitions is the possibility of more than two potential wells, leading to complicated energy landscapes with new fundamental and functional properties. Here, direct dynamic evidence is revealed of a triple&#8208;well potential in the metal thiophosphate Sn2P2S6 compound using multivariate scanning probe microscopy combined with theoretical simulations. The key finding is that the metastable zero polarization state can be accessed through a gradual switching process and is stabilized over a broad range of electric fields. Simulations confirm that the observed zero polarization state originates from a kinetic stabilization of the nonpolar state of the triple&#8208;well, as opposed to domain walls. Dynamically, the triple&#8208;well of Sn2P2S6 becomes equivalent to antiferroelectric hysteresis loops. Therefore, this material combines the robust and well&#8208;defined domain structure of a proper ferroelectric with dynamic hysteresis loops present in antiferroelectrics. Moreover, the triple&#8208;well enhances mem&#8208;capacitive effects in Sn2P2S6, which are forbidden for ideal double&#8208;well ferroelectrics. These findings provide a path to tunable electronic elements for beyond binary high&#8208;density computing devices and neuromorphic circuits based on dynamic properties of the triple&#8208;well.

Therefore, this material combines the robust and well-defined domain structure of a proper ferroelectric with dynamic hysteresis loops present in antiferroelectrics. Moreover, the triple-well enhances mem-capacitive effects in Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, which are forbidden for ideal double-well ferroelectrics. These findings provide a path to tunable electronic elements for beyond binary high-density computing devices and neuromorphic circuits based on dynamic properties of the triple-well.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Repeatedly Recyclable 3D Printing Catalyst&#8208;Free Dynamic Thermosetting Photopolymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalyst&#8208;free dynamic thermosetting photopolymers are developed by immobilized the catalyst&#8208;free reversible bonds into the photopolymers, that can enable users to realize repeatable 3D printing. The generated resins demonstrate controllable mechanical properties with elastomeric behaviors to thermadapt shape memory polymers. Furthermore, the resulting network presents an on&#8208;demand, repeatedly recyclable thermosetting photopolymer platform for sustainable 3D printing.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;curing 3D printing technology has promoted the advanced manufacturing in various fields, but has exacerbated the environmental crisis by the demand for the chemically cross&#8208;linked thermosetting photopolymers. Here, the authors report a generic strategy to develop catalyst&#8208;free dynamic thermosetting photopolymers, based on photopolymerization and transesterification, that can enable users to realize repeatable 3D printing, providing a practical solution to the environmental challenges. That the &#946;&#8208;carbonyl group adjacent to the ester group greatly accelerates the rate of transesterification is demonstrated. The generated resins from the immobilization of the catalyst&#8208;free reversible bonds into the photopolymers leads to a dynamic covalently crosslinked network structure upon UV based 3D printing, which exhibit controllable mechanical properties with elastomeric behaviors to thermadapt shape memory polymers. Furthermore, the resulting network can be reverted into an acrylate&#8208;functioned photopolymer that is suitable for 3D printing again, presenting an on&#8208;demand, repeatedly recyclable thermosetting photopolymer platform for sustainable 3D printing.

         <title>Ultrabroadband Imaging Based on Wafer&#8208;Scale Tellurene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wafer&#8208;scale tellurene is synthesized under room temperature by exploiting pulsed&#8208;laser deposition. On this basis, tellurene&#8208;based photodetector arrays are constructed, manifesting outstanding photosensitivity with the optimal responsivity, external quantum efficiency, and detectivity of 2.7&#160;&#215; 107 A&#160;W&#8722;1, 8.2&#160;&#215; 109%, and 4.5 &#215; 1015&#160;Jones. Moreover, proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept ultrabroadband optical imaging is realized.








Abstract
High&#8208;resolution imaging is at the heart of the revolutionary breakthroughs of intelligent technologies, and it is established as an important approach toward high&#8208;sensitivity information extraction/storage. However, due to the incompatibility between non&#8208;silicon optoelectronic materials and traditional integrated circuits as well as the lack of competent photosensitive semiconductors in the infrared region, the development of ultrabroadband imaging is severely impeded. Herein, the monolithic integration of wafer&#8208;scale tellurene photoelectric functional units by exploiting room&#8208;temperature pulsed&#8208;laser deposition is realized. Taking advantage of the surface plasmon polaritons of tellurene, which results in the thermal perturbation promoted exciton separation, in situ formation of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane homojunction and negative expansion promoted carrier transport, as well as the band bending promoted electron&#8211;hole pair separation enabled by the unique interconnected nanostrip morphology, the tellurene photodetectors demonstrate wide&#8208;spectrum photoresponse from 370.6 to 2240&#160;nm and unprecedented photosensitivity with the optimized responsivity, external quantum efficiency and detectivity of 2.7&#160;&#215;&#160;107&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, 8.2&#160;&#215;&#160;109% and 4.5 &#215; 1015&#160;Jones. An ultrabroadband imager is demonstrated and high&#8208;resolution photoelectric imaging is realized. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept wafer&#8208;scale tellurene&#8208;based ultrabroadband photoelectric imaging system depicts a fascinating paradigm for the development of an advanced 2D imaging platform toward next&#8208;generation intelligent equipment.

         <title>Band Position&#8208;Independent Piezo&#8208;Electrocatalysis for Ultrahigh CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezo&#8208;electrocatalysis as an emerging mechano&#8208;to&#8208;chemistry energy conversion technique opens multiple innovative opportunities, drawing great interest but also suffering from the controversial mechanisms. A narrow&#8208;bandgap piezo&#8208;electrocatalyst strategy is proposed by choosing CO2 reduction as a probe reaction to distinguish the two potential mechanisms, i.e., screening charge effect and energy band theory, and reveal that piezo&#8208;electrocatalysis is independent of band positions.








Abstract
Piezo&#8208;electrocatalysis as an emerging mechano&#8208;to&#8208;chemistry energy conversion technique opens multiple innovative opportunities and draws great interest over the past decade. However, the two potential mechanisms in piezo&#8208;electrocatalysis, i.e., screening charge effect and energy band theory, generally coexist in the most piezoelectrics, making the essential mechanism remain controversial. Here, for the first time, the two mechanisms in piezo&#8208;electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (PECRR) is distinguished through a narrow&#8208;bandgap piezo&#8208;electrocatalyst strategy using MoS2 nanoflakes as demo. With conduction band of &#8722;0.12&#160;eV, the MoS2 nanoflakes are unsatisfied for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO redox potential of &#8722;0.53&#160;eV, yet they achieve an ultrahigh CO yield of &#8776;543.1&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in PECRR. Potential band position shifts under vibration are still unsatisfied with CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO potential verified by theoretical investigation and piezo&#8208;photocatalytic experiment, further indicating that the mechanism of piezo&#8208;electrocatalysis is independent of band position. Besides, MoS2 nanoflakes exhibit unexpected intense &#8220;breathing&#8221; effect under vibration and enable the naked&#8208;eye&#8208;visible inhalation of CO2 gas, independently achieving the complete carbon cycle chain from CO2 capture to conversion. The CO2 inhalation and conversion processes in PECRR are revealed by a self&#8208;designed in situ reaction cell. This work brings new insights into the essential mechanism and surface reaction evolution of piezo&#8208;electrocatalysis.

         <title>Hygrothermic Wood Actuated Robotic Hand</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hygrothermic wood actuator with asymmetric water affinity is developed, which generates stretching and bending responses to moisture and thermal/light stimulation. Multiple advantages are realized, including good mechanical properties, multi&#8208;stimulus response, complex deformation, wide working temperature range, low manufacturing cost, and biocompatibility. A robotic hand and grippers are designed for dexterous object&#8211;hand interactions and fire rescue scenarios.








Abstract
Stimulus&#8211;responsive actuators play a vital role in the new generation of intelligent systems. However, poor mechanical performance, complicated fabrication processes, and the inability to complex deformation limit their practical applications. Herein, these challenges are overcome via designing a strong hygrothermic wood actuator with asymmetric water affinity. The actuator is readily constructed by sandwiching polypyrrole&#8211;coated wood with a Ni complex hygroscopic gel top layer for moisture absorption and a polyimide bottom layer as the water barrier. The resulting hygrothermic wood spontaneously stretches and bends itself in response to moisture and thermal/light stimulation. A robotic hand and a series of grippers made of hygrothermic wood demonstrate dexterous object&#8211;hand interactions during grasping and holding, while the reversible hygrothermic property allows the actuator to be potentially applied in fire rescue scenarios to rescue trapped objects. A combination of good mechanical properties, multi&#8211;stimulus&#8208;response, complex deformation, wide working temperature range, low manufacturing cost, and biocompatibility are simultaneously realized by one device. It is thus believed that such a strong wood actuator will open up a new avenue for building intelligent robotic hand systems.

         <title>Gadolinium (III)&#8208;Chelated Deformable Mesoporous Organosilica Nanoparticles as Magnetic Resonance Imaging Contrast Agent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel deformable nanocarrier is synthesized that is easy to modify and load with drugs. The magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent Gd&#8208;DTPA (Magnevist) has longer blood circulation, higher relaxivity, and greater tissue specificity when loaded into the deformable nanocarrier.








Abstract
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, such as Magnevist (Gd&#8208;DTPA), are routinely used for detecting tumors at an early stage. However, the rapid clearance by the kidney of Gd&#8208;DTPA leads to short blood circulation time, which limits further improvement of the contrast between tumorous and normal tissue. Inspired by the deformability of red blood cells, which improves their blood circulation, this work fabricates a novel MRI contrast agent by incorporating Gd&#8208;DTPA into deformable mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles (D&#8208;MON). In vivo distribution shows that the novel contrast agent is able to depress rapid clearance by the liver and spleen, and the mean residence time is 20 h longer than Gd&#8208;DTPA. Tumor MRI studies demonstrated&#160;that the D&#8208;MON&#8208;based contrast agent is highly enriched in the tumor tissue and achieves prolonged high&#8208;contrast imaging. D&#8208;MON significantly improves the performance of clinical contrast agent Gd&#8208;DTPA, exhibiting good potential in clinical applications.

         <title>Cuproptosis Induced by ROS Responsive Nanoparticles with Elesclomol and Copper Combined with &#945;PD&#8208;L1 for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2212267, Nianzeng Xing, Haihua Xiao, and co&#8208;workers provides a novel therapeutic strategy to achieve synergistic cancer immunotherapy via cuproptosis induced by ROS&#8208;responsive nanomedicine loaded with elesclomol and copper (NP@ESCu). With this approach, the tumor microenvironment is reprogrammed, and the expression of PD&#8208;L1 is increased, which consequently improves responsiveness of immunotherapy.








Abstract
Cuproptosis is a new cell death that depends on copper (Cu) ionophores to transport Cu into cancer cells, which induces cell death. However, existing Cu ionophores are small molecules with a short blood half&#8208;life making it hard to transport enough Cu into cancer cells. Herein, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive polymer (PHPM) is designed, which is used to co&#8208;encapsulate elesclomol (ES) and Cu to form nanoparticles (NP@ESCu). After entering cancer cells, ES and Cu, triggered by excessive intracellular ROS, are readily released. ES and Cu work in a concerted way to not only kill cancer cells by cuproptosis, but also induce immune responses. In vitro, the ability of NP@ESCu to efficiently transport Cu and induce cuproptosis is investigated. In addition, the change in the transcriptomes of cancer cells treated with NP@ESCu is explored by RNA&#8208;Seq. In vivo, NP@ESCu is found to induce cuproptosis in the mice model with subcutaneous bladder cancer, reprograming the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, NP@ESCu is further combined with anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein ligand&#8208;1&#160;antibody (&#945;PD&#8208;L1). This study provides the first report of combining nanomedicine that can induce cuproptosis with &#945;PD&#8208;L1&#160;for enhanced cancer therapy, thereby providing a novel strategy for future cancer therapy.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Specific Photothermal&#8208;Therapy&#8208;Assisted Immunomodulation via Multiresponsive Adjuvant Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;enzyme&#8208;near&#8208;infrared multi&#8208;responsive immune&#8208;adjuvant nanoparticle is fabricated to perform tumor&#8208;specific photothermal therapy and photothermal&#8208;assisted manipulation of immune cells including dendritic cells, macrophages, and T cells for effective treatment of malignant tumor, which significantly inhibits the primary tumor and its metastasis, resulting in the dramatic enhancement of survival rate of lung metastatic tumor&#8208;bearing mice.








Abstract
Multiresponsive adjuvant nanoparticles (RMmAGL) are fabricated to perform tumor&#8208;specific photothermal therapy while regulating the behavior of tumor&#8208;associated immune cells for primary tumor eradication and metastasis inhibition. Core&#8211;satellite&#8208;like RMmAGL have a core of mannose&#8208;functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded with the TLR7 agonist imiquimod (R837@MSN&#8208;mannose) connected via hydrazone bonds to satellites of glutamine (Glu)&#8208; and lysine (Lys)&#8208;comodified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys). During therapy, the acidic environment in tumor tissue cleaves the hydrazone bonds to release AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys, which further accumulate in tumor cells. After internalization, photothermal agents (aggregated AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys) are generated in situ through the intratumoral enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reaction between Glu and Lys, resulting in tumor&#8208;specific photothermal therapy. The detachment of AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys also triggers the release of R837, which matured dendritic cells (DCs) via a vaccine&#8208;like mechanism along with the tumor&#8208;associated antigens generated by photothermal therapy. These matured DCs further activates surrounding T cells for immunotherapy. Moreover, the resulting free MSN&#8208;mannose serves as an artificial glycocalyx to continuously induce the polarization of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages from an immunosuppressive phenotype to an inflammatory phenotype, thus further enhancing immunotherapy. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate significant inhibition of malignant tumors after therapy.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Semiconducting Graft Copolymers to Achieve &#8220;Clickable&#8221; Fluorescent Nanoparticles with Long Circulation and Specific Cancer Targeting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) are a promising tool for theranostic applications. Here, a method of imparting colloidal stability, low&#8208;protein fouling, and high circulation efficiencies onto SPNs is described via a one&#8208;step, postpolymerization reaction. This method can also afford azide&#8208;functionalized SPNs, which allows for subsequent &#8220;click&#8221; reactions to achieve specific human epidermal growth factor receptor 2&#160;(HER2) targeting in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) are explored for applications in cancer theranostics because of their high absorption coefficients, photostability, and biocompatibility. However, SPNs are susceptible to aggregation and protein fouling in physiological conditions, which can be detrimental for in vivo applications. Here, a method for achieving colloidally stable and low&#8208;fouling SPNs is described by grafting poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) onto the backbone of the fluorescent semiconducting polymer, poly(9,9&#8242;&#8208;dioctylfluorene&#8208;5&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole), in a simple one&#8208;step substitution reaction, postpolymerization. Further, by utilizing azide&#8208;functionalized PEG, anti&#8208;human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)&#160;antibodies, antibody fragments, or affibodies are site&#8208;specifically &#8220;clicked&#8221; onto the SPN surface, which allows the functionalized SPNs to specifically target HER2&#8208;positive cancer cells. In vivo, the PEGylated SPNs are found to have excellent circulation efficiencies in zebrafish embryos for up to seven days postinjection. SPNs functionalized with affibodies are then shown to be able to target HER2 expressing cancer cells in a zebrafish xenograft model. The covalent PEGylated SPN system described herein shows great potential for cancer theranostics.

         <title>Biomimetic Construction of Ferrite Quantum Dot/Graphene Heterostructure for Enhancing Ion/Charge Transfer in Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general biomimetic mineralization synthetic strategy is proposed to construct a series of spinel ferrite quantum dot/graphene (XFe2O4 QD/G) heterostructures. The biomimetic mineralization strategy can precisely tune complex architectures by slowing down the reaction kinetics. The combination of ferrite QD and graphene provides rich redox active sites and boosts the ion/charge transfer, improving their capacitive and cyclic performances.








Abstract
Spinel ferrites are regarded as promising electrode materials for supercapacitors (SCs) in virtue of their low cost and high theoretical specific capacitances. However, bulk ferrites suffer from limited electrical conductivity, sluggish ion transport, and inadequate active sites. Therefore, rational structural design and composition regulation of the ferrites are approaches to overcome these limitations. Herein, a general biomimetic mineralization synthetic strategy is proposed to synthesize ferrite (XFe2O4, X = Ni, Co, Mn) quantum dot/graphene (QD/G) heterostructures. Anchoring ferrite QD on the graphene sheets not only strengthens the structural stability, but also forms the electrical conductivity network needed to boost the ion diffusion and charge transfer. The optimized NiFe2O4 QD/G heterostructure exhibits specific capacitances of 697.5 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, and exceptional cycling performance. Furthermore, the fabricated symmetrical SCs deliver energy densities of 24.4 and 17.4&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at power densities of 499.3 and 4304.2&#160;W kg&#8722;1, respectively. Density functional theory calculations indicate the combination of NiFe2O4 QD and graphene facilitates the adsorption of potassium atoms, ensuring rapid ion/charge transfer. This work enriches the application of the biomimetic mineralization synthesis and provides effective strategies for boosting ion/charge transfer, which may offer a new way to develop advanced electrodes for SCs.

Herein, a general biomimetic mineralization synthetic strategy is proposed to synthesize ferrite (XFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, X = Ni, Co, Mn) quantum dot/graphene (QD/G) heterostructures. Anchoring ferrite QD on the graphene sheets not only strengthens the structural stability, but also forms the electrical conductivity network needed to boost the ion diffusion and charge transfer. The optimized NiFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; QD/G heterostructure exhibits specific capacitances of 697.5 F g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and exceptional cycling performance. Furthermore, the fabricated symmetrical SCs deliver energy densities of 24.4 and 17.4&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at power densities of 499.3 and 4304.2&#160;W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Density functional theory calculations indicate the combination of NiFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; QD and graphene facilitates the adsorption of potassium atoms, ensuring rapid ion/charge transfer. This work enriches the application of the biomimetic mineralization synthesis and provides effective strategies for boosting ion/charge transfer, which may offer a new way to develop advanced electrodes for SCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Z&#8208;scheme Heterojunctional Photocatalyst Engineered with Spatially Separated Dual Redox Sites for Selective CO2 Reduction with Water: Insight by In situ &#181;s&#8208;transient Absorption Spectra</title>

The cascade Z&#8208;scheme charge transfer steered by anchored CoOx clusters for capturing holes and the accelerated water oxidation dynamics, together with the CO2 concentrated microenvironment and activation created by modified ILs synergistically boost the CO2 conversion.s








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction by water with a Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction affords an avenue to access energy storage and to alleviate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, yet the separation of charge carriers and the integrative regulation of water oxidation and CO2 activation sites remain challenging. Here, a BiVO4/g&#8208;C3N4 (BVO/CN) Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction as such a prototype is constructed by spatially separated dual sites with CoOx clusters and imidazolium ionic liquids (IL) toward CO2 photoreduction. The optimized CoOx&#8208;BVO/CN&#8208;IL delivers an &#8776;80&#8208;fold CO production rate without H2 evolution compared with urea&#8208;C3N4 counterpart, together with nearly stoichiometric O2 gas produced. Experimental results and DFT calculations unveil the cascade Z&#8208;scheme charge transfer and subsequently the prominent redox co&#8208;catalysis by CoOx and IL for holes&#8208;H2O oxidation and electrons&#8208;CO2 reduction, respectively. Moreover, in situ &#181;s&#8208;transient absorption spectra clearly show the function of each cocatalyst and quantitatively reveal that the resulting CoOx&#8208;BVO/CN&#8208;IL reaches up to the electron transfer efficiency of 36.4% for CO2 reduction, far beyond those for BVO/CN (4.0%) and urea&#8208;CN (0.8%), underlining an exceptional synergy of dual reaction sites engineering. This work provides deep insights and guidelines for the rational design of highly efficient Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions with precise redox catalytic sites toward solar fuel production.

         <title>Thermodynamically Stable Dual&#8208;Modified LiF&amp;FeF3 layer Empowering Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes with Superior Cyclabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermodynamically stabilized LiF&amp;FeF3 coating can effectively suppress the nanoscale structural degradation and the intergranular cracks and alleviates the outward migration of O&#945;&#8722; (&#945;&lt;2), increases oxygen vacancy formation energies, and accelerates interfacial Li+ diffusion.








Abstract
Pushing the limit of cutoff potentials allows nickel&#8208;rich layered oxides to provide greater energy density and specific capacity whereas reducing thermodynamic and kinetic stability. Herein, a one&#8208;step dual&#8208;modified method is proposed for in situ synthesizing thermodynamically stable LiF&amp;FeF3 coating on LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 surfaces by capturing lithium impurity on the surface to overcome the challenges suffered. The thermodynamically stabilized LiF&amp;FeF3 coating can effectively suppress the nanoscale structural degradation and the intergranular cracks. Meanwhile, the LiF&amp;FeF3 coating alleviates the outward migration of O&#945;&#8722; (&#945;&lt;2), increases oxygen vacancy formation energies, and accelerates interfacial Li+ diffusion. Benefited from these, the electrochemical performance of LiF&amp;FeF3 modified materials is improved (83.1% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1C), even under exertive operational conditions of elevated temperature (91.3% capacity retention after 150 cycles at 1C). This work demonstrates that the dual&#8208;modified strategy can simultaneously address the problems of interfacial instability and bulk structural degradation and represents significant progress in developing high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs).

         <title>Localized Bound Multiexcitons in Engineered Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskites Grains at Room Temperature for Efficient Lasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature multiexcitonic amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) with threshold as low as 13.7 &#181;J cm&#8722;2, which is reduced 58.6% relative to the amorphous counterpart with larger grains, is demonstrated based on quasi&#8208;2D perovskite P2F8 with grains sized in hundreds&#8208;nm scale. In addition, the well&#8208;defined translational momentum in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite grains can restrict the Auger recombination that is detrimental to radiative emission.








Abstract
Reducing the excitation threshold to minimize the Joule heating is critical for the realization of perovskite laser diodes. Although bound excitons are promising for low threshold laser, how to generate them at room temperature for laser applications is still unclear in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite&#8208;based devices. In this work, via engineering quasi&#8208;2D perovskite PEA2(CH3NH3)n&#8208;1PbnBr3n+1 microscopic grains by the anti&#8208;solvent method, room&#8208;temperature multiexciton radiative recombination is successfully demonstrated at a remarkably low pump density of 0.97 &#181;J cm&#8722;2, which is only one&#8208;fourth of that required in 2D CdSe nanosheets. In addition, the well&#8208;defined translational momentum in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite grains can restrict the Auger recombination which is detrimental to radiative emission. Furthermore, the quasi&#8208;2D perovskite grains are favorable for increasing binding energies of excitons and biexcitons and so as the related radiative recombination. Consequently, the prepared &lt;n&#160;= 8&gt; phase quasi&#8208;2D perovskite film renders a threshold of room&#8208;temperature stimulated emission as low as 13.7 &#181;J cm&#8722;2, reduced by 58.6% relative to the amorphous counterpart with larger grains. The findings in this work are expected to facilitate the development of solution&#8208;processable perovskite multiexcitonic laser diodes.

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination Induces Electron Localization at Ca Sites for Robust CO2 Electroreduction to CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving electron localization around Ca single&#8208;atom sites promotes CO2 activation for CO2 electroreduction to CO. A strategy to localize electrons on Ca p&#8208;orbitals through O doping is reported. This results in the asymmetric coordination (N and O) of the atomic Ca sites. Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate the favorable *COOH formation under this asymmetric coordination strategy.








Abstract
Main group single atom catalysts (SACs) are promising for CO2 electroreduction to CO by virtue of their ability in preventing the hydrogen evolution reaction and CO poisoning. Unfortunately, their delocalized orbitals reduce the CO2 activation to *COOH. Herein, an O doping strategy to localize electrons on p&#8208;orbitals through asymmetric coordination of Ca SAC sites (Ca&#8208;N3O) is developed, thus enhancing the CO2 activation. Theoretical calculations indicate that asymmetric coordination of Ca&#8208;N3O improves electron&#8208;localization around Ca sites and thus promotes *COOH formation. X&#8208;ray absorption fine spectroscopy shows the obtained Ca&#8208;N3O features: one O and three N coordinated atoms with one Ca as a reactive site. In situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy proves that Ca&#8208;N3O promotes *COOH formation. As a result, the Ca&#8208;N3O catalyst exhibits a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art turnover frequency of &#8776;15&#160;000 per hour in an H&#8208;cell and a large current density of &#8722;400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) &#8805; 90% in a flow cell. Moreover, Ca&#8208;N3O sites retain a FE above 90% even with a 30% diluted CO2 concentration.

Unfortunately, their delocalized orbitals reduce the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation to *COOH. Herein, an O doping strategy to localize electrons on p-orbitals through asymmetric coordination of Ca SAC sites (Ca-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O) is developed, thus enhancing the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation. Theoretical calculations indicate that asymmetric coordination of Ca-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O improves electron-localization around Ca sites and thus promotes *COOH formation. X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy shows the obtained Ca-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O features: one O and three N coordinated atoms with one Ca as a reactive site. In situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy proves that Ca-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O promotes *COOH formation. As a result, the Ca-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O catalyst exhibits a state-of-the-art turnover frequency of &#8776;15&#160;000 per hour in an H-cell and a large current density of &#8722;400&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) &#8805; 90% in a flow cell. Moreover, Ca-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O sites retain a FE above 90% even with a 30% diluted CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Hierarchical Structured Fiber Device Remodeling the Acidic Tumor Microenvironment for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchically structured fiber device is developed as a local drug delivery system for alleviating the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). It has a great capacity to sustainably remodel the acidic TME, enhancing the antitumor immune response and finally improving the antitumor immunotherapy effect.








Abstract
The acidic microenvironment of tumors significantly reduces the anti&#8208;tumor effect of immunotherapy. Herein, a hierarchically structured fiber device is developed as a local drug delivery system for remodeling the acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) to improve the therapeutic effect of immunotherapy. Proton pump inhibitors in the fiber matrix can be sustainedly released to inhibit the efflux of intracellular H+ from tumor cells, resulting in the remodeling of the acidic TME. The targeted micelles and M1 macrophage membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles in internal cavities of fiber can induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) of tumor cells and phenotypic transformation of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), respectively. The relief of the acidity in the TME further promotes ICD and the polarization of TAMs, alleviating the immunosuppressive microenvironment and synergistically enhancing the antitumor immune response. In vivo results reveal this local drug delivery system restores the pH value of TME from 6.8 to 7.2 and exhibit an excellent immunotherapeutic effect.

         <title>Pollen&#8208;Inspired Adhesive Multi&#8208;Lobe Microparticles from Microfluidics for Intestinal Drug Delivery</title>

Abstract
Microparticles (MPs) based delivery systems have a demonstrated value in gastrointestinal administration. Researches in this area are focusing on developing of multifunctional MPs to improve delivery effects. Herein, learning from the natural morphology of peony pollens, we present novel multi&#8208;lobe MPs delivery systems for target surface adhesion and durable drug release. Ascribing to the flexibility of microfluidic technology and the combination of selective hydrogel degradation methods, MPs with a series of multi&#8208;lobed structures can be obtained using alginate and methacrylated gelatin. Compared with spherical MPs, these multi&#8208;lobe MPs are elucidated to show excellent adhesion capacity due to their enhanced contact area. By encapsulating anti&#8208;inflammatory agent dexamethasone (DXM) into their matrix hydrogel, the resultant multi&#8208;lobe MPs delivery systems are verified to feature durable drug release property and anti&#8208;inflammatory efficacy, which is further demonstrated in rats with inflammatory bowel disease. These results indicated that the biomimetic multi&#8208;lobe MPs are potentially ideal adhesive and durable drug delivery vehicles for gastrointestinal drug administrations.

         <title>Switching of Perpendicular Magnetization by Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Magnetic materials with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are of great interest for the development of nonvolatile magnetic memory and computing technologies due to their high stabilities at the nanoscale. However, electrical switching of such perpendicular magnetization in an energy&#8208;efficient, deterministic, scalable manner has remained a big challenge. This problem has recently attracted enormous efforts in the field of spintronics. Here, we review recent advances and challenges in the understanding of the electrical generation of spin currents, the switching mechanisms and the switching strategies of perpendicular magnetization, the switching current density by spin&#8208;orbit torque of transverse spins, the choice of perpendicular magnetic materials, and summarize the progress in prototype perpendicular SOT memory and logic devices toward the goal of energy&#8208;efficient, dense, fast perpendicular spin&#8208;orbit torque applications.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Solvation towards Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Temperature&#8208;Adaptive Feature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Salt precipitation at temperatures far above the freezing point of solvents is primarily responsible for performance decay of rechargeable batteries at low temperature, yet is still challenged by a lack of in&#8208;depth understanding of the design principle and ultimate solutions. Here, we resolve this via tuning the entropy of solvation in a strong&#8208;solvation (SS) and weak&#8208;solvation (WS) solvent mixture, in which the solvation structure can spontaneously transform at low temperature to avoid the salt precipitation, endowing the electrolyte with a temperature&#8208;adaptive feature. Our results affirm that such temperature&#8208;adaptive electrolyte ensures encouraging low&#8208;temperature performance in a hard carbon||Na2/3Ni1/4Cu1/12Mn2/3O2 full cell with 90.6% capacity retention over 400 cycles at &#8208;40&#8201;&#176;C. We further expand the generality of the concept to construct a series of SS&#8208;WS electrolytes as potential candidates for rechargeable low&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Our work shed lights on the importance of entropy tuning and affords a rational viewpoint on designing low&#8208;temperature electrolytes.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Percolated Networks Enabled by Low Loadings of Branched Nanorods For Enhanced H2 Separations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs) at high loadings are often used in mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) to improve gas separation properties, but they can lead to defects and poor processability that impede membrane fabrication. Herein we demonstrate that branched nanorods (NRs) with controlled aspect ratios can significantly reduce the required loading to achieve superior gas separation properties while maintaining excellent processability, as demonstrated by the dispersion of palladium (Pd) NRs in polybenzimidazole for H2/CO2 separation. Increasing the aspect ratio from 1 for NPs to 40 for NRs decreases the percolation threshold volume fraction by a factor of 30, from 0.35 to 0.011. An MMM with percolated networks formed by Pd NRs at a volume fraction of 0.039 exhibits H2 permeability of 110 Barrer and H2/CO2 selectivity of 31 when challenged with simulated syngas at 200 &#176;C, surpassing Robeson's upper bound. This work highlights the advantage of NRs over NPs and nanowires and shows that right&#8208;sizing nanofillers in MMMs is critical to construct highly sieving pathways at minimal loadings. This work paves the way for this general feature to be applied across materials systems for a variety of chemical separations.

         <title>Inhibition of Tumor Metastasis by Liquid Nitrogen&#8208;Shocked Tumor Cells with Oncolytic Viruses Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite the tumor&#8208;selective lytic efficacy of oncolytic viruses (OVs), their systemic delivery still faces the challenges of limited circulating periods, poor tumor tropism, and spontaneous antiviral immune responses. Herein, we describe a virus&#8208;concealed tumor&#8208;targeting strategy enabling OVs delivery toward lung metastasis via systemic administration. The OVs can actively infect, be internalized, and cloak into tumor cells, then the tumor cells are subsequently treated with liquid nitrogen&#8208;shocking to eliminate the pathogenicity. Such a Trojan Horse&#8208;like vehicle avoids virus neutralization and clearance in the bloodstream and facilitates tumor&#8208;targeted delivery for more than 110&#8208;fold virus enrichment in the tumor metastasis. In addition, this strategy can serve as a tumor vaccine and initiate endogenous adaptive anti&#8208;tumor effects through increasing the memory subtypes of T cells and modulating the tumor immune microenvironment, including reducing the M2 macrophage, downregulating Treg cells and augmenting T cells&#8217; priming.

The OVs can actively infect, be internalized, and cloak into tumor cells, then the tumor cells are subsequently treated with liquid nitrogen-shocking to eliminate the pathogenicity. Such a Trojan Horse-like vehicle avoids virus neutralization and clearance in the bloodstream and facilitates tumor-targeted delivery for more than 110-fold virus enrichment in the tumor metastasis. In addition, this strategy can serve as a tumor vaccine and initiate endogenous adaptive anti-tumor effects through increasing the memory subtypes of T cells and modulating the tumor immune microenvironment, including reducing the M2 macrophage, downregulating Treg cells and augmenting T cells&#8217; priming.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ultrafast, High&#8208;Strain, and Strong Uniaxial Hydrogel Actuators from Recyclable Nanofibril Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Synthetic polymeric hydrogels mimic biological tissues and are suitable for future lifelike machines. However, in polymer hydrogel actuators, actuation is isotropic, so they must be crosslinked or placed in a turgor membrane to achieve high actuation pressures, severely impeding their performance. Here, we show that organizing cellulose nanofibrils in anisotropic fibrillar networks leads to hydrogel sheets with a mechanical in&#8208;plane reinforcement that generates a uniaxial, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane strain with performance far surpassing polymer hydrogels. These fibrillar hydrogel actuators expand uniaxially by 250 times with an initial rate of 100&#8211;150% s&#8722;1, compared to &lt;10 times and &lt;1% s&#8722;1 in directional strain rate for isotropic hydrogels, respectively. The blocking pressure was up to 0.9&#160;MPa, similar to turgor actuators, while the time to reach 90% of the max pressure was 1&#8211;2 minutes, compared to 10 minutes to hours for crosslinked polymers or turgor actuators. We showcase uniaxial actuators that lift objects 120 000 times their weight and soft grippers that grasp objects. In addition, the hydrogels could be recycled without a loss in performance. The uniaxial swelling allowed adding channels through the gel for local solvent delivery, further increasing the actuation rate and cyclability. Thus, fibrillar networks can overcome the major drawbacks of hydrogel actuators and is a significant advancement toward hydrogel&#8208;based lifelike machines.

         <title>Multichannel Single&#8208;Photon Emissions with on&#8208;Demand Momentums by Using Anisotropic Quantum Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photon momentums and controls of them are of importance for carrying quantum information and increasing information capacities. It is a great challenge to freely control multiple momentums of single photons based on only phase&#8208;dependent schemes in isotropic metasurfaces because the exact manipulations of interference phases and precise alignments between quantum emitters and metasurfaces are involved. Here, an anisotropic metasurface, in which anisotropic rather than isotropic nano&#8208;scatterers are arranged anisotropically, is proposed to freely control multiple momentums of single photons. In the metasurfaces, the phase&#8208;independent and phase&#8208;dependent schemes are used to independently control spin angular momentums (SAMs) and linear momentum (LMs), respectively. The phase&#8208;independent scheme allows robust alignment between quantum emitters and metasurfaces. The anisotropic design amends geometrical phases for oblique emissions, providing larger ranges (up to 53&#176;) for tailoring LMs. In experiments, three&#8208;channel single&#8208;photon emissions with independent SAMs and LMs are demonstrated. The introduction of anisotropic nano&#8208;scatterers and anisotropic arrangements of nano&#8208;scatterers is a more general design method for metasurfaces, and it could provide more flexibilities to freely and efficiently tailor single&#8208;photon emissions.

         <title>Designing Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;based Light&#8208;driven Microswimmers towards Therapeutic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
While micromachines with tailored functionalities enable therapeutic applications in biological environments, their controlled motion and targeted drug delivery in biological media require sophisticated designs for practical applications. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a new generation of crystalline and nanoporous polymers, offer new perspectives for light&#8208;driven microswimmers in heterogeneous biological environments including intraocular fluids, thus setting the stage for biomedical applications such as retinal drug delivery. We describe and compare two different types of COFs, uniformly spherical TABP&#8208;PDA&#8208;COF sub&#8208;micron particles and texturally nanoporous, micron&#8208;sized TpAzo&#8208;COF particles as light&#8208;driven microrobots. They can be used as highly efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven drug carriers in aqueous ionic and cellular media. Their absorption ranging down to red light enables phototaxis even in deeper and viscous biological media, while the organic nature of COFs ensures their biocompatibility. Their inherently porous structures with &#8764;2.6&#160; and &#8764;3.4&#160;nm pores, and large surface areas allow for targeted and efficient drug loading even for insoluble drugs, which can be released on demand. Additionally, indocyanine green (ICG) dye loading in the pores enables photoacoustic imaging, optical coherence tomography, and hyperthermia in operando conditions. This real&#8208;time visualization of the drug&#8208;loaded COF microswimmers enables unique insights into the action of photoactive porous drug carriers for therapeutic applications.

         <title>Antisense Oligonucleotides Selectively Enter Human&#8208;derived Antibiotic&#8208;Resistant Bacteria through bacterial&#8208;specific ATP&#8208;binding Cassette Sugar Transporter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Current vehicles used to deliver antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) cannot distinguish between bacterial and mammalian cells, greatly hindering the preclinical or clinical treatment of bacterial infections, especially those caused by antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria. Herein, we leverage the bacteria&#8208;specific ATP&#8208;binding cassette (ABC) sugar transporters to selectively internalize ASOs by hitchhiking them on &#945; (1&#8208;4)&#8208;glucosidically linked glucose polymers. Compared with their cell&#8208;penetrating peptide counterparts, which are non&#8208;specifically engulfed by mammalian and bacterial cells, the presented therapeutics consisting of glucose polymer and antisense peptide nucleic acid&#8208;modified nanoparticles are selectively internalized into the human&#8208;derived multidrug&#8208;resistant Escherichia coli and methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and they display a much higher uptake rate (i.e., 51.6%). The developed strategy allows specific and efficient killing of nearly 100% of the antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria. We also show its significant curative efficacy against bacterial keratitis and endophthalmitis. This strategy will expand the focus of antisense technology to include bacterial cells other than mammalian cells.

         <title>Biomimetic Spun Silk Ionotronic Fibers for Intelligent Discrimination of Motions and Tactile Stimuli</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Innovation in ionotronics field has significantly accelerated the development of ultra&#8208;flexible devices and machines. However, it is still challenging to develop efficient ionotronic&#8208;based fibers with necessary stretchability, resilience, and conductivity due to inherent conflict in producing spinning dopes with both high polymer and ion concentrations and low viscosities. Inspired by the liquid crystalline spinning of animal silk, this study circumvents the inherent tradeoff in other spinning methods by dry spinning a nematic silk microfibril dope solution. The liquid crystalline texture allows the spinning dope to flow through the spinneret and form free&#8208;standing fibers under minimal external forces. The resultant silk sourced ionotronic fibers (SSIFs) are highly stretchable, tough, resilient, and fatigue&#8208;resistant. These mechanical advantages ensure a rapid and recoverable electromechanical response of SSIFs to kinematic deformations. Further, the incorporation of SSIFs into core&#8211;shell triboelectric nanogenerator fibers provides outstanding stable and sensitive triboelectric response to precisely and sensitively perceive small pressures. Moreover, by implementing a combination of machine learning and Internet of Things techniques, the SSIFs could sort objects made of different materials. With these structural, processing, performance, and functional merits, the SSIFs prepared herein are expected to be applied in human&#8211;machine interfaces.

A synergistical optimization of layered architecture on half&#8208;Heusler alloys is demonstrated for high conversion efficiency thermoelectric power generation applications. The (Nb, Hf)FeSb alloy exhibits a superior figure of merit of 1.5 at 973 K.

Abstract
Waste&#8208;heat electricity generation using high&#8208;efficiency solid&#8208;state conversion technology can significantly decrease dependence on fossil fuels. Here, a synergistical optimization of layered half&#8208;Heusler (hH) materials and module to improve thermoelectric conversion efficiency is reported. This is realized by manufacturing multiple thermoelectric materials with major compositional variations and temperature&#8208;gradient&#8208;coupled carrier distribution by one&#8208;step spark plasma sintering. This strategy provides a solution to overcome the intrinsic concomitants of the conventional segmented architecture that only considers the matching of the figure of merit (zT) with the temperature gradient. The current design is dedicated to temperature&#8208;gradient&#8208;coupled resistivity and compatibility matching, optimum zT matching, and reducing contact resistance sources. By enhancing the quality factor of the materials by Sb&#8208;vapor&#8208;pressure&#8208;induced annealing, a superior zT of 1.47 at 973 K is achieved for (Nb, Hf)FeSb hH alloys. Along with the low&#8208;temperature high&#8208;zT hH alloys of (Nb, Ta, Ti, V)FeSb, the single stage layered hH modules are developed with efficiencies of &#8776;15.2% and &#8776;13.5% for the single&#8208;leg and unicouple thermoelectric modules, respectively, under &#916;T of 670 K. Therefore, this work has a transformative impact on the design and development of next&#8208;generation thermoelectric generators for any thermoelectric material families.

         <title>Non&#8208;equilibrium&#8208;Growing Aesthetic Ionic Skin for Fingertip&#8208;Like Strain&#8208;Undisturbed Tactile Sensation and Texture Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the fingertip's formation and modulus&#8208;contrast structure, an aesthetic ionic skin grew using a non&#8208;equilibrium Liesegang patterning process is reported. Ionic skin with periodic stiff ridges embedded in a soft hydrogel matrix enables both strain&#8208;undisturbed dynamic pressure sensing and fine texture recognition. Such a design overcomes the long&#8208;term contradiction encountered by previous ionic skins between structural compliance and pressure sensing accuracy.








Abstract
Humans use periodically ridged fingertips to precisely perceive the characteristics of objects via ion&#8208;based fast&#8208; and slow&#8208;adaptive mechanotransduction. However, designing artificial ionic skins with fingertip&#8208;like tactile capabilities remains challenging because of the contradiction between structural compliance and pressure sensing accuracy (e.g., anti&#8208;interference from stretch and texture recognition). Inspired by the formation and modulus&#8208;contrast hierarchical structure of fingertips, an aesthetic ionic skin grown from a non&#8208;equilibrium Liesegang patterning process is introduced. This ionic skin with periodic stiff ridges embedded in a soft hydrogel matrix enables strain&#8208;undisturbed triboelectric dynamic pressure sensing as well as vibrotactile texture recognition. By coupling with another piezoresistive ionogel, an artificial tactile sensory system is further fabricated as a soft robotic skin to mimic the simultaneous fast&#8208; and slow&#8208;adaptive multimodal sensations of fingers in grasping actions. This approach may inspire the future design of high&#8208;performance ionic tactile sensors for intelligent applications in soft robotics and prosthetics.

         <title>Synergetic Lithium and Hydrogen Bonds Endow Liquid&#8208;Free Photonic Ionic Elastomer with Mechanical Robustness and Electrical/Optical Dual&#8208;Output</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of lithium and hydrogen bonds is introduced into an elastomer to provide liquid&#8208;free photonic ionic elastomers (PIEs) with simultaneous mechanical robustness, satisfied ionic conductivity, and brilliant structure color. The PIEs with mechanical strength up to 4.3 MPa and toughness up to 8.6&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3 demonstrate synchronous electrical/optical dual&#8208;outputs under various harsh conditions.








Abstract
Photonic ionic elastomers (PIEs) capable of multiple signal outputs are intriguing in flexible interactive electronics. However, fabricating PIEs with simultaneous mechanical robustness, good ionic conductivity, and brilliant structure color still remains challenging. Here, the limitations are broken through introducing the synergistic effect of lithium and hydrogen bonds into an elastomer. In virtue of lithium bonding between lithium ions and carbonyl groups in the polymer matrix as well as hydrogen bonding between silanol on the surface of silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) and ether groups along polymer chains, the PIEs demonstrate mechanical strength up to 4.3&#160;MPa and toughness up to 8.6&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3. Meanwhile, the synchronous electrical and optical output under mechanical strains can be achieved in the PIEs with the presence of dissociated ions contributed by lithium bond and non&#8208;close&#8208;packed SiNPs stabilized by the hydrogen bond. Moreover, due to their liquid&#8208;free nature, the PIEs exhibit extraordinary stability and durability, which can withstand extreme conditions including both high and low temperatures as well as high humidity. This work provides a promising molecular engineering route to construct high&#8208;performance photonic ionic conductors toward advanced ionotronic applications.

         <title>Thermally Enhanced and Long Lifetime Red TADF Carbon Dots via Multi&#8208;Confinement and Phosphorescence Assisted Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface engineering strategy is developed to confine carbon dots into a rigid network derived from multiple ionic bonds, which efficiently promote reverse intersystem crossing rate, suppress non&#8208;radiative transition, and stabilize triplet excited states. These results endow carbon dots with unique thermally enhanced TADF luminescence, accompanied by a long lifetime via energy transfer from RTP donor.








Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, which can harvest both singlet and triplet excitons for high&#8208;efficiency emission, have attracted widespread concern for their enormous applications. Nevertheless, luminescence thermal quenching severely limits the efficiency and operating stability in TADF materials and devices at high temperature. Herein, a surface engineering strategy is adopted to obtain unique carbon dots (CDs)&#8208;based thermally enhanced TADF materials with &#8776;250% enhancement from 273 to 343&#160;K via incorporating seed CDs into ionic crystal network. The rigid crystal network can simultaneously boost reverse intersystem crossing process via enhancing spin&#8208;orbit coupling between singlet and triplet states and suppressing non&#8208;radiative transition rate, contributing to the thermally enhanced TADF character. Benefiting from efficient energy transfer from triplet states of phosphorescence center to singlet states of CDs, TADF emission at &#8776;600&#160;nm in CDs displays a long lifetime up to 109.6&#160;ms, outperforming other red organic TADF materials. Thanks to variable decay rates of the delayed emission centers, time and temperature&#8208;dependent delayed emission color has been first realized in CDs&#8208;based delayed emission materials. The CDs with thermally enhanced and time&#8208;/temperature&#8208;dependent emission in one material system can offer new opportunities in information protection and processing.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Industrial&#8208;Grade p&#8208;Type (Bi,Sb)2Te3 Thermoelectric Enabled by a Stepwise Optimization Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The significantly suppressed lattice thermal conductivity &#954;ph and elevated quality factor B have created high&#8208;performance (Bi,Sb)2Te3 material. Most noteworthily, the size and mass of the optimal sample are enlarged to &#216;40 mm&#8208;200 g (industrial grade) with only &#8776;5% loss of thermoelectric (TE) performance, the resulting 17&#8208;couple TE modules exhibit an excellent conversion efficiency up to 6.3% (&#916;T&#160;= 245 K).








Abstract
As the sole dominator of the commercial thermoelectric (TE) market, Bi2Te3&#8208;based alloys play an irreplaceable role in Peltier cooling and low&#8208;grade waste heat recovery. Herein, to improve the relative low TE efficiency determined by the figure of merit ZT, an effective approach is reported for improving the TE performance of p&#8208;type (Bi,Sb)2Te3 by incorporating Ag8GeTe6 and Se. Specifically, the diffused Ag and Ge atoms into the matrix conduce to optimized carrier concentration and enlarge the density&#8208;of&#8208;states effective mass while the Sb&#8208;rich nanoprecipitates generate coherent interfaces with little loss of carrier mobility. The subsequent Se dopants introduce multiple phonon scattering sources and significantly suppress the lattice thermal conductivity while maintaining a decent power factor. Consequently, a high peak ZT of 1.53 at 350 K and a remarkable average ZT of 1.31 (300&#8211;500 K) are attained in the Bi0.4Sb1.6Te0.95Se0.05&#160;+ 0.10 wt% Ag8GeTe6 sample. Most noteworthily, the size and mass of the optimal sample are enlarged to &#216;40 mm&#8208;200&#160;g and the constructed 17&#8208;couple TE module exhibits an extraordinary conversion efficiency of 6.3% at &#916;T&#160;= 245 K. This work demonstrates a facile method to develop high&#8208;performance and industrial&#8208;grade (Bi,Sb)2Te3&#8208;based alloys, which paves a strong way for further practical applications.

Consequently, a high peak &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt; of 1.53 at 350 K and a remarkable average &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt; of 1.31 (300&#8211;500 K) are attained in the Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;1.6&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;0.95&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;+ 0.10 wt% Ag&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; sample. Most noteworthily, the size and mass of the optimal sample are enlarged to &lt;i&gt;&#216;&lt;/i&gt;40 mm-200&#160;g and the constructed 17-couple TE module exhibits an extraordinary conversion efficiency of 6.3% at &#916;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&#160;= 245 K. This work demonstrates a facile method to develop high-performance and industrial-grade (Bi,Sb)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based alloys, which paves a strong way for further practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Realizing the Heteromorphic Superlattice: Repeated Heterolayers of Amorphous Insulator and Polycrystalline Semiconductor with Minimal Interface Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superlattices represent the epitome of combinatorial materials science: their properties can transcend those of their constituent layers, such as improved mobility with modulation doped structures. Here superlattice combinations are expanded into the morphological domain by introducing direct growth of alternating amorphous and polycrystalline layers, realizing a high&#8208;quality, high mobility &#8220;heteromorphic superlattice,&#8221; originally conceived by Raphael Tsu in 1989.








Abstract
An unconventional &#8220;heteromorphic&#8221; superlattice (HSL) is realized, comprised of repeated layers of different materials with differing morphologies: semiconducting pc&#8208;In2O3 layers interleaved with insulating a&#8208;MoO3 layers. Originally proposed by Tsu in 1989, yet never fully realized, the high quality of the HSL heterostructure demonstrated here validates the intuition of Tsu, whereby the flexibility of the bond angle in the amorphous phase and the passivation effect of the oxide at interfacial bonds serve to create smooth, high&#8208;mobility interfaces. The alternating amorphous layers prevent strain accumulation in the polycrystalline layers while suppressing defect propagation across the HSL. For the HSL with 7:7&#160;nm layer thickness, the observed electron mobility of 71 cm2&#160;Vs&#8208;1, matches that of the highest quality In2O3 thin films. The atomic structure and electronic properties of crystalline In2O3/amorphous MoO3 interfaces are verified using ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations and hybrid functional calculations. This work generalizes the superlattice concept to an entirely new paradigm of morphological combinations.

         <title>Alloying of Cu with Ru Enabling the Relay Catalysis for Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Converting NO3&#8722; to NH3 with renewable energy is of great practical significance to balance the environmental problems and economic benefits. Ru1Cu10 alloy exhibits high activity for direct reduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3 under an ultralow potential due to a relay effect on Cu (NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722;) and Ru (NO2&#8722; to NH3) sites.








Abstract
Involving eight electron transfer process and multiple intermediates of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction reaction leads to a sluggish kinetic and low Faradaic efficiency, therefore, it is essential to get an insight into the reaction mechanism to develop highly efficient electrocatalyst. Herein, a series of reduced&#8208;graphene&#8208;oxide&#8208;supported RuCu alloy catalysts (RuxCux/rGO) are fabricated and used for the direct reduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3. It is found that the Ru1Cu10/rGO shows the ammonia formation rate of 0.38&#160;mmol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 (loading 1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and the ammonia Faradaic efficiency of 98% under an ultralow potential of &#8722;0.05&#160;V versus Reversible Hydrogen Electode (RHE), which is comparable to Ru catalyst. The highly efficient activity of Ru1Cu10/rGO can be attributed to the synergetic effect between Ru and Cu sites via a relay catalysis, in which the Cu shows the exclusively efficient activity for the reduction of NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722; and Ru exhibits the superior activity for NO2&#8722; to NH3. In addition, the doping of Ru into Cu tunes the d&#8208;band center of alloy and effectively modulates the adsorption energy of the NO3&#8722; and NO2&#8722;, which promotes the direct reduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3. This synergetic electrocatalysis strategy opens a new avenue for developing highly efficient multifunctional catalysts.

         <title>Horizontal and Vertical Coalescent Microrobotic Collectives Using Ferrofluid Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Many artificial miniature robotic collectives have been developed by emulating collective biological behaviors to overcome the inherent limitations of inadequate individual capabilities. However, the basic building blocks of the reported collectives are mainly in the solid state, where the morphological boundaries of internal individuals are clear and cannot genuinely merge. Miniature robotic collectives based on liquid units still need to be explored; such on&#8208;demand mergeable swarm systems are advantageous for adapting to the changing external environment. Here, we&#160;present a strategy to achieve a coalescent collective system that exploits the ferrofluid droplets' splitting and coalescence properties to trigger the formation of horizontal multimodal and vertical gravity&#8208;resistant collectives and unveil pattern&#8208;enabled robotic functionalities. When subjected to a time&#8208;varying magnetic field, the droplet swarm exhibits a variety of morphologies ranging from horizontal collectives, including vortex&#8208;like, chain&#8208;like, and crystal&#8208;like patterns to vertical layer&#8208;upon&#8208;layer patterns. Using experiments and simulations, we&#160;show the formation and transformation of different morphological collectives and demonstrate their robust environmental adaptability. Potential applications of the multimodal droplet collectives are presented, including exploring an unknown environment, targeted object delivery, and fluid flow filtration in a lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip. This work may facilitate the design of microrobotic swarm systems and expand the range of materials for miniature&#160;robots.

         <title>Rational Design of PDI&#8208;based Linear Conjugated Polymers for Highly Effective And Long&#8208;term Photocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Constructed through relatively weak noncovalent forces, the stability of organic supramolecular materials has shown to be a challenge. Herein, designing of linear conjugated polymer is proposed through creating chain polymer connected via bridging covalent bonds in one direction and retaining &#960;&#8722;stacked aromatic columns in its orthogonal direction. Specifically, three analogues of linear conjugated polymers through tuning aromatic core and its covalently linked moiety (bridging group) within the building block monomer were prepared. Cooperatively supported by strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions from the extended aromatic core of perylene and favorable dipole&#8208;dipole interactions from bridging group, the as&#8208;expected high crystallinity, wide light absorption and increased stability was successfully achieved for Oxamide&#8208;PDI through ordered molecular arrangement, and presented a remarkable full&#8208;spectrum oxygen evolution rate of 5110.25&#160;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 without any cocatalyst. Notably, experimental and theoretical studies revealed that large internal dipole moments within Oxamide&#8208;PDI DFT together with its ordered crystalline structure enabled a robust built&#8208;in electric field for efficient charge carrier migration and separation. Moreover, DFT calculations also revealed oxidative sites located at carbon atoms next to imide bonds and inner bay positions based on proved spatially separated photogenerated electrons and holes, thus resulting in highly efficient water photolysis into oxygen.

         <title>Surface Chemistry of Biologically&#8208;Active Reducible Oxide Nanozymes</title>

Abstract
Reducible metal oxide nanozymes (rNZs) have been a subject of intense recent interest due to their catalytic nature, ease of synthesis, and complex surface character. Such materials contain surface sites which facilitate enzyme&#8208;mimetic reactions via substrate coordination and redox cycling. Further, these surface reactive sites have been shown to be highly sensitive to stresses within the nanomaterial lattice, the physicochemical environment, and to processing conditions occurring as part of their syntheses. When administered in vivo, a complex protein corona binds to the surface, redefining its biological identity and subsequent interactions within the biological system. Catalytic activities of rNZs each deliver a differing impact on protein corona formation, its composition, and in turn, their recognition, and internalization by host cells. Improving our understanding of the precise principles that dominate rNZ surface&#8208;biomolecule adsorption raises the question of whether designer rNZs can be engineered to prevent corona formation, or indeed to produce &#8220;custom&#8221; protein coronas applied either in vitro, and pre&#8208;administration, or formed immediately upon their exposure to body fluids. Here, we consider fundamental surface chemistry processes and their implications in rNZ material performance. In particular, we discuss material structures which inform component adsorption from the application environment, including substrates for enzyme&#8208;mimetic reactions.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetism in 2D MnGa4&#8208;H Induced by Hydrogen Insertion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition method is developed to construct the 2D room&#8208;temperature magnetic MnGa4&#8208;H crystal. Hydrogen insertion inside the MnGa4 lattice can modulate the atomic distance and charge state, thereby ferrimagnetism can be achieved without destroying the structural configuration. 2D MnGa4&#8208;H is high&#8208;quality and air&#8208;stable, demonstrating robust and stable room&#8208;temperature magnetism with a high Curie temperature above 620&#160;K.








Abstract
2D room&#8208;temperature magnetic materials are of great importance in future spintronic devices while only very few are reported. Herein, a plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition approach is exploited to construct the 2D room&#8208;temperature magnetic MnGa4&#8208;H single crystal with a thickness down to 2.2&#160;nm. The employment of H2 plasma makes hydrogen atoms can be easily inserted into the MnGa4 lattice to modulate the atomic distance and charge state, thereby ferrimagnetism can be achieved without destroying the structural configuration. The as&#8208;obtained 2D MnGa4&#8208;H crystal is high&#8208;quality, air&#8208;stable, and thermo&#8208;stable, demonstrating robust and stable room&#8208;temperature magnetism with a high Curie temperature above 620&#160;K. This work enriches the 2D room&#8208;temperature magnetic family and opens up the possibility for the development of spintronic devices based on 2D magnetic alloys.

         <title>Tough, Recyclable, and Degradable Elastomers for Potential Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve sustainable development, the preparation of novel elastomers that are concurrently tough, recyclable, and degradable is highly desirable. In this work, a polycaprolactone&#8208;based polyurethane elastomer is carefully designed and developed with excellent mechanical properties and biocompatibility, which shows great potential for biomedical applications.








Abstract
Elastomers have many industrial, medical and commercial applications, however, their huge demand raises an important question of how to dispose of the out&#8208;of&#8208;service elastomers. Ideal elastomers that are concurrently tough, recyclable, and degradable are in urgent need, but their preparation remains a rigorous challenge. Herein, a polycaprolactone (PCL) based polyurethane elastomer is designed and prepared to meet this demand. Owing to the presence of dynamic coordination bond and the occurrence of strain&#8208;induced crystallization, the obtained elastomer exhibits a high toughness of &#8776;372&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3 and an unprecedented fracture energy of &#8776;646&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;2, which is much higher than natural rubber (&#8776;50&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3 for toughness and &#8776;10&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;2 for fracture energy). In addition, the elastomer can be recycled at least three times using solvent without losing its mechanical properties and can be degraded by lipase in &#8776;2 months. Finally, biological experiments demonstrate that the elastomer possesses good biocompatibility and can facilitate wound healing in mice when used as sutures. It is believed that the obtained elastomer meets the requirements for next&#8208;generation elastomers and is expected to be used in emerging fields such as biomedicine, flexible electronics, robotics and beyond.

         <title>Lipid Deposition Profiles Influence Foreign Body Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fibrosis remains a significant cause of failure in implanted biomedical devices, and factors that affect it are still being discovered. Here, it is demonstrated through Time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF&#8208;SIMS), RNA sequencing, and other biological analyses that the surface chemistry of an implant guides lipid deposition, which in turn affects the fibrotic response by influencing the reactions of immune cells to the material.








Abstract
Fibrosis remains a significant cause of failure in implanted biomedical devices and early absorption of proteins on implant surfaces has been shown to be a key instigating factor. However, lipids can also regulate immune activity and their presence may also contribute to biomaterial&#8208;induced foreign body responses (FBR) and fibrosis. Here it is demonstrated that the surface presentation of lipids on implant affects FBR by influencing reactions of immune cells to materials as well as their resultant inflammatory/suppressive polarization. Time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF&#8208;SIMS) is employed to characterize lipid deposition on implants that are surface&#8208;modified chemically with immunomodulatory small molecules. Multiple immunosuppressive phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin) are all found to deposit preferentially on implants with anti&#8208;FBR surface modifications in mice. Significantly, a set of 11 fatty acids is enriched on unmodified implanted devices that failed in both mice and humans, highlighting relevance across species. Phospholipid deposition is also found to upregulate the transcription of anti&#8208;inflammatory genes in murine macrophages, while fatty acid deposition stimulated the expression of pro&#8208;inflammatory genes. These results provide further insights into how to improve the design of biomaterials and medical devices to mitigate biomaterial material&#8208;induced FBR and fibrosis.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Incorporated Mg&#8208;Ion Solvation Modulation Enables Fast Magnesium Storage Kinetics of Conversion&#8208;Type Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of the trifluoromethanesulfonate anion in the Mg&#8208;ion solvation structure of the borate&#8208;based Mg&#8208;ion electrolyte enables the fast magnesium storage kinetics of the conversion&#8208;type cathode materials. The as&#8208;prepared copper selenide cathode achieved a more than twofold capacity increase at a high rate and the highest reversible capacities compared to those of the previously reported metal selenide cathodes.








Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMB) have emerged as one of the most promising alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to the prominent advantages of magnesium metal anodes. Nevertheless, their application is hindered by sluggish Mg&#8208;ion storage kinetics in cathodes, although various structural modifications of cathode materials have been performed. Herein, an electrolyte design using an anion&#8208;incorporated Mg&#8208;ion solvation structure is developed to promote the Mg&#8208;ion storage reactions of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials. The addition of the trifluoromethanesulfonate anion (OTf&#8722;) in the ether&#8208;based Mg&#8208;ion electrolyte modulates the solvation structure of Mg2+ from [Mg(DME)3]2+ to [Mg(DME)2.5OTf]+ (DME = dimethoxy ethane), which facilitates Mg&#8208;ion desolvation and thus significantly expedites the charge transfer of the cathode material. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared CuSe cathode material on copper current collector exhibits a considerable increase in magnesium storage capacity from 61% (228 mAh g&#8208;1) to 95% (357 mAh g&#8208;1) of the theoretical capacity at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 and a more than twofold capacity increase at a high current density of 1.0 A g&#8208;1. This work provides an efficient strategy via electrolyte modulation to achieve high&#8208;rate conversion&#8208;type cathode materials for RMBs. The incorporation of the trifluoromethanesulfonate anion in the Mg&#8208;ion solvation structure of the borate&#8208;based Mg&#8208;ion electrolyte enables the fast magnesium storage kinetics of the conversion&#8208;type cathode materials.

The as-prepared copper selenide cathode achieved a more than twofold capacity increase at a high rate and the highest reversible capacities compared to those of the previously reported metal selenide cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Like Conjugated Molecule as Hole&#8208;Selective Contact for Operationally Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photostable graphene&#8208;like conjugated molecule is developed as the hole&#8208;selective contact to improve the operational lifetime of inverted perovskite solar cells, enabling an estimated device operational lifetime of over 3000&#160;h.








Abstract
Further enhancing the operational lifetime of inverted&#8208;structure perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is crucial for their commercialization, and the design of hole&#8208;selective contacts at the illumination side plays a key role in operational stability. In this work, the self&#8208;anchoring benzo[rst]pentaphene (SA&#8208;BPP) is developed as a new type of hole&#8208;selective contact toward long&#8208;term operationally stable inverted PSCs. The SA&#8208;BPP molecule with a graphene&#8208;like conjugated structure shows a higher photostability and mobility than that of the frequently&#8208;used triphenylamine and carbazole&#8208;based hole&#8208;selective molecules. Besides, the anchoring groups of SA&#8208;BPP promote the formation of a large&#8208;scale uniform hole contact on ITO substrate and efficiently passivate the perovskite absorbers. Benefiting from these merits, the champion efficiencies of 22.03% for the small&#8208;sized cells and 17.08% for 5&#160;&#215;&#160;5&#160;cm2 solar modules on an aperture area of 22.4&#160;cm2 are achieved based on this SA&#8208;BPP contact. Also, the SA&#8208;BPP&#8208;based device exhibits promising operational stability, with an efficiency retention of 87.4% after 2000&#160;h continuous operation at the maximum power point under simulated 1&#8208;sun illumination, which indicates an estimated T80 lifetime of 3175&#160;h. This novel design concept of hole&#8208;selective contacts provides a promising strategy for further improving the PSC stability.

         <title>An Edible Rechargeable Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By immobilizing on activated carbon, a widespread food additive, riboflavin (anode) and quercetin (cathode), common food ingredients and dietary supplements, a rechargeable edible battery is demonstrated. An acqueous electrolyte, a nori algae separator and a beeswax encapsulation complete the cell, which can operate at 0.65&#160;V.








Abstract
Edible electronics is a growing field that aims to produce digestible devices using only food ingredients and additives, thus addressing many of the shortcomings of ingestible electronic devices. Edible electronic devices will have major implications for gastrointestinal tract monitoring, therapeutics, as well as rapid food quality monitoring. Recent research has demonstrated the feasibility of edible circuits and sensors, but to realize fully edible electronic devices edible power sources are required, of which there have been very few examples. Drawing inspiration from living organisms, which use redox cofactors to power biochemical machines, a rechargeable edible battery formed from materials eaten in everyday life is developed. The battery is realized by immobilizing riboflavin and quercetin, common food ingredients and dietary supplements, on activated carbon, a widespread food additive. Riboflavin is used as the anode, while quercetin is used as the cathode. By encapsulating the electrodes in beeswax, a fully edible battery is fabricated capable of supplying power to small electronic devices. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept battery cell operated at 0.65&#160;V, sustaining a current of 48&#160;&#181;A for 12&#160;min. The presented proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept will open the doors to new edible electronic applications, enabling safer and easier medical diagnostics, treatments, and unexplored ways to monitor food quality.

         <title>Realizing Photoswitchable Mechanoluminescence in Organic Crystals Based on Photochromism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manipulation of mechanoluminescence in organic molecules has tremendous application potential in many fields. Here an example is successfully developed to realize photoswitchable mechanoluminescence byendowing reversible photochromic properties to organic mechanoluminescent molecule. It provides a suggestive molecular designing strategy to achieve novel smart luminescent materials toward widespread applications in material science fields.








Abstract
Organic mechanoluminescent (ML) materials possessing photophysical properties that are sensitive to multiple external stimuli have shown great potential in many fields, including optic and sensing. Particularly, the photoswitchable ML property for these materials is fundamental to their applications but remains a formidable challenge. Herein, photoswitchable ML is successfully realized by endowing reversible photochromic properties to an ML molecule, namely 2&#8208;(1,2,2&#8208;triphenylvinyl) fluoropyridine (o&#8208;TPF). o&#8208;TPF shows both high&#8208;contrast photochromism with a distinct color change from white to purplish red, as well as bright blue ML (&#955;ML&#160;= 453&#160;nm). The ML property can be repeatedly switched between ON and OFF states under alternate UV and visible light irradiation. Impressively, the photoswitchable ML is of high stability and repeatability. The ML can be reversibly switched on and off by conducting alternate UV and visible light irradiation in cycles under ambient conditions. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the change of dipole moment of o&#8208;TPF during the photochromic process is responsible for the photoswitchable ML. These results outline a fundamental strategy to achieve for the control of organic ML and pave the way to the development of expanded smart luminescent materials and their applications.

         <title>Ultrathin Nitride Ferroic Memory with Large ON/OFF Ratios for Analog In&#8208;memory Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric and analog resistive switching in an ultrathin, epitaxial nitride ferroelectric heterostructure is demonstrated, showing high ON/OFF ratios, high uniformity, and good retention that enables multistate operation and linear analog computing with high accuracy. The results pave the way for constructing advanced memory/computing architectures based on emerging nitride ferroelectrics and promote homo and hybrid integrated functional edge devices beyond silicon.








Abstract
Computing in the analog regime using nonlinear ferroelectric resistive memory arrays can potentially alleviate the energy constraints and complexity/footprint challenges imposed by digital von Neumann systems. Yet the current ferroelectric resistive memories suffer from either low ON/OFF ratios/imprint or limited compatibility with mainstream semiconductors. Here, for the first time, ferroelectric and analog resistive switching in an epitaxial nitride heterojunction comprising ultrathin (&#8776;5&#160;nm) nitride ferroelectrics, i.e., ScAlN, with potentiality to bridge the gap between performance and compatibility is demonstrated. High ON/OFF ratios (up to 105), high uniformity, good retention, (&lt;20% variation after &gt;&#160;105&#160;s) and cycling endurance (&gt;104) are simultaneously demonstrated in a metal/oxide/nitride ferroelectric junction. It is further demonstrated that the memristor can provide programmability to enable multistate operation and linear analogue computing as well as image processing with high accuracy. Neural network simulations based on the weight update characteristics of the nitride memory yielded an image recognition accuracy of 92.9% (baseline 96.2%) on the images from Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology. The non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;level programmability and analog computing capability provide first&#8208;hand and landmark evidence for constructing advanced memory/computing architectures based on emerging nitride ferroelectrics, and promote homo and hybrid integrated functional edge devices beyond silicon.

         <title>Selective CO2 Electroreduction from Tuneable Naphthalene&#8208;Based Porous Polyimide Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here the developed Bristol&#8211;X'an&#8208;Jiatong (BXJ) method is utilized to tune the porosity properties of crosslinked polyimides (pPIs) to optimize CO2 capture. Once optimized, these pPIs are exploited as metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 to formate and methanol. High Faradaic efficiencies (up to 91%) and selective reduction products are achieved via tuning of the porosity properties and surface areas.








Abstract
A series of porous polyimides (pPIs) are synthesized, and their surface areas and pore sizes are optimized by the previously reported Bristol&#8211;X'an&#8208;Jiatong (BXJ) approach.&#160;How&#160;this approach can be used to tune and optimize the porous network properties to target and tune their ability to capture CO2 is demonstrated. Once optimized, these porous organic frameworks are utilized, for the first time, as electrocatalysts for the conversion of CO2. The excellent Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) for the conversion of CO2 to formate (91%) and methanol (85%) present exciting opportunities for the metal&#8208;free generation of useful fuels and feedstocks from CO2. In addition, the ability to directly address and select the conversion products through tuning of the porous materials&#8217; properties highlights the potential of this approach, and more generally for a wide range of organic frameworks as future metal&#8208;free CO2 reduction catalysts.

     alt="Selective CO2 Electroreduction from Tuneable Naphthalene-Based Porous Polyimide Networks"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the developed Bristol&#8211;X'an-Jiatong (BXJ) method is utilized to tune the porosity properties of crosslinked polyimides (pPIs) to optimize CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture. Once optimized, these pPIs are exploited as metal-free electrocatalysts for the reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to formate and methanol. High Faradaic efficiencies (up to 91%) and selective reduction products are achieved via tuning of the porosity properties and surface areas.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of porous polyimides (pPIs) are synthesized, and their surface areas and pore sizes are optimized by the previously reported Bristol&#8211;X'an-Jiatong (BXJ) approach.&#160;How&#160;this approach can be used to tune and optimize the porous network properties to target and tune their ability to capture CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is demonstrated. Once optimized, these porous organic frameworks are utilized, for the first time, as electrocatalysts for the conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The excellent Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) for the conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to formate (91%) and methanol (85%) present exciting opportunities for the metal-free generation of useful fuels and feedstocks from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In addition, the ability to directly address and select the conversion products through tuning of the porous materials&#8217; properties highlights the potential of this approach, and more generally for a wide range of organic frameworks as future metal-free CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thermal Management in Neuromorphic Materials, Devices, and Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current state of thermal management of neuromorphic computing technology is described and the challenges and opportunities of energy efficient implementation of neuromorphic devices are addressed. The fundamental features of the brain's thermal regulation and their further physical implementation are discussed. It is believed that the underlined importance of thermal management of neuromorphic computing technology will guide researchers in this field.








Abstract
Machine learning has experienced unprecedented growth in recent years, often referred to as an &#8220;artificial intelligence revolution.&#8221; Biological systems inspire the fundamental approach for this new computing paradigm: using neural networks to classify large amounts of data into sorting categories. Current machine&#8208;learning schemes implement simulated neurons and synapses on standard computers based on a von Neumann architecture. This approach is inefficient in energy consumption, and thermal management, motivating the search for hardware&#8208;based systems that imitate the brain. Here, the present state of thermal management of neuromorphic computing technology and the challenges and opportunities of the energy&#8208;efficient implementation of neuromorphic devices are considered. The main features of brain&#8208;inspired computing and quantum materials for implementing neuromorphic devices are briefly described, the brain criticality and resistive switching&#8208;based neuromorphic devices are discussed, the energy and electrical considerations for spiking&#8208;based computation are presented, the fundamental features of the brain's thermal regulation are addressed, the physical mechanisms for thermal management and thermoelectric control of materials and neuromorphic devices are analyzed, and challenges and new avenues for implementing energy&#8208;efficient computing are described.

         <title>True Nonvolatile High&#8208;speed DRAM Cells Using Tailored Ultrathin IGZO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nonvolatile dynamic random access memory (DRAM) using an optimized indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IGZO) transistor with record&#8208;high threshold voltage beyond 1.78&#160;V and on&#8208;current &gt;40&#160;&#181;A &#181;m&#8722;1 is demonstrated for the first time. The DRAM shows a record retention time exceeding 25 h with an ultra&#8208;fast write speed of 10&#160;ns under power interruption, along with a 3&#8208;bit multilevel operation with a wide margin and excellent linearity.








Abstract
Severe power consumption in the continuous scaling of Silicon&#8208;based dynamic random access memory (DRAM) technology quests for a transistor technology with a much lower off&#8208;state leakage current. Wide bandgap amorphous oxide semiconductors, especially indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IGZO)&#160;exhibit many orders of magnitude lower off&#8208;state leakage. However, they are typically heavily n&#8208;doped and require negative gate voltage to turn off, which prevents them from true nonvolatile operation. The efforts on doping density reduction typically result in mobility degradation and high Schottky barriers at contacts, causing severe degradation of on&#8208;current and operation speed of the DRAM cells. Here, high&#8208;speed true nonvolatile DRAM cells are successfully demonstrated by deep suppression of doping density in the IGZO channel using in situ oxygen ion beam treatment and ohmic contact engineering by inserting a thin In&#8208;rich indium&#8208;tin&#8208;oxide (ITO) at contact regions. A record high on&#8208;current of 40&#160;&#181;A &#181;m&#8722;1&#160;at a large positive threshold voltage of 1.78&#160;V enables the first true nonvolatile DRAM with the fastest write speed of 10&#160;ns and data retention up to 25 h under power interruption, five orders of magnitude higher than the previously projected values.

         <title>Duplex Responsive Nanoplatform with Cascade Targeting for Atherosclerosis Photoacoustic Diagnosis and Multichannel Combination Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theranostic nanoplatform PA/ASePSD is constructed with atherosclerosis&#8208;targeting accumulation and pH/ROS dual&#8208;responsiveness, which indicates a plaque&#8208;specific photoacoustic diagnosis and a &#8220;three&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; therapeutic strategy of combined multi&#8208;channel mediated lipid management via reducing lipid uptake, enhancing lipid efflux and anti&#8208;inflammation. PA/ASePSD provides a candidate for the diagnosis of early&#8208;stage plaques and the inhibition of atherosclerosis progression.








Abstract
The culprits of atherosclerosis are endothelial damage, local disorders of lipid metabolism, and progressive inflammation. Early atherosclerosis is typically difficult to diagnose in time due to the lack of obvious symptoms, thus missing the best period of treatment. In this work, a &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer (PMeTPP&#8208;MBT) based on 3,6&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;bis(2&#8208;octyldodecyl)pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;1,4(2H,5H)&#8208;dione is designed as a novel photoacoustic contrast agent. On this basis, an intelligent responsive theranostic nanoplatform (PA/ASePSD) combining astaxanthin and SS&#8208;31 peptide and loading with PMeTPP&#8208;MBT is developed. The high affinity between the dextran shell with the broken endothelial surface VCAM&#8208;1 and CD44 confers active targeting of PA/ASePSD to atherosclerotic lesions. High levels of ROS in the acidic plaque microenvironment act as an intelligent cascade switch to achieve controlled release of astaxanthin, SS&#8208;31 peptide, and PMeTPP&#8208;MBT for non&#8208;invasive photoacoustic diagnosis, as well as plaque inhibition mediated by anti&#8208;inflammation and multichannel regulation (including ABCA1, ABCG1, CD36, and LOX&#8208;1) of lipid metabolism. Both in vitro and in vivo evaluations confirm the impressive anti&#8208;atherosclerotic capability and the accurate photoacoustic diagnosis of PA/ASePSD nanoparticles, thus promising a candidate for early&#8208;stage atherosclerosis theranostics.

         <title>Supporting Trimetallic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks on S/N&#8208;Doped Carbon Macroporous Fibers for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trimetallic metal&#8208;organic frameworks supported over the hollow S/N&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (S/N&#8208;CMF@FexCoyNi1&#8208;x&#8208;y&#8208;MOF) are prepared as a promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefiting from the trimetallic composition with improved intrinsic activity, hollow S/N&#8208;CMF matrix facilitating active sites exposure, as well as their robust integration, the resultant S/N&#8208;CMF@FexCoyNi1&#8208;x&#8208;y&#8208;MOF electrocatalyst delivers excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 296&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, a Tafel slope of 53.5&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1, and outstanding durability.








Abstract
Hybrid materials, integrating the merits of individual components, are ideal structures for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the rational construction of hybrid structures with decent physical/electrochemical properties is yet challenging. Herein, a promising OER electrocatalyst composed of trimetallic metal&#8208;organic frameworks supported over S/N&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (S/N&#8208;CMF@FexCoyNi1&#8208;x&#8208;y&#8208;MOF) via a cation&#8208;exchange strategy is delicately fabricated. Benefiting from the trimetallic composition with improved intrinsic activity, hollow S/N&#8208;CMF matrix facilitating exposure of active sites, as well as their robust integration, the resultant S/N&#8208;CMF@FexCoyNi1&#8208;x&#8208;y&#8208;MOF electrocatalyst delivers outstanding activity and stability for alkaline OER. Specifically, it needs an overpotential of 296&#160;mV to reach the benchmark current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a small Tafel slope of 53.5&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1. In combination with X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, the post&#8208;formed Fe/Co&#8208;doped &#947;&#8208;NiOOH during the OER operation is revealed to account for the high OER performance of S/N&#8208;CMF@FexCoyNi1&#8208;x&#8208;y&#8208;MOF.

In combination with X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, the post-formed Fe/Co-doped &#947;-NiOOH during the OER operation is revealed to account for the high OER performance of S/N-CMF@Fe&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;1-x-y&lt;/sub&gt;-MOF.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anti&#8208;Quenching NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;Aggregates of Benzo[c]thiophene Fluorophore for Highly Efficient Bioimaging and Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bright benzo[c]thiophene J&#8208;aggregate with anti&#8208;quenching property is developed. The J&#8208;type nanoparticles (NPs) are featured with large Stokes shift of 402 nm. After forming aggregates in aqueous milieu, the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence intensity is enhanced &#8776;26 folds due to aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect. The bright J&#8208;type AIE NPs are used to conduct whole&#8208;body blood vessel NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and cancer phototheranostics.








Abstract
Molecular fluorophores with the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emission hold great potential for deep&#8208;tissue bioimaging owing to their excellent biocompatibility and high resolution. Recently, J&#8208;aggregates are used to construct long&#8208;wavelength NIR&#8208;II emitters as their optical bands show remarkable red shifts upon forming water&#8208;dispersible nano&#8208;aggregates. However, their wide applications in the NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging are impeded by the limited varieties of J&#8208;type backbone and serious fluorescence quenching. Herein, a bright benzo[c]thiophene (BT) J&#8208;aggregate fluorophore (BT6) with anti&#8208;quenching effect is reported for highly efficient NIR&#8208;II bioimaging and phototheranostics. The BT fluorophores are manipulated to have Stokes shift over 400&#160;nm and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property for conquering the self&#8208;quenching issue of the J&#8208;type fluorophores. Upon forming BT6 assemblies in an aqueous environment, the absorption over 800&#160;nm and NIR&#8208;II emission over 1000&#160;nm are boosted for more than 41 and 26 folds, respectively. In vivo visualization of the whole&#8208;body blood vessel and imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy results verify that BT6 NPs are excellent agent for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and cancer phototheranostics. This work develops a strategy to construct bright NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates with precisely manipulated anti&#8208;quenching properties for highly efficient biomedical applications.

         <title>Liquid Metal Droplets&#8208;Based Elastomers from Electric Toothbrush&#8208;Inspired Revolving Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the working principle of electric toothbrushes, a novel revolving microfluidic technology for the generation of liquid metal (LM) droplets is presented. The resultant LM droplets exhibit controllable size and are produced in high&#8208;throughput. The droplets act as conductive fillers for the construction of flexible electronics directly. The obtained LM droplets&#8208;based elastomers show potential prospects in flexible electronics&#8208;relevant applications.








Abstract
Liquid metal (LM)&#8208;based elastomers have a demonstrated value in flexible electronics. Attempts in this area include the development of multifunctional LM&#8208;based elastomers with controllable morphology, superior mechanical performances, and great stability. Herein, inspired by the working principle of electric toothbrushes, a revolving microfluidic system is presented for the generation of LM droplets and construction of desired elastomers. The system involves revolving modules assembled by a needles array and 3D microfluidic channels. LM droplets can be generated with controllable size in a high&#8208;throughput manner due to the revolving motion&#8208;derived drag force. It is demonstrated that by employing a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) matrix as the collection phase, the generated LM droplets can act as conductive fillers for the construction of flexible electronics directly. The resultant LM droplets&#8208;based elastomers exhibit high mechanical strength, stable electrical performance, as well as superior self&#8208;healing property benefiting from the dynamic exchangeable urea bond of the polymer matrix. Notably, due to the flexible programmable feature of the LM droplets embedded within the elastomers, various patterned LM droplets&#8208;based elastomers can be easily achieved. These results indicate that the proposed microfluidic LM droplets&#8208;based elastomers have a great potential for promoting the development of flexible electronics.

         <title>High Performance Transparent Silver Grid Electrodes for Organic Photovoltaics Fabricated by Selective Metal Condensation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance silver grid electrodes on glass and plastic substrates fabricate by condensation coefficient modulation, using a perfluorinated polymer shown to be far superior to other compounds used for this purpose to date. The very narrow line width and small pitch open the door to using these electrodes in OPVs without a PEDOT: PSS layer to span the gaps between grid lines.








Abstract
Silver grid electrodes on glass and flexible plastic substrates with performance that exceeds that of commercial indium&#8208;tin oxide (ITO) coated glass are reported and show their suitability as a drop&#8208;in replacement for ITO glass in solution&#8208;processed organic photovoltaics (OPVs). When supported on flexible plastic substrates these electrodes are stable toward repeated bending through a small radius of curvature over tens of thousands of cycles. The grid electrodes are fabricated by the unconventional approach of condensation coefficient modulation using a perfluorinated polymer shown to be far superior to the other compounds used for this purpose to date. The very narrow line width and small grid pitch that can be achieved also open the door to the possibility of using grid electrodes in OPVs without a conducting poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene&#8208;poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) layer to span the gaps between grid lines.

         <title>A Novel Potassium Salt Regulated Solvation Chemistry Enabling Excellent Li Anode Protection in Carbonate Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In lithium metal batteries (LMBs), the compatibility of Li anode and conventional lithium hexafluorophosphate&#8208;(LiPF6) carbonate electrolyte is poor owing to the severe parasitic reactions. Herein, to resolve this issue, a delicately designed additive of potassium perfluoropinacolatoborate (KFPB) is unprecedentedly synthesized. On the one hand, KFPB additive can regulate the solvation structure of the carbonate electrolyte, promoting the formation of Li+&#8208;FPB&#8722; and K+&#8208;PF6&#8722; ion&#8208;pairs with lower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels; On the other hand, FPB&#8722; anion possesses strong adsorption ability on Li anode.Thus, anions can preferentially adsorb and decompose on the Li anode surface to form a conductive and robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Only a trace amount of KFPB additive (0.03&#160;M) in the carbonate electrolyte, Li dendrites growth can be totally suppressed and Li||Cu and Li||Li half cells exhibit excellent Li plating/stripping stability upon cycling. Encouragingly, KFPB assisted carbonate electrolyte enables high areal capacity LiCoO2||Li, LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)||Li, and LiNi0.8Co0.05Al0.15O2 (NCA)||Li LMBs with superior cycling stability, showing its excellent universality. This work reveals the importance of designing novel additives to regulate the solvation structure of carbonate electrolytes in improving its interface compatibility with the Li anode.

         <title>Outstanding Fill Factor in Inverted Organic Solar Cells with SnO2 by Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Transport layers are of outmost importance for thin film solar cells, determining not only their efficiency but also their stability. To bring one of these thin film technologies towards commercialization, many factors besides efficiency and stability become important, including the ease of deposition in a scalable manner and the cost of the different material's layers. Herein, highly efficient organic solar cells (OSCs), in the inverted structure (n&#8208;i&#8208;p), are demonstrated by using as electron transport layer (ETL) tin oxide (SnO2) deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD). ALD is an industrial grade technique which can be applied both at the wafer level but also in a roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll configuration. A champion efficiency of 17.26% and a record FF of 79% is shown by PM6:L8&#8208;BO OSCs when using ALD&#8208;SnO2 as ETL. These devices outperform not only solar cells with SnO2 nanoparticles casted from solution (PCE 16.03%, FF 74%) but also those utilizing the more common sol&#8208;gel ZnO (PCE 16.84%, FF 77%). The outstanding results are attributed to a reduced charge carrier recombination at the interface between the ALD&#8208;SnO2 film and the active layer. Furthermore, a higher stability under illumination is demonstrated for the devices with ALD&#8208;SnO2 in comparison with those utilizing ZnO.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transport layers are of outmost importance for thin film solar cells, determining not only their efficiency but also their stability. To bring one of these thin film technologies towards commercialization, many factors besides efficiency and stability become important, including the ease of deposition in a scalable manner and the cost of the different material's layers. Herein, highly efficient organic solar cells (OSCs), in the inverted structure (n-i-p), are demonstrated by using as electron transport layer (ETL) tin oxide (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD). ALD is an industrial grade technique which can be applied both at the wafer level but also in a roll-to-roll configuration. A champion efficiency of 17.26% and a record FF of 79% is shown by PM6:L8-BO OSCs when using ALD-SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as ETL. These devices outperform not only solar cells with SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles casted from solution (PCE 16.03%, FF 74%) but also those utilizing the more common sol-gel ZnO (PCE 16.84%, FF 77%). The outstanding results are attributed to a reduced charge carrier recombination at the interface between the ALD-SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; film and the active layer. Furthermore, a higher stability under illumination is demonstrated for the devices with ALD-SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in comparison with those utilizing ZnO.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Molecular Chameleon Carriers for Nucleic Acid Delivery: The Sweet Spot Between Lipoplexes and Polyplexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Taking advantage of effective intracellular delivery mechanisms of both cationizable lipids and polymers, highly potent double pH&#8208;responsive nucleic acid carriers were generated by combining at least two lipo amino fatty acids (LAFs) as hydrophobic cationizable motifs with hydrophilic cationizable aminoethylene units into novel sequence&#8208;defined molecules. The pH&#8208;dependent tunable polarity of the LAF was successfully implemented by inserting a central tertiary amine, which disrupts the hydrophobic character once protonated, resulting in pH&#8208;dependent structural and physical changes. This &#8220;molecular chameleon character&#8221; turned out to be advantageous for dynamic nucleic acid delivery via lipopolyplexes. By screening of different topologies (blocks, bundles, T&#8208;shapes, U&#8208;shapes), LAF types, and LAF/aminoethylene ratios, highly potent pDNA, mRNA, and siRNA carriers were identified, which were up to several hundred&#8208;fold more efficient than previous carrier generations and characterized by very fast transfection kinetics. mRNA lipopolyplexes maintained high transfection activity in cell culture even in the presence of &#8805;90% serum at an ultra&#8208;low mRNA dose of 3 picogram (&#8764;2 nanoparticles/cell), and thus are comparable in potency to viral nanoparticles. Importantly, they showed great in vivo performance with high expression levels especially in spleen, tumor, lungs, and liver upon intravenous administration of 1&#8211;3&#160;&#956;g luciferase&#8208;encoding mRNA in mice.

         <title>Direct Integration of Perovskite Solar Cells with Carbon Fibre Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Integrating photovoltaic devices onto the surface of carbon fibre&#8208;reinforced polymer substrates should create materials with high mechanical strength that are also able to generate electrical power. Such devices are anticipated to find ready applications as structural, energy&#8208;harvesting systems in both the automotive and aeronautical sectors. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of triple&#8208;cation perovskite n&#8208;i&#8208;p solar cells onto the surface of planarised carbon fibre&#8208;reinforced polymer substrates, with devices utilising a transparent top ITO contact. These devices also contain a &#8220;wrinkled&#8221; SiO2 interlayer placed between the device and substrate which alleviates thermally&#8208;induced cracking of the bottom ITO layer. Our devices were found to have a stabilised power conversion efficiency of 14.5% and a specific power (power per weight) of 21.4&#160;W g&#8722;1 (without encapsulation), making them highly suitable for mobile power applications.

         <title>Highly Ordered Supramolecular Materials of Phase&#8208;Separated Block Molecules for Long&#8208;Range Exciton Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Efficient energy transport over long distances is essential for optoelectronic and light&#8208;harvesting devices. Although self&#8208;assembled nanofibers of organic molecules have been shown to exhibit long exciton diffusion lengths, alignment of these nanofibers into films with large, organized domains with similar properties remains a challenge. Here, we show how the functionalization of C3&#8208;symmetric carbonyl&#8208;bridged triarylamine trisamide (CBT) oligodimethylsiloxane (oDMS) sidechains with discrete length leads to fully covered surfaces with aligned domains up to 125 &#215; 70 &#956;m2 in which long&#8208;range exciton transport takes place. The nanoscale morphology within the domains consists of highly ordered nanofibers with discrete intercolumnar spacings within a soft amorphous oDMS matrix. The oDMS prevents bundling of the CBT fibers, reducing the number of defects within the CBT columns. As a result, the columns have a high degree of coherence, leading to exciton diffusion lengths of a few hundred nanometers with exciton diffusivities (&#8764;0.05 cm2 s&#8722;1) that are comparable to those of a crystalline tetracene. These findings represent the next step towards fully covered surfaces of highly aligned nanofibers through functionalization with oDMS.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Raman spectroscopy is an analytical method based on light&#8208;matter interactions that can interrogate the vibrational modes of matter and provide representative molecular fingerprints. Mediated by its label&#8208;free, non&#8208;invasive nature and high molecular specificity, Raman&#8208;based techniques have become ubiquitous tools for in situ characterisation of materials. This review comprehensively describes the theoretical and practical background of Raman spectroscopy and its advanced variants. We highlight the numerous facets of material characterisation that Raman scattering can reveal, including biomolecular identification, solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transitions and spatial mapping of biomolecular species in bioactive materials. The review illustrates the potential of these techniques in the context of active biomedical material design and development by highlighting representative studies from the literature. These studies cover the use of Raman spectroscopy for the characterisation of both natural and synthetic biomaterials, including engineered tissue constructs, biopolymer systems, ceramics and nanoparticle formulations, among others. To increase the accessibility and adoption of these techniques, the present review also provides the reader with practical recommendations on the integration of Raman techniques into the experimental laboratory toolbox. Finally, we provide perspectives on how recent developments in plasmon&#8208; and coherently&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy can propel Raman from underutilised to critical for biomaterial&#160;development.

         <title>Material Design Strategies for Recovery of Critical Resources from Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Population growth, urbanization, and decarbonization efforts are collectively straining the supply of limited resources that are necessary to produce batteries, electronics, chemicals, fertilizers, and other important products. Securing the supply chains of these critical resources via the development of separation technologies for their recovery represents a major global challenge to ensure stability and security. Surface water, groundwater, and wastewater are emerging as potential new sources to bolster these supply chains. Recently, a variety of material&#8208;based technologies have been developed and employed for separations and resource recovery in water. Judicious selection and design of these materials to tune their properties for targeting specific solutes is central to realizing the potential of water as a source for critical resources. Here, we review the materials that have been developed for membranes, sorbents, catalysts, electrodes, and interfacial solar steam generators (ISSGs) that demonstrate promise for applications in critical resource recovery. In addition, we offer a critical perspective on the grand challenges and key research directions that need to be addressed to improve their practical viability.

Abstract
Advances in emerging technologies for wireless collection and the timely analysis of various information captured by wearable devices are of growing interest. Herein, we propose a crosslinked ionic hydrogel prepared by a facile photocuring process, that allows wearable devices to be further incorporated into two wireless integrated systems for pressure monitoring applications. The device exhibits a simplified structure by effectively sharing functional layers, rather than conventional two separate combinations, offering the salient performance of iontronic sensing and electrochromic properties to simultaneously quantify and visualize pressure. The developed smart patch system was demonstrated to monitor physiological signals in real&#8208;time using the user interface of remote portable equipment with Bluetooth protocol and on&#8208;site electrochromic displays. Moreover, a passive wireless system based on the magnetic coupling effect was designed, which could operate free from the battery and simultaneously acquire multiple pressure information. It is envisioned that the strategies would hold enormous potential for flexible electronics, versatile sensing platforms and wireless on&#8208;body networks.

Apoptosis and autophagy determine the fate of cancer cells. Simultaneous activation of pro&#8208;apoptotic autophagy and apoptotic signaling pathways is a novel strategy for the treatment of solid liver tumors. Here, the amphiphilic peptide&#8208;modified glutathione&#8208;gold nanoclusters with the enrichment of solid liver tumors and the prolonged stress in the endoplasmic reticulum can achieve the mutual promotion of autophagy and apoptosis.








Abstract
Apoptosis and autophagy determine the fate of cancer cells. However, simply promoting apoptosis of tumor cells is limited in the treatment of unresectable solid liver tumors. Generally, autophagy is considered the anti&#8208;apoptotic &#8220;guardian&#8221;. But the pro&#8208;apoptotic effects of autophagy can be activated by excessive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Here, amphiphilic peptide&#8208;modified glutathione (GSH)&#8208;gold nanocluster aggregates (AP1P2&#8208;PEG NCs)&#160;were&#160;designed with the enrichment of solid liver tumors and the prolonged stress in the ER, which can achieve the mutual promotion of autophagy and apoptosis in liver tumor cells. In this study, orthotopic and subcutaneous liver tumor models show the anti&#8208;tumor effectiveness of AP1P2&#8208;PEG NCs, with a better antitumor effect than sorafenib, biosafety (Lethal Dose, 50% (LD50) of 827.3&#160;mg&#160;kg&#8722;1), wide therapeutic window (non&#8208;toxic in 20 times of therapeutic concentration) and high stability (blood half&#8208;life of 4&#160;h). These findings identify an effective strategy to develop peptide&#8208;modified gold nanocluster aggregates with low toxicity, high potency, and selectivity for solid liver tumors treatment.

         <title>A Bifunctional Carbazide Additive For Durable CSSNI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inorganic CsSnI3 with low toxicity and a narrow band gap is a promising photovoltaic material. However, the performance of CsSnI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is much lower than that of Pb&#8208;based and hybrid Sn&#8208;based (e. g. CsPbX3 and FASnX3) PSCs, which might be attributed to its poor film&#8208;forming property and deep traps induced by Sn4+. Here, a bifunctional additive carbazide (CBZ) was adopted to deposit a pinhole&#8208;free film and remove the deep traps via two&#8208;step annealing. The lone electrons of the &#8208;NH2 and &#8208;CO units in CBZ can coordinate with Sn2+ to form a dense film with large grains during the phase transition at 80&#176;C. The decomposition of CBZ can reduce Sn4+ to Sn2+ during annealing at 150&#176;C to remove deep traps. Compared with the control device (4.12%), the maximum efficiency of the CsSnI3:CBZ PSC reached 11.21%, which is the highest efficiency of CsSnI3 PSC reported to date. A certified efficiency of 10.90% was obtained in an independent photovoltaic testing laboratory. In addition, the unsealed CsSnI3:CBZ devices maintained initial efficiencies of approximately 100%, 90%, and 80% under an inert atmosphere (60 days), standard maximum power point tracking (650&#160;h at 65&#176;C), and ambient air (100&#160;h), respectively.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Small High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoparticles: Efficient Nanozyme for Enhancing Tumor Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys nanoparticles (HEANPs) are receiving extensive attention due to their broad compositional tunability and unlimited potential in bioapplication. However, developing new methods to prepare ultra&#8208;small high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles (US&#8208;HEANPs) faces severe challenges owing to their intrinsic thermodynamic instability. Furthermore, there are few reports on studying the effect of HEANPs in tumor therapy. Herein, the fabricated PtPdRuRhIr US&#8208;HEANPs act as bifunctional nanoplatforms for the highly efficient treatment of tumors. The US&#8208;HEANPs are engineered by the universal metal&#8208;ligand cross&#8208;linking strategy. This simple and scalable strategy is based on the aldol condensation of organometallics to form the target US&#8208;HEANPs. The synthesized US&#8208;HEANPs exhibit excellent peroxidase&#8208;like (POD&#8208;like) activity and can spanking catalyze the endogenous hydrogen peroxide to produce highly toxic hydroxyl radicals. Furthermore, the US&#8208;HEANPs possess a high photothermal conversion effect for converting 808&#160;nm near&#8208;infrared light into heat energy. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that under the synergistic effect of POD&#8208;like activity and photothermal action, the US&#8208;HEANPs nanoplatform can effectively ablate cancer cells and treat tumors. We believe that this work not only provides a new perspective for the fabrication of HEANPs, but also opens the high&#8208;entropy nanozymes research direction and their biomedical application.

         <title>Nontrivial Topological Surface States in Ru3Sn7 toward Wide pH&#8208;Range Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nontrivial topological surface states (TSSs), which possess extraordinary carrier mobility and are protected by the bulk symmetry, have emerged as an innovative platform to search for efficient electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we prepare a Sn&#8208;based nontrivial metal Ru3Sn7 using electrical arc melting method. Our results indicate that the (001) crystal family of Ru3Sn7 possesses nontrivial TSSs with linear dispersion relation and large nontrivial energy window. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that nontrivial TSSs of Ru3Sn7 could significantly boost charge transfer kinetics and optimize adsorption of hydrogen intermediates due to bulk symmetry&#8208;protected band structures. As expected, nontrivial Ru3Sn7 exhibits superior HER activity to Ru, Pt/C, and trivial counterparts (e.g., Ru2Sn3, IrSn2, and Rh3Sn2) with higher ratios of noble metals. Furthermore, the wide pH&#8208;range activity of topologically nontrivial Ru3Sn7 implies the robustness of its TSSs against pH variation during the HER. Our findings provide a promising approach to the rational design of topologically nontrivial metals as highly efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Metallic Glass Fiber Fabrics: A New Type of Flexible, Super&#8208;Lightweight, and Three&#8208;Dimensional Current Collectors for Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Current collectors are indispensable parts that provide electron transport and mechanical support of electrode materials in a battery. Nowadays, thin metal foils made of Cu and Al are used as current collectors of lithium batteries, but they do not contribute to the storage capacity. Therefore, decreasing the weight of current collectors can directly enhance the energy density of a battery. However, limited by the requirements of mechanical strength, it is difficult to reduce the weight of metal foils any further. Herein, we report a new type of current collectors made of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) metallic glass fiber fabrics (MGFs), which shows advantages of super&#8208;lightweight (2.9&#8764;3.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;2), outstanding electrochemical stability for cathodes and anodes of lithium&#8208;ion and lithium metal batteries, fire resistance, high strength and flexibility suitable for roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll electrode fabrication. The gravimetric energy densities of lithium batteries exhibit improvements of 9&#8764;18% by only replacing the metal foils with the MGFs. In addition, MGFs are suitable for the fabrication of flexible batteries. We demonstrate a high energy density flexible lithium battery with an outstanding figure of merit of flexible battery (fbFOM) and flexing stability.

Herein, we report a new type of current collectors made of three-dimensional (3D) metallic glass fiber fabrics (MGFs), which shows advantages of super-lightweight (2.9&#8764;3.2&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), outstanding electrochemical stability for cathodes and anodes of lithium-ion and lithium metal batteries, fire resistance, high strength and flexibility suitable for roll-to-roll electrode fabrication. The gravimetric energy densities of lithium batteries exhibit improvements of 9&#8764;18% by only replacing the metal foils with the MGFs. In addition, MGFs are suitable for the fabrication of flexible batteries. We demonstrate a high energy density flexible lithium battery with an outstanding figure of merit of flexible battery (&lt;i&gt;fb&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;FOM&lt;/sub&gt;) and flexing stability.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>2D Materials&#8208;based Electrochemical Triboelectric Nanogenerators</title>

Abstract
The integration of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials in triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) is known to increase the mechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical power conversion efficiency. 2D materials have been used in TENGs with multiple roles as triboelectric material, charge&#8208;trapping fillers or as electrodes. Here, we develop novel TENGs based on few&#8208;layers graphene (FLG) electrodes and stable gel electrolytes composed of liquid phase exfoliated 2D&#8208;transition metal dichalcogenides and polyvinyl alcohol. TENGs embedding FLG and gel composites, show competitive open&#8208;circuit voltage (&#8764;300 V), instant peak power (530 mW/m2) and stability (&gt; 11 months). These values correspond to a 7&#8208;fold higher electrical output compared to TENGs embedding bare FLG electrodes. It is demonstrated that such a significant improvement depends on the high electrical double&#8208;layer capacitance (EDLC) of FLG electrodes functionalized with the gel composites. The wet encapsulation of the TENGs is shown to be an effective strategy to increase their power output further highlighting the EDLC role. We also show that the EDLC is dependent upon the transition metal (W vs Mo) rather than the relative abundance of 1T or 2H phases. Overall, this work lays down the roots for novel sustainable electrochemical&#8208;(e)&#8208;TENGs developed exploiting strategies typically used in electrochemical capacitors.

         <title>Localized Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Delivery of miR&#8208;29b Normalises the Dysregulation of Bone Homeostasis Caused by Osteosarcoma Whilst Simultaneously Inhibiting Tumour Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma undergo extensive surgical intervention and chemotherapy resulting in dismal prognosis and compromised quality of life owing to poor bone regeneration, which is further compromised with chemotherapy delivery. This study aims to investigate if localised delivery of miR&#8208;29b&#8212;which has been shown to promote bone formation by inducing osteoblast differentiation and also to suppress prostate and glioblastoma tumour growth&#8212;would suppress osteosarcoma tumours whilst simultaneously normalising the dysregulation of bone homeostasis caused by osteosarcoma. Thus, we studied the therapeutic potential of miR&#8208;29b to promote bone remodelling in an orthotopic model of osteosarcoma (rather than in bone defect models using healthy mice), and in the context of chemotherapy, that is clinically relevant. We developed a formulation of miR&#8208;29b:nanoparticles that were delivered via a hyaluronic&#8208;based hydrogel to enable local and sustained release of the therapy, and to study the potential of attenuating tumour growth whilst normalising bone homeostasis. We found that when miR&#8208;29b was delivered along with systemic chemotherapy, compared to chemotherapy alone, our therapy provided a significant decrease in tumour burden, increase in mouse survival, and a significant decrease in osteolysis thereby normalising the dysregulation of bone lysis activity caused by the tumour.

         <title>Atomic Displacements Enabling the Observation of the Anomalous Hall Effect in a Non&#8208;Collinear Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Antiferromagnets with non&#8208;collinear spin structures display various properties that make them attractive for spintronic devices. Some of the most interesting examples are an anomalous Hall effect despite negligible magnetization and a spin Hall effect with unusual spin polarization directions. However, these effects can only be observed when the sample is set predominantly into a single antiferromagnetic domain state. This can only be achieved when the compensated spin structure is perturbed and displays weak moments due to spin canting that allows for external domain control. In thin films of cubic non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnets, this imbalance was&#160;previously assumed to require tetragonal distortions induced by substrate strain. Here we&#160;show that in Mn3SnN and Mn3GaN, spin canting is due to structural symmetry lowering induced by large displacements of the magnetic manganese atoms away from high symmetry positions. These displacements remain hidden in X&#8208;ray diffraction when only probing the lattice metric and require measurement of a large set of scattering vectors to resolve the local atomic positions. In Mn3SnN, the induced net moments enable the observation of the anomalous Hall effect with an unusual temperature dependence, which we&#160;conjecture results from a bulk&#8208;like temperature&#8208;dependent coherent spin rotation within the Kagome&#160;plane.

         <title>Multimodal&#8208;Driven Magnetic Microrobots with Enhanced Bactericidal Activity for Biofilm Eradication and Removal from Titanium Mesh</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Modern micro/nanorobots can perform multiple tasks for biomedical and environmental applications. Particularly, magnetic microrobots can be completely controlled by a rotating magnetic field and their motion powered and controlled without the use of toxic fuels, which makes them most promising for biomedical application. Moreover, they are able to form swarms, allowing them to perform specific tasks at a larger scale than a single microrobot. In this work, we developed magnetic microrobots composed of halloysite nanotubes as backbone and Fe3O4 nanoparticles as magnetic material allowing magnetic propulsion and covered these with polyethylenimine to load ampicillin and prevent the microrobots from disassembling. These microrobots exhibit multimodal motion as single robots as well as in swarms. In addition, they can transform from tumbling to spinning motion and vice&#8208;versa, and when in swarm mode they can change their motion from vortex to ribbon and back again. Finally, the vortex motion mode is used to penetrate and disrupt the extracellular matrix of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm colonized on titanium mesh used for bone restoration, which improves the effect of the antibiotic's activity. Such magnetic microrobots for biofilm removal from medical implants could reduce implant rejection and improve patients&#8217; well&#8208;being.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Active Self&#8208;Cleaning Surfaces via Filament&#8208;Like Sweepers Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydrodynamic forces from moving fluids can be utilized to remove contaminants which is an ideal fouling&#8208;release strategy for underwater surfaces. However, the hydrodynamic forces in the viscous sublayer are greatly reduced owing to the no&#8208;slip condition, which restricts their practical applications. Here, inspired by sweeper tentacles of corals, we report an active self&#8208;cleaning surface with flexible filament&#8208;like sweepers. The sweepers can penetrate the viscous sublayer by utilizing energy from outer turbulent flows and remove contaminants with adhesion strength of more than 30&#160;kPa. Under an oscillating flow, the removal rate of the single sweeper can reach up to 99.5% due to dynamic buckling movements. In addition, the sweepers array can completely clean its coverage area within 10 s through coordinated movements as symplectic waves. Our active self&#8208;cleaning surface depends on the fluid&#8208;structure coupling between sweepers and flows, which breaks the concept of conventional self&#8208;cleaning.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Macrocyclic Copper Complex Enables Homogeneous Catalysis for High&#8208;Loading Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The practical viability of high energy density lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries stipulates the use of a high&#8208;loading cathode and lean electrolyte. However, under such harsh conditions, the liquid&#8208;solid sulfur redox reaction is much&#8208;retarded due to the poor sulfur and polysulfides utilization, leading to low capacity and fast fading. Herein, a self&#8208;assembled macrocyclic Cu(II) complex (CuL) is designed as an effective catalyst to homogenize and maximize the liquid&#8208;involved reaction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical viability of high energy density lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries stipulates the use of a high-loading cathode and lean electrolyte. However, under such harsh conditions, the liquid-solid sulfur redox reaction is much-retarded due to the poor sulfur and polysulfides utilization, leading to low capacity and fast fading. Herein, a self-assembled macrocyclic Cu(II) complex (CuL) is designed as an effective catalyst to homogenize and maximize the liquid-involved reaction. The four-N atoms coordinated Cu(II) ion features a planar &lt;i&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybridization, showing a strong bonding affinity towards lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) along the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; orbital via steric effect. Such a structure not only lowers the energy barrier of the liquid-solid conversion (Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) but also guides a 3D deposition of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. As such, with a 1 wt% electrolyte additive of CuL, a high initial capacity of 925 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and areal capacity of 9.62 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a low decay of 0.3%/cycle can be achieved under a high sulfur loading of 10.4&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 6&#160;&#956;L mg&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>A Self&#8208;Reconfigured, Dual&#8208;Layered Artificial Interphase Towards High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Abstract
The uncontrollable dendrite growth and unstable solid electrolyte interphase have long plagued the practical application of Li metal batteries. Herein, we demonstrate a dual&#8208;layered artificial interphase LiF/LiBO&#8208;Ag that is simultaneously reconfigured via an electrochemical process to stabilize the lithium anode. This dual&#8208;layered interphase consists of a heterogeneous LiF/LiBO glassy top layer with ultrafast Li&#8208;ion conductivity and lithiophilic Li&#8208;Ag alloy bottom layer, which synergistically regulates the dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition, even at high current densities. As a result, Li||Li symmetric cells with LiF/LiBO&#8208;Ag interphase achieve an ultralong lifespan (4500&#160;h) at an ultrahigh current density and area capacity (20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 20 mAh cm&#8722;2). LiF/LiBO&#8208;Ag@Li anodes were successfully applied in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, showing excellent cycling performances in symmetric cells (8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 8 mAh cm&#8722;2, 5000&#160;h) and full cells. Furthermore, a practical quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cell coupling with a high&#8208;nickel cathode exhibits a stable cycling with a capacity retention of over 91% after 60 cycles at 0.5 C, which is comparable or even better than that in liquid&#8208;state pouch cells. Additionally, a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cell (10.75 Ah, 448.7&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) were successfully accomplished. This well&#8208;orchestrated interphase design provides new guidance in engineering highly stable interphase towards practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Space&#8208;Confined Metal Ion Strategy for Carbon Materials Derived from Cobalt Benzimidazole Frameworks with High Desalination Performance in Simulated Seawater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Various metal ions with different valence states (Mg2+, Al3+, Ca2+, Ti4+, Mn2+, Fe3+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, Ba2+, Ce4+) were successfully confined in quasi&#8208;microcube&#8208;shaped cobalt benzimidazole frameworks (CoZIF9) using a space&#8208;confined synthesis strategy. More importantly, a series of derived carbon materials that confine metal ions were obtained by high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis. Interestingly, the derived carbon materials exhibited electric double&#8208;layer and pseudocapacitance properties because of the presence of metal ions with various valence states. Moreover, the presence of additional metal ions within carbon materials may create new phases, which can accelerate Na+ insertion/extraction and thus increase electrochemical adsorption. Density functional theory results showed that carbon materials in which Ti ions are confined exhibit enhanced insertion/extraction of Na+ resulting from the presence of the characteristic anatase crystalline phases of TiO2. The Ti&#8208;containing materials have an impressive desalination capacity (62.8&#160;mg g&#8722;1) in capacitive deionization (CDI) applications with high cycling stability. This work provides a facile synthetic strategy for the confinement of metal ions in metal&#8211;organic frameworks and thus supports the further development of derived carbon materials for seawater desalination by CDI.

         <title>Cu&#8208;doped Heterointerfaced Ru/RuSe2 nanosheets with optimized H and H2O adsorption boost hydrogen evolution catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ruthenium chalcogenide is a highly promising catalytic system as a Pt alternative for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, well&#8208;studied ruthenium selenide (RuSe2) still exhibits sluggish HER kinetics in alkaline media due to the inappropriate adsorption strength of H and H2O. Herein, w e report a new design of Cu&#8208;doped Ru/RuSe2 heterogeneous nanosheets (NSs) with optimized H and H2O adsorption strength for highly efficient HER catalysis in alkaline media. Theoretical calculations reveal that the superior HER performance is attributed to a synergistic effect of the unique heterogeneous interface structure and Cu doping, which not only optimizes the electronic structure with a suitable d&#8208;band center to suppress proton overbinding but also alleviates the energy barrier with enhanced H2O adsorption. As a result, Cu&#8208;doped heterogeneous Ru/RuSe2 NSs exhibit a small overpotential of 23&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, a low Tafel slope of 58.5&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 and a high turnover frequency (TOF) value of 0.88 s&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mV for HER in alkaline media, which is among the best catalysts in noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts toward HER. The present Cu&#8208;doped Ru/RuSe2 NSs interface catalyst is very stable for HER by showing no activity decay after 5000&#8208;cycle potential sweeps. This work heralds that heterogeneous interface modulation opens up a new strategy for the designing of more efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Intravascularly Deliverable Biomaterial Platforms for Tissue Repair and Regeneration Post&#8208;myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Each year, nearly 19 million people die of cardiovascular disease with coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction (MI) as the leading cause for the progression of heart failure. Due to the high risk associated with surgical procedures, a variety of minimally invasive therapeutics aimed at tissue repair and regeneration are being developed. While biomaterials delivered via intramyocardial injection have shown promise, there are challenges associated with delivery in acute MI. In contrast, intravascularly injectable biomaterials are a desirable category of therapeutics due to their ability to be delivered immediately post&#8208;MI via less invasive methods. In addition to passive diffusion into the infarct, these biomaterials can be designed to target the molecular and cellular characteristics seen in MI pathophysiology, such as cells and proteins present in the ischemic myocardium, to reduce off&#8208;target localization. These injectable materials can also be stimuli responsive through enzymes or chemical imbalances. This review outlines the natural and synthetic biomaterial designs that allow for retention and accumulation within the infarct via intravascular delivery, including intracoronary infusion and intravenous injection.

The previous Er&#8208;based electroluminescence (EL) devices are mainly based on Er&#8208;complexes or Er&#8208;doped oxide compounds, which usually suffer from low external quantum efficiency(EQE)or high applied voltage etc. In this work, a novel type of Er3+/Yb3+ co&#8208;doped lead&#8208;halide perovskite films (Er3+/Yb3+:CsPbCl3) with the maximum photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 30.12% are prepared by a simple two&#8208;step solution&#8208;coating method and the corresponding light emitting diodes (Er&#8208;PeLEDs) are fabricated, which demonstrate a almost pure 1.54&#8208;&#956;m emission and a peak EQE up to 0.366% at a low applied voltage of 1.4&#160;V. Strong negative thermal quenching effect may help Er&#8208;PeLEDs suppress Joule heating quenching. These excellent LED properties benefit mainly from outstanding regulatory performance of acetate to perovskite films, the excellent semiconductor behavior and strong ionic property of the perovskite, and the involving of Yb3+ ions, which can directly and efficiently transfer the exciton energy to Er3+ through a quantum cutting process. Overall, the realization of 1.54&#8208;&#956;m Er&#8208;PeLEDs offers new opportunities for silicon&#8208;based integrated light sources.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Small Molecule Organic Solar Cells Enabled by a Symmetric&#8208;Asymmetric Alloy Acceptor with a Broad Composition Tolerance</title>

Abstract
Using a combinatory blending strategy is demonstrated as a promising path for designing efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) by boosting the short&#8208;circuit current density and fill factor. Herein, a high&#8208;performance ternary all&#8208;small molecule OSC (all&#8208;SMOSCs) using a narrow&#8208;bandgap alloy acceptor containing symmetric and asymmetric molecules (BTP&#8208;eC9 and SSe&#8208;NIC) and a wide&#8208;bandgap small molecule donor MPhS&#8208;C2 is reported. Introducing the synthesized SSe&#8208;NIC into the MPhS&#8208;C2:BTP&#8208;eC9 host system can broaden&#160;the&#160;absorption spectrum, modulate energy offsets, and optimize the molecular packing of the host materials. After systematically optimizing the weight ratio of MPhS&#8208;C2:BTP&#8208;eC9:SSe&#8208;NIC, a champion efficiency of 18.02% is achieved. Impressively, the ternary system not only delivered a broad composition tolerance with device efficiencies over 17% throughout the whole blend ratios, but also exhibited less non&#8208;geminate recombination and energy loss, and better light&#8208;soaking stability than did the corresponding binary systems. This work promotes the development of high&#8208;performance ternary all&#8208;SMOSCs and heralds their brighter application prospects.

         <title>Cell Reprogramming&#8208;Inspired Dynamically Responsive Hydrogel Boosts the Induction of Pluripotency via Phase&#8208;Separated Biomolecular Condensates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have wide applications in disease modeling, personalized medicine and tissue engineering. The generation of iPSCs from somatic cells via transcriptional factor&#8208; or chemical molecule&#8208;based approaches is time&#8208;consuming and inefficient. Here, cell reprogramming&#8208;inspired dynamically responsive hydrogel is fabricated via a synthetic biology&#8208;based strategy. Human and mouse somatic cells (including senescent cells) have been efficiently reprogrammed into iPSCs that exhibit key features of embryonic stem cells. Cell reprogramming&#8208;responsive hydrogel possesses dynamic bioresponsiveness, which faithfully senses metabolic remodeling and extracellular acidification during cell reprogramming and responds by changing its mechanical properties accordingly. Mechanistic study demonstrate that the autonomous change of mechanical properties of cell reprogramming&#8208;responsive hydrogel elicits the formation of Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP) biomolecular condensates with the appropriate timing during cell reprogramming, ensuring a faster and more efficient generation of iPSCs than conventional cell reprogramming approach. Taken together, our study reveals the robust induction of pluripotency by coordination of cell reprogramming&#8208;inspired dynamically responsive hydrogel and phase&#8208;separated biomolecular condensates.

         <title>Broadband Emission Origin in Metal Halide Perovskites: Are Self&#8208;Trapped Excitons or Ions?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
It has always been a goal to realize high efficiency and broadband emission in the single&#8208;component materials. The appearance of metal halide perovskites makes it possible. Their soft lattice characteristics and significant electron&#8208;phonon coupling synergistically generate the self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs), contributing to the broadband emission with a large Stokes shift. Meanwhile, their structural/compositional diversity provides suitable active sites and coordination environments for ns2 ions doping, allowing 3Pn (n = 0, 1, 2)&#8594;1S0 transitions toward the broadband emission. The ns2 ions emission is phenomenologically similar to that of the STE emission, preventing people from in&#8208;depth understanding their emission origin, thus failure to meeting the design requirements to serve the various sectors of practical applications. In this scenario, we deploy this review by summarizing the fundamentals and development of such two emission mechanisms, to establish a clear and comprehensive understanding of the broadband emission phenomenon, which may pave the way to an ideal customization of broadband&#8208;emission metal halide perovskites.

         <title>Ultrafast laser plasmonic fabrication of nanocrystals by molecule modulation for photoresponse multifunctional structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanotechnology has attracted widely research attention in constructing functional devices, including integrated circuits, transparent electrodes, and flexible actuators. Bottom&#8208;up fabrication is an important approach for functional structure manufacture, however, the controllable fabrication of complex architectures for practical applications has long been a challenge. Here, we propose a novel strategy of laser plasmonic fabrication based on glue molecule modulation that can assemble metal nanocrystals into interconnected pattern networks. The plasmonic response of nanocrystals is adjustable with molecule modulation, which is benefit for the effective formation of laser&#8208;induced localized oscillating electrons. The further decomposition of molecules and the movement of nanocrystal surface atoms can achieve the coalescence of assembled nanocrystals. It is demonstrated that the complex architectures can be controllably constructed by molecule level modulation. Through molecule&#8208;assisted laser plasmonic fabrication, the functional nanocrystals with enhanced photothermal capacity can be used for information encryption and soft machinery. This work expands the knowledge of bottom&#8208;up fabrication and provides a method for designing functional nanocrystals for a wide range of applications.

         <title>Skeletal Network Enabling New&#8208;Generation Thermoplastic Vulcanizates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Upcycling of cross&#8208;linked rubbers is pressing. The introduction of dynamic covalent bonds into the networks is a popular tactic for recycling thermosetting polymers, but it is very challenging to integrate engineering performance and continuous yet stable reprocessability. Based on traditional rubber formulations, herein, a straightforward strategy is presented for constructing a skeletal network (SN) through interfacial cross&#8208;linking and percolation of rubbery granules in a rubber matrix. Rapid exchange reactions involving dynamic interfacial sulfides realize repeated &#8220;fragmentation and healing&#8221; in the solid&#8208;state and consequent reconfiguration of the SN topology of the elastomer, thus endowing the resultant SN elastomer with continuous yet stable re&#8208;extrudability. These SN elastomers with hierarchical structures exhibit high gel contents, high resilience, low creep, and reinforcibility competitive to traditional vulcanizates. Specifically, SN elastomers exhibit better overall performance than commercial thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs) materials. Overall, a new concept of thermoplastic vulcanizates is proposed, which will promote the sustainable development of rubbers.

The introduction of dynamic covalent bonds into the networks is a popular tactic for recycling thermosetting polymers, but it is very challenging to integrate engineering performance and continuous yet stable reprocessability. Based on traditional rubber formulations, herein, a straightforward strategy is presented for constructing a skeletal network (SN) through interfacial cross-linking and percolation of rubbery granules in a rubber matrix. Rapid exchange reactions involving dynamic interfacial sulfides realize repeated &#8220;fragmentation and healing&#8221; in the solid-state and consequent reconfiguration of the SN topology of the elastomer, thus endowing the resultant SN elastomer with continuous yet stable re-extrudability. These SN elastomers with hierarchical structures exhibit high gel contents, high resilience, low creep, and reinforcibility competitive to traditional vulcanizates. Specifically, SN elastomers exhibit better overall performance than commercial thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs) materials. Overall, a new concept of thermoplastic vulcanizates is proposed, which will promote the sustainable development of rubbers.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Biomimetic In Vitro Lung Models: Current Challenges and Future Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chronic respiratory diseases are one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with a considerable disease burden. Current in vitro lung models must be evolved to replace inefficient animal models and enhance the translational power of preclinical studies. The current challenges of in vitro lung models are discussed, and the future perspectives for the evolution of these models for preclinical studies on cellular, material, and fabrication levels are outlined.








Abstract
As post&#8208;COVID complications, chronic respiratory diseases are one of the foremost causes of mortality. The quest for a cure for this recent global challenge underlines that the lack of predictive in vitro lung models is one of the main bottlenecks in pulmonary preclinical drug development. Despite rigorous efforts to develop biomimetic in vitro lung models, the current cutting&#8208;edge models represent a compromise in numerous technological and biological aspects. Most advanced in vitro models are still in the &#8220;proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept&#8221; phase with a low clinical translation of the findings. On the other hand, advances in cellular and molecular studies are mainly based on relatively simple and unrealistic in vitro models. Herein, the current challenges and potential strategies toward not only bioinspired but truly biomimetic lung models are discussed.

         <dc:description>
A series of ultra&#8208;microporous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) (JLU&#8208;MOF87&#8211;89) with triangular channels is successfully blueprinted and constructed via mixed&#8208;ligand strategy. By selecting different&#8208;sized ligands and applying linker modification, the channel is fine&#8208;tuned and precisely tailored into the optimized zone, realizing high C2H2/C2H4 selectivity. Moreover, the excellent performances of JLU&#8208;MOF mixed&#8208;matrix membranes have validated the application potential for C2H2/C2H4 separation.








Abstract
Effective separation of ethyne from ethyne/ethylene (C2H2/C2H4) mixtures is a challenging and crucial industrial process. Herein, an ultra&#8208;microporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) platform, Cd(dicarboxylate)2(ditriazole), with triangular channels is proposed for high&#8208;efficiency separation of C2H2 from C2H4. The targeted structures are constructed via a mixed&#8208;ligand strategy by selecting different&#8208;sized ligands, allowing for tunable pore sizes and volumes. The pore properties can be further optimized by additional modification via pore environment tailoring. This concept leads to the successful synthesis of three ultra&#8208;microporous Cd&#8208;MOFs (JLU&#8208;MOF87&#8211;89). As intended, C2H2 uptake and C2H2/C2H4 selectivity gradually increase with progressively optimizing the pore structure by adjusting ligand length and substituents. JLU&#8208;MOF89, functionalized with methyl groups, features the most optimal pore chemistry and shows selective recognition of C2H2 over C2H4, owing to the framework&#8211;C2H2 host&#8211;guest interactions. Furthermore, JLU&#8208;MOFs are fabricated into mixed&#8208;matrix membranes for C2H2/C2H4 separation. C2H2 permeability and C2H2/C2H4 permselectivity are substantially enhanced by &#8805;400% and &#8805;200%, respectively, after hybridization of JLU&#8208;MOF88 and JLU&#8208;MOF89 with a polyimide&#160;polymer&#160;(6FDA&#8211;ODA). These membranes can work efficiently and are stable under different conditions, demonstrating their potential in actual ethyne separation.

         <title>Electrically Driven Sub&#8208;Micrometer Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Arrays Using Maskless and Etching&#8208;Free Pixelation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A&#160;pixelation technique of micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diodes via helium focused ion beam irradiation is introduced. Various pixel sizes down to sub&#8208;micrometer scale are demonstrated, and their optical and electrical properties are investigated. This approach does not require any complicated fabrication processes for pixelation such as lithography, passivation, and planarization, providing a new way to fabricate sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;scale optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
For decades, group&#8208;III&#8208;nitride&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) have&#160;been regarded as a light emitting source for future displays by virtue of their novel properties such as high efficiency, brightness, and stability. Nevertheless, realization of high pixel density displays is still challenging due to limitations of pixelation methods. Here, a maskless and etching&#8208;free micro&#8208;LED (&#181;LED) pixelation method is developed via tailored He focused ion beam (FIB) irradiation technique, and electrically driven sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;scale &#181;LED pixel arrays are demonstrated. It is confirmed that optical quenching and electrical isolation effects are simultaneously induced at a certain ion dose (&#8776;1014 ions cm&#8722;2) without surface damage. Furthermore, highly efficient &#181;LED pixel arrays at sub&#8208;micrometer scale (square pixel, 0.5&#160;&#181;m side length) are fabricated. Their pixelation and brightness are verified by various optical measurements such as cathodo&#8208;, photo&#8208;, and electroluminescence. It is expected that the FIB&#8208;induced optical quenching and electrical isolation method can pioneer a new defect engineering technology not only for &#181;LED fabrication, but also for sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;scale optoelectronic devices.

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Enabled Stable Cobalt Species Deposition on MnO2 for Water Oxidation in Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high voltage endows cobalt oxides with stably acidic oxygen evolution on the surface of a&#160;MnO2 host material. MnO2 treated with molten salt possesses more cobalt deposition sites and therefore shows higher oxygen&#160;evolution&#160;reaction&#160;(OER) activity. The stable presence of CoO2 at 1.8&#160;V in the acid electrolyte is beneficial to high activity and stability for the&#160;OER. The exploration of applying high voltage to construct stable species in the&#160;Pourbaix diagram before they are exposed in an&#160;acidic environment proves the feasibility of this method to improve the stability of cobalt&#8208;based electrocatalyst, which provides a new perspective for the design of acidic non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The design and maintenance of highly active sites in an&#160;acidic environment is vital and challenging for the&#160;oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In&#160;this&#160;work, it is found that the obtained CoO2 under high applied potential can be stable on MnO2 host in acidic environment, which may act as an effective means to solve the instability of cobalt&#8208;based electrocatalyst. The significant improvement of acidic OER activity (6.9 times) and stability (46.4 times) of 90&#8208;Co&#8208;MnO2 (treated by molten salt with more Co deposition sites) demonstrates the advantages of this approach. In situ Raman and the&#160;Pourbaix diagram suggest that the enhanced performance derives from the stable presence of CoO2 at the voltage &gt;1.8&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). However, when the potential is &lt;1.8&#160;V, the corresponding other cobalt species is too unstable to facilitate the&#160;OER. Density functional theorycalculations reveal that the deposited cobalt oxides can act as active sites, thus effectively reducing the reaction energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step. This work provides a new perspective for enhancing the stability of cobalt&#8208;based electrocatalyst. In the future, the dual consideration of applied potential and stable species of active element in the&#160;Pourbaix diagram may be a new direction for developing acid&#8208;stable electrocatalysts.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design and maintenance of highly active sites in an&#160;acidic environment is vital and challenging for the&#160;oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In&#160;this&#160;work, it is found that the obtained CoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under high applied potential can be stable on MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; host in acidic environment, which may act as an effective means to solve the instability of cobalt-based electrocatalyst. The significant improvement of acidic OER activity (6.9 times) and stability (46.4 times) of 90-Co-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (treated by molten salt with more Co deposition sites) demonstrates the advantages of this approach. In situ Raman and the&#160;Pourbaix diagram suggest that the enhanced performance derives from the stable presence of CoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the voltage &amp;gt;1.8&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). However, when the potential is &amp;lt;1.8&#160;V, the corresponding other cobalt species is too unstable to facilitate the&#160;OER. Density functional theorycalculations reveal that the deposited cobalt oxides can act as active sites, thus effectively reducing the reaction energy barrier of the rate-determining step. This work provides a new perspective for enhancing the stability of cobalt-based electrocatalyst. In the future, the dual consideration of applied potential and stable species of active element in the&#160;Pourbaix diagram may be a new direction for developing acid-stable electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pollen&#8208;Inspired Shell&#8211;Core Aerosol Particles Capable of Brownian Motion for Pulmonary Vascularization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by pollen in nature, novel shell&#8211;core aerosol particles capable of Brownian motion and immune evasion are constructed for respiratory administration. The aerosol particles disperse into the alveolar cavity by Brownian motion, implant in the alveolar interstitium by immune evasion, and activate angiogenic sprouting via the HIF&#8208;1 pathway, thus promoting bronchopulmonary development.








Abstract
Nebulization is the most widely used respiratory delivery technique with non&#8208;invasive properties. However, nebulized drugs often fail to function due to the excretion and immune clearance of the respiratory system. In&#160;this&#160;work, inspired by pollen in nature, novel shell&#8211;core aerosol particles (APs) capable of Brownian motion are constructed for respiratory delivery. Drugs&#8208;loaded poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) nanoparticles are prepared by emulsification to form the inner core, and the membranes of macrophages are extracted to form the outer shell. The optimized size and the shell&#8211;core structure endow APs with Brownian motion and atomization stability, thus enabling the APs to reach the bronchi and alveoli deeply for effective deposition. Camouflaging the&#160;macrophage membranes equips the APs with immune evasion. In vitro experiments prove that deferoxamine (DFO)&#8208;loaded APs (DFO@APs) can promote the angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. A hyperoxia&#8208;induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) model is constructed to validate the efficiency of DFO@APs. In BPD mice, DFO@APs can release DFO in the alveolar interstitium, thus promoting the reconstruction of microvasculature, ultimately inducing lung development for treating BPD. In conclusion, this study develops &#8220;pollen&#8221;&#8208;inspired shell&#8211;core aerosol particles capable of Brownian motion, which provides a novel idea and theoretical basis for respiratory administration.

         <title>Pore Perforation of Graphene Coupled with In Situ Growth of Co3Se4 for High&#8208;Performance Na&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pore&#8208;forming engineering has been employed to simultaneously achieve the perforation of graphene nanosheets and the in situ growth of Co3Se4 nanoparticles. Benefiting from the fast diffusion of electrolyte ions in the longitudinal direction, Co3Se4/holey&#160;graphene&#160;(Co3Se4/HG) as anode material exhibits remarkable rate performance and excellent cycling performance in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Graphene&#8208;based nanomaterials have sprung up as promising anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to the intriguing properties of graphene itself and the synergic effect between graphene and active materials. However, the 2D&#160;graphene sheet only allows the rapid diffusion of sodium ions along the parallel direction while that of the vertical direction is difficult, limiting the rate capability of graphene&#8208;based electrode materials. To tackle this problem, pore&#8208;forming engineering has been employed to perforate graphene and concurrently achieve the in situ growth of Co3Se4 nanoparticles. The generation of in&#8208;plane nanohole breaks through the physical barriers of the graphene nanosheets, enabling the fast diffusion of electrolyte ions in the longitudinal direction. In addition, this design limits the aggregation of Co3Se4 nanoparticles because of the high affinity of Co3Se4 on graphene. Benefiting from the high conductivity and fast ion transport bestowed by the ingenious architecture, the Co3Se4/holey graphene exhibits a remarkable rate performance of 519.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5.0 A g&#8722;1 and desirable cycle stability. Conclusions drawn from this investigation are that the transport of sodium inside the graphene&#8208;based composites is crucial for rate performance enhancement and this method is effective in modifying graphene&#8208;based nanomaterials as potential anode materials.

         <title>Assembly of Fillable Microrobotic Systems by Microfluidic Loading with Dip Sealing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated technique to fabricate fillable microrobotic systems is developed based on microfluidic loading with dip sealing (MLDS). The fillable chamber design isolates the loaded cargo from its surroundings, maintains cargo stability, and facilitates high loading capacity. This technique expands opportunities in microrobotics for targeted on&#8208;demand cargo release and biosensing with an all&#8208;in&#8208;one fabrication method.








Abstract
Microrobots can provide spatiotemporally well&#8208;controlled cargo delivery that can improve therapeutic efficiency compared to conventional drug delivery strategies. Robust microfabrication methods to expand the variety of materials or cargoes that can be incorporated into microrobots can greatly broaden the scope of their functions. However, current surface coating or direct blending techniques used for cargo loading result in inefficient loading and poor cargo protection during transportation, which leads to cargo waste, degradation and non&#8208;specific release. Herein, a versatile platform to fabricate fillable microrobots using microfluidic loading and dip sealing (MLDS) is presented. MLDS enables the encapsulation of different types of cargoes within hollow microrobots and protection of cargo integrity. The technique is supported by high&#8208;resolution 3D printing with an integrated microfluidic loading system, which realizes a highly precise loading process and improves cargo loading capacity. A corresponding dip sealing strategy is developed to encase and protect the loaded cargo whilst maintaining the geometric and structural integrity of the loaded microrobots. This dip sealing technique is suitable for different materials, including thermal and light&#8208;responsive materials. The MLDS platform provides new opportunities for microrobotic systems in targeted drug delivery, environmental sensing, and chemically powered micromotor applications.

         <title>All&#8208;Liquid Reconfigurable Electronics Using Jammed MXene Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structured liquids provide a route to self&#8208;assemble functional materials at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface and to shape liquids into arbitrary geometries. In this work, the high conductivity of MXenes is leveraged to create conductive pathways at the interface. The electrical properties of the assemblies are characterized and initial all&#8208;liquid electronic devices are presented.








Abstract
Rigid, solid&#8208;state components represent the current paradigm for electronic systems, but they lack post&#8208;production reconfigurability and pose ever&#8208;increasing challenges to efficient end&#8208;of&#8208;life recycling. Liquid electronics may overcome these limitations by offering flexible in&#8208;the&#8208;field redesign and separation at end&#8208;of&#8208;life via simple liquid phase chemistries. Up to now, preliminary work on liquid electronics has focused on liquid metal components, but these devices still require an encapsulating polymer and typically use alloys of rare elements like indium. Here, using the self&#8208;assembly of jammed 2D titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) MXene nanoparticles at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces, &#8220;all&#8208;liquid&#8221; electrically conductive sheets, wires, and simple functional devices are described including electromechanical switches and photodetectors. These assemblies combine the high conductivity of MXene nanosheets with the controllable form and reconfigurability of structured liquids. Such configurations can have applications not only in electronics, but also in catalysis and microfluidics, especially in systems where the product and substrate have affinity for solvents of differing polarity.

         <title>Heterogeneous Structure Omnidirectional Strain Sensor Arrays With Cognitively&#160;Learned Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An omnidirectional strain sensor array for electronic skin applications, which can detect and predict both the 360&#176; direction and strain intensity based on machine learning,&#160;is demonstrated. By adopting a learning algorithm based on the multiclass&#8211;multioutput model, highly accurate prediction of strain information is achieved.








Abstract
Mechanically stretchable strain sensors gain tremendous attention for bioinspired skin sensation systems and artificially intelligent tactile sensors. However, high&#8208;accuracy detection of both strain intensity and direction with simple device/array structures is still insufficient. To overcome this limitation, an omnidirectional strain perception platform utilizing a stretchable strain sensor array with triangular&#8208;sensor&#8208;assembly (three sensors tilted by 45&#176;) coupled with machine learning (ML) &#8208;based neural network classification algorithm, is proposed. The strain sensor, which is constructed with strain&#8208;insensitive electrode regions and strain&#8208;sensitive channel region, can minimize the undesirable electrical intrusion from the electrodes by strain, leading to a heterogeneous surface structure for more reliable strain sensing characteristics. The strain sensor exhibits decent sensitivity with gauge factor (GF) of &#8776;8, a moderate sensing range (&#8776;0&#8211;35%), and relatively good reliability (3000 stretching cycles). More importantly, by employing a multiclass&#8211;multioutput behavior&#8208;learned cognition algorithm, the stretchable sensor array with triangular&#8208;sensor&#8208;assembly exhibits highly accurate recognition of both direction and intensity of an arbitrary strain by interpretating the correlated signals from the three&#8208;unit sensors. The omnidirectional strain perception platform with its&#160;neural network algorithm exhibits overall strain intensity and direction accuracy around 98% &#177; 2% over a strain range of &#8776;0&#8211;30% in various surface stimuli environments.

Determination of crystal structures of nanocrystalline compounds is a great challenge in solid&#8208;state chemistry. In&#160;this&#160;work, an algorithm is introduced,&#160;which&#160;is able to determine the crystal structure of an unknown compound by means of an on&#8208;the&#8208;fly trained machine&#160;learning model that combines density functional calculations with comparison of calculated and measured pair distribution functions for global optimization.








Abstract
Determination of crystal structures of nanocrystalline or amorphous compounds is a great challenge in solid&#8208;state chemistry and physics. Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of X&#8208;ray or neutron total scattering&#160;data has proven to be a key element in tackling this challenge. However, in most cases, a reliable structural motif is needed as a&#160;starting configuration for structure refinements. Here, an algorithm that is able to determine the crystal structure of an unknown compound by means of an on&#8208;the&#8208;fly trained machine&#160;learning model,&#160;which&#160;combines density functional theory calculations with comparison of calculated and measured PDFs for global optimization in an artificial landscape, is presented. Due to the nature of this landscape, even metastable configurations and stacking disorders can be identified.

         <title>Harvesting Triplet Excitons in High Mobility Emissive Organic Semiconductor for Efficiency Enhancement of Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triplet excitons in high mobility emissive semiconductor 2,6&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA) are successfully harvested via triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation and further increased by doping a highly emissive guest. The exciton utilization and device efficiency of DPA are significantly improved in organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs). This concept can be extended to other advanced high mobility emissive organic semiconductors for promoting the development of OLETs and related functional devices.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs), a kind of highly integrated and minimized optoelectronic device, demonstrate great potential applications in various fields. The construction of high&#8208;performance OLETs requires the integration of high charge carrier mobility, strong emission, and high triplet exciton utilization efficiency in the active layer. However, it remains a significant long&#8208;term challenge, especially for single component active layer OLETs. Herein, the successful harvesting of triplet excitons in a high mobility emissive molecule, 2,6&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA), through the triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation process is demonstrated. By incorporating a highly emissive guest into the DPA host system, an obvious increase in photoluminescence efficiency along with exciton utilization efficiency results in an obvious enhancement of external quantum efficiency of 7.2&#160;times for OLETs compared to the non&#8208;doped devices. Moreover, well&#8208;tunable multi&#8208;color electroluminescence, especially white emission with Commission Internationale del'Eclairage&#160; of (0.31, 0.35), from OLETs is also achieved by modulating the doping concentration with a controlled energy transfer process. This work opens a new avenue for integrating strong emission and efficient exciton utilization in high&#8208;mobility organic semiconductors for high&#8208;performance OLETs and advancing their related functional device applications.

         <title>Nanocomposite Engineering of a High&#8208;Capacity Partially Ordered Cathode for Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multi&#8208;phase heterogeneous nature of ultrahigh&#8208;energy Mn&#8208;based partially disordered cathodes is revealed by combined experimental and computational studies. This fundamental understanding enables the novel nanocomposite design, which controls a phase fraction within a single particle. Consequently, T30 cathode via a nanocomposite engineering shows more reversible redox properties and a superior cycle retention, showing new insights into developing advanced Mn&#8208;based cathodes.








Abstract
Understanding the local cation order in the crystal structure and its correlation with electrochemical performances has advanced the development of high&#8208;energy Mn&#8208;rich cathode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries, notably Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered cathodes (LMR, e.g., Li1.2Ni0.13Mn0.54Co0.13O2) that are considered as nanocomposite layered materials with C2/m Li2MnO3&#8208;type medium&#8208;range order (MRO). Moreover, the Li&#8208;transport rate in high&#8208;capacity Mn&#8208;based disordered rock&#8208;salt (DRX) cathodes (e.g., Li1.2Mn0.4Ti0.4O2) is found to be influenced by the short&#8208;range order of cations, underlining the importance of engineering the local cation order in designing high&#8208;energy materials. Herein, the nanocomposite is revealed, with&#160;a&#160;heterogeneous nature (like MRO found in LMR) of ultrahigh&#8208;capacity partially ordered cathodes (e.g., Li1.68Mn1.6O3.7F0.3) made of distinct domains of spinel&#8208;, DRX&#8208; and layered&#8208;like phases, contrary to conventional single&#8208;phase DRX cathodes. This multi&#8208;scale understanding of ordering informs engineering the nanocomposite material via Ti doping, altering the intra&#8208;particle characteristics to increase the content of the rock&#8208;salt phase and heterogeneity within a particle. This strategy markedly improves the reversibility of both Mn&#8208; and O&#8208;redox processes to enhance the cycling stability of the partially ordered DRX cathodes (nearly &#8776;30% improvement of capacity retention). This work sheds light on the importance of nanocomposite engineering to develop ultrahigh&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost Li&#8208;ion cathode materials.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Pure Red TADF Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes With High External Quantum Efficiency and Saturated Red Emission Color</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TADF emitter tBuTPA&#8208;CNQx is designed and synthesized to enable highly efficient pure red emitting solution&#8208;processed OLEDs. Relying on its small &#916;EST of 0.07&#160;eV, high PLQY of 92%, and high KRISC of 3.98&#160;&#215;&#160;105 s&#8722;1, solution&#8208;processed OLED doped with tBuTPA&#8208;CNQx exhibit a high EQE of 16.7% at 662&#160;nm with CIE coordinates of (0.67, 0.32).








Abstract
In spite of recent research progress in red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, highly efficient solution&#8208;processable pure red TADF emitters are rarely reported. Most of the red TADF emitters reported to date are designed using a rigid acceptor unit which renders them insoluble and unsuitable for solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). To resolve this issue, a novel TADF emitter, 6,7&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl)amino)phenyl)&#8208;2,3&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl)quinoxaline&#8208;5,8&#8208;dicarbonitrile (tBuTPA&#8208;CNQx) is designed and synthesized. The highly twisted donor&#8208;acceptor architecture and appropriate highest occupied molecular orbital/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital distribution lead to a very small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of 0.07&#160;eV, high photoluminescence quantum yield of 92%, and short delayed fluorescence lifetime of 52.4&#160;&#181;s. The peripheral t&#8208;butyl phenyl decorated quinoxaline acceptor unit and t&#8208;butyl protected triphenylamine donor unit are proven to be useful building blocks to improve solubility and minimize the intermolecular interaction. The solution&#8208;processed OLED based on tBuTPA&#8208;CNQx achieves a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 16.7% with a pure red emission peak at 662 nm, which is one of the highest EQE values reported till date in the solution&#8208;processed pure red TADF OLEDs. Additionally, vacuum&#8208;processable OLED based on tBuTPA&#8208;CNQx exhibits a high EQE of 22.2% and negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off.

         <title>Interface Modulation of Metal Sulfide Anodes for Long&#8208;Cycle&#8208;Life Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new capacity fading mechanism of metal sulfide electrode materials is discovered, that is, the parasitic reaction between electrolyte anions and metal sulfides. Herein, a universal strategy is proposed to manipulate the electrolyte decomposition and construct a stable and ion&#8208;conductive solid electrolyte interphase that prevents the corrosive side reactions and leads to prolonged cycle life.








Abstract
Although studies of transition metal sulfides (TMS) as anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries are extensively reported, the short cycle life is still a thorny problem that impedes their practical application. In this work, a new capacity fading mechanism of the TMS electrodes is demonstrated; that is, the parasitic reaction between electrolyte anions (i.e., ClO4&#8722;) and metal sulfides yields non&#8208;conductive and unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and meanwhile, corrosively turns metal sulfides into less&#8208;active oxides. This knowledge guides the development of an electrochemical strategy to manipulate the anion decomposition and construct a stable interface that prevents extensive parasitic reactions. It is shown that introducing sodium nitrate to the electrolyte radically changes the Na+ solvation structure by populating nitrate ions in the first solvation sheath, generating a stable and conductive SEI layer containing both Na3N and NaF. The optimized interface enables an iron sulfide anode to stably cycle for over 2000 cycles with negligible capacity loss, and a similar enhancement in cycle performance is demonstrated on a number of other metal sulfides. This work discloses metal sulfides&#8217; cycling failure mechanism from a unique perspective and highlights the critical importance of manipulating the interface chemistry in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Fabrication of Size&#8208;Controlled Pickering Emulsions, Colloidosomes, and Air&#8208;Coated Particles via Clog&#8208;Free Jetting of Suspensions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clog&#8208;free jetting of dense nanoparticle suspension and polymer solution is successfully realized by "jetting through&#160;a&#160;liquid layer" (JetALL). This technique&#160;enables the scalable jetting fabrication of size&#8208;controlled microcapsules with hydrophobic shells that form stable antibubbles (droplets encapsulated by a thin air shell underwater) for better controlled release. JetALL plays a key role in microencapsulation for drug delivery, preservation of food ingredients, and gas sensing.








Abstract
Microcapsules with a liquid core and a solid shell composed of hydrophobic nanoparticles are broadly applied in food, pharmaceutics, and biotechnologies. For example, Pickering emulsions, colloidosomes, or antibubbles (droplets surrounded by air layers in water) enable controlled release of active agents, biocompatibility, and contact&#8208;less liquid transportation. However, producing controlled nanoparticle&#8208; or polymer&#8208;laden hydrophobic shells at scale is highly challenging, since bulk methods are polydisperse and microfluidic chips are prone to clogging and slow. Here, clog&#8208;free coating of an aqueous jet with silica nanoparticle suspensions with concentrations up to 10% (w/v), as well as high concentrations of polymers (30% (w/v) poly(lactic acid) (PLA)), is demonstrated, enabling continuous generation of microcapsules at flow rates up to 4&#160;mL&#160;min&#8722;1. Pickering emulsions are converted into capsules, providing hydrophobic shells consisting of nanoparticles for controlled release. As a highlight, the scalable fabrication of&#160;air&#8208;coated capsules (antibubbles) in the sub&#8208;millimeter range is demonstrated. The shell contains an air film that protects the liquid core for days yet enables ultrasound&#8208;induced release within 3 min. By enabling rapid fabrication of controlled Pickering emulsions, colloidosomes, antibubbles, and biodegradable capsules, jetting through a liquid layer (JetALL) provides a versatile platform for advanced applications in food, pharmacy, and life science.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Localized Vibrations at Complex Grain Boundaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Localized measurements of vibrations in the dislocation cores of a complex grain boundary are correlated with structure and nonstoichiometry using monochromated electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope. The experimental results are correlated with density functional theory calculations to understand the atomistic influence of the unique structure and chemistry of grain boundary dislocations and their influence on atomic vibrations.








Abstract
Grain boundaries (GBs) are a prolific microstructural feature that dominates the functionality of a wide class of materials. The functionality at a GB results from the unique atomic arrangements, different from those in the grain, that have driven extensive experimental and theoretical studies correlating atomic&#8208;scale GB structures to macroscopic electronic, infrared optical, and thermal properties. In this work, a SrTiO3 GB is examined using atomic&#8208;resolution aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and ultrahigh&#8208;energy&#8208;resolution monochromated electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy, in conjunction with density functional theory. This combination enables the correlation of the GB structure, nonstoichiometry, and chemical bonding with a redistribution of vibrational states within the GB dislocation cores. The new experimental access to localized GB vibrations provides a direct route to quantifying the impact of individual boundaries on macroscopic properties.

Biomimetic design of universal nanovaccine platform is introduced by taking advantage of tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;derived components and genetically engineered antibody&#8208;anchored membrane. The nanovaccines can be cross&#8208;presented on dendritic cells (DCs) to activate antigen&#8208;specific T cells. The incorporation of agonistic antibody anti&#8208;CD40 single chain variable fragment into the nanovaccines facilitates DC maturation, which in turn activates tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells.








Abstract
Despite the promise in whole&#8208;tumor cell vaccines, a key challenge is to overcome the lack of costimulatory signals. Here, agonistic&#8208;antibody&#8208;boosted tumor cell nanovaccines are reported by genetically engineered antibody&#8208;anchored membrane (AAM) technology, capable of effectively activating costimulatory pathways. Specifically, the AAM can be stably constructed following genetic engineering of tumor cell membranes with anti&#8208;CD40 single chain variable fragment (scFv), an agonistic antibody to induce costimulatory signals. The nanovaccines are versatilely designed and obtained based on the anti&#8208;CD40 scFv&#8208;anchored membrane and nanotechnology. Following vaccination, the anti&#8208;CD40 scFv&#8208;anchored membrane nanovaccine (Nano&#8208;AAM/CD40) significantly facilitates dendritic cell maturation in CD40&#8208;humanized transgenic mice and subsequent adaptive immune responses. Compared to membrane&#8208;based nanovaccines alone, the enhanced antitumor efficacy in both &#8220;hot&#8221; and &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor models of the Nano&#8208;AAM/CD40 demonstrates the importance of agonistic antibodies in development of tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;based vaccines. To expand the design of nanovaccines, further incorporation of cell lysates into the Nano&#8208;AAM/CD40 to conceptually construct tumor cell&#8208;like nanovaccines results in boosted immune responses and improved antitumor efficacy against malignant tumors inoculated into CD40&#8208;humanized transgenic mice. Overall, this genetically engineered AAM technology provides a versatile design of nanovaccines by incorporation of tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;based components and agonistic antibodies of costimulatory immune checkpoints.

         <title>Topological Metal MoP Nanowire for Interconnect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological metal molybdenum phosphide (MoP) nanowires are demonstrated as a new class of interconnect material for on&#8208;chip applications. Owing to its high carrier density, low resistivity, and short electron mean free path, MoP nanowires exhibit dimensional scaling of resistivity far superior to effective copper (Cu) and ruthenium&#160;(Ru). MoP is also oxidation resistant and has a high cohesive energy, potentially enabling a barrier&#8208;free interconnect design. Thus, this work demonstrates MoP as a breakthrough material for interconnect technologies for continued downscaling of integrated circuits and future energy&#8208;efficient computing.








Abstract
The increasing resistance of copper (Cu) interconnects for decreasing dimensions is a major challenge in continued downscaling of integrated circuits beyond the 7&#160;nm technology node&#160;as it leads to unacceptable signal delays and power consumption in computing. The resistivity of Cu increases due to electron scattering at surfaces and grain boundaries at the nanoscale. Topological semimetals, owing to their topologically protected surface states and suppressed electron backscattering, are promising candidates to potentially replace current Cu interconnects. Here,&#160;we report the unprecedented resistivity scaling of topological metal molybdenum phosphide (MoP) nanowires, and it is shown that the resistivity values are superior to those of nanoscale Cu interconnects &lt;500&#160;nm2 cross&#8208;section areas. The cohesive energy of MoP suggests better stability against electromigration, enabling a barrier&#8208;free design . MoP nanowires are more resistant to surface oxidation than the 20&#160;nm thick Cu. The thermal conductivity of MoP is comparable to those of Ru and Co. Most importantly, it is demonstrated that the dimensional scaling of MoP, in terms of line resistance versus total cross&#8208;sectional area, is competitive to those of effective Cu with barrier/liner and barrier&#8208;less Ru, suggesting MoP is an attractive alternative for the scaling challenge of Cu interconnects.

         <title>Membrane Protein Modification Modulates Big and Small Extracellular Vesicle Biodistribution and Tumorigenic Potential in Breast Cancers In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Big and small extracellular vesicles circulate differentially and confer tumorigenic function modulatable by extracellular vesicle (EV) membrane proteins. Malignant breast cancers release more big EVs, in addition to small EVs, than normal cells to target organs and individually promote tumor growth via tumor&#8208;progression&#8208;associated EV surface membrane proteins.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by cells to mediate intercellular communication under pathological and physiological conditions. While small EVs (sEVs; &lt;100&#8211;200&#160;nm, exosomes) are intensely investigated, the properties and functions of medium and large EVs (big EVs (bEVs); &gt;200&#160;nm, microvesicles) are less well explored. Here, bEVs and sEVs are identified as distinct EV populations, and it is determined that bEVs are released in a greater bEV:sEV ratio in the aggressive human triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype. PalmGRET, bioluminescence&#8208;resonance&#8208;energy&#8208;transfer (BRET)&#8208;based EV reporter, reveals dose&#8208;dependent EV biodistribution at nonlethal and physiological EV dosages, as compared to lipophilic fluorescent dyes. Remarkably, the bEVs and sEVs exhibit unique biodistribution profiles, yet individually promote in vivo tumor growth in a syngeneic immunocompetent TNBC breast tumor murine model. The bEVs and sEVs share mass&#8208;spectrometry&#8208;identified tumor&#8208;progression&#8208;associated EV surface membrane proteins (tpEVSurfMEMs), which include solute carrier family 29 member 1, Cd9, and Cd44. tpEVSurfMEM depletion attenuates EV lung organotropism, alters biodistribution, and reduces protumorigenic potential. This study identifies distinct in vivo property and function of bEVs and sEVs in breast cancer, which suggest the significant role of bEVs in diseases, diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

         <title>A Matrix&#8208;Metalloproteinase&#8208;Responsive Hydrogel System for Modulating the Immune Microenvironment in Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2/9&#8208;responsive hydrogel system (MPGC4) are developed based on the post&#8208;myocardial infarction (MI) microenvironment. MPGC4 can be triggered by highly expressed MMP2/9 after MI to release on&#8208;demand interleukin&#8208;4 plasmid DNA that promote M2 macrophage polarization early in the infarction and participate in inflammatory repair. MPGC4 also inhibited the activity of MMP2/9 and reduced the degradation of cardiac extracellular matrix.








Abstract
Injectable hydrogels carrying therapeutic factors to modulate the infarct immune microenvironment show great potential in the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI). However, conventional injectable hydrogels release therapeutic factors in an uncontrolled manner, which leads to poor treatment efficacy and acute side effects on normal tissues. In&#160;this&#160;work, a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2/9&#8208;responsive hydrogel system (MPGC4) is developed, considering the characteristics of the post&#8208;MI microenvironment. MPGC4 consists of tetra&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels and a composite gene nanocarrier (CTL4) that is composed of carbon dots (CDots) coupled with interleukin&#8208;4 plasmid DNA via electrostatic interactions. MPGC4 can be automatically triggered to release CTL4 on demand after MI to regulate the infarct immune microenvironment. In addition, due to the photoluminescence properties of CDots, a large amount of viscoelastic MPGC4 is found to be retained in situ after injection into the infarct region without leakage. The in vitro results demonstrate that CTL4 promotes proinflammatory M1 macrophage polarization to the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 subtype and contributes to cardiomyocyte survival through macrophage transition. In a rat model of MI, MPGC4 clears MMPs and precisely targets CTL4 to the infarcted region. In particular, MPGC4 improves cardiac function by modulating macrophage transition to reduce early inflammatory responses and proangiogenic activity.

         <title>Triple Threshold Transitions and Strong Polariton Interaction in 2D Layered Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Microplates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic framework is&#160;introduced&#160;as a new type of quantum material, with naturally formed polariton cavities, that&#160;is a cost&#8208;effective and scalable solution to develop next&#8208;gen microscale quantum light sources and polaritonic devices.








Abstract

         <title>Dynamically Tunable Optical Cavities with Embedded Nematic Liquid Crystalline Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new tuning mechanism for Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot resonators, that employs reversible mechanical adaptations of a polymer network to dynamically tune the reflectance,&#160;is&#160;developed. A&#160;liquid crystalline network is&#160;incorporated&#160;between metallic mirrors, to show large, reversible and highly linear spectral tuning of reflection resonances over the entire visible and near&#8208;infrared spectral regions with absolute modulation &#916;R&#160;=&#160;79%.








Abstract
Tunable metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;metal (MIM) Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (FP) cavities that can dynamically control light enable novel sensing, imaging&#160;and display applications. However, the realization of dynamic cavities incorporating stimuli&#8208;responsive materials poses a significant engineering challenge. Current approaches rely on refractive index modulation and suffer from low dynamic tunability, high losses, and limited spectral ranges, and require liquid and hazardous materials for operation. To overcome these challenges, a new tuning mechanism employing reversible mechanical adaptations of a polymer network is proposed, and dynamic tuning of optical resonances is demonstrated. Solid&#8208;state temperature&#8208;responsive optical coatings are developed by preparing a monodomain nematic liquid crystalline network (LCN) and are incorporated between metallic mirrors to form active optical microcavities. LCN microcavities offer large, reversible and highly linear spectral tuning of FP resonances reaching wavelength&#8208;shifts up to 40&#160;nm via thermomechanical actuation while featuring outstanding repeatability and precision over more than 100 heating&#8211;cooling cycles. This degree of tunability allows for reversible switching between the reflective and the absorbing states of the device over the entire visible and near&#8208;infrared spectral regions, reaching large changes in reflectance with modulation efficiency &#916;R&#160;=&#160;79%.

         <title>Metasurface&#8208;Enabled Holographic Lithography for Impact&#8208;Absorbing Nanoarchitected Sheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optical metasurfaces are utilized to fabricate polymer nanoarchitected sheets with a thickness of 30&#8211;40 &#181;m and lateral dimensions of 2.1&#160;&#215;&#160;2.4 cm2. Nanoindentation reveals the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane elastic modulus to vary between 0.3 and 4 GPa. Laser&#160;induced particle impact tests indicate specific inelastic energy dissipation of 0.51&#8211;2.61 MJ kg&#8722;1 which is comparable to other high&#160;impact energy absorbing composites and nanomaterials.








Abstract
Nanoarchitected materials represent a class of structural meta&#8208;materials that utilze nanoscale features to achieve unconventional material properties such as ultralow density and high energy absorption. A dearth of fabrication methods capable of producing architected materials with sub&#8208;micrometer resolution over large areas in a scalable manner exists. A fabrication technique is presented that employs holographic patterns generated by laser exposure of phase metasurface masks in negative&#8208;tone photoresists to produce 30&#8211;40 &#181;m&#8208;thick nanoarchitected sheets with 2.1 &#215; 2.4 cm2 lateral dimensions and &#8776;500 nm&#8208;wide struts organized in layered 3D brick&#8208;and&#8208;mortar&#8208;like patterns to result in &#8776;50&#8211;70% porosity. Nanoindentation arrays over the entire sample area reveal the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane elastic modulus to vary between 300 MPa and 4 GPa, with irrecoverable post&#8208;elastic material deformation commencing via individual nanostrut buckling, densification within layers, shearing along perturbation perimeter, and tensile cracking. Laser&#160;induced particle impact tests (LIPIT) indicate specific inelastic energy dissipation of 0.51&#8211;2.61 MJ kg&#8722;1, which is comparable to other high impact energy absorbing composites and nanomaterials, such as Kevlar/poly(vinyl butyral)&#160;(PVB) composite, polystyrene, and pyrolized carbon nanolattices with 23% relative density. These results demonstrate that holographic lithography offers a promising platform for scalable manufacturing of nanoarchitected materials with impact resistant&#160;capabilities.

         <title>Non&#8208;Destructive Low&#8208;Temperature Contacts to MoS2 Nanoribbon and Nanotube Quantum Dots</title>

Molybdenum disulfide nanoribbons and nanotubes grown from vapor phase are a low&#8208;defect&#8208;density nanomaterial highly promising for quantum electronic applications. Devices integrating them with bismuth&#8208;based contacts show strongly reduced contact resistances and a marked absence of trap states at cryogenic temperatures. This allows for quantum&#8208;dot Coulomb blockade measurements. Single&#8208;level quantum transport is observed at temperatures below 100mK.








Abstract
Molybdenum disulfide nanoribbons and nanotubes are quasi&#8208;1D&#160;semiconductors with strong spin&#8211;orbit interaction, a nanomaterial highly promising for quantum electronic applications. Here, it is demonstrated that a bismuth semimetal layer between the contact metal and this nanomaterial strongly improves the properties of the contacts. Two&#8208;point resistances on the order of 100&#160;k&#937; are observed at room temperature. At cryogenic temperature, Coulomb blockade is visible. The resulting stability diagrams indicate a marked absence of trap states at the contacts and the corresponding disorder, compared to previous devices that use low&#8208;work&#8208;function metals as contacts. Single&#8208;level quantum transport is observed at temperatures below 100&#160;mK.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Ni&#8211;Cu Catalysts for pH&#8208;Universal CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared with alkaline and neutral electrolytes, using an acidic electrolyte for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) can significantly improve the carbon utilization efficiency. Herein, a Ni&#8211;Cu dual&#8208;atom electrocatalyst is developed for pH&#8208;universal CO2 electroreduction, which shows superior catalytic performance due to the electronic interaction between the Ni and the Cu. In particular, the carbon utilization efficiency increases from 33.0% to 64.3%.








Abstract
CO2 electroreduction is of great significance to reduce CO2 emissions and complete the carbon cycle. However, the unavoidable carbonate formation and low CO2 utilization efficiency in neutral or alkaline electrolytes hinder its application at commercial scale. The development of CO2 reduction under acidic conditions provides a promising strategy, but the inhibition of the hydrogen evolution reaction is difficult. Herein, the first work to design a Ni&#8211;Cu dual atom catalyst supported on hollow nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon is reported for pH&#8208;universal CO2 electroreduction to CO. The catalyst shows a high CO Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;99% in acidic, neutral, and alkaline electrolytes, and the partial current densities of CO reach 190 &#177; 11, 225 &#177; 10, and 489 &#177; 14&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. In particular, the CO2 utilization efficiency under acidic conditions reaches 64.3%, which is twice as high as that of alkaline conditions.

     alt="Atomically Dispersed Ni&#8211;Cu Catalysts for pH-Universal CO2 Electroreduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with alkaline and neutral electrolytes, using an acidic electrolyte for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) can significantly improve the carbon utilization efficiency. Herein, a Ni&#8211;Cu dual-atom electrocatalyst is developed for pH-universal CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction, which shows superior catalytic performance due to the electronic interaction between the Ni and the Cu. In particular, the carbon utilization efficiency increases from 33.0% to 64.3%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction is of great significance to reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and complete the carbon cycle. However, the unavoidable carbonate formation and low CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization efficiency in neutral or alkaline electrolytes hinder its application at commercial scale. The development of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction under acidic conditions provides a promising strategy, but the inhibition of the hydrogen evolution reaction is difficult. Herein, the first work to design a Ni&#8211;Cu dual atom catalyst supported on hollow nitrogen-doped carbon is reported for pH-universal CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction to CO. The catalyst shows a high CO Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;99% in acidic, neutral, and alkaline electrolytes, and the partial current densities of CO reach 190 &#177; 11, 225 &#177; 10, and 489 &#177; 14&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. In particular, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization efficiency under acidic conditions reaches 64.3%, which is twice as high as that of alkaline conditions. Detailed study indicates the existence of electronic interaction between Ni and Cu atoms. The Cu atoms push the Ni d-band center further toward the Fermi level, thereby accelerating the formation of *COOH. In addition, operando characterizations and density functional theory calculation are used to elucidate the possible reaction mechanism of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO under acidic and alkaline electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Resolution of MoS2 Nanosheets&#8208;Induced Pulmonary Inflammation Driven by Nanoscale Intracellular Transformation and Extracellular&#8208;Vesicle Shuttles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoS2 nanosheets trigger lung inflammation that is fast recovered, although the products derived from their degradation remain in the alveolar macrophages and in the extracellular vesicles for&#160;up to 30 days. The&#160;in&#160;vivo&#160;biotransformation&#160;of&#160;MoS2 is caused by reactive oxygen species following three mechanisms: scrolling, etching, and oxidation, generating molybdate ions and oxide nanoparticles.








Abstract
Pulmonary exposure to some engineered nanomaterials can cause chronic lesions as a result of unresolved inflammation. Among 2D nanomaterials and graphene, MoS2 has received tremendous attention in optoelectronics and nanomedicine. Here an integrated approach is proposed to follow up the transformation of MoS2 nanosheets at the nanoscale and assesss&#160;their impact on lung inflammation status over 1 month after a single inhalation in mice. Analysis of immune cells, alveolar macrophages, extracellular vesicles, and cytokine profiling in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) shows that MoS2 nanosheets induced initiation of lung inflammation. However, the inflammation is rapidly resolved despite the persistence of various biotransformed molybdenum&#8208;based nanostructures in the alveolar macrophages and the extracellular vesicles for&#160;up to 1 month. Using in situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy experiments, the dynamics of MoS2 nanosheets transformation triggered by reactive oxygen species could be evidenced. Three main transformation mechanisms are observed directly at the nanoscale level: 1) scrolling of the dispersed sheets leading to the formation of nanoscrolls and folded patches, 2) etching releasing soluble MoO4&#8722;, and 3) oxidation generating oxidized sheet fragments. Extracellular vesicles released in BALF are also identified as a potential shuttle of MoS2 nanostructures and their degradation products and more importantly as mediators of inflammation resolution.

         <title>Microfluidics&#8208;enabled Serial Assembly of Lipid&#8208;siRNA&#8208;sorafenib Nanoparticles for Synergetic Hepatocellular Carcinoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of microfluidics&#8208;enabled serial assembly is used to assemble multi&#8208;component nanoparticles step&#8208;by&#8208;step. This versatile microfluidic platform can accommodate both fast and slow processes to sequentially enable the assembly of sorafenib supramolecule, electrostatic adsorption of siRNA, and surface assembly of lipids. The improved performances are observed in the produced lipid&#8208;siRNA&#8208;sorafenib nanoparticles, including ultrahigh encapsulation efficiency, transfection efficiency, and anti&#8208;tumor effects.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;component nanoparticles (mNPs) hold great potential for disease prevention and treatment. However, a major barrier is the lack of versatile platforms to accommodate steps of assembly processes of mNPs. Here the microfluidics&#8208;enabled serial assembly (MESA) of mNPs is presented. The microfluidic chip, as a mini&#8208;conveyor of initial materials, sequentially enables the assembly of sorafenib supramolecule, electrostatic adsorption of siRNA, and surface assembly of protective lipids. The produced lipid&#8208;siRNA&#8208;sorafenib nanoparticles (LSS NPs) have ultrahigh encapsulation efficiencies for sorafenib (&#8776;100%) and siRNA (&#8776;95%), which benefit from the accommodation of both fast and slow processes on the chip. Although carrying negative charges, LSS NPs enable cytosolic delivery of agents and high gene silencing efficiency within tumor cells. In vivo, the LSS NPs delivering hypoxia&#8208;induced factor (HIF1&#945;)&#8208;targeted siRNA efficiently regress tumors of Hep3B xenograft and hepatocellular carcinoma patient&#8208;derived primary cells xenograft (PDCX) and finally extend the average survival of PDCX mice to 68 days. Thus, this strategy is promising as a sorafenib/siRNA combination therapy, and MESA can be a universal platform for fabricating complex nanosystems.

         <title>High&#8208;Q Nanophotonics over the Full Visible Spectrum Enabled by Hexagonal Boron Nitride Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors demonstrate how the combination of low&#8208;refractive&#8208;index resonator materials such as hexagonal boron nitride and symmetry&#8208;broken bound states in the continuum overcomes the lack of high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index and lossless materials in the visible&#160;region. Following this approach, high&#8208;Q photonic resonances over the full visible spectrum are realized and used to enhance second&#8208;harmonic generation in the ultraviolet&#160;region.








Abstract
All&#8208;dielectric optical metasurfaces with high quality (Q) factors have been hampered by the lack of simultaneously lossless and high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index materials over the full visible spectrum. In fact, the use of low&#8208;refractive&#8208;index materials is unavoidable for extending the spectral coverage due to the inverse correlation between the bandgap energy (and therefore the optical losses) and the refractive index (n). However, for Mie resonant photonics, smaller refractive indices&#160;are associated with reduced Q factors and low mode volume confinement. Here, symmetry&#8208;broken quasi&#160;bound&#160;states in the continuum (qBICs) are&#160;leveraged&#160;to efficiently suppress radiation losses from the low&#8208;index (n&#160;&#8776;&#160;2) van der Waals material hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), realizing metasurfaces with high&#8208;Q resonances over the complete visible spectrum. The rational use of low&#8208; and high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index materials as resonator components is analyzed and the insights are harnessed to experimentally demonstrate sharp qBIC resonances with Q factors above 300, spanning wavelengths between 400&#160;and 1000&#160;nm from a single hBN flake. Moreover, the enhanced electric near fields are utilized to demonstrate second&#8208;harmonic generation with enhancement factors above 102. These&#160;results provide a theoretical and experimental framework for the implementation of low&#8208;refractive&#8208;index materials as photonic media for metaoptics.

         <title>All&#8208;Optical Switching Based on Sub&#8208;Bandgap Photoactivation of Charge Trapping in Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoluminescence (PL) of perovskite can be switched by other light with sub&#8208;bandgap photon energy in a broad spectral range with high stability. This effect is controlled by photosensitive defects, in which concentration is modified by the&#160;crystal stoichiometry. This finding indicates a new application area of metal halide perovskites in optical switches, transistors, and memory.








Abstract
Controllable optical properties are crucial for the application of light&#8208;emitting materials in optical devices. In this work, controllable photoluminescence in metal halide perovskite crystals is realized via photoactivation of their defects. It is found that under continuous excitation, the photoluminescence intensity of a CH3NH3PbBr3 crystal can be fully controlled by sub&#8208;bandgap energy photon illumination. Such optically controllable emission behavior is rather general as it is observed also in CsPbBr3 and other perovskite materials. The switching mechanism is assigned to reversible light&#8208;induced activation/deactivation of nonradiative recombination centers, the presence of which relates to an excess of Pb during perovskite synthesis. Given the success of perovskites in photovoltaics and optoelectronics, it is believed that the discovery of green luminescence controlled by red illumination will extend the application scope of perovskites toward optical devices and intelligent control.

This effect is controlled by photosensitive defects, in which concentration is modified by the&#160;crystal stoichiometry. This finding indicates a new application area of metal halide perovskites in optical switches, transistors, and memory.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controllable optical properties are crucial for the application of light-emitting materials in optical devices. In this work, controllable photoluminescence in metal halide perovskite crystals is realized via photoactivation of their defects. It is found that under continuous excitation, the photoluminescence intensity of a CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystal can be fully controlled by sub-bandgap energy photon illumination. Such optically controllable emission behavior is rather general as it is observed also in CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and other perovskite materials. The switching mechanism is assigned to reversible light-induced activation/deactivation of nonradiative recombination centers, the presence of which relates to an excess of Pb during perovskite synthesis. Given the success of perovskites in photovoltaics and optoelectronics, it is believed that the discovery of green luminescence controlled by red illumination will extend the application scope of perovskites toward optical devices and intelligent control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxygen Vacancies in Piezoelectric ZnO Twin&#8208;Mesocrystal to Improve Peroxymonosulfate Utilization Efficiency via Piezo&#8208;Activation for Antibiotic Ornidazole Removal</title>

         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric ZnO mesocrystals with different oxygen vacancy (OVs) concentrations are quantitatively regulated as models for understanding the role of OVs in piezoelectric&#8208;catalysis for peroxymonosulfate&#160;(PMS) activation. The ZnO with a moderate OVs concentration realizes increased electron delocalization, reduced charge transfer barrier, and enhanced reactants affinity, thus accelerating the kinetics of PMS activation.








Abstract
Piezoelectric mesocrystals as defective materials have been demonstrated to possess adsorptive and catalytic properties in redox reactions. However, there is still a lack of research on the quantitative relationship between the defect concentration and the piezocatalytic performance in piezoelectric mesocrystals. Herein, twin&#8208;hierarchical structure ZnO piezoelectric mesocrystals are taken with different oxygen&#8208;vacancies (OVs) concentrations to quantitatively investigate the effect of defect content on the peroxymonosulfate (PMS) piezo&#8208;activation in water purification. The ZnO piezoelectric mesocrystal with moderate OVs concentration exhibits a rapid antibiotic ornidazole (ORZ) pollutants degradation rate (0.034&#160;min&#8722;1) and achieves a high PMS utilization efficiency (0.162) that exceeds the most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalytic processes, while excessive OVs suppressed the piezocatalytic performance. Through calculations of electron property and reactants affinity, a quantitative relationship between OVs concentration and piezocatalytic properties is established. The ZnO mesocrystal with moderate OVs concentration realized increased electron delocalization, reduced charge transfer barrier, and enhanced reactants affinity, thus accelerating the kinetics of PMS activation. This work provides theoretical guidance for the application of defect engineering in mesocrystal to realize enhanced piezocatalytic performance.

         <title>Direct Observation of Oxygen Atoms Taking Tetrahedral Interstitial Sites in Medium&#8208;Entropy Body&#8208;Centered&#8208;Cubic Solutions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interstitial solutes normally occupy the octahedral interstices in body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic metals. Using deep&#8208;sub&#8208;angstrom&#8208;resolution electron ptychography, this work provides the first experimental evidence to directly observe individual oxygen atoms, and shows a switch in preference to the unusual tetrahedral sites at high oxygen concentrations in a medium&#8208;entropy alloy.








Abstract
Interstitial solutes, such as carbon in steels, are effective solid&#8208;solution hardening agents. These alloying elements are believed to occupy the octahedral interstices in body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (bcc) metals. Using deep&#8208;sub&#8208;angstrom&#8208;resolution electron ptychography, here&#160;the first experimental evidence to directly observe individual oxygen atoms in a highly concentrated bcc solid solution&#8212;the (TiNbZr)86O12C1N1 medium&#8208;entropy alloy (MEA)&#8212;is&#160;provided, whereby&#160;the interstitial sites in which&#160;the&#160;oxygen&#160;atoms are located&#160;are discerned. In addition to oxygen interstitials residing in octahedral sites, the first unambiguous evidence of a switch in preference to the unusual tetrahedral sites at high oxygen concentrations&#160;is&#160;shown. This shift away from octahedral occupancy is explained as resulting from the extra cost of strain energy when the requisite displacement of the host atoms is deterred in the presence of nearby octahedral interstitials.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Crosslinked, Highly Entangled Hydrogels with Excellent Mechanical Properties but Ultra&#8208;Low Solid Content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully swollen hydrogel with ultra&#8208;low solid content (5.8%) but excellent mechanical properties, including high stretchability (440%), high tensile strength (220 KPa), superb resilience (99%), high fracture toughness (2100 J&#160;m&#8722;2), excellent fatigue resistance (720 J&#160;m&#8722;2), low friction (0.0059), and high wear resistance, are successfully synthesized by combining two recently developed approaches.








Abstract
Low&#160;solid&#160;content&#160;is&#160;the&#160;ultimate&#160;reason&#160;for&#160;the&#160;brittleness&#160;and&#160;weakness of ordinary hydrogels. Here, hydrogels with ultra&#8208;low solid content but good mechanical properties are successfully synthesized using high monomer concentrations and low cross&#8208;linker/monomer ratios to obtain highly entangled structure&#160;and poly(l&#8208;lysine)&#8208;based cross&#8208;linker&#160;to&#160;introduce&#160;peptide&#160;chains. Compared with hydrogel cross&#8208;linked with N,N'&#8208;methylenebisacrylamide (BIS), the peptide&#8208;crosslinked one has a larger swelling degree in water, leading to fully swollen gel with ultra&#8208;low solid content (5.8%). However, it still exhibits excellent mechanical properties, including high stretchability (440%), high tensile strength (220 KPa), superb resilience (99%), high fracture toughness (2100 J&#160;m&#8722;2), excellent fatigue resistance (720 J&#160;m&#8722;2), low friction (0.0059), and high wear resistance. These properties are comparable to or even better than the BIS&#8208;crosslinked hydrogel, although&#160;the former has much lower solid content. The excellent mechanical properties of the peptide&#8208;crosslinked gel are attributed to its highly entangled structure and also to the introduction of a novel mechanism for energy dissipation, that is, energy dissipation via breakage of intramolecular hydrogen bonds stabilizing the helical structure of the&#160;peptide.

         <title>Achieving Fast Charge Separation by Ferroelectric Ultrasonic Interfacial Engineering for Rapid Sonotherapy of Bacteria&#8208;Infected Osteomyelitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of ferroelectric polarization interfacial engineering of BiFeO3/Ti3C2 to treat osteomyelitis under ultrasound&#160;is&#160;reported. The ferroelectric polarization induces the formation of&#160;a piezoelectric field. US cavitation effect&#160;induced sonoluminescence stimulates BiFeO3/Ti3C2 to produce photogenerated carriers. With synergistic action of the&#160;polarization electric field and Schottky junction, BiFeO3/Ti3C2 enhances the utilization of polarized charges and photogenerated charges, enhancing the yield of reactive oxygen species.








Abstract
Bacteria&#8208;infected osteomyelitis is life&#8208;threatening without effective therapeutic methods clinically. Here, a rapid and effective therapeutic strategy to treat osteomyelitis through ferroelectric polarization interfacial engineering of BiFeO3/MXene (Ti3C2) triggered by ultrasound (US) is reported. Under US, the ferroelectric polarization induces the formation of the&#160;piezoelectric field. US cavitation effect&#160;induced sonoluminescence stimulates BiFeO3/Ti3C2 to produce photogenerated carriers. With synergistic action of&#160;the&#160;polarization electric field and Schottky junction, BiFeO3/Ti3C2 accelerates the separation of electrons and holes and simultaneously inhibits the backflow of electrons, thus improving the utilization of polarized charges and photogenerated charges and consequently enhancing the yield of reactive oxygen species under US. As a result, 99.87 &#177; 0.05% of Staphylococcus aureus are efficiently killed in 20&#160;min with the assistance of ultrasonic heating. The theory of ferroelectric ultrasonic interfacial engineering is proposed, which brings new insight for developing ferroelectric ultrasonic responsive materials used for the diagnosis and therapy of deep tissue infection and other acoustoelectric devices.

As a result, 99.87 &#177; 0.05% of &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; are efficiently killed in 20&#160;min with the assistance of ultrasonic heating. The theory of ferroelectric ultrasonic interfacial engineering is proposed, which brings new insight for developing ferroelectric ultrasonic responsive materials used for the diagnosis and therapy of deep tissue infection and other acoustoelectric devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Based on the super&#8208;semiconducting metallic bi&#8208;layer shell arrays, this experiment realizes super&#8208;semiconductor&#160;p&#8208;n junction diodes with near zero&#8208;threshold&#160;voltage and a high breakdown field (&#8776;1.1&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;V&#160;cm&#8722;1). This research paves the way to develop ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power semiconducting transistors, integrated circuits, chips, and power devices.








Abstract
Semiconductor devices are currently one of the most common energy consumption devices. Significantly reducing the energy consumption of semiconductor devices with advanced energy&#8208;efficient technologies is highly desirable. The discovery of super&#8208;semiconductors (SSCs) based on metallic bi&#8208;layer shell arrays provides an opportunity to realize ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power consumption semiconductor devices. As an example, the achievement of near zero&#8208;threshold voltage in p&#8208;n junction diodes based on super&#8208;semiconducting nanostructured Ag/Al arrays is reported, realizing ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power p&#8208;n junction diodes: &#8776;3&#160;W per trillion diodes with a working voltage of 1&#160;V or 30&#160;mW per trillion diodes with an operating voltage of 0.1 V. In addition, the p&#8208;n junction diodes exhibit a high breakdown field of &#8776;1.1&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;V&#160;cm&#8722;1, similar to that of SiC and GaN, due to a robust built&#8208;in field driven by infrared light photons. The SSC p&#8208;n diodes with near zero&#8208;threshold&#160;voltage and high breakdown field allow access to ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power semiconducting transistors, integrated circuits, chips, etc.

         <title>Controlling &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interactions of Highly Soluble Naphthalene Diimide Derivatives for Neutral pH Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>

The design of organic redox&#8208;active molecules to develop spin pairing during the electron&#8208;transfer process improves cycling performance in aqueous redox flow batteries.








Abstract
Organic redox&#8208;active molecules are a promising platform for designing sustainable, cheap, and safe charge carriers for redox flow batteries. However, radical formation during the electron&#8208;transfer process causes severe side reactions and reduces cyclability. This problem is mitigated by using naphthalene diimide (NDI) molecules and regulating their &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. The long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;stacking of NDI molecules, which leads to precipitation, is disrupted by tethering four ammonium functionalities, and the solubility approaches 1.5&#160;m in water. The gentle &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions induce clustering and disassembling of the NDI molecules during the two&#8208;electron transfer processes. When the radical anion forms, the antiferromagnetic coupling develops tetramer and dimer and nullifies the radical character. In addition, short&#8208;range&#8208;order NDI clusters at 1&#160;m concentration are not precipitated but inhibit crossover. They are disassembled in the subsequent electron&#8208;transfer process, and the negatively charged NDI core strongly interacts with ammonium groups. These behaviors afford excellent RFB performance, demonstrating 98% capacity retention for 500 cycles at 25&#160;mA cm&#8208;2 and 99.5% Coulombic efficiency with 2&#160;m electron storage capacity.

         <title>Highly Selective On&#8208;Surface Reactions of Aryl Propiolic Acids via Decarboxylative Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The on&#8208;surface Glaser coupling of aryl propiolic acids is herein&#160;presented as a new class of monomers on Ag(111). The coupling yielding poly(arylenebutadiynylenes) with high selectivity is investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy and supportive density functional theory calculations. Further, the selective formation of unsymmetric metal&#8208;organic coordination bonds out of p&#8208;halogenated congeners is disclosed, which might&#160;enable new reactivity of Ag&#8208;adatoms.








Abstract
Aryl propiolic acids are introduced as a new class of monomers in the field of on&#8208;surface chemistry to build up poly(arylenebutadiynylenes) through decarboxylative Glaser coupling. As compared to aryl alkynes that are routinely used in the on&#8208;surface Glaser coupling, it is found that the decarboxylative coupling occurs at slightly lower temperature and with excellent selectivity. Activation occurs through decarboxylation for the propiolic acids, whereas the classical Glaser coupling is achieved through alkyne C&#63743;H activation, and this process shows poor selectivity. The efficiency of the decarboxylative coupling is documented by the successful polymerization of bis(propiolic acids) as monomers. It is also found that the new activation mode is compatible with aryl bromide functionalities, which allows the formation of unsymmetric metal&#8208;organic polymers on the surface by chemoselective sequential reactions. All transformations are analyzed by a scanning tunneling microscope and are further studied by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Stabilization of the Alkylammonium Cations in Halide Perovskite Thin Films by Water&#8208;Mediated Proton Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkylammonium in the form of CH3NH3+ is produced in the reaction between CH3NH2 and dissociated 2H2O molecules via the catalytic halide anion in a hybrid perovskite precursor. This stabilization of alkylammonium is largely dependent on the quantity of the ionized halide additive and its proton affinity. Consequently, the stabilized alkylammonium can produce stable and more ordered organic&#8211;inorganic metal trihalide perovskite crystals.








Abstract
The development of alkylammonium lead trihalide perovskite (ALHP) photovoltaics has grown rapidly over the past decade. However, there are remaining critical challenges, such as proton defects, which can lead to the material instability of ALHPs. Although specific strategies, including the use of halide additives, have significantly reduced the defects, a fundamental understanding of the defect passivation mechanism remains elusive. Herein, an approach and mechanism for minimizing proton defects in ALHP crystals by adding ionized halides to the perovskite precursor solution are reported. This work clarifies that the ionized halides induced proton transfer from H2O to the alkylammonium cation in the precursor solution, stabilizing the ALHP crystals. The fundamental characteristics of ALHP and its precursors are examined by X&#8208;ray diffraction, transmittance electron microscopy, in situ extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure, Fourier&#160;transform NMR spectroscopy, and Fourier&#160;transform infrared spectroscopy. The findings from this work will guide the development of highly stable ALHP crystals, enabling efficient and stable optoelectronic ALHP devices.

         <title>Programmable Jigsaw Puzzles of Soft Materials Enabled by Pixelated Holographic Surface Reliefs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiscale optical jigsaw puzzles with tailored functions are established by programming pixelated holographic surface reliefs. The robust reliefs and stimuli&#8208;responsive&#160;liquid&#160;crystals&#160;(LCs) endow the optical jigsaw puzzles with broad spectral adaptability, unprecedented stability, and reliable durability, which builds up a new way for soft materials in adaptive flat optics.








Abstract
Manual intervention in the self&#8208;organization of soft matter to obtain a desired superstructure is a complex but significant project. Specifically, optical components made fully or partially from reconfigurable and stimuli&#8208;responsive soft materials, referred to as soft photonics, are poised to form versatile platforms in various areas; however, a limited scale, narrow spectral adaptability, and poor stability are still formidable challenges. Herein, a facile way is developed to program the optical jigsaw puzzle of nematic liquid crystals via pixelated holographic surface reliefs, leading to an era of manufacturing for programmable soft materials with tailored functions. Multiscale jigsaw puzzles are established and endowed with unprecedented stability and durability, further sketching a prospective framework toward customized adaptive photonic architectures. This work demonstrates a reliable and efficient approach for directly assembling soft matter, unlocking the long&#8208;sought full potential of stimuli&#8208;responsive soft systems, and providing opportunities to inspire the next generation of soft photonics and relevant areas.

         <title>Combined Vacuum Evaporation and Solution Process for High&#8208;Efficiency Large&#8208;Area Perovskite Solar Cells with Exceptional Reproducibility</title>

         <dc:description>
Vacuum evaporation of lead iodide and solution processing of organic ammonium halide are combined to produce large&#8208;area homogeneous perovskite films with high reproducibility. The resulting PSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.0% (certified PCE 23.7%) on large area (1&#160;cm2) under AM 1.5G illumination, which is currently the highest PCE for large area perovskite photovoltaics.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites exhibit outstanding performances in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the complex solution chemistry of perovskites precursors renders it difficult to prepare large&#8208;area devices in a reproducible way, which is a prerequisite for the technology to make an impact beyond lab scale. Vacuum processing, instead, is an established technology for large&#8208;scale coating of thin films. However, with respect to the hybrid perovskites it is highly challenging due to the high vapor pressure of the organic ammonium halide. In this work, vacuum evaporation of lead iodide and solution processing of organic ammonium halide is combined to produce large&#8208;area homogeneous perovskite films with large grains in a highly reproducible way. The resulting PSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.3% (certified 23.9%) on small area (0.10&#160;cm2), 24.0% (certified 23.7%) on large area (1&#160;cm2) and 20.0% for minimodule (16&#160;cm2), and maintain 90% of its initial efficiency after 1000&#160;h 1&#8208;sun operation. The vacuum evaporation prevents advert environmental effects on lead halide formation and guarantees a reproducible fabrication of high&#8208;quality large&#8208;area perovskite films, which opens a promising way for large&#8208;scale fabrication of perovskite optoelectronics.

         <title>A Neurospheroid&#8208;Based Microrobot for Targeted Neural Connections in a Hippocampal Slice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using an external rotating magnetic field, a magnetic neurospheroid consisting of primary hippocampal neurons and superparamagnetic nanoparticles can be precisely delivered to the target area in an ex vivo brain slice, where the neurospheroid subsequently establishes structural and functional neuronal connectivity. This method can be used to examine ex vivo functional neuronal connections and neuronal regeneration processes.








Abstract
Functional restoration by the re&#8208;establishment of cellular or neural connections remains a major challenge in targeted cell therapy and regenerative medicine. Recent advances in magnetically powered microrobots have shown potential for use in controlled and targeted cell therapy. In this study, a magnetic neurospheroid (Mag&#8208;Neurobot) that can form both structural and functional connections with an organotypic hippocampal slice (OHS) is assessed using an ex vivo model as a bridge toward in vivo application. The Mag&#8208;Neurobot consists of hippocampal neurons and superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SPIONs); it is precisely and skillfully manipulated by an external magnetic field. Furthermore, the results of patch&#8208;clamp recordings of hippocampal neurons indicate that neither the neuronal excitabilities nor the synaptic functions of SPION&#8208;loaded cells are significantly affected. Analysis of neural activity propagation using high&#8208;density multi&#8208;electrode arrays shows that the delivered Mag&#8208;Neurobot is functionally connected with the OHS. The applications of this study include functional verification for targeted cell delivery through the characterization of novel synaptic connections and the functionalities of transported and transplanted cells. The success of the Mag&#8208;Neurobot opens up new avenues of research and application; it offers a test platform for functional neural connections and neural regenerative processes through cell transplantation.

         <title>Flexible Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries with Ampere&#8208;Hour Capacities and Wide&#8208;Temperature Adaptabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic liquid (IL) additive hydrogel is reported for flexible Zn&#8211;air batteries (FZABs). Similar to a crab, the IL creates pores and captures water in the hydrogel, which improves the ionic conductivity and water retention of the hydrogel. The FZABs based on this hydrogel can operate at high and low temperatures.








Abstract
Flexible Zn&#8211;air batteries (FZABs) have significant potentials as efficient energy storage devices for wearable electronics because of their safeties and high energy&#8208;to&#8208;cost ratios. However, their application is limited by their short cycle lives, low discharge capacities per cycle, and high charge/discharge polarizations. Accordingly, herein, a poly(sodium acrylate)&#8211;polyvinyl alcohol (PANa&#8211;PVA)&#8211;ionic liquid (IL) hydrogel (PANa&#8211;PVA&#8211;IL) is prepared using a hygroscopic IL, 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride, as an additive for twin&#8208;chain PANa&#8211;PVA. PANa&#8211;PVA&#8211;IL exhibits a high conductivity of 306.9&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 and a water uptake of 2515 wt% at room temperature. Moreover, a low&#8208;cost bifunctional catalyst, namely, Co9S8 nanoparticles anchored on N&#8208; and S&#8208;co&#8208;doped activated carbon black pearls 2000 (Co9S8&#8208;NSABP), is synthesized, which demonstrates a low O2 reversibility potential gap of 0.629&#160;V. FZABs based on PANa&#8211;PVA&#8211;IL and Co9S8&#8208;NSABP demonstrate high discharge capacities of 1.67&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 per cycle and long cycle lives of 330&#160;h.&#160;Large&#8208;scale flexible rechargeable Zn&#8211;air pouch cells exhibit total capacities of 1.03&#160;Ah and energy densities of 246&#160;Wh&#160;kgcell&#8722;1. This study provides new information about hydrogels with high ionic conductivities and water uptakes and should facilitate the application of FZABs in wearable electronics.

Li&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes
In article 2208423, Hyun&#8208;Wook Lee, Jinhyuk Lee, Dong&#8208;Hwa Seo, and co&#8208;workers reveal the multiphase heterogeneous nature of ultrahigh&#8208;energy Mn&#8208;based partially disordered Li&#8208;ion cathodes through combined experimental and computational studies. This fundamental understanding enables novel nanocomposite design, wherein a phase fraction of the nanocomposites is manipulated. Consequently, cathodes engineered via nanocomposite engineering exhibit superior reversible redox properties and improved cycle retention.

Micro&#8208;Light&#8208;Emitting&#8208;Diodes
Conventional methods of pixelating micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diodes (micro&#8208;LEDs) via dry&#8208;etching present many drawbacks due to induced structural damage. In article 2206945, Yong&#8208;Hoon Cho and co&#8208;workers report a simple pixelation methodology for micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes that can be scaled down to the sub&#8208;micrometer scale using a tailored focused ion beam irradiation technique. Electrically driven sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;sized pixels are successfully demonstrated without any structural deformation, enabling high&#8208;pixel&#8208;density displays for future applications.

Microparticles
Producing microparticles with an aqueous core and a controlled nanoparticle&#8208; or polymer&#8208;laden hydrophobic shell at scale is highly challenging, since bulk methods are polydisperse and microfluidic chips are prone to clogging and slow. In article number 2208894, Jieke Jiang, Claas Willem Visser, and co&#8208;workers developed a platform, called &#8220;jetting through a liquid layer&#8221; (JetALL), to produce Pickering emulsions, microcapsules, and even antibubbles at high&#8208;throughput.

SrTiO3 Grain Boundaries
Using an electron microscope with ultrahigh&#8208;energy&#8208;resolution enables direct imaging of local structure, nonstoichiometry, and chemical bonding, leading to a redistribution of vibrational states within the grain&#8208;boundary dislocation cores, as reported by by Eric R. Hoglund, Sokrates T. Pantelides, Patrick E. Hopkins, Jordan A. Hachtel, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2208920. Density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations of thousand&#8208;atom supercells show that the unique environment of atoms in the dislocation cores results in new vibrational modes that are highly localized and have energies in the Restrahlen band.

         <title>Curvature in Biological Systems: Its Quantification, Emergence, and Implications across the Scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Curvature as a local descriptor for shape has been revealed to play a fundamental role in the development of biological systems. Advanced 3D characterization methods allow its quantification across time and length scales indicating that cells and tissue growth can cause emergence of curved surfaces but in turn curvature also acts as a trigger for specific biological processes.








Abstract
Surface curvature both emerges from, and influences the behavior of, living objects at length scales ranging from cell&#160;membranes to single cells to tissues and organs. The relevance of surface curvature in biology is supported by numerous experimental and theoretical investigations in recent years. In this review, first, a brief introduction to the key ideas of surface curvature in the context of biological systems is given and the challenges that arise when measuring surface curvature are discussed. Giving an overview of the emergence of curvature in biological systems, its significance at different length scales becomes apparent. On the other hand, summarizing current findings also shows that both single cells and entire cell sheets, tissues or organisms respond to curvature by modulating their shape and their migration behavior. Finally, the interplay between the distribution of morphogens or micro&#8208;organisms and the emergence of curvature across length scales is addressed with examples demonstrating these key mechanistic principles of morphogenesis. Overall, this review highlights that curved interfaces are not merely a passive by&#8208;product of the chemical, biological, and mechanical processes but that curvature acts also as a signal that co&#8208;determines these processes.

         <title>Advanced Nonflammable Organic Electrolyte Promises Safer Li&#8208;Metal Batteries: From Solvation Structure Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 13, March 29, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonflammable organic electrolytes are very promising to address the safety issue facing Li&#8208;metal batteries. Several types of nonflammable organic electrolytes are reviewed from the perspective of solvation structure. The analysis of solvation structure provides insight into the nonflammability and the mechanism for Li&#8208;dendrite suppression. Finally, future guidelines for designing nonflammable electrolyte are provided.








Abstract
Batteries with a Li&#8208;metal anode have recently attracted extensive attention from the battery communities owing to their high energy density. However, severe dendrite growth hinders their practical applications. More seriously, when Li dendrites pierce the separators and trigger short circuit in a highly flammable organic electrolyte, the results would be catastrophic. Although the issues of growth of Li dendrites have been almost addressed by various methods, the highly flammable nature of conventional organic liquid electrolytes is still a lingering fear facing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;metal batteries given the possibility of thermal runaway of the high&#8208;voltage cathode. Recently, various kinds of nonflammable liquid&#8208; or solid&#8208;state electrolytes have shown great potential toward safer Li&#8208;metal batteries with minimal detrimental effect on the battery performance or even enhanced electrochemical performance. In this review, recent advances in developing nonflammable electrolyte for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;metal batteries including high&#8208;concentration electrolyte, localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte, fluorinated electrolyte, ionic liquid electrolyte, and polymer electrolyte are summarized. Then, the solvation structure of different kinds of nonflammable liquid and polymer electrolytes are analyzed to provide insight into the mechanism for dendrite suppression and fire extinguishing. Finally, guidelines for future design of nonflammable electrolyte for safer Li&#8208;metal batteries are provided.

         <title>Programming 3D Curves with Discretely Constrained Cylindrical Inflatables</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Programming inflatable systems to deform to desired three&#8208;dimensional (3D) shapes opens up multifarious applications in robotics, morphing architecture, and interventional medicine. This work elicits complex deformations by attaching discrete strain limiters to cylindrical hyperelastic inflatables. Using this system, we&#160;present a method to solve the inverse problem of programming myriad 3D centerline curves upon inflation. The method entails two steps: first, a reduced&#8208;order model generates a conceptual solution giving coarse indications of strain limiter placement on the undeformed cylindrical inflatable. This low&#8208;fidelity solution then seeds a finite element simulation nested within an optimization loop to further tune strain limiter parameters. We&#160;leverage this framework to achieve functionality through a&#8208;priori programmed deformations of cylindrical inflatables, including 3D curve matching, self&#8208;tying knotting, and manipulation. Results hold broad significance for the emerging computational design of inflatable systems.

Abstract
In the energy transition context, the design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance Pt&#8208;based photocatalysts with low Pt content and ultrahigh atom&#8208;utilization efficiency for hydrogen production are essential. Herein, w e report a facile approach for decorating atomically dispersed Pt cocatalysts having single&#8208;atom (SA) and atomic cluster dual active sites on CdS nanorods (PtSA+C/CdS) via atomic layer deposition. The size of the cocatalyst and the spatial intimacy of the cocatalyst active sites are precisely engineered at the atomic scale. The PtSA+C/CdS photocatalysts show the optimized photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, achieving a reaction rate of 80.4&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, which is 1.6&#8208; and 7.3&#8208;fold higher than those of the PtSA/CdS and PtNP/CdS photocatalysts, respectively. Thorough characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that the enhanced photocatalytic activity is due to a remarkable synergy between SAs and atomic clusters as dual active sites, which are responsible for water adsorption&#8211;dissociation and hydrogen desorption, respectively. A similar synergetic effect is found in a representative Pt/TiO2 system, indicating the generality of o ur strategy. This study demonstrates the significance of the synergy between active sites for enhancing the reaction efficiency, opening a new avenue for the rational design of atomically dispersed photocatalysts with high efficiency.

         <title>Electrical Manipulation of Orbital Current Via Oxygen Migration in Ni81fe19/Cuox/Tan Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The orbital Hall effect and the interfacial Rashba effect provide new approaches to generate orbital current and spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) efficiently without the use of heavy metals. However, achieving efficient dynamic control of orbital current and SOT in light metal oxides has proven challenging. In this study, we demonstrate that a sizable magnetoresistance effect related to orbital current and SOT can be observed in Ni81Fe19/CuOx/TaN heterostructures with various CuOx oxidisation concentrations. The ionic liquid gating induces migration of oxygen ions, which modulates the oxygen concentration at the Ni81Fe19/CuOx interface, leading to reversible manipulation of the magnetoresistance effect and SOT. The existence of a thick TaN capping layer allows for sophisticated internal oxygen ion reconstruction in the CuOx layer, rather than conventional external ion exchange. These results provide a method for the reversible and dynamic manipulation of the orbital current and SOT generation efficiency, thereby advancing the development of spin&#8208;orbitronics devices through ionic engineering.

         <title>Vesicular Antibodies: Shedding Light on Antibody Therapeutics with Cell Membrane Nanotechnology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent breakthroughs in membrane&#8208;derived vesicle nanotechnology have enabled vesicular&#8208;antibody&#8208;based therapy. By proposing the concept of vesicular antibodies, reviewing their engineering strategies and biomedical applications, and highlighting their unique advantages, this perspective intends to provide new insights on the development of vesicular antibodies.








Abstract
The high stability of antibodies and their ability to precisely bind to antigens and endogenous immune receptors, as well as their susceptibility to protein engineering, enable antibody&#8208;based therapeutics to be widely applied in cancer, inflammation, infection, and other disorders. Nevertheless, the application of traditional antibody&#8208;based therapeutics has certain limitations, such as high price, limited permeability, and protein engineering complexity. Recent breakthroughs in cell membrane nanotechnology have deepened the understanding of the critical role of membrane protein receptors in disease treatment, enabling vesicular&#8208;antibody&#8208;based therapeutics. Here, the concept of vesicular antibodies that are obtained by modifying target antibodies onto cell membranes for biomedical applications is proposed. Given that an antibody is basically a protein, as an extension of this concept, vesicles or membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles that use surface antibodies and protein receptors on cell membranes for biomedical applications as vesicular antibodies are defined. Furthermore, several engineering strategies for vesicular antibodies are summarized and how vesicular antibodies can be used in a variety of situations is highlighted. In addition, current challenges and future prospects of vesicular antibodies are also discussed. It is anticipated this perspective will provide new insights on the development of next&#8208;generation antibodies for enhanced therapeutics.

         <title>High&#8208;Gain of NdIII Complex Doped Optical Waveguide Amplifiers at 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#181;m Wavelengths Based on Intramolecular Energy Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on intramolecular energy transfer mechanism, high gains of 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#181;m are achieved simultaneously in complex Nd (TTA)3(XPO)&#8208;doped polymer waveguides by utilizing light&#8208;emitting diodes(LEDs) rather than semiconductor lasers as pumping sources. The novel complex is a high&#8208;gain material that can be easily spin&#8208;coated on different types of waveguides and is expected to have a critical role in planar photonic integration.








Abstract
Chelate phosphine oxide ligand (9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;xanthene&#8208;4,5&#8208;diyl) bis (diphenylphosphineoxide) (XPO) is prepared as a neutral ligand to synthesize complex Nd (TTA)3 (XPO) (TTA = 2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetone). An appropriate energy gap between the XPO and TTA ligands, which can support two additional energy transfer routines from the first excited triplet state (T1) energy level of the XPO to that of the TTA, improves energy transfer in the Nd complex. Based on intramolecular energy transfer mechanism, optical gains at 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#181;m are demonstrated in Nd (TTA)3 (XPO)&#8208;doped polymer waveguides with the excitation of low&#8208;power light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) instead of semiconductor lasers as pump sources. Using the vertical top&#8208;pumping mode of a 365&#160;nm LED, relative gains of 22.5 and 8.4&#160;dB&#160;cm&#8722;1 are obtained at 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#181;m, respectively, in a 0.2 cm long embedded waveguide with a cross&#8208;section of 8&#160;&#215;&#160;5&#160;&#181;m2. The active core layer is Nd (TTA)3 (XPO)&#8208;doped SU&#8208;8 polymer. Moreover, relative gains are achieved in evanescent&#8208;field waveguide with a cross&#8208;section of 6&#160;&#215;&#160;4&#160;&#181;m2. The 21.0 and 5.6&#160;dB&#160;cm&#8722;1 relative gains are achieved at 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#181;m, respectively, with a net gain of 13.8&#160;&#177;&#160;0.3&#160;dB&#160;cm&#8722;1 obtained at 1.06&#160;&#181;m in a 0.9 cm long SU&#8208;8 waveguide with Nd (TTA)3 (XPO)&#8208;doped polymethylmethacrylate as upper cladding.

         <title>S&#8208;Species&#8208;Evoked High&#8208;Valence&#160;Ni2+&#948; of the Evolved &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 Electrode for Selective Oxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiSx&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2/Ni is elaborately designed for the efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to valuable 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), along with green hydrogen production. The reaction path and mechanism are comprehensively understood by ex/in situ characterization and theoretical calculations, and the high&#8208;valence Ni2+&#948; is identified as the real active species.








Abstract
An efficient NiSx&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 electrode is reported for the selective oxidation reaction of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMFOR) with excellent electrocatalytic 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) selectivity (99.4%), conversion (97.7%), and Faradaic efficiency (98.3%). The decoration of NiSx will evoke high&#8208;valence Ni2+&#948; species in the reconstructed &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 electrode, which are the real active species for HMFOR. The generated NiSx/Ni(OH)O modulates the proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer (PCET) process of HMFOR, where the electrocatalytically generated Ni(OH)O can effectively trap the protons from the CHO&#63743; end in HMF to realize electron transfer. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) competes with the HMFOR when NiSx/Ni(OH)O continues to accumulate, to generate the NiSx/NiOx(OH)y intermediate. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results verify that the adsorption energy of HMF can be optimized through the increased NiSx composition for more efficient capture of protons and electrons in the HMFOR.

&lt;/i&gt;-modified &#946;-Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Ni is elaborately designed for the efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to valuable 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), along with green hydrogen production. The reaction path and mechanism are comprehensively understood by ex/in situ characterization and theoretical calculations, and the high-valence Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;&#948;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; is identified as the real active species.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient NiS&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-modified &#946;-Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrode is reported for the selective oxidation reaction of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMFOR) with excellent electrocatalytic 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) selectivity (99.4%), conversion (97.7%), and Faradaic efficiency (98.3%). The decoration of NiS&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; will evoke high-valence Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;&#948;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; species in the reconstructed &#946;-Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrode, which are the real active species for HMFOR. The generated NiS&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/Ni(OH)O modulates the proton-coupled electron-transfer (PCET) process of HMFOR, where the electrocatalytically generated Ni(OH)O can effectively trap the protons from the CHO&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt; end in HMF to realize electron transfer. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) competes with the HMFOR when NiS&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/Ni(OH)O continues to accumulate, to generate the NiS&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/NiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;(OH)&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; intermediate. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results verify that the adsorption energy of HMF can be optimized through the increased NiS&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; composition for more efficient capture of protons and electrons in the HMFOR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Moisture Stability of Lithium&#8208;Rich Antiperovskites for Sustainable All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hygroscopicity of lithium&#8208;rich antiperovskites (LiRAPs) is successfully suppressed by weakening the intermolecular hydrogen bond between LiRAPs and H2O with fluorine doping. Based on the high moisture resistivity and the low melting point of LiRAPs, two prototypes of all ceramic lithium batteries (ACLBs) are assembled in ambient air by means of co&#8208;coating sintering and melt&#8208;infiltration, respectively.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich antiperovskites (LiRAPs) solid electrolytes have attracted extensive interest due to their advantages of structural tunability, mechanical flexibility, and low cost. However, LiRAPs are instinctively hygroscopic and suffer from decomposition in air, which not only diversifies their electrochemical performances in present reports but also hinders their application in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). Herein, the origin of the hygroscopicity, and also the effect of the hygroscopicity on the electrochemical performances of Li3&#8722;x(OHx)Cl are systematically investigated. Li3&#8722;x(OHx)Cl is demonstrated to be unstable in the air and prone to decompose into LiOH and LiCl. Nevertheless, with fluorine doping on chlorine sites, the hygroscopicity of LiRAPs is suppressed by weakening the intermolecular hydrogen bond between LiRAPs and H2O, forming a moisture&#8208;resistive Li3&#8722;x(OHx)Cl0.9F0.1. Taking advantage of its low melting point (274&#160;&#176;C), two prototypes of ASSLBs are assembled in the ambient air by means of co&#8208;coating sintering and melt&#8208;infiltration. With LiRAPs as the solder, low&#8208;temperature sintering of the ASSLBs with low interfacial resistance is demonstrated as feasible. The understanding of the hygroscopic behavior of LiRAPs and the integration of the moisture&#8208;resistive LiRAPs with ASSLBs provide an effective way toward the fabrication of the ASSLBs.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Assisted Compressed Flux Growth: A Universal and High&#8208;Yield Method for Dimension&#8208;Controlled Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;yield crystal growth method utilizing a polymer flux in a compressed growth space is invented to cast molecules or precursors into dimension&#8208;defined single crystals. This compressed flux growth is universally applicable to various materials and scalable to mass production, and the grown single crystals can be directly integrated into electronic devices.








Abstract
Single crystals possess the most perfect and stable morphology and represent the intrinsic and upper limits of performance when integrated into various application scenarios. However, for a large portion of the newly emerging low&#8208;dimensional and molecular materials, the mass production of crystals with a desirable shape is still challenging. Here, a universal and high&#8208;yield method to grow functional single crystals with controlled dimensions is provided that can be directly integrated into a device. By utilizing a polymeric flux in combination with a compressed growth space, numerous materials can be grown into size&#8208;controllable single crystalline flakes, with millions produced in one batch. This scalable growth method shows promise for the large&#8208;scale integration of micro&#8208;single&#8208;crystals as functional components, as exemplified by the construction of a 5 in. field&#8208;effect transistor array.

         <title>Formation and Applications in Electronic Devices of Lattice&#8208;Aligned Gallium Oxynitride Nanolayer on Gallium Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ &#8220;oxidation&#8211;reconfiguration&#8221; process is developed to form lattice&#8208;aligned gallium oxynitride (GaON) epitaxial nanolayer on gallium nitride (GaN) substrate. Two metastable GaON phases are formed through oxygen segregation following kinetic&#8211;thermodynamic reaction pathways. The GaN&#8208;derived GaON nanolayer is a tailored structure for surface reinforcement and can be leveraged to enhance the performance of GaN&#8208;based devices in various applications.








Abstract
Gallium nitride (GaN), a promising alternative semiconductor to Si, is widely used in photoelectronic and electronic technologies. However, the vulnerability of the GaN surface is a critical restriction that hinders the development of GaN&#8208;based devices, especially in terms of device stability and reliability. In this study, this challenge is overcome by converting the GaN surface into a gallium oxynitride (GaON) epitaxial nanolayer through an in situ two&#8208;step &#8220;oxidation&#8211;reconfiguration&#8221; process. The O plasma treatment overcomes the chemical inertness of the GaN surface, and sequential thermal annealing manipulates the kinetic&#8211;thermodynamic reaction pathways to create a metastable GaON nanolayer with a wurtzite lattice. The GaN&#8208;derived GaON nanolayer is a tailored structure for surface reinforcement and possesses several advantages, including a wide bandgap, high thermodynamic stability, and large valence band offset with a GaN substrate. These physical properties can be further leveraged to enhance the performance of GaN&#8208;based devices in various applications, such as power systems, complementary logic integrated circuits, photoelectrochemical water splitting, and ultraviolet photoelectric&#160;conversion.

         <title>In Situ Fabrication of Benzoquinone Crystal Layer on the Surface of Nest&#8208;Structural Ionohydrogel for Flexible &#8220;All&#8208;in&#8208;One&#8221; Supercapattery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benzoquinone crystal&#8211;gel interface (CGI) membrane is fabricated on the surface of nest&#8208;structural ionohydrogel through the in situ electrochemical deposition of benzoquinone. Thus, an integrated CGI&#8208;gel platform with a middle body as electrolyte and the surficial redox&#8208;active CGI membrane for electrochemical energy conversion and storage is achieved. This CGI&#8208;gel platform greatly simplifies the fabrication of flexible energy&#8208;storage devices and dramatically improves its electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Flexible energy&#8208;storage devices lay the foundation for a convenient, advanced, fossil fuel&#8208;free society. However, the fabrication of flexible energy&#8208;storage devices remains a tremendous challenge due to the intrinsic dissimilarities between electrode and electrolyte. In this study, a strategy is proposed for fabricating a flexible electrode and electrolyte entirely inside a matrix. First, a nest&#8208;structural and redox&#8208;active ionohydrogel with excellent stretchability (up to 3000%) and conductivity (167.9 mS cm&#8722;1) is designed using a hydrated ionic liquid (HIL) solvent and chemical foaming strategy. The nest&#8208;structure ionohydrogel provides sufficient &#8220;highways&#8221; and &#8220;service area&#8221;, and the cation in HIL facilitates the reaction, transportation, and deposition of benzoquinone. Subsequently, in situ, a novel benzoquinone crystal&#8211;gel interface (CGI) is in situ fabricated on the surface of the ionohydrogel through electrochemical deposition of benzoquinone. Thus, an integrated CGI&#8208;gel platform is successfully achieved with a middle body as an electrolyte and the surficial redox&#8208;active CGI membrane for electrochemical energy conversion and storage. Based on the CGI&#8208;gel platform, an extreme simple and effective &#8220;stick&#8208;to&#8208;use&#8221; strategy is proposed for constructing flexible energy&#8208;storage devices and then a series of flexible supercapatteries are fabricated with high stretchability and capacitance (5222.1 mF cm&#8722;2 at 600% strain), low self&#8208;discharge and interfacial resistance and a wearable, self&#8208;power and intelligent display.

However, the fabrication of flexible energy-storage devices remains a tremendous challenge due to the intrinsic dissimilarities between electrode and electrolyte. In this study, a strategy is proposed for fabricating a flexible electrode and electrolyte entirely inside a matrix. First, a nest-structural and redox-active ionohydrogel with excellent stretchability (up to 3000%) and conductivity (167.9 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is designed using a hydrated ionic liquid (HIL) solvent and chemical foaming strategy. The nest-structure ionohydrogel provides sufficient &#8220;highways&#8221; and &#8220;service area&#8221;, and the cation in HIL facilitates the reaction, transportation, and deposition of benzoquinone. Subsequently, in situ, a novel benzoquinone crystal&#8211;gel interface (CGI) is in situ fabricated on the surface of the ionohydrogel through electrochemical deposition of benzoquinone. Thus, an integrated CGI-gel platform is successfully achieved with a middle body as an electrolyte and the surficial redox-active CGI membrane for electrochemical energy conversion and storage. Based on the CGI-gel platform, an extreme simple and effective &#8220;stick-to-use&#8221; strategy is proposed for constructing flexible energy-storage devices and then a series of flexible supercapatteries are fabricated with high stretchability and capacitance (5222.1 mF cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 600% strain), low self-discharge and interfacial resistance and a wearable, self-power and intelligent display.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Elastomers Grow into Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elastomer that can grow automatically and finally becomes a soft actuator is presented. The whole process does not need energy input or external stimuli other than a single pre&#8208;stretch. The growth can output mechanical work. The material has an uncommon liquid crystal phase. The formation of soft actuators is associated with a usually unnoticed reaction.








Abstract
It is common knowledge that when an elastomer (rubber) is stretched, its length will be&#160;maintained if its two ends are fixed. Here, it is serendipitously found that when&#160;an elastomer is&#160;slowly elongated further to achieve buckling under such conditions, the final length is much longer than the pre&#8208;stretched length. This allows the design&#160;of untethered autonomous synthetic&#8208;material&#8208;based soft robots that do not need any other chemical or electrical energy sources or external stimuli after the pre&#8208;strain is installed. Once the growth starts, the elongation continues to proceed even when the applied force is removed. Moreover, the elastomer, after growing, eventually forms a robust soft actuator that can be reshaped for different purposes. Few synthetic materials can grow like this, so far. This investigation shows that the material has an uncommon liquid crystal phase. Contrary to normal liquid crystals, it becomes birefringent only at high temperatures. The formation and the reshaping of the resulting soft actuators relate to a usually unnoticed reversible reaction. The work is promising to promote further understanding of dynamic covalent chemistry and liquid crystal elastomers, as well as to foster new designs and high&#8208;impact applications of bioinspired sustainable soft actuators in areas other than soft robots.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Powered Portable Nanowire Array Gas Sensor for Dynamic NO2 Monitoring at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>

An innovative self&#8208;powered room&#8208;temperature nitrogen dioxide (NO2) sensor based on an indium phosphide homojunction nanowire array is presented. The proof&#8208;to&#8208;concept sensor structure, with high sensitivity, stability, and selectivity, is demonstrated. It is integrated to&#160;a USB interface for on&#8208;field vehicle&#8208;exhaust measurement. This work promises a new family of self&#8208;powered sensors made of III&#8211;V compound semiconductor nanostructures, for future mega&#8208;scale Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things systems.








Abstract
The fast development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven an increasing consumer demand for self&#8208;powered gas sensors for real&#8208;time data collection and autonomous responses in industries such as environmental monitoring, workplace safety, smart cities, and personal healthcare. Despite intensive research and rapid progress in the field, most reported self&#8208;powered devices, specifically NO2 sensors for air pollution monitoring, have limited sensitivity, selectivity, and scalability. Here, a novel photovoltaic self&#8208;powered NO2 sensor is demonstrated based on axial p&#8211;i&#8211;n homojunction InP nanowire (NW) arrays, that overcome these limitations. The optimized innovative InP NW array device is designed by numerical simulation for insights into sensing mechanisms and performance enhancement. Without a power source, this InP NW sensor achieves an 84% sensing response to 1&#160;ppm NO2 and records a limit of detection down to the sub&#8208;ppb level, with little dependence on the incident light intensity, even under &lt;5% of 1 sun illumination. Based on this great environmental fidelity, the sensor is integrated into a commercial microchip interface to evaluate its performance in the context of dynamic environmental monitoring of motor vehicle exhaust. The results show that compound semiconductor nanowires can form promising self&#8208;powered sensing platforms suitable for future mega&#8208;scale IoT systems.

         <title>Metasurface Enabled On&#8208;Chip Generation and Manipulation of Vector Beams from Vertical Cavity Surface&#8208;Emitting Lasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;chip generation and manipulation of vector beams are demonstrated by monolithically integrating vectorial metasurfaces with standard vertical cavity surface&#8208;emitting lasers (VCSELs). The developed approach enables a powerful tool to structure the complex wavefronts of a VCSEL in an ultracompact way, providing the access to previously unattainable both phase and polarization degrees of freedom.








Abstract
Metasurface polarization optics that consist of 2D array of birefringent nano&#8208;antennas have proven remarkable capabilities to generate and manipulate vectorial fields with subwavelength resolution and high efficiency. Integrating this new type of metasurface with the standard vertical cavity surface&#8208;emitting laser (VCSEL) platform enables an ultracompact and powerful solution to control both phase and polarization properties of the laser on a chip, which allows to structure a VCSEL into vector beams with on&#8208;demand wavefronts. Here, this concept is demonstrated by directly generating versatile vector beams from commercially available VCSELs through on&#8208;chip integration of high&#8208;index dielectric metasurfaces. Experimentally, the versatility of the approach for the development of vectorial VCSELs are validated by implementing a variety of functionalities, including directional emission of multibeam with specified polarizations, vectorial holographic display, and vector vortex beams generations. Notably, the proposed vectorial VCSELs integrated with a single layer of beam shaping metasurface bypass the requirements of multiple cascaded optical components, and thus have the potential to promote the advancements of ultracompact, lightweight, and scalable vector beams sources, enriching and expanding the applications of VCSELs in optical communications, laser manipulation and processing, information encryption, and quantum optics.

         <title>An Ultrasound&#8208;Driven Bioadhesive Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Instant Wound Sealing and Electrically Accelerated Healing in Emergencies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy of instant wound sealing and electrically assisted wound healing by an ultrasound&#8208;driven bioadhesive triboelectric nanogenerator is used to treat wounds in an emergency, to avoid serving hemostasis and infection, and the electrical stimulation driven by ultrasound promotes skin wound healing significantly via cell migration and proliferation, being a potential first&#8208;aid rescue and self&#8208;help method of portable medical devices.








Abstract
A bioadhesive triboelectric nanogenerator (BA&#8208;TENG), as a first&#8208;aid rescue for instant and robust wound sealing and ultrasound&#8208;driven accelerated wound healing, is designed. This BA&#8208;TENG is fabricated with biocompatible materials, and integrates a flexible TENG as the top layer and bioadhesive as the bottom layer, resulting in effective electricity supply and strong sutureless sealing capability on wet tissues. When driven by ultrasound, the BA&#8208;TENG can produce a stable voltage of 1.50&#160;V and current of 24.20&#160;&#181;A underwater. The ex vivo porcine colon organ models show that the BA&#8208;TENG seals defects instantly (&#8776;5 s) with high interfacial toughness (&#8776;150 J m&#8722;2), while the rat bleeding liver incision model confirms that the BA&#8208;TENG performs rapid wound closure and hemostasis, reducing the blood loss by about 82%. When applied in living rats, the BA&#8208;TENG not only seals skin injuries immediately but also produces a strong electric field (E&#8208;field) of about 0.86&#160;kV m&#8722;1 stimulated by ultrasound to accelerate skin wound healing significantly. The in vitro studies confirm that these effects are attributed to the E&#8208;field&#8208;accelerated cell migration and proliferation. In addition, these TENG adhesives can be applied to not only wound treatment, nerve stimulation and regeneration, and charging batteries in implanted devices.

         <title>Conformal Volumetric Grayscale Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformal volumetric grayscale metamaterials are presented as a new class of artificially structured media capable of multiplexing electromagnetic responses as a function of frequency and incident beam form. These materials can realize new classes of multifunctional devices including conformal microwave carpet cloaks, which render an object invisible to observers for a wide range of probing frequencies and incidence angles.








Abstract
Conformal artificial electromagnetic media that feature tailorable responses as a function of incidence wavelength and angle represent universal components for optical engineering. Conformal grayscale metamaterials are introduced as a new class of volumetric electromagnetic media capable of supporting highly multiplexed responses and arbitrary, curvilinear form factors. Subwavelength&#8208;scale voxels based on irregular shapes are designed to accommodate a continuum of dielectric values, enabling the freeform design process to reliably converge to exceptionally high figures of merit (FOMs) for a given multi&#8208;objective design problem. Through additive manufacturing of ceramic&#8211;polymer composites, microwave metamaterials, designed for the radio&#8208;frequency range of 8&#8211;12&#160;GHz, are experimentally fabricated and devices with extreme dispersion profiles, an airfoil&#8208;shaped beam&#8208;steering device, and a broadband, broad&#8208;angle conformal carpet cloak, are demonstrated. It is anticipated that conformal volumetric metamaterials will lead to new classes of compact and multifunctional imaging, sensing, and communications systems.

         <title>Super&#8208;Resolution Detection of DNA Nanostructures Using a Nanopore</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glass nanopores with 3&#8211;4&#160;nm diameters demonstrate super&#8208;resolution single&#8208;molecule sensing capability, which can be used to detect DNA nanostructures separated only by 18&#160;bp (&#8776;6&#160;nm). The super&#8208;resolution is attributed to the electric field enhancement at the nanopore tip and the slowdown of the&#160;DNA, with great potential for label&#8208;free, high&#8208;resolution DNA sequence mapping and digital information storage.








Abstract
High&#8208;resolution analysis of biomolecules has brought unprecedented insights into fundamental biological processes and dramatically advanced biosensing. Notwithstanding the ongoing resolution revolution in electron microscopy and optical imaging, only a few methods are presently available for high&#8208;resolution analysis of unlabeled single molecules in their native states. Here, label&#8208;free electrical sensing of structured single molecules with a spatial resolution down to single&#8208;digit nanometers is demonstrated. Using a narrow solid&#8208;state nanopore, the passage of a series of nanostructures attached to a freely translocating DNA molecule is detected, resolving individual nanostructures placed as close as 6&#160;nm apart and with a surface&#8208;to&#8208;surface gap distance of only 2&#160;nm. Such super&#8208;resolution ability is attributed to the nanostructure&#8208;induced enhancement of the electric field at the tip of the nanopore. This work demonstrates a general approach to improving the resolution of single&#8208;molecule nanopore sensing and presents a critical advance towards label&#8208;free, high&#8208;resolution DNA sequence mapping, and digital information storage independent of molecular motors.

         <title>Colloid Electrolyte with Changed Li+ Solvation Structure for High&#8208;Power, Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel colloid electrolyte constructs a weak Li+ solvation environment by introducing lithium thiocarbonate colloids to coordinate with solvents and anions competitively. Thus, the Li+ conductivity, desolvation process, and configuration of the&#160;cathode electrolyte interface are optimized. The enhanced interfacial Li+ transfer kinetics endow lithium&#8208;ion batteries with excellent fast charging/discharging capability and long lifespan at room and low temperatures.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries currently suffer from low capacity and fast degradation under fast charging and/or low temperatures. In&#160;this&#160;work, a colloid liquid electrolyte (CLE) is designed, where the trace amount of lithium thiocarbonate (LTC) colloids in commercial carbonate electrolyte (1&#160;m LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate) not only boosts up &#963;Li+ but also improves the Li+ transfer kinetics at LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA) cathode/electrolyte interface. The competitive coordination of LTCs with anions and solvents facilitates the dissociation of lithium salts and Li+ decoupling, dramatically enhancing the &#963;Li+ (15 to 4.5 mS cm&#8722;1 at 30 and &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, respectively); meanwhile, the desolvation process is accelerated. It demonstrates that LTC colloids induce an&#160;&#8776;5&#160;nm ultrathin Li2CO3&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interface&#160;and infuse the grain boundary of NCA particles, enhancing interfacial Li+ transfer and inhibiting the particle cracks during cycling. Consequently, the Li||CLE||NCA battery delivers a maximum capacity of 135 mAh g&#8722;1 at a 10 C rate with 80% retention after 2000 cycles. Moreover, the fast&#8208;charging capability under a sub&#8208;zero environment is proved (122 mAh g&#8722;1 with 90% retention after 400 cycles at 2 C and &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C). This strategy for tailoring the interfacial charge transfer appears generalizable and can practically be extended to next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Selective Microporous Polymer Membranes with Hydrogen&#8208;Bond and Salt&#8208;Bridge Networks for Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance ion&#8208;selective polymer membranes are fabricated from blends of carboxylate&#8208; and amidoxime&#8208;functionalized polymers of intrinsic microporosity by exploiting inter&#8208;/intrachain hydrogen&#8208;bond and salt&#8208;bridge interactions. They demonstrate fast ion conduction with low crossover of redox&#8208;active molecules, enabling improved power rating and stable cycling performance in aqueous organic redox flow batteries.








Abstract
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) have great potential for long&#8208;duration grid&#8208;scale energy storage. Ion&#8208;conducting membranes are a crucial component in RFBs, allowing charge&#8208;carrying ions to transport while preventing the cross&#8208;mixing of redox couples. Commercial Nafion membranes are widely used in RFBs, but their unsatisfactory ionic and molecular selectivity, as well as high costs, limit the performance and the widespread deployment of this technology. To extend the longevity and reduce the cost of RFB systems, inexpensive ion&#8208;selective membranes that concurrently deliver low ionic resistance and high selectivity toward redox&#8208;active species are highly desired. Here, high&#8208;performance RFB membranes are fabricated from blends of carboxylate&#8208; and amidoxime&#8208;functionalized polymers of intrinsic microporosity, which exploit the beneficial properties of both polymers. The enthalpy&#8208;driven formation of cohesive interchain interactions, including hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, facilitates the microscopic miscibility of the blends, while ionizable functional groups within the sub&#8208;nanometer pores allow optimization of membrane ion&#8208;transport functions. The resulting microporous membranes demonstrate fast cation conduction with low crossover of redox&#8208;active molecular species, enabling improved power ratings and reduced capacity fade in aqueous RFBs using anthraquinone and ferrocyanide as redox couples.

Phototheranostics have emerged and flourished as a promising pattern for cancer theranostics owing to their precise photoinduced diagnosis and therapeutic to meet the demands of precision medicine. The diagnosis information and therapeutic effect are directly determined by the fluorescence imaging ability and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of phototheranostic agents. Hence, how to balance the competitive radiative and nonradiative processes of phototheranostic agents is the key factor to evaluate the phototheranostic effect. Herein, molecules named ICRs with high photostaibility&#160; are rationally designed, exhibiting fluorescence emission in the second near&#8208;infrared window&#160;(NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700 nm) and high PCE,&#160;which are related to the strong donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) interaction and high reorganization energy&#160;Noteworthily, ICR&#8208;Qu with stronger D&#8211;A interaction and a&#160;large&#8208;sized conjugated unit encapsulated in nanoparticles exhibits high PCE (81.1%). In&#160;addition, ICR&#8208;QuNPs are used for fluorescence imaging (FLI), photoacoustic imaging (PAI), and photothermal imaging (PTI) to guide deep&#8208;tissue photonic hyperthermia, achieving precise removal and inhibition of breast cancer. Furthermore, combined with &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;1, ICR&#8208;QuNPs show huge potential to be a facile and efficient tool for photo&#8208;immunotherapy. More importantly, this study not only reports an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; polymethine&#8208;based phototheranostic agent, but also sheds light on the exploration of versatile organic molecules for future practical applications.

         <title>A&#160;Reconfigurable Optoelectronic Synaptic Transistor with Stable Zr&#8208;CsPbI3 Nanocrystals for Visuomorphic Computing</title>

         <dc:description>
Wavelength&#8208;aware transistor memory is designed by incorporating air&#8208;stable Zr&#8208;CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals. On&#8208;demand creation of an&#160;artificial synapse and non&#8208;volatile memory in such homogeneous phototransistor that can be quickly reconfigured for a specific purpose by adjusting the wavelength of the incident light is demonstrated.








Abstract
Reconfigurable phototransistor memory attracts considerable attention for adaptive visuomorphic computing, with highly&#160;efficient sensing, memory, and processing functions integrated onto a single device. However, developing reconfigurable phototransistor memory remains a challenge due to the lack of an&#160;all&#8208;optically controlled transition between short&#8208;term plasticity (STP) and long&#8208;term plasticity (LTP). Herein, an air&#8208;stable Zr&#8208;CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystal (PNC)&#8208;based phototransistor memory is designed,&#160;which&#160;is capable of broadband photoresponses. Benefitting from the different electron capture ability of Zr&#8208;CsPbI3 PNCs to 650 and 405&#160;nm light, an&#160;artificial synapse and non&#8208;volatile memory can be created on&#8208;demand and quickly reconfigured within a single device for specific purposes. Owing to the optically reconfigurable and wavelength&#8208;aware operation between STP and LTP modes, the integrated blue feature extraction and target recognition can be demonstrated in a homogeneous neuromorphic vision sensor array. This work suggests a new way in developing perovskite optoelectronic transistors for highly efficient in&#8208;sensor computing.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Mott&#8208;Insulator&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Phase Transition in Ultrathin Intermediate&#8208;Spin Ferromagnetic Perovskite Ruthenates</title>

A&#160;photocarrier&#8208;doping&#8208;induced reversible Mott&#8208;insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal phase transition is realized by means of UV&#8208;light irradiation in a few atomic layers of intermediate&#8208;spin ferromagnetic SrRuO3&#8722;&#948;. Dynamical mean&#8208;field theory calculations further verify such photoinduced electronic phase transformation,&#160;owing to oxygen vacancies and orbital reconstruction. Therefore, a new intermediate&#8208;spin ferromagnetic metallic metastable phase of perovskite ruthenate is demonstrated.








Abstract
Light control of emergent quantum phenomena is a widely used external stimulus for quantum materials. Generally, perovskite strontium ruthenate SrRuO3 has an itinerant ferromagnetism with a low&#8208;spin state. However, the phase of intermediate&#8208;spin (IS) ferromagnetic metallic state has never been seen. Here, by means of UV&#8208;light irradiation, a photocarrier&#8208;doping&#8208;induced Mott&#8208;insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal phase transition is shown in a few atomic layers of perovskite IS ferromagnetic SrRuO3&#8722;&#948;. This new metastable IS metallic phase can be reversibly regulated due to the convenient photocharge transfer from SrTiO3 substrates to SrRuO3&#8722;&#948; ultrathin films. These dynamical mean&#8208;field theory calculations further verify such photoinduced electronic phase transformation, owing to oxygen vacancies and orbital reconstruction. The optical manipulation of charge&#8208;transfer finesse is an alternative pathway toward discovering novel metastable phases in strongly correlated systems and facilitates potential light&#8208;controlled device applications in optoelectronics and spintronics.

         <title>Scaled&#8208;Up Synthesis of Freestanding Molybdenum Disulfide Membranes for Nanopore Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to scale up freestanding synthesis of MoS2 sheets on 100 mm&#8208;diameter silicon wafers that have hundreds of nanoapertures is proposed. The MoS2 sheets cover the apertures to form ultrathin membranes that are useful in nanopore sensing.








Abstract
2D materials are ideal for nanopores with optimal detection sensitivity and resolution. Among these, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has gained traction as a less hydrophobic material than graphene. However, experiments using 2D nanopores remain challenging due to the lack of scalable methods for high&#8208;quality freestanding membranes. Herein, a site&#8208;directed, scaled&#8208;up synthesis of MoS2 membranes on predrilled nanoapertures on 4&#8208;inch wafer substrates with 75% yields is reported. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which introduces sulfur and molybdenum dioxide vapors across the sub&#8208;100 nm nanoapertures results in exclusive formation of freestanding membranes that seal the apertures. Nucleation and growth near the nanoaperture edges is followed by nanoaperture decoration with MoS2, which proceeds until a critical flake curvature is achieved, after which fully spanning freestanding membranes form. Intentional blocking of reagent flow through the apertures inhibits MoS2 nucleation around the nanoapertures, promoting the formation of large&#8208;crystal monolayer MoS2 membranes. The in situ grown membranes along with facile membrane wetting and nanopore formation using dielectric breakdown enables the recording of dsDNA translocation events at an unprecedentedly high 1 MHz bandwidth. The methods presented here are important steps toward the development of scalable single&#8208;layer membrane manufacture for 2D nanofluidics and nanopore applications.

         <title>4D&#8208;Printed Soft and Stretchable Self&#8208;Folding Cuff Electrodes for Small&#8208;Nerve Interfacing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric peripheral nerve interface that can fold itself to a cuff around small nerves during the implantation is presented. This actuation property, combined with the use of stretchable materials, makes the device robust and straightforward to use. The stimulation and recording capabilities are shown on small nerves in vivo.








Abstract
Peripheral nerve interfacing (PNI) has a high clinical potential for treating various diseases, such as obesity or diabetes. However, currently existing electrodes present challenges to the interfacing procedure, which limit their clinical application, in particular, when targeting small peripheral nerves (&lt;200&#160;&#181;m). To improve the electrode handling and implantation, a nerve interface that can fold itself to a cuff around a small nerve, triggered by the body moisture during insertion, is fabricated. This folding is achieved by printing a bilayer of a flexible polyurethane printing resin and a highly swelling sodium acrylate hydrogel using photopolymerization. When immersed in an aqueous liquid, the hydrogel swells and folds the electrode softly around the nerve. Furthermore, the electrodes are robust, can be stretched (&gt;20%), and bent to facilitate the implantation due to the use of soft and stretchable printing resins as substrates and a microcracked gold film as conductive layer. The straightforward implantation and extraction of the electrode as well as stimulation and recording capabilities on a small peripheral nerve in vivo are demonstrated. It is believed that such simple and robust to use self&#8208;folding electrodes will pave the way for bringing PNI to a broader clinical application.

     alt="4D-Printed Soft and Stretchable Self-Folding Cuff Electrodes for Small-Nerve Interfacing"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An electric peripheral nerve interface that can fold itself to a cuff around small nerves during the implantation is presented. This actuation property, combined with the use of stretchable materials, makes the device robust and straightforward to use. The stimulation and recording capabilities are shown on small nerves in vivo.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peripheral nerve interfacing (PNI) has a high clinical potential for treating various diseases, such as obesity or diabetes. However, currently existing electrodes present challenges to the interfacing procedure, which limit their clinical application, in particular, when targeting small peripheral nerves (&amp;lt;200&#160;&#181;m). To improve the electrode handling and implantation, a nerve interface that can fold itself to a cuff around a small nerve, triggered by the body moisture during insertion, is fabricated. This folding is achieved by printing a bilayer of a flexible polyurethane printing resin and a highly swelling sodium acrylate hydrogel using photopolymerization. When immersed in an aqueous liquid, the hydrogel swells and folds the electrode softly around the nerve. Furthermore, the electrodes are robust, can be stretched (&amp;gt;20%), and bent to facilitate the implantation due to the use of soft and stretchable printing resins as substrates and a microcracked gold film as conductive layer. The straightforward implantation and extraction of the electrode as well as stimulation and recording capabilities on a small peripheral nerve in vivo are demonstrated. It is believed that such simple and robust to use self-folding electrodes will pave the way for bringing PNI to a broader clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Widely Tunable Berry Curvature in the Magnetic Semimetal Cr1+&#948;Te2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide Cr1+&#948;Te2 is shown to be a unique magnetic semimetal enabling widely tunable k&#8208;space Berry curvature near Fermi energy. The door has been opened for probing and tailoring the intertwined Berry curvature physics in real and momentum&#160;space in Cr1+&#948;Te2 epitaxial thin films and their heterostructures.








Abstract
Magnetic semimetals have increasingly emerged as lucrative platforms hosting spin&#8208;based topological phenomena in real and momentum spaces. Cr1+&#948;Te2 is a self&#8208;intercalated magnetic transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD), which exhibits topological magnetism and tunable electron filling. While recent studies have explored real&#8208;space Berry curvature effects, similar considerations of momentum&#8208;space Berry curvature&#160;are lacking. Here, the electronic structure and transport properties of epitaxial Cr1+&#948;Te2 thin films are systematically investigated over a range of doping, &#948; (0.33 &#8211; 0.71). Spectroscopic experiments reveal the presence of a characteristic semi&#8208;metallic band region, which shows a rigid like energy shift with &#948;. Transport experiments show that the intrinsic component of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is sizable and undergoes a sign flip across &#948;. Finally, density functional theory calculations establish a link between the doping evolution of the band structure and AHE: the AHE sign flip is shown to emerge from the sign change of the Berry curvature, as the semi&#8208;metallic band region crosses the Fermi energy. These findings underscore the increasing relevance of momentum&#8208;space Berry curvature in magnetic TMDs and provide a unique platform for intertwining topological physics in real and momentum spaces.

         <title>A Highly Active, Long&#8208;Lived Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalyst Derived from Open&#8208;Framework Iridates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Open&#8208;framework iridate is employed as a pre&#8208;electrocatalyst for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The structure undergoes an unusual crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline phase transition during OER, with ultrasmall, (200) crystal plane&#8208;oriented rutile nanocrystallites as final active phase. The resulting nanocatalyst affords high activity, while remaining greatly stable for beyond 1000 h.








Abstract
The acidic oxygen evolution reaction underpins several important electrical&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversions, and this energy&#8208;intensive process relies industrially on iridium&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Here, phase&#8208;selective synthesis of metastable strontium iridates with open&#8208;framework structure and their unexpected transformation into a highly active, ultrastable oxygen evolution nano&#8208;electrocatalyst are presented. This transformation involves two major steps: Sr2+/H+ ion exchange in acid and in situ structural rearrangement under electrocatalysis conditions. Unlike its dense perovskite&#8208;structured polymorphs, the open&#8208;framework iridates have the ability to undergo rapid proton exchange in acid without framework amorphization. The resulting protonated iridates further reconstruct into ultrasmall, surface&#8208;hydroxylated, (200) crystal plane&#8208;oriented rutile nanocatalyst, instead of the common amorphous IrOxHy phase, during acidic oxygen evolution. Such microstructural characteristics are found to benefit both the oxidation of hydroxyls and the formation of O&#63743;O bonds in electrocatalytic cycle. As a result, the open&#8208;framework iridate derived nanocatalyst gives a comparable catalytic activity to the most active iridium&#8208;based oxygen evolution electrocatalysts in acid, and retains its catalytic activity for more than 1000&#160;h.

         <title>Bioinspired Self&#8208;Growing Hydrogels by Harnessing Interfacial Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the self&#8208;growing behaviors of keratin proteins, the fabrication of synthetic hydrogels by harnessing free radical polymerization at the interface between a&#160;monomer precursor solution and a&#160;liquid metal is reported, which can be further exploited for functional actuators and soft robotics.








Abstract
The production of natural materials is achieved through a bottom&#8208;up approach, in which materials spontaneously grow and adapt to the external environment. Synthetic materials are specifically designed and fabricated as engineered materials; however, they are far away from these natural self&#8208;growing attributes. Thus, design and fabrication of synthetic material systems to replicate the self&#8208;growing characteristics of those natural prototypes (i.e., hairs and nails) remains challenging. Inspired by the self&#8208;growing behaviors of keratin proteins, here the fabrication of synthetic hydrogels (i.e., polyacrylamide (PAAm)) from the free radical polymerization at the interface between AAm precursor solution and liquid metals (i.e., eutectic gallium&#8211;indium (EGaIn)) is reported. The newly formed hydrogel materials at the EGaIn/AAm precursor interface gradually push the whole hydrogel upward, enabling the self&#8208;growing of these synthetic hydrogel materials. This work not only endows the fabrication of synthetic materials with unprecedented self&#8208;growing characters, but also broadens the potential applications of self&#8208;growing materials in actuation and soft robotics.

         <title>Seeding and Emergence of Composite Skyrmions in a van der Waals Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Composite skyrmions with non&#8208;unitary topological charge are imaged in exfoliated flakes of the 2D magnet Fe3GeTe2. Transitions between skyrmion, skyrmionium, skyrmion bag, and skyrmion sack states reveal details concerning the topological protection of the observed objects. The general nature of the seeding and emergence formation mechanism highlights that composite skyrmions may await discovery in both well&#8208;known and future skyrmion materials.








Abstract
Topological charge plays a significant role in a range of physical systems. In particular, observations of real&#8208;space topological objects in magnetic materials have been largely limited to skyrmions &#8211; states with a unitary topological charge. Recently, more exotic states with varying topology, such as antiskyrmions, merons, or bimerons and 3D states such as skyrmion strings, chiral bobbers, and hopfions, have been experimentally reported. Along these lines, the realization of states with higher&#8208;order topology has the potential to open new avenues of research in topological magnetism and its spintronic applications. Here, real&#8208;space imaging of such spin textures, including skyrmion, skyrmionium, skyrmion bag, and skyrmion sack states, observed in exfoliated flakes of the van der Waals magnet Fe3&#8722;xGeTe2 (FGT) is reported. These composite skyrmions may emerge from seeded, loop&#8208;like states condensed into the stripe domain structure, demonstrating the possibility to realize spin textures with arbitrary integer topological charge within exfoliated flakes of 2D magnets. The general nature of the formation mechanism motivates the search for composite skyrmion states in both well&#8208;known and new magnetic materials, which may yet reveal an even richer spectrum of higher&#8208;order topological&#160;objects.

         <title>21.15%&#8208;Efficiency and Stable &#947;&#8201;&#8208;CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by an Acyloin Ligand</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acyloin ligand (1,2&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;dione (DED)) is developed to construct &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Comprehensive characterizations confirm that the&#160;carbonyl and thienyl in DED can synergistically bind with Pb2+&#8208;related defects by forming a&#160;chelate (one DED bind with two Pb2+ ions), yielding a stable &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3 film. Consequently, DED&#8208;CsPbI3 yields a champion PCE of 21.15% among the reported CsPbI3 PSCs to date.








Abstract
Cesium lead triiodide (CsPbI3) is a promising light&#8208;absorbing material for constructing perovskite solar cells (PSCs) owing to its favorable bandgap and thermal tolerance. However, the high density of defects in the CsPbI3 film not only act as recombination centers, but also facilitate ion migration, leading to lower PCE and inferior stability compared with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid PSC counterpart. Theoretical analyses suggest that the effective suppression of defects in CsPbI3 film is helpful for improving the device performance. Herein, the stable and efficient &#947;&#8201;&#8208;CsPbI3 PSCs are demonstrated by developing an&#160;acyloin ligand (1,2&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;dione (DED)) as a&#160;phase stabilizer and defect passivator. The experiment and calculation results confirm that carbonyl and thienyl in DED can synergistically interact with CsPbI3 by forming a&#160;chelate to effectively passivate Pb&#8208;related defects and further suppress ion migration. Consequently, DED&#8208;treated CsPbI3 PSCs yield a champion PCE of 21.15%, which is one of the highest PCE among all the reported CsPbI3 PSCs to date. In addition, the unencapsulated DED&#8208;CsPbI3 PSC can retain 94.9% of itsinitial PCE when stored under ambient conditions for 1000&#160;h and 92.8% of its initial PCE under constant illumination for 250&#160;h.

         <title>Electrically Switchable Polarization in Bi2O2Se Ferroelectric Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switchable ferroelectric polarization in Bi2O2Se semiconductors is experimentally and theoretically investigated. The interplay between ferroelectricity and semiconducting characteristics of Bi2O2Se is explored on device&#8208;level operation. Leveraging its ferroelectric polarization, the fabricated device exhibits &#8220;smart&#8221; photoresponse tunability. This research provides valuable insights into the synergistic effect of ferroelectricity with semiconducting characteristics in 2D ferroelectric semiconductors, toward device simplification and miniaturization.








Abstract
Atomically 2D layered ferroelectric semiconductors, in which the polarization switching process occurs within the channel material itself, offer a new material platform that can drive electronic components toward structural simplification and high&#8208;density integration. Here, a room&#8208;temperature 2D layered ferroelectric semiconductor, bismuth oxychalcogenides (Bi2O2Se), is investigated with a thickness down to 7.3&#160;nm (&#8776;12 layers) and piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of 4.4 &#177; 0.1 pm V&#8722;1. The random orientations and electrically dependent polarization of the dipoles in Bi2O2Se are separately uncovered owing to the structural symmetry&#8208;breaking at room temperature. Specifically, the interplay between ferroelectricity and semiconducting characteristics of Bi2O2Se is explored on device&#8208;level operation, revealing the hysteresis behavior and memory window (MW) formation. Leveraging the ferroelectric polarization originating from Bi2O2Se, the fabricated device exhibits &#8220;smart&#8221; photoresponse tunability and excellent electronic characteristics, e.g., a high on/off current ratio &gt;&#160;104 and a large MW to the sweeping range of 47% at VGS&#160;=&#160;&#177;5&#160;V. These results demonstrate the synergistic combination of ferroelectricity with semiconducting characteristics in Bi2O2Se, laying the foundation for integrating sensing, logic, and memory functions into a single material system that can overcome the bottlenecks in von Neumann architecture.

         <title>Controlled Synthesis of Sub&#8208;Millimeter Nonlayered WO2 Nanoplates via a WSe2&#8208;Assisted Method</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality and nonlayered WO2 nanoplates with tunable thickness and lateral dimension by a WSe2&#8208;assisted strategy are reported. Electrical measurements demonstrate that&#160;the WO2 nanoplates exhibit metallic behavior with excellent conductivity, ultrahigh breakdown current density, and strong anisotropic resistance. Magnetotransport studies show quantum&#8208;interference&#8208;induced weak&#8208;localization behavior. These studies demonstrate that 2D&#160;metal oxides are promising candidates for interconnecting and other novel electronic devices.








Abstract
2D&#160;metal oxides (2DMOs) have stimulated tremendous attention due to their distinct electronic structures and abundant surface chemistry. However, it remains a standing challenge for the synthesis of 2DMOs because of their intrinsic 3D&#160;lattice structure and ultrahigh synthesis temperature. Here, a reliable WSe2&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) strategy to grow nonlayered WO2 nanoplates with tunable thickness and lateral dimension is reported. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy studies demonstrate that the&#160;WO2 nanoplates exhibit a well&#8208;faceted rhombic geometry with a lateral dimension up to the sub&#8208;millimeter level (&#8776;135&#160;&#181;m), which is the largest size of 2DMO single crystals obtained by CVD to date. Scanning transmission electron microscopy studies reveal that the nanoplates are high&#8208;quality single crystals. Electrical measurements show the nanoplates exhibit metallic behavior with strong anisotropic resistance, outstanding conductivity of 1.1&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1, and breakdown current density of 7.1&#160;&#215;&#160;107&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. More interestingly, low&#8208;temperature magnetotransport studies demonstrate that the nanoplates show a quantum&#8208;interference&#8208;induced weak&#8208;localization effect. The developed WSe2&#8208;assisted strategy for the growth of WO2 nanoplates can enrich the library of 2DMO materials and provide a material platform for other property explorations based on 2D WO2.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Manganese on Carbon Substrate for Aqueous and Aprotic CO2 Electrochemical Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematically theoretical calculations are performed to seek the optimal structure from atomically dispersed manganese for CO2 electrochemical reduction catalysts. Based on the&#160;theoretical results, Mn&#8211;N4 sites with the functionalization of epoxy groups in the second coordination spheres are designed and embedded in a&#160;bowl&#8208;like mesoporous carbon substrate, which exhibits superior electrochemical performance in both the aqueous and aprotic electrolyte.








Abstract
CO2 utilization and conversion are of great importance in alleviating the rising CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Here, a single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) is reported for electrochemical CO2 utilization in both aqueous and aprotic electrolytes.

     alt="Atomically Dispersed Manganese on Carbon Substrate for Aqueous and Aprotic CO2 Electrochemical Reduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systematically theoretical calculations are performed to seek the optimal structure from atomically dispersed manganese for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrochemical reduction catalysts. Based on the&#160;theoretical results, Mn&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites with the functionalization of epoxy groups in the second coordination spheres are designed and embedded in a&#160;bowl-like mesoporous carbon substrate, which exhibits superior electrochemical performance in both the aqueous and aprotic electrolyte.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization and conversion are of great importance in alleviating the rising CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration in the atmosphere. Here, a single-atom catalyst (SAC) is reported for electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization in both aqueous and aprotic electrolytes. Specifically, atomically dispersed Mn&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites are embedded in bowl-like mesoporous carbon particles with the functionalization of epoxy groups in the second coordination spheres. Theoretical calculations suggest that the epoxy groups near the Mn&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; site adjust the electronic structure of the catalyst with reduced reaction energy barriers for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO. The resultant Mn-single-atom carbon with N and O doped catalyst (MCs-(N,O)) exhibits extraordinary electrocatalytic performance with a high CO faradaic efficiency of 94.5%, a high CO current density of 13.7 mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and a low overpotential of 0.44 V in the aqueous environment. Meanwhile, as a cathode catalyst for aprotic Li&#8211;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries, the MCs-(N,O) with well-regulated active sites and unique mesoporous bowl-like morphology optimizes the nucleation behavior of discharge products. MCs-(N,O)-based batteries deliver a low overpotential and excellent cyclic stability of 1000&#160;h. The&#160;findings in this work provide a new avenue to design and fabricate SACs for various electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coordinatively Stiffen and Toughen Hydrogels with Adaptable Crystal&#8208;Domain Cross&#8208;Linking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homogeneous dynamic cross&#8208;linking design is developed to reconcile the stiffness&#8211;toughness trade&#8208;off for hydrogels via fully triggering both deformation&#8208;resisting and energy&#8208;dissipating capacities of strong yet dynamic cross&#8208;links. Using a solvent&#8208;exchange&#8208;assisted salting&#8208;out method, a class of sal&#8208;exogels with high number densities of crystalline domains embedded in homogeneous networks is constructed, which achieves coordinatively enhanced stiffness and toughness.








Abstract
Conventional hydrogels usually suffer from the inherent conflict between stiffness and toughness, severely hampering their applications as load&#8208;bearing materials. Herein, an adaptable crystal&#8208;domain cross&#8208;linking design is reported to overcome this inherent trade&#8208;off for hydrogels by taking full advantage of both deformation&#8208;resisting and energy&#8208;dissipating capacities of cross&#8208;linking points. Through solvent exchange to homogenize the polymer network, followed by salting out to foster crystallization, a class of sal&#8208;exogels with high number densities of uniform crystalline domains embedded in homogeneous networks is constructed. During the deformation, those adaptive crystalline domains initially survive to arrest deformation, while later gradually disentangle to efficiently dissipate energy, crucial to the realization of the desirable compatibility between stiffness and toughness. The resultant sal&#8208;exogel achieves coordinatively enhanced stiffness (52.3 &#177; 2.7&#160;MPa) and toughness (120.7 &#177; 11.7&#160;kJ m&#8722;2), reconciling the challenging trade&#8208;off between them. This finding provides a practical and universal route to design stiff and tough hydrogels and has a profound impact on many applications requiring hydrogels with such combined mechanical properties.

         <title>Rapid Identification and Monitoring of Multiple Bacterial Infections Using Printed Nanoarrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, fast, and accessible diagnosis tool is developed for direct point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing of pathogenic bacteria in clinical and food samples at the single&#8208;cell level, by using a nanoarray&#8208;based colorimetric biosensor. It does not need enrichment, culturing, fluorescence probes, or other sample pretreatments, and can be readily extended to many microbes such as viruses, spirochetes, mycoplasma, rickettsia, and chlamydia.








Abstract
Fast and accurate detection of microbial cells in clinical samples is highly valuable but remains a challenge. Here, a simple, culture&#8208;free diagnostic system is developed for direct detection of pathogenic bacteria in water, urine, and serum samples using an optical colorimetric biosensor. It consists of printed nanoarrays chemically conjugated with specific antibodies that exhibits distinct color changes after capturing target pathogens. By utilizing the internal capillarity inside an evaporating droplet, target preconcentration is achieved within a few minutes to enable rapid identification and more efficient detection of bacterial pathogens. More importantly, the scattering signals of bacteria are significantly amplified by the nanoarrays due to strong near&#8208;field localization, which supports a visualizable analysis of the growth, reproduction, and cell activity of bacteria at the single&#8208;cell level. Finally, in addition to high selectivity, this nanoarray&#8208;based biosensor is also capable of accurate quantification and continuous monitoring of bacterial load on food over a broad linear range, with a detection limit of 10 CFU mL&#8722;1. This work provides an accessible and user&#8208;friendly tool for point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing of pathogens in many clinical and environmental applications, and possibly enables a breakthrough in early prevention and treatment.

Abstract
Mixing a sterically bulky, electron&#8208;transporting host material into a conventional single host&#8211;guest emissive layer is&#160;demonstrated&#160;to&#160;suppress phase separation of the host matrix while increasing the efficiency and operational lifetime of deep&#8208;blue phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PHOLEDs) with chromaticity coordinates of (0.14, 0.15). The bulky host enables homogenous mixing of the molecules comprising the emissive layer while suppressing single host aggregation; a significant loss channel of nonradiative recombination. By controlling the amorphous phase of the host&#8208;matrix morphology, the mixed&#8208;host device achieves a significant reduction in nonradiative exciton decay, resulting in 120 &#177; 6% increase in external quantum efficiency relative to an analogous, single&#8208;host device. In contrast to single host PHOLEDs where electrons are transported by the host and holes by the dopants, both charge carriers are conducted by the mixed host, reducing the probability of exciton annihilation, thereby doubling of the deep&#8208;blue PHOLED operational lifetime. These findings demonstrate that the host matrix morphology affects almost every aspect of PHOLED performance.

         <title>Deciphering Adverse Detrapped Hole Transfer in Hot&#8208;Electron Photoelectric Conversion at Infrared Wavelengths</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Existing hot&#8208;carrier devices suffer from low efficiencies, particularly in the infrared region, and ambiguous physical mechanisms. In&#160;this&#160;work,&#160;the competitive interfacial transfer mechanisms of detrapped holes and hot electrons in hot&#8208;carrier devices are discovered. By eliminating the adverse detrapped&#8208;hole transfer, the external quantum efficiency of a hot&#8208;electron device can increase by over two orders of magnitude at 10&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Hot&#8208;carrier devices are promising alternatives for enabling path breaking photoelectric conversion. However, existing hot&#8208;carrier devices suffer from low efficiencies, particularly in the infrared region, and ambiguous physical mechanisms. In&#160;this&#160;work,&#160;the competitive interfacial transfer mechanisms of detrapped holes and hot electrons in hot&#8208;carrier devices are discovered. Through photocurrent polarity research and optical&#8208;pump&#8211;THz&#8208;probe (OPTP) spectroscopy, it is verified that detrapped hole transfer (DHT) and hot&#8208;electron transfer (HET) dominate the low&#8208; and high&#8208;density excitation responses, respectively. The photocurrent ratio assigned to DHT and HET increases from 6.6% to over 1133.3% as the illumination intensity decreases. DHT induces severe degeneration of the external quantum efficiency (EQE), especially at low illumination intensities. The EQE of a hot&#8208;electron device can theoretically increase by over two orders of magnitude at 10&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 through DHT elimination. The OPTP results show that competitive transfer arises from the carrier oscillation type and carrier&#8208;density&#8208;related Coulomb screening. The screening intensity determines the excitation weight and hot&#8208;electron cooling scenes and thereby the transfer dynamics.

However, existing hot-carrier devices suffer from low efficiencies, particularly in the infrared region, and ambiguous physical mechanisms. In&#160;this&#160;work,&#160;the competitive interfacial transfer mechanisms of detrapped holes and hot electrons in hot-carrier devices are discovered. Through photocurrent polarity research and optical-pump&#8211;THz-probe (OPTP) spectroscopy, it is verified that detrapped hole transfer (DHT) and hot-electron transfer (HET) dominate the low- and high-density excitation responses, respectively. The photocurrent ratio assigned to DHT and HET increases from 6.6% to over 1133.3% as the illumination intensity decreases. DHT induces severe degeneration of the external quantum efficiency (EQE), especially at low illumination intensities. The EQE of a hot-electron device can theoretically increase by over two orders of magnitude at 10&#160;mW&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; through DHT elimination. The OPTP results show that competitive transfer arises from the carrier oscillation type and carrier-density-related Coulomb screening. The screening intensity determines the excitation weight and hot-electron cooling scenes and thereby the transfer dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Physiologically Responsive Nanocomposite Hydrogel for Treatment of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma via Proteolysis&#8208;Targeting Chimeras Enhanced Immunotherapy</title>

A PP&#8208;RC&#8208;H hydrogel confers potent immuno&#8208; and bio&#8208;chemotherapeutic effects against tumor growth and metastasis by exploiting multiple known vulnerabilities of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This synergistic strategy reverses the immunosuppressive microenvironment in tumor tissues for immunotherapy and also used a proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras drug and paclitaxel to induce tumor apoptosis and suppression of immune escape to further promote the immunotherapy against HNSCC.








Abstract
Although immunotherapy has revolutionized oncotherapy, only &#8776;15% of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients benefit from the current therapies. An immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and dysregulation of the polycomb ring finger oncogene BMI1 are potential reasons for the failure. Herein, to promote immunotherapeutic efficacy against HNSCC, an injectable nanocomposite hydrogel is developed with a polymer framework (PLGA&#8208;PEG&#8208;PLGA) that is loaded with both imiquimod encapsulated CaCO3 nanoparticles (RC) and cancer cell membrane (CCM)&#8208;coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles containing a peptide&#8208;based proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTAC) for BMI1 and paclitaxel (PepM@PacC). Upon injection, this nanocomposite hydrogel undergoes in situ gelation, after which it degrades in the TME over time, releasing RC and PepM@PacC nanoparticles to respectively perform immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Specifically, the RC particles selectively manipulate tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and dendritic cells to activate a T&#8208;cell immune response, while CCM&#8208;mediated homologous targeting and endocytosis delivers the PepM@PacC particles into cancer cells, where endogenous glutathione promotes disulfide bond cleavage to release the PROTAC peptide for BMI1 degradation and frees the paclitaxel from the particle pores to elicit apoptosis meanwhile enhance immunotherapy. Thus, the nanocomposite hydrogel, which is designed to exploit multiple known vulnerabilities of HNSCC, succeeds in suppressing both growth and metastasis of HNSCC.

         <title>Backbone Engineering Enables Highly Efficient Polymer Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new pyridine&#8208;based polymer hole&#8208;transporting material is developed through backbone engineering strategy to simultaneously modulate the interface and crystallinity of inverted perovskite solar cells, resulting in a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 24.89% (certified 24.50%) with outstanding stability.








Abstract
The interface and crystallinity of perovskite films play a decisive role in determining the device performance, which is significantly influenced by the bottom hole&#8208;transporting material (HTM) of inverted perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Herein, a simple design strategy of polymer HTMs&#160;is&#160;reported, which can modulate the wettability and promote the anchoring by introducing pyridine units into the polyarylamine backbone, so as to realize efficient and stable inverted PVSCs. The HTM properties can be effectively modified by varying the linkage sites of pyridine units, and 3,5&#8208;linked PTAA&#8208;P1&#160;particularly demonstrates a more regulated molecular configuration for interacting with perovskites, leading to highly crystalline perovskite films with uniform back contact and reduced defect density. Dopant&#8208;free PTAA&#8208;P1&#8208;based inverted PVSCs have realized remarkable efficiencies of 24.89% (certified value: 24.50%) for small&#8208;area (0.08&#160;cm2) as well as 23.12% for large&#8208;area (1&#160;cm2) devices. Moreover, the unencapsulated device maintains over 93% of its initial efficiency after 800&#160;h of maximum power point tracking under simulated AM 1.5G illumination.

         <title>Versatile Assembly of Metal&#8211;Phenolic Network Foams Enabled by Tannin&#8211;Cellulose Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;phenolic network foams are prepared using tannin&#8211;cellulose nanofibers as a structured background. The method relies on ice&#8208;templating the nanofibers to promote the metal&#8211;phenolic networking in situ, during thawing in ethanol solutions of metal nitrates. This leads to strong and homogenous lightweight foams, whose properties are tailorable by adjusting the tannin type and content, as well as the metal ion.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;phenolic network (MPN) foams are prepared using colloidal suspensions of tannin&#8208;containing cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) that are ice&#8208;templated and thawed in ethanolic media in the presence of metal nitrates. The MPN facilitates the formation of solid foams by air drying, given the strength and self&#8208;supporting nature of the obtained tannin&#8211;cellulose nanohybrid structures. The porous characteristics and (dry and wet) compression strength of the foams are rationalized by the development of secondary, cohesive&#160;metal&#8208;phenolic layers combined with a hydrogen bonding network involving the CNF. The shrinkage of the MPN foams is as low as 6% for samples prepared with 2.5&#8211;10% tannic acid (or condensed tannin at 2.5%) with respect to CNF content. The strength of the MPN foams reaches a maximum at 10% tannic acid (using Fe(III) ions), equivalent to a compressive strength 70% higher than that produced with tannin&#8208;free CNF foams. Overall, a straightforward framework is introduced to synthesize MPN foams whose physical and mechanical properties are tailored by the presence of tannins as well as the metal ion species that enable the metal&#8211;phenolic networking. Depending on the metal ion, the foams are amenable to modification according to the desired application.

         <title>Inhibiting Formation and Reduction of Li2CO3 to LiCx at Grain Boundaries in Garnet Electrolytes to Prevent Li Penetration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel mechanism for Li penetration is discovered within Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) where Li2CO3 at the grain boundaries (GBs) of LLZO is reduced to an electron&#8208;conductive LiCx network. The ion/electron transfer properties of GBs within LLZO are regulated via F&#8208;doping and LiAlO2 infusion, which significantly reduce the formation of Li2CO3 and promote homogenous Li plating/stripping.








Abstract
Poor ion and high electron transport at the grain boundaries (GBs) of ceramic electrolytes are the primary reasons for lithium filament infiltration and short&#8208;circuiting of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASLMBs). Herein, it is discovered that Li2CO3 at the GBs of Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) sheets is reduced to highly electron&#8208;conductive LiCx during cycling, resulting in lithium penetration of LLZO. The ionic and electronic conductivity of the GBs within LLZO can be simultaneously tuned using sintered Li3AlF6. The generated LiAlO2 (LAO) infusion and F&#8208;doping at the GBs of LLZO (LAO&#8208;LLZOF) significantly reduce the Li2CO3 content and broaden the energy bandgap of LLZO, which decreases the electronic conductivity of LAO&#8208;LLZOF. LAO forms a 3D continuous ion transport network at the GB that significantly improves the total ionic conductivity. Lithium penetration within LLZO is suppressed and an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LiFePO4/LAO&#8208;LLZOF/Li battery stably cycled for 5500 cycles at 3&#160;C. This work reveals the chemistry of Li2CO3 at the LLZO GBs during cycling, presents a novel lithium penetration mechanism within garnet electrolytes, and provides an innovative method to simultaneously regulate the ion and electron transport at the GBs in garnet electrodes for advanced ASLMBs.

Lithium penetration within LLZO is suppressed and an all-solid-state LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/LAO-LLZOF/Li battery stably cycled for 5500 cycles at 3&#160;C. This work reveals the chemistry of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at the LLZO GBs during cycling, presents a novel lithium penetration mechanism within garnet electrolytes, and provides an innovative method to simultaneously regulate the ion and electron transport at the GBs in garnet electrodes for advanced ASLMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogel Nanoarchitectonics of a Flexible and Self&#8208;Adhesive Electrode for Long&#8208;Term Wireless Electroencephalogram Recording and High&#8208;Accuracy Sustained Attention Evaluation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multichannel and wirelessly operated hydrogel electrode for long&#8208;term electroencephalography (EEG) signal recording and real&#8208;time sustained attention evaluation is presented. Due to the combined merits of conductivity, self&#8208;adhesion, low modulus, flexibility, and transparency of the hydrogel, it is able to construct an effective and stable bioelectrical interface for high&#8208;quality EEG signal acquisition.








Abstract
Hydrogels are ideal building blocks to fabricate the next generation of electrodes for acquiring high&#8208;quality physiological electrical signals, for example, electroencephalography (EEG). However, collection of EEG signals still suffers from electrode deformation, sweating, extensive body motion and vibration, and environmental interference. Herein, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinylpyrrolidone are selected to prepare a hydrogel network with tissue&#8208;like modulus and excellent flexibility. Additionally, polydopamine nanoparticles, obtained by polydopamine peroxidation, are integrated into the hydrogel to endow them with higher transparency, higher self&#8208;adhesion, and lower impedance. Consequently, a multichannel and wirelessly operated hydrogel electrode can establish a conformal and stable interface with tissue and illustrate high channel uniformity, low interfacial contact impedance, low power noise, long&#8208;term stability, and a tolerance to sweat and motion. Furthermore, the hydrogel electrode shows the unprecedented ability to classify the recorded high&#8208;quality prefrontal EEG signals into seven&#8208;category sustained attention with high accuracy (91.5%), having great potential applications in the assessment of human consciousness and in multifunctional diagnoses.

         <title>Revisiting Lithium&#8208; and Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage in Hard Carbon Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive comparison of the lithium&#8208; and sodium&#8208;ion storage behaviors of hard carbon is conducted, yielding the key findings: the sloping voltage section is presented by the lithium&#8208;ion intercalation in the graphitic lattices of hard carbons, whereas it mainly arises from the chemisorption of sodium ions. The intercalation preference and the plateau capacity have an inverse correlation.








Abstract
The galvanostatic lithiation/sodiation voltage profiles of hard carbon anodes are simple, with a sloping drop followed by a&#160;plateau. However, a precise understanding of the corresponding redox sites and storage mechanisms is still elusive, which hinders further development in commercial applications. Here, a comprehensive comparison of the lithium&#8208; and sodium&#8208;ion storage behaviors of hard carbon is conducted, yielding the following key findings: 1) the sloping voltage section is presented by the lithium&#8208;ion intercalation in the graphitic lattices of hard carbons, whereas it mainly arises from the chemisorption of sodium ions on their inner surfaces constituting closed pores, even if the graphitic lattices are unoccupied; 2) the redox sites for the plateau capacities are the same as those for the closed pores regardless of the alkali ions; 3) the sodiation plateau capacities are mostly determined by the volume of the available closed pore, whereas the lithiation plateau capacities are primarily affected by the intercalation propensity; and 4) the intercalation preference and the plateau capacity have an inverse correlation. These findings from extensive characterizations and theoretical investigations provide a relatively clear elucidation of the electrochemical footprint of hard carbon anodes in relation to the redox mechanisms and storage sites for lithium and sodium ions, thereby providing a more rational design strategy for constructing better hard carbon anodes.

         <title>Enhancement of Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Spin&#8211;Orbit Torque by Interfacial Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation in CuPt/ferromagnet interface is found to be able to enhance the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (OOP) torque and associated spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT) switching efficiency with remaining threefold rotational symmetry. The enhancement is independent of the device shapes, magnetic materials, or magnetization easy axis. This work offers an industrial&#8208;compatible route to improve the performance of low&#8208;symmetry crystal&#8208;based spintronic devices.








Abstract
Spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT)&#8208;induced switching of perpendicular magnetization in the absence of magnetic field is crucial for the application of SOT&#8208;based spintronic devices. Recent works have demonstrated that the low&#8208;symmetry crystal structure in CuPt/CoPt can give rise to an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (OOP) spin torque and lead to deterministic magnetization switching without an external field. However, it is essential to improve OOP effective field for the efficient switching. In this work, the impact of interface oxidation on the generation of OOP effective field in a CuPt/ferromagnet heterostructure is systematically studied. By introducing an oxidized CuPt surface, it is found that the field&#8208;free switching performance shows remarkable improvement. OOP effective field measurement indicates that the oxidation treatment can enhance the OOP effective field by more than two times. It is also demonstrated that this oxidation&#8208;induced OOP SOT efficiency enhancement is independent of the device shapes, magnetic materials, or magnetization easy axis. This work contributes to improve the performance of SOT devices and provides an effective fabrication guidance for future spintronic devices that utilize OOP SOT.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Transfer of Freestanding Large&#8208;Area Conjugated Polymer Films for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A technique to enable deposition of large&#8208;area, freestanding, ultra&#8208;thin, conjugated polymer films, which can be transferred to a desired substrate without using solvents, is demonstrated. The quality of these films is assessed by a variety of techniques, and limiting factors and strategies are identified.








Abstract
Conventional processes for depositing thin films of conjugated polymers are restricted to those based on vapor, liquid, and solution&#8208;phase precursors. Each of these methods bear some limitations. For example, low&#8208;bandgap polymers with alternating donor&#8211;acceptor structures cannot be deposited from the vapor phase, and solution&#8208;phase deposition is always subject to issues related to the incompatibility of the substrate with the solvent. Here, a technique to enable deposition of large&#8208;area, ultra&#8208;thin films (&#8776;20 nm or more), which are transferred from the surface of water, is demonstrated. From the water, these pre&#8208;solidified films can then be transferred to a desired substrate, circumventing limitations such as solvent orthogonality. The quality of these films is characterized by a variety of imaging and electrochemical measurements. Mechanical toughness is identified as a limiting property of polymer compatibility, along with some strategies to address this limitation. As a demonstration, the films are used as the hole&#8208;transport layer in perovskite solar cells, in which their performance is shown to be comparable to controls formed by&#160;spin&#8208;coating.

         <title>Perspiring Soft Robotics Skin Constituted by Dynamic Polarity&#8208;Switching Porous Liquid Crystal Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic polarity switching liquid crystal polymer network membrane skin, which enables the exchange of apolar liquid with polar liquid, is developed. This is realized by incorporating a benzoic acid derivative into the original apolar polymer network. A number of applications based on this system from anti&#8208;icing, surface friction tuning, and drug release, to surface adhesion control are demonstrated.








Abstract
Secretion of functional fluids is essential for affecting surface properties in ecosystems. The existing polymer membranes that mimic human skin functions are limited to secreting, either apolar or polar, liquid. However, the development of membranes that grant exchange liquid with different polarities remains a grand challenge. This process is prohibited by the mismatch of the polarity between the carrier polymer and the loaded liquid. To conquer this limitation, an innovative strategy is reported to dynamically switch the polarity of the porous membrane, thereby empowering the exchange of apolar liquid with polar liquid and vice versa. This approach incorporates a benzoic acid derivative into the original apolar polymer network. The benzoic acid dimerizes and forms hydrogen bonds, which supports the molecular alignment, but can be broken into the ionic state when subjected to alkaline treatment, changing the polarity of themembrane. Consequently, the apolar liquid can be replaced with a more polar one. This polar liquid is ejected upon safe&#8208;dose UV illumination from the membrane. Reabsorption occurs on demand by illumination of visible light or when left in contact with the membrane, spontaneously in the dark. Based on this, the consumed membrane is replenished with the same or different exchanging liquid.

         <title>Pd&#8211;PdO Nanodomains on Amorphous Ru Metallene Oxide for High&#8208;Performance Multifunctional Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct heterostructure engineering on an ultrathin 2D platform of Pd&#8211;PdO nanodomains confined on amorphous RuO2 yields excellent catalytic activity toward pH&#8208;universal HER, alkaline oxygen electrochemistry, and overall water splitting. The enhanced multifunctional performance is attributed to the rational integration of novel nanostructures, including atomically thin morphology, coexisting amorphous and defect&#8208;rich crystalline phases, and multicomponent heterostructural features.








Abstract
Developing highly efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts is crucial for future sustainable energy &#160;pursuits, but remains a great challenge. Herein, a facile synthetic strategy is used to confine atomically thin Pd&#8211;PdO nanodomains to amorphous Ru metallene oxide (RuO2). The as&#8208;synthesized electrocatalyst (Pd2RuOx&#8208;0.5&#160;h) exhibits excellent catalytic activity toward the pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction (&#951;10&#160;=&#160;14&#160;mV in 1&#160;m KOH, &#951;10&#160;=&#160;12&#160;mV in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4, and &#951;10&#160;=&#160;22&#160;mV in 1&#160;m PBS), alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (&#951;10&#160;=&#160;225&#160;mV), and overall water splitting (E10&#160;=&#160;1.49&#160;V) with high mass activity and operational stability. Further reduction endows the material (Pd2RuOx&#8208;2&#160;h) with a promising alkaline oxygen reduction activity, evidenced by high halfway potential, four&#8208;electron selectivity, and excellent poison tolerance. The enhanced catalytic activity is attributed to the rational integration of favorable nanostructures, including 1) the atomically thin nanosheet morphology, 2) the coexisting amorphous and defective crystalline phases, and 3) the multi&#8208;component heterostructural features. These structural factors effectively regulate the material's electronic configuration and the adsorption of intermediates at the active sites for favorable reaction energetics.

         <title>Thermoresponsive Electrolytes for Safe Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermoresponsive electrolyte is introduced into a working cell to relieve the exothermic reactions between electrodes and electrolytes, the internal short circuit. The critical temperature for thermal safety, &#8220;ignition point&#8221; of battery, and internal&#8208;short&#8208;circuit temperature of batteries with thermoresponsive electrolyte increase from 71.5, 100.3, and 126.3&#160;&#176;C to 137.4, 203.6, and 176.5&#160;&#176;C compared with routine electrolyte.








Abstract
Exploring advanced strategies in alleviating the thermal runaway of lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) is critically essential. Herein, a novel electrolyte system with thermoresponsive characteristics is designed to largely enhance the thermal safety of 1.0 Ah LMBs. Specifically, vinyl carbonate (VC) with azodiisobutyronitrile is introduced as a thermoresponsive solvent to boost the thermal stability of both the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and electrolyte. First, abundant poly(VC) is formed in SEI with thermoresponsive electrolyte, which is more thermally stable against lithium hexafluorophosphate compared to the inorganic components widely acquired in routine electrolyte. This increases the critical temperature for thermal safety (the beginning temperature of obvious self&#8208;heating) from 71.5 to 137.4&#160;&#176;C. The remained VC solvents can be polymerized into poly(VC) as the battery temperature abnormally increases. The poly(VC) can not only afford as a barrier to prevent the direct contact between electrodes, but also immobilize the free liquid solvents, thereby reducing the exothermic reactions between electrodes and electrolytes. Consequently, the internal&#8208;short&#8208;circuit temperature and &#8220;ignition point&#8221; temperature (the starting temperature of thermal runaway) of LMBs are largely increased from 126.3 and 100.3&#160;&#176;C to 176.5 and 203.6&#160;&#176;C. This work provides novel insights for pursuing thermally stable LMBs with the addition of various thermoresponsive solvents in commercial electrolytes.

         <title>Sequential Deposition of Multicomponent Bulk Heterojunctions Increases Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;bulk heterojunction active layer structure for organic solar cell (OSC) is constructed by sequential deposition of a PM6:L8&#8208;BO blend on top of a D18&#8208;Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend, in which the optimal morphology of the two binary blends were&#160;retained with a vertical phase separation, resulting in a record PCE of 19.61%.








Abstract
Constructing tandem and multi&#8208;blend organic solar cells (OSCs) is&#160;an effective way to overcome the absorption limitations of conventional single&#8208;junction devices. However, these methods inevitably require tedious multilayer deposition or complicated morphology&#8208;optimization procedures. Herein, sequential deposition is utilized as an effective and simple method to fabricate multicomponent OSCs with a double&#8208;bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure of the active layer to further improve photovoltaic performance. Two efficient donor&#8208;acceptor pairs, D18&#8208;Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9 and PM6:L8&#8208;BO, are sequentially deposited to form the D18&#8208;Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9/PM6:L8&#8208;BO double&#8208;BHJ active layer. In these double&#8208;BHJ OSCs, light absorption is significantly improved, and optimal morphology is also retained without requiring a more complicated morphology optimization involved in quaternary blends. Compared to the quaternary blend devices, energy loss (Eloss) is also reduced by rationally matching each donor with an appropriate acceptor. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is improved from 18.25% for D18&#8208;Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9 and 18.69% for PM6:L8&#8208;BO based binary blend OSCs to 19.61% for the double&#8208;BHJ OSCs. In contrast, a D18&#8208;Cl:PM6:L8&#8208;BO:BTP&#8208;eC9 quaternary blend of OSCs exhibited a dramatically reduced PCE of 15.83%. These results demonstrate that a double&#8208;BHJ strategy, with a relatively simple processing procedure, can potentially enhance the device performance of OSCs and lead to more widespread use.

Electromagnetic Metamaterials
Conformal volumetric grayscale metamaterials are structured dielectric media, designed using gradient&#8208;based topology optimization, which are capable of supporting highly multiplexed electromagnetic responses and curvilinear form factors, as reported by Jonathan A. Fan and co&#8208;workers in article number 2204688. An invisibility carpet cloak that can hide arbitrary&#8208;shaped objects from electromagnetic waves featuring a range of incidence angles and wavelengths is depicted.

Gallium Nitride Surface
The vulnerability of the GaN surface is a critical restriction that hinders the development of GaN&#8208;based devices. In article number 2208960, Junting Chen, Junlei Zhao, Mengyuan Hua, and co&#8208;workers report the conversion of the GaN surface into a gallium oxynitride (GaON) epitaxial nanolayer by an in situ two&#8208;step &#8220;oxidation&#8211;reconfiguration&#8221; process. The metastable GaON nanolayer can enhance the performance of GaN&#8208;based devices in power, logic, and photoelectric applications.

Synaptic Transistors
In article 2208497, Haifeng Ling, Linghai Xie, Wei Huang, and co&#8208;workers propose a wavelength&#8208;aware reconfigurable synaptic transistor for visuomorphic computing. Based on the broadband absorption of Zr&#8208;CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals, reconfigurability between short&#8208;term plasticity and long&#8208;term plasticity for the device is realized. A vision sensor array is constructed to simulate image pre&#8208;processing and recognition with a homogeneous architecture.

Insulator&#8211;Metal Transition
In article number 2211612, Zhicheng Zhong, Xuefeng Wang, and co&#8208;workers report that UV&#8208;light irradiation on perovskite&#8208;based heterostructures can drive the photocharge transfer from SrTiO3 substrates to intermediate&#8208;spin ferromagnetic SrRuO3 ultrathin films containing oxygen vacancies. As a consequence, a reversible Mott&#8208;insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal phase transition occurs in the SrRuO3 layer, as revealed by systematic light&#8208;irradiation transport experiments and dynamical mean&#8208;field theory calculations.

Active Polymer Waveguides
In article number 2209239, Hui Xu, Dan Zhang, and co&#8208;workers report high gains at 1.06 and 1.31 &#956;m wavelengths in a novel complex Nd (TTA)3(XPO)&#8208;doped polymer waveguide with the excitation by light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) instead of a semiconductor laser as the pump source. The importance of this work is to minimize the commercial cost of waveguide amplifiers in planar photonic integration.

Self&#8208;Folding Electrodes
In article number 2210206, Lukas Hiendlmeier, Francisco Zurita, Bernhard Wolfrum, and co&#8208;workers present a new method for fabricating small, soft, and stretchable cuff electrodes that fold and change shape when submerged in an aqueous environment. Just like a hand closes its fingers when grasping, these structures fold and wrap around peripheral nerves, greatly simplifying the process of nerve interfacing at a small scale.

The properties and application progress of hollow multi&#8208;shelled structure (HoMS) drug delivery system (DDS) for small&#8208;molecule and macromolecular drugs.








Abstract
Hollow&#8208;structured nanomaterials (HSNMs) have attracted increased interest in biomedical fields, owing to their excellent potential as drug delivery systems (DDSs) for clinical applications. Among HSNMs, hollow multi&#8208;shelled structures (HoMSs) exhibit properties such as high loading capacity, sequential drug release, and multi&#8208;functionalized modification and represent a new class of nanoplatforms for clinical applications. The remarkable properties of HoMS&#8208;based DDS can simultaneously satisfy and enhance DDSs for delivering small molecular drugs (e.g., antibiotics, chemotherapy drugs, and imaging agents) and macromolecular drugs (e.g., protein/peptide&#8208; and nucleic acid&#8208;based drugs). First, the latest research advances in delivering small molecular drugs are summarized and highlight the inherent advantages of HoMS&#8208;based DDSs for small molecular drug targeting, combining continuous therapeutic drug delivery and theranostics to optimize the clinical benefit. Meanwhile, the macromolecular drugs DDSs are in the initial development stage and currently offer limited delivery modes. There is a growing need to analyze the deficiency of other HSNMs and integrate the advantages of HSNMs, providing solutions for the safe, stable, and cascade delivery of macromolecular drugs to meet vast treatment requirements. Therefore, the latest advances in HoMS&#8208;based DDSs are comprehensively reviewed, mainly focusing on the characteristics, research progress by drug category, and future research prospects.

         <dc:description>
Recently reported new methods to induce strain are summarized and discussed, and the latest developments on the modification of electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of 2D materials are updated by strain engineering (in particular properties such as the electrochemical, magnetic and superconducting characteristics, and their strain tuning have received little attention previously), and future perspectives are presented.








Abstract
Strain engineering is a promising way to tune the electrical, electrochemical, magnetic, and optical properties of 2D&#160;materials, with the potential to achieve high&#8208;performance 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based devices ultimately. This review discusses the experimental and theoretical results from recent advances in the strain engineering of 2D materials. Some novel methods to induce strain are summarized and then the tunable electrical and optical/optoelectronic properties of 2D materials via strain engineering are highlighted, including particularly the previously less&#8208;discussed strain tuning of superconducting, magnetic, and electrochemical properties. Also, future perspectives of strain engineering are given for its potential applications in functional devices. The state of the survey presents the ever&#8208;increasing advantages and popularity of strain engineering for tuning properties of 2D materials. Suggestions and insights for further research and applications in optical, electronic, and spintronic devices are provided.

         <title>Toward Plasmonic Neural Probes: SERS Detection of Neurotransmitters through Gold&#8208;Nanoislands&#8208;Decorated Tapered Optical Fibers with Sub&#8208;10&#160;nm Gaps</title>

         <dc:description>
A surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy based neural probe that can detect neurotransmitters down to the micromolar range is presented. Striving for the development of minimally invasive neuroplasmonic probes providing highly sensitive biomolecular detection in the deep brain regions, a nonplanar repeated dewetting technique to fabricate gold nanoislands with sub&#8208;10 nm gaps around the entire tapered optical fiber surface is introduced.








Abstract
Integration of plasmonic nanostructures with fiber&#8208;optics&#8208;based neural probes enables label&#8208;free detection of molecular fingerprints via surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), and it represents a fascinating technological horizon to investigate brain function. However, developing neuroplasmonic probes that can interface with deep brain regions with minimal invasiveness while providing the sensitivity to detect biomolecular signatures in a physiological environment is challenging, in particular because the same waveguide must be employed for both delivering excitation light and collecting the resulting scattered photons. Here, a SERS&#8208;active neural probe based on a tapered optical fiber (TF) decorated with gold nanoislands (NIs) that can detect neurotransmitters down to the micromolar range is presented. To do this, a novel, nonplanar repeated dewetting technique to fabricate gold NIs with sub&#8208;10&#160;nm gaps, uniformly distributed on the wide (square millimeter scale in surface area), highly curved surface of TF is developed. It is experimentally and numerically shown&#160;that the amplified broadband near&#8208;field enhancement of the high&#8208;density NIs layer allows for achieving a limit of detection in aqueous solution of 10&#8722;7&#160;m for rhodamine 6G and 10&#8722;5&#160;m for serotonin and dopamine through SERS at near&#8208;infrared wavelengths. The NIs&#8208;TF technology is envisioned as a first step toward the unexplored frontier of in vivo label&#8208;free plasmonic neural interfaces.

         <title>Hybridization Engineering of Oxyfluoride Aluminosilicate Glass for Construction of Dual&#8208;Phase Optical Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>

Abstract
The construction of transparent ceramics under mild conditionsand standard atmospheric pressure has great scientific and technological potential; however, it remains difficult to achieve when conventional ceramic sintering techniques are used. Herein, a mild strategy for constructing dual&#8208;phase optical ceramics with high crystallinity (&gt;90%) based on the stepped dual&#8208;phase crystallization of hybridized aluminosilicate glass is presented. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the hybridization of the glass system enables a new balance between the glass&#8208;forming ability and crystallization and can overcome the uncontrolled devitrification phenomenon during the dense crystallization of glass. Transparent hybridized oxide&#8208;fluoride ceramics with fiber geometry and dual&#8208;phase microstructures are also successfully fabricated. The generality of the strategy is confirmed, and transparent ceramics with various chemical compositions and phase combinations are prepared. Additionally, the cross&#8208;section of the ceramic fibers can be easily tuned into a circle, square, trapezoid, or even a triangle. Furthermore, the practical applications of optical ceramics for lighting and X&#8208;ray imaging are demonstrated. The findings described here suggest a major step toward expanding the scope of optical ceramics.

         <title>From Heterostructures to Solid&#8208;Solutions: Structural Tunability in Mixed Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The degree of ion mixing in multicomponent perovskite crystals is a key factor for the stability and performance of optoelectronic devices but remains challenging to control. In this work, a new method, termed evaporation&#8211;crystallization polymer pen lithography, is used to synthesize and systematically study libraries of halide perovskite crystals (Cs1&#8722;xFAxPbX3, where X = halide anion) and reveals strategies for deliberately controlling ion segregation behavior in these materials.








Abstract
The stability, reliability, and performance of halide&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based devices depend upon the structure, composition, and particle size of the device&#8208;enabling materials. Indeed, the degree of ion mixing in multicomponent perovskite crystals, although challenging to control, is a key factor in determining properties. Herein, an emerging method termed evaporation&#8211;crystallization polymer pen lithography is used to synthesize and systematically study the degree of ionic mixing of Cs0.5FA0.5PbX3 (FA = formamidinium; X = halide anion, ABX3) crystals, as a function of size, temperature, and composition. These experiments have led to the discovery of a heterostructure morphology where the A&#8208;site cations, Cs and FA, are segregated into the core and edge layers, respectively. Simulation and experimental results indicate that the heterostructures form as a consequence of a combination of both differences in solubility of the two ions in solution and the enthalpic preference for Cs&#8211;FA ion segregation. This preference for segregation can be overcome to form a solid&#8208;solution by decreasing crystal size (&lt;60&#160;nm) or increasing temperature. Finally, these tools are utilized to identify and synthesize solid&#8208;solution nanocrystals of Cs0.5FA0.5Pb(Br/I)3 that significantly suppress photoinduced anion migration compared to their bulk counterparts, offering a route to deliberately designed photostable optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Oral Delivery of siRNA Using Fluorinated, Small&#8208;Sized Nanocapsules toward Anti&#8208;Inflammation Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;sized, reversibly cross&#8208;linked, fluorinated nanocapsules are developed to mediate efficient intestinal absorption of siRNA and systemic tumor necrosis factor &#945; gene silencing via oral administration. They feature high oral bioavailability of 20.4%, and demonstrate potent anti&#8208;inflammatory efficacy against both acute and chronic inflammation. This study provides a transformative platform for oral siRNA delivery.








Abstract
Oral delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) provides a promising paradigm for treating diseases that require regular injections. However, the multiple gastrointestinal (GI) and systemic barriers often lead to inefficient oral absorption and low bioavailability of siRNA. Technologies that can overcome these barriers are still lacking, which hinders the clinical potential of orally delivered siRNA. Herein, small&#8208;sized, fluorinated nanocapsules (F&#8208;NCs) are developed to mediate efficient oral delivery of tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF&#8208;&#945;) siRNA for anti&#8208;inflammation treatment. The NCs possess a disulfide&#8208;cross&#8208;linked shell structure, thus featuring robust stability in the GI tract. Because of their small size (&#8776;30&#160;nm) and fluorocarbon&#8208;assisted repelling of mucin adsorption, the best&#8208;performing F3&#8208;NCs show excellent mucus penetration and intestinal transport capabilities without impairing the intestinal tight junction, conferring the oral bioavailability of 20.4% in relative to intravenous injection. The disulfide cross&#8208;linker can be cleaved inside target cells, causing NCs dissociation and siRNA release to potentiate the TNF&#8208;&#945; silencing efficiency. In murine models of acute and chronic inflammation, orally delivered F3&#8208;NCs provoke efficient TNF&#8208;&#945; silencing and pronounced anti&#8208;inflammatory efficacies. This study therefore provides a transformative strategy for oral siRNA delivery, and will render promising utilities for anti&#8208;inflammation treatment.

         <title>Correlated Rattling of Sodium&#8208;Chains Suppressing Thermal Conduction in Thermoelectric Stannides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin&#8208;based intermetallics with tunnel frameworks encapsulating zigzag Na&#8208;chains show lower thermal conductivity with decreasing inter&#8208;Na distances. Na atoms behave as Einstein&#8208;like oscillators along the tunnel, while significant interactions exist both between Na atoms in the chain and between the chain and the framework. The large anisotropic oscillations, the correlation of Na atoms in the tunnels, and their interaction with frameworks&#160;lead to low thermal conductivity.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;based intermetallics with tunnel frameworks containing zigzag Na chains that excite correlated rattling impinging on the framework phonons are attractive as thermoelectric materials owing to their low lattice thermal conductivity. The correlated rattling of Na atoms in the zigzag chains and the origin of the low thermal conductivity is uncovered via experimental and computational analyses. The Na atoms behave as oscillators along the tunnel, resulting in substantial interactions between Na atoms in the chain and between the chain and framework. In these intermetallic compounds, a shorter inter&#8208;rattler distance results in lower thermal conductivity, suggesting that phonon scattering by the correlated rattling Na&#8208;chains is enhanced. These results provide new insights into the behavior of thermoelectric materials with low thermal conductivity and suggest strategies for the development of such materials that utilize the correlated rattling.

         <title>Tuning of Polar Domain Boundaries in Nonpolar Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Domain boundaries with macroscopic polarity are discovered in a nonpolar PbZrO3&#8208;based single crystal. They can be preferentially created and erased by applying a small stress. The polarity can be enhanced or switched with a small electric field. Atomistic&#8208;structural analysis reveals that the polar domains boundaries are formed by a combination of &#8593;&#8593;&#8595;&#8208;like ferrielectric structures.








Abstract
Domain boundaries in ferroic materials are found to have various physical properties not observed in the surrounding domains. Such differences can be enhanced and bring promising functionalities when centrosymmetric nonpolar materials encounter polar domain boundaries. In this work, a tunable polar domain boundary is discovered in an antiferroelectric single crystal. Under a small stress or electric field, the density, volume, and polarity of the boundaries are successfully controlled.

         <title>Triplet Fusion Upconversion for Photocuring 3D&#8208;Printed Particle&#8208;Reinforced Composite Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct&#8208;ink&#8208;write printing and photocuring of opaque hydrogel composites are enabled by multiexciton triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion. Low energy red light is used for better penetration into opaque hydrogels and the upconverted blue light induces the free radical photopolymerization process. This method allows conventional photoinitiation systems to modify objects that block high energy photons.








Abstract
High energy photons (&#955;&#160;&lt;&#160;400&#160;nm) are frequently used to initiate free radical polymerizations to form polymer networks, but are only effective for transparent objects. This phenomenon poses a major challenge to additive manufacturing of particle&#8208;reinforced composite networks since deep light penetration of short&#8208;wavelength photons limits the homogeneous modification of physicochemical and mechanical properties. Herein, the unconventional, yet versatile, multiexciton process of triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) is employed for curing opaque hydrogel composites created by direct&#8208;ink&#8208;write (DIW) 3D printing. TTA&#8208;UC converts low energy red light (&#955;max&#160;=&#160;660&#160;nm) for deep penetration into higher&#8208;energy blue light to initiate free radical polymerizations within opaque objects. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, hydrogels containing up to 15&#160;wt.% TiO2 filler particles and doped with TTA&#8208;UC chromophores are readily cured with red light, while composites without the chromophores and TiO2 loadings as little as 1&#8211;2&#160;wt.% remain uncured. Importantly, this method has wide potential to modify the chemical and mechanical properties of complex DIW 3D&#8208;printed composite polymer networks.

         <title>Radiative Recombination Processes in Halide Perovskites Observed by Light Emission Voltage Modulated Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new methodology to analyze the kinetics that determine the light emission in voltage&#8208;driven devices is presented. It consists of combining the voltage&#8208;modulated light emission with impedance spectroscopy, whose spectra are interpreted according to the described equivalent circuit. This method, which is unprecedently applied to perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with high radiative efficiency, reveals electronic steps that delay the radiative event.








Abstract
The kinetics of light emission in halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and solar cells is composed of a radiative recombination of voltage&#8208;injected carriers mediated by additional steps such as carrier trapping, redistribution of injected carriers, and photon recycling that affect the observed luminescence decays. These processes are investigated in high&#8208;performance halide perovskite LEDs, with external quantum efficiency (EQE) and luminance values higher than 20% and 80&#160;000 Cd m&#8722;2, by measuring the frequency&#8208;resolved emitted light with respect to modulated voltage through a new methodology termed light emission voltage modulated spectroscopy (LEVS). The spectra are shown to provide detailed information on at least three different characteristic times. Essentially, new information is obtained with respect to the electrical method of impedance spectroscopy (IS), and overall, LEVS shows promise to capture internal kinetics that are difficult to be discerned by other techniques.

         <title>Toward the Speed Limit of Phase&#8208;Change Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The operation speeds of elemental Sb devices are explored by both&#160;theoretical calculations and experiments. It is directly demonstrated that the fastest speed of elemental Sb is &#8776;242&#160;ps, which is also the fastest operation speed as found among known phase&#8208;change memory.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;change memory (PCM) is one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation data&#8208;storage technology, the programming speed of which has enhanced within a timescale from milliseconds to sub&#8208;nanosecond (&#8776;500 ps) through decades of effort. As the potential applications of PCM strongly depend on the switching speed, namely, the time required for the recrystallization of amorphous chalcogenide media, the finding of the ultimate crystallization speed is of great importance both theoretically and practically. In&#160;this&#160;work, through systematic analysis of discovered phase&#8208;change materials and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, elemental Sb&#8208;based PCM is predicted to have a superfast crystallization speed. Indeed, such cells experimentally present extremely fast crystallization speeds within 360&#160;ps. Remarkably, the recrystallization process is further sped up as the device shrinks, and a record&#8208;fast crystallization speed of only 242&#160;ps is achieved in 60&#160;nm&#8208;size devices. These findings open opportunities for dynamic random&#8208;access memory (DRAM)&#8208;like and even cache&#8208;like PCM using appropriate storage materials.

         <title>Reviving Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis of Bulk La&#8211;Ni Intermetallics via Gaseous Hydrogen Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen processing strategy is utilized to optimize the microstructure of bulk LaNi5 to activate its alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER)&#160;performance. Furthermore, the phase evolution, as well as the role of La during the OER process, is unequivocally decoupled. Hydrogen storage, hydrogen production, and hydrogen application are integrated toward the development of the hydrogen economy.








Abstract
A hydrogen processing strategy is developed to enable bulk LaNi5 to attain high activity and long&#8208;term stability toward the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By a combination of in situ Raman and quasi in situ X&#8208;ray absorption (XAS) spectra, secondary&#8208;electron&#8208;excited scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) patterns as well as the Rietveld method and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is discovered that hydrogen&#8208;induced lattice distortion, grain refinement, and particle cracks dictate the effective reconstruction of the LaNi5 surface into a porous hetero&#8208;nanoarchitecture composed of uniformly confined active &#947;&#8208;NiOOH nanocrystals by La(OH)3 layer in the alkaline OER process. This significantly optimizes the charge transfer, structural integrity, active&#8208;site exposure, and adsorption energy toward the reaction intermediates. Benefiting from these merits, the overpotential (322&#160;mV) at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for the hydrogen&#8208;processed OER catalyst deposited on nickel foam is reduced by 104&#160;mV as compared to the original phase. Notably, it exhibits remarkable stability for 10 days at an industrial&#8208;grade current density of more than 560&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline media.

         <title>Efficient, Color&#8208;Stable, and Long&#8208;Lived White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Utilizing Phosphorescent Molecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Development of single&#8208;stack hybrid white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (WOLEDs) uses amber&#8208;colored aggregate emission and blue fluorescence emission to achieve high efficiencies, long operational lifetimes, and excellent color stabilities under various driving conditions. As far as it is known, this is the most stable single&#8208;stack white OLED device among all reported white OLEDs on the public domain.








Abstract
Highly efficient and stable single&#8208;stack hybrid white organic light&#8208;emitting diode (WOLED) devices are developed using two emissive layers: one with amber&#8208;colored phosphorescent molecular&#8208;aggregate emission from the Pd(II) complex, Pd(II) 7&#8208;(3&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;&#954;N)phenoxy&#8208;&#954;C)(benzo&#8208;&#954;C)([c]benzo[4,5]imidazo&#8208;&#954;N)[1,2&#8208;a][1,5]naphthyridine, Pd3O8&#8208;Py5, and the other with blue fluorescence emission. An optimized device structure achieves high color stability under various current densities, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 45.5%, a power efficiency of 97.4 Lm W&#8722;1, and an estimated LT95 (operational time to 95% of the initial luminance) of 50 744 h at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

&lt;p&gt;Development of single-stack hybrid white organic light-emitting diodes (WOLEDs) uses amber-colored aggregate emission and blue fluorescence emission to achieve high efficiencies, long operational lifetimes, and excellent color stabilities under various driving conditions. As far as it is known, this is the most stable single-stack white OLED device among all reported white OLEDs on the public domain.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly efficient and stable single-stack hybrid white organic light-emitting diode (WOLED) devices are developed using two emissive layers: one with amber-colored phosphorescent molecular-aggregate emission from the Pd(II) complex, Pd(II) 7-(3-(pyridine-2-yl-&#954;N)phenoxy-&#954;C)(benzo-&#954;C)([&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;]benzo[4,5]imidazo-&#954;N)[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;][1,5]naphthyridine, Pd3O8-Py5, and the other with blue fluorescence emission. An optimized device structure achieves high color stability under various current densities, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 45.5%, a power efficiency of 97.4 Lm W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and an estimated LT&lt;sub&gt;95&lt;/sub&gt; (operational time to 95% of the initial luminance) of 50 744 h at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mitochondrial&#8208;Targeted Delivery of Polyphenol&#8208;Mediated Antioxidases Complexes against Pyroptosis and Inflammatory Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyphenols such as tannic acid (TA) are able to mediate the targeting of polyphenol/antioxidases complexes to mitochondria, stemming from the strong binding of TA to mitochondrial outer membrane proteins. Superoxide dismutase, catalase, and TA are assembled into complexes for efficiently scavenging excess mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and reversing mitochondrial depolarization, thereby inhibiting inflammasome&#8208;mediated pyroptosis and alleviate pyroptosis&#8208;related hepatitis.








Abstract
Excess accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) is a key target for inhibiting pyroptosis&#8208;induced inflammation and tissue damage. However, targeted delivery of drugs to mitochondria and efficient clearance of mtROS remain challenging. In current study, it is discovered that polyphenols such as tannic acid (TA) can mediate the targeting of polyphenol/antioxidases complexes to mitochondria. This affinity does not depend on mitochondrial membrane potential but stems from the strong binding of TA to mitochondrial outer membrane proteins. Taking advantage of the feasibility of self&#8208;assembly between TA and proteins, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and TA are assembled into complexes (referred to as TSC) for efficient enzymatic activity maintenance. In vitro fluorescence confocal imaging shows that TSC not only promoted the uptake of biological enzymes in hepatocytes but also highly overlapped with mitochondria after lysosomal escape. The results from an in vitro model of hepatocyte oxidative stress demonstrate that TSC efficiently scavenges excess mtROS and reverses mitochondrial depolarization, thereby inhibiting inflammasome&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. More interestingly, TSC maintain superior efficacy compared with the clinical gold standard drug N&#8208;acetylcysteine in both acetaminophen&#8208; and D&#8208;galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide&#8208;induced pyroptosis&#8208;related hepatitis mouse models. In conclusion, this study opens a new paradigm for targeting mitochondrial oxidative stress to inhibit pyroptosis and treat inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordination Trimetallic PtFeCo Nanosaws for Practical Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing highly efficient electrocatalysts with well&#8208;controlled nanostructure is significant for realizing the practical applications of fuel cells. In&#160;this&#160;work,&#160;a&#160;novel trimetallic platinum&#8211;iron&#8211;cobalt Pt3FeCo nanosaw with abundant defects and high&#8208;index edges&#160;is&#160;synthesized, reaching superior oxygen reduction reaction kinetics and fuel cell performances than commercial Pt/C. This work offers great inspiration for developing Pt&#8208;based multimetallic nanocatalysts in the future.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance catalysts for fuel cell catalysis is the most critical and challenging step for the commercialization of fuel cell technology. Here 1D&#160;trimetallic platinum&#8211;iron&#8211;cobalt nanosaws (Pt3FeCo NSs) with low&#8208;coordination features are designed as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for practical fuel cell catalysis. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Pt3FeCo NSs (10.62&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 4.66 A mg&#8722;1Pt at 0.90&#160;V) is more than 25&#8208;folds higher than that of the commercial Pt/C, even after 30&#160;000 voltage cycles. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the strong inter&#8208;d&#8208;orbital electron transfer minimizes the ORR barrier with higher selectivity at robust valence states. The volcano correlation between the intrinsic structure featured with low&#8208;coordination Pt&#8208;sites and corresponding electronic activities is discovered, which guarantees high ORR activities. The Pt3FeCo NSs located in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) also achieve very high peak power density (1800.6&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and competitive specific/mass activities (1.79&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.79 A mg&#8722;1Pt at 0.90 ViR&#8208;free cell voltage) as well as a long&#8208;term lifetime in specific H2&#63743;O2 medium for proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells, ranking top electrocatalysts reported to date for MEA. This work represents a class of multimetallic Pt&#8208;based nanocatalysts for practical fuel cells and beyond.

         <title>Piezoelectric Actuation Mechanism Involving Extrinsic Nanodomain Dynamics in Lead&#8208;Free Piezoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The piezoelectric actuation mechanism in pseudocubic structures is clarified by the calculation of extrinsic/intrinsic contribution. Although only intrinsic contributes to the piezoelectricity, it does not match the piezoelectricity of BiFeO3&#8211;BaTiO3. It is clarified that extrinsic effect on nanodomain rearrangements is revealed in BiFeO3&#8211;BaTiO3. Extrinsic effect on nanodomain rearrangement is involved in the actuation mechanism of piezoelectricity.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials play a key role in applications, while there are physically open questions. The physical origin of piezoelectricity is understood as the sum of contributions from intrinsic effects on lattice dynamics and those from extrinsic effects on ferroic&#8208;domain dynamics, but there is an incomplete understanding that all but intrinsic effects are classified as extrinsic effects. Therefore, the accurate classification of extrinsic effects is important for understanding&#160;the physical origin of piezoelectricity. In this work, high&#8208;energy synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray diffraction is utilized to measure the response of BiFeO3&#8722;BaTiO3 piezoelectrics and the intrinsic/extrinsic contribution to electric fields. It is found from crystal structure and intrinsic/extrinsic contribution, using the analysis involving structure refinement with various structural model and micromechanics&#8208;based calculations, that Bi3+&#8208;ion disordering is important for realization of piezoelectricity and nanodomains. Here, an extrinsic effect on the rearrangement of nanodomains is suggested. The nanodomains, which are formed by the locally distorted structure around the A&#8208;site by Bi&#8208;ion disordering, can significantly deform the material in the BiFeO3&#8722;BaTiO3 system, which contributes to the piezoelectric actuation mechanism apart from the extrinsic effect on ferroic&#8208;domain dynamics. Bi&#8208;ion disordering plays an important role in realizing piezoelectricity and nanodomains and can provide essential material design clues to develop next&#8208;generation Bi&#8208;based lead&#8208;free piezoelectric ceramics.

         <title>Biohybrid 3D Printing of a Tissue&#8208;Sensor Platform for Wireless, Real&#8208;Time, and Continuous Monitoring of Drug&#8208;Induced Cardiotoxicity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biohybrid 3D printing method is introduced for the fabrication of tissue&#8208;sensor platforms. The integration of electronics with living cardiac tissues enables continuous monitoring of their contractile force and, ultimately, the drug&#8208;induced cardiotoxicity effects on cardiac tissues. It is expected that this method&#160;has the potential to become the next&#8208;generation technology in the field of tissue engineering for drug development.








Abstract
Drug&#8208;induced cardiotoxicity is regarded as a major hurdle in the early stages of drug development. Although there are various methods for preclinical cardiotoxicity tests, they cannot completely predict the cardiotoxic potential of a compound due to the lack of physiological relevance. Recently, 3D engineered heart tissue (EHT) has been used to investigate cardiac muscle functions as well as pharmacological effects by exhibiting physiological auxotonic contractions. However, there is still no adequate platform for continuous monitoring to test acute and chronic pharmacological effects in vitro. Here, a biohybrid 3D printing method for fabricating a tissue&#8208;sensor platform, composed of a bipillar&#8208;grafted strain gauge sensor and EHT, is first introduced. Two pillars are three&#8208;dimensionally printed as grafts onto a strain gauge&#8208;embedded substrate to promote the EHT contractility and guide the self&#8208;assembly of the EHTs along with the strain gauge. In addition, the integration of a wireless multi&#8208;channel electronic system allows for continuous monitoring of the EHT contractile force by the tissue&#8208;sensor platform and, ultimately, for the observation of the acute and chronic drug effects of cardiotoxicants.

     alt="Biohybrid 3D Printing of a Tissue-Sensor Platform for Wireless, Real-Time, and Continuous Monitoring of Drug-Induced Cardiotoxicity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A biohybrid 3D printing method is introduced for the fabrication of tissue-sensor platforms. The integration of electronics with living cardiac tissues enables continuous monitoring of their contractile force and, ultimately, the drug-induced cardiotoxicity effects on cardiac tissues. It is expected that this method&#160;has the potential to become the next-generation technology in the field of tissue engineering for drug development.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug-induced cardiotoxicity is regarded as a major hurdle in the early stages of drug development. Although there are various methods for preclinical cardiotoxicity tests, they cannot completely predict the cardiotoxic potential of a compound due to the lack of physiological relevance. Recently, 3D engineered heart tissue (EHT) has been used to investigate cardiac muscle functions as well as pharmacological effects by exhibiting physiological auxotonic contractions. However, there is still no adequate platform for continuous monitoring to test acute and chronic pharmacological effects in vitro. Here, a biohybrid 3D printing method for fabricating a tissue-sensor platform, composed of a bipillar-grafted strain gauge sensor and EHT, is first introduced. Two pillars are three-dimensionally printed as grafts onto a strain gauge-embedded substrate to promote the EHT contractility and guide the self-assembly of the EHTs along with the strain gauge. In addition, the integration of a wireless multi-channel electronic system allows for continuous monitoring of the EHT contractile force by the tissue-sensor platform and, ultimately, for the observation of the acute and chronic drug effects of cardiotoxicants. In summary, biohybrid 3D printing technology is expected to be a potential fabrication method to provide a next-generation tissue-sensor platform for an effective drug development process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Defect&#8208;Engineering&#8208;Stabilized AgSbTe2 with High Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
p&#8208;Type AgSbTe2 materials stabilized with S and Se co&#8208;doping are demonstrated to exhibit an outstanding thermoelectric (TE) figure of merit zTmax of 2.3 and a unicouple device reaching energy conversion efficiencies up to 12.3% at a temperature difference of 370 K. This exceptional performance arises from an enhanced carrier density resulting from a higher concentration of silver vacancies, a vastly improved Seebeck coefficient enabled by the flattening of the valence band maximum and the inhibited formation of n&#8208;type Ag2Te.








Abstract
Thermoelectric (TE) generators enable the direct and reversible conversion between heat and electricity, providing applications in both refrigeration and power generation. In the last decade, several TE materials with relatively high figures of merit (zT) have been reported in the low&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature regimes. However, there is an urgent demand for high&#8208;performance TE materials working in the mid&#8208;temperature range (400&#8211;700 K). Herein, p&#8208;type AgSbTe2 materials stabilized with S and Se co&#8208;doping are demonstrated to exhibit an outstanding maximum figure of merit (zTmax) of 2.3 at 673 K and an average figure of merit (zTave) of 1.59 over the wide temperature range of 300&#8211;673 K. This exceptional performance arises from an enhanced carrier density resulting from a higher concentration of silver vacancies, a vastly improved Seebeck coefficient enabled by the flattening of the valence band maximum&#160;and the inhibited formation of n&#8208;type Ag2Te, and ahighly improved stability beyond 673 K. The optimized material is used to fabricate a single&#8208;leg device with efficiencies up to 13.3% and a unicouple TE device reaching energy conversion efficiencies up to 12.3% at a temperature difference of 370 K. These results highlight an effective strategy to engineer high&#8208;performance TE material in the mid&#8208;temperature range.

         <title>Direct CO2 Capture by Alkali&#8208;Dissolved Cellulose and Sequestration in Building Materials and Artificial Reef Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali cellulose solutions are used as CO2 absorption media to lead mineralized cellulose materials at a tailorable cellulose&#8208;to&#8208;mineral ratio. Cellulose lean gels are converted into dry powders, shown as a functional component of ceramic glazes and cementitious composites; meanwhile, cellulose&#8208;rich gels are moldable and extrudable, yielding stone&#8208;like structures tested as artificial substrates for coral reef restoration.








Abstract
Current carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies require high energy input and costly catalysts. Here, an effective pathway is offered that addresses climate action by atmospheric CO2 sequestration. Industrially relevant highly reactive alkali cellulose solutions are used as CO2 absorption media. The latter lead to mineralized cellulose materials (MCM) at a tailorable cellulose&#8208;to&#8208;mineral ratio, forming organic&#8208;inorganic viscous systems (viscosity from 102 to 107&#160;mPa&#160;s and storage modulus from 10 to 105&#160;Pa). CO2 absorption and conversion into calcium carbonate and associated minerals translate to maximum absorption of 6.5&#160;gCO2 gcellulose&#8722;1, tracking inversely with cellulose loading. Cellulose lean gels are easily converted into dry powders, shown as a functional component of ceramic glazes and cementitious composites. Meanwhile, cellulose&#8208;rich gels are moldable and extrudable, yielding stone&#8208;like structures tested as artificial substrates for coral reef restoration. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) suggests new CCU opportunities for building materials, as demonstrated in underwater deployment for coral reef ecosystem restoration.

         <title>Regulating Surface Oxygen Activity by Perovskite&#8208;Coating&#8208;Stabilized Ultrahigh&#8208;Nickel Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly active anionic redox in the ultrahigh&#8208;Ni layered oxide cathode is directly regulated by leveraging the stable oxygen vacancies/interstitials in a lithium and oxygen dual&#8208;ion conductor perovskite coating layer, which facilitates surface lithium&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics and electronic conductivity at the same time. This work provides an effective strategy for capacity versus stability juggling of the high&#8208;energy cathodes.








Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni layered oxides are proposed as promising cathodes to fulfill the range demand of electric vehicles; yet, they are still haunted by compromised cyclability and thermal robustness. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art surface coating has been applied to solve the instability via blocking the physical contact between the electrolyte and the highly active Ni4+ ions on the cathode surface, but it falls short in handling the chemo&#8211;physical mobility of the oxidized lattice oxygen ions in the cathode. Herein, a direct regulation strategy is proposed to accommodate the highly active anionic redox within the solid phase. By leveraging the stable oxygen vacancies/interstitials in a lithium and oxygen dual&#8208;ion conductor (layered perovskite La4NiLiO8) coating layer, the reactivity of the surface lattice oxygen ion is dramatically restrained. As a result, the oxygen release from the lattice is suppressed, as well as the undesired irreversible phase transition and intergranular mechanical cracking. Meanwhile, the introduced dual&#8208;ion conductor can also facilitate lithium&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics and electronic conductivity on the particle surface. This work demonstrates that accommodating the anionic redox chemistry by dual&#8208;ion conductors is an effective strategy for capacity versus stability juggling of the high&#8208;energy cathodes.

         <title>A Multifunctional Interphase Layer Enabling Superior Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries under Ambient Temperature and &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional interphase consisting of disodium selenide and metal vanadium is developed for the Na anode via an in situ spontaneous chemical reaction. It possesses high sodiophilicity, strong mechanical strength, excellent ionic conductivity, and fast desolvation of solvated Na+, which can boost Na&#8208;ion adsorption and transport, realizing homogenous Na deposition without dendrites under ambient temperature and &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The sodium (Na)&#8208;metal anode with high theoretical capacity and low cost is promising for construction of&#160;high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries. However, the unsatisfactory interface between Na and the liquid electrolyte induces tardy ion transfer kinetics and dendritic Na growth, especially at ultralow temperature (&#8722;40&#160;&#176;C). Herein, an artificial heterogeneous interphase consisting of disodium selenide (Na2Se) and metal vanadium (V) is produced on the surface of Na (Na@Na2Se/V) via an in situ spontaneous chemical reaction. Such interphase layer possesses high sodiophilicity, excellent ionic conductivity, and high Young's modulus, which can promote Na&#8208;ion adsorption and transport, realizing homogenous Na deposition without dendrites. The symmetric Na@Na2Se/V cell exhibits outstanding cycling life span of over 1790&#160;h (0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2) in carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte. More remarkably, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the artificial Na2Se/V hybrid interphase can accelerate the desolvation of solvated Na+ at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. The Na@Na2Se/V electrode thus exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance in symmetric cell (over 1500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2) and full cell (over 700 cycles at 0.5 C) at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. This work provides an avenue to design artificial heterogeneous interphase layers for superior high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries at ambient and ultralow temperatures.

It possesses high sodiophilicity, strong mechanical strength, excellent ionic conductivity, and fast desolvation of solvated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which can boost Na-ion adsorption and transport, realizing homogenous Na deposition without dendrites under ambient temperature and &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sodium (Na)-metal anode with high theoretical capacity and low cost is promising for construction of&#160;high-energy-density metal batteries. However, the unsatisfactory interface between Na and the liquid electrolyte induces tardy ion transfer kinetics and dendritic Na growth, especially at ultralow temperature (&#8722;40&#160;&#176;C). Herein, an artificial heterogeneous interphase consisting of disodium selenide (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se) and metal vanadium (V) is produced on the surface of Na (Na@Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se/V) via an in situ spontaneous chemical reaction. Such interphase layer possesses high sodiophilicity, excellent ionic conductivity, and high Young's modulus, which can promote Na-ion adsorption and transport, realizing homogenous Na deposition without dendrites. The symmetric Na@Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se/V cell exhibits outstanding cycling life span of over 1790&#160;h (0.5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;/1 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in carbonate-based electrolyte. More remarkably, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the artificial Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se/V hybrid interphase can accelerate the desolvation of solvated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. The Na@Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se/V electrode thus exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance in symmetric cell (over 1500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;/0.5 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and full cell (over 700 cycles at 0.5 C) at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. This work provides an avenue to design artificial heterogeneous interphase layers for superior high-energy-density metal batteries at ambient and ultralow temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Humidity&#8208;Insensitive, Large&#8208;Area&#8208;Applicable, Hot&#8208;Air&#8208;Assisted Ambient Fabrication of 2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A hot&#8208;air&#8208;assisted ambient fabrication technique is introduced to prepare 2D layered perovskite films for efficient and stable solar cells. This method is material&#8208;saving, humidity&#8208;insensitive, large&#8208;area&#8208;applicable, and adaptable for different 2D perovskites. High&#8208;quality 2D perovskite films are obtained with good crystallinity, preferable orientation, and desirable morphology.








Abstract
2D layered perovskites (LPs) have shown great potential to deliver high&#8208;performance photovoltaic devices with long&#8208;term stability. Despite many signs of progress being made in film quality and device performance, LP films are mainly processed in strict conditions and through non&#8208;scalable techniques. Here, the hot&#8208;air&#8208;assisted ambient fabrication technique is introduced to prepare LP films for efficient and stable solar cells. The high&#8208;quality LP films with good crystallinity, preferable orientation and desirable morphology are obtained by balancing the crystal nucleation and growth processes. Employing the synchrotron&#8208;based in situ grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction technique, hot air induces the solidification of solutes and forms an intermediate at the air&#8211;liquid interface, which transforms into 3D&#8208;like perovskite, followed by the growth of the 2D species toward the substrate. The optimal LP film delivers a device power conversion efficiency of 16.36%, the best value for the LP&#8208;based solar cells prepared by the non&#8208;spin&#8208;coating techniques. The solar cell performance is insensitive to the film processing humidity and the device size is upscalable, which promises real&#8208;world deployment of LP&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

         <title>An Integrated Solar Panel with a Triboelectric Nanogenerator Array for Synergistic Harvesting of Raindrop&#160;and Solar Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A constructed integrated generator with a raindrop triboelectric nanogenerator (R&#8208;TENG) array and a solar panel can realize all&#8208;weather, complementary energy harvesting of raindrop and solar energy, and sustainable energy supply for the widely distributed sensors, which can promote the self&#8208;powered wireless environmental monitoring and the development of remote meteorological monitoring or smart farming, etc.








Abstract
The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is regarded as an effective strategy for harvesting energy from raindrops, and is a complementary solution with solar cells to achieve all&#8208;weather energy harvesting and sustainable energy supply. However, due to the irregularity of natural rainfalls in the volume, frequency, density, and location, designing high&#8208;efficiency raindrop TENG (R&#8208;TENG) arrays faces great challenges. In this work, a highly transparent, large&#8208;area, and high&#8208;efficiency R&#8208;TENG array with rational material choice, electrode structure, and array distribution is developed for efficiently harvesting irregular raindrop energy. The problem of electrical signal cancellation among adjacent raindrops can be fully avoided, as viewed from the high&#8208;resolution space&#8211;time analyses of high&#8208;speed camera and electrical signal characteristics. With the rationally designed electrode instead of multiple complex electrodes, all charges can be exported by the R&#8208;TENG array in a simulated irregular raindrop scenario. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the R&#8208;TENG possesses higher average power density (40.80&#160;mW m&#8722;2) than that of the solar cell (37.03&#160;mW m&#8722;2) in rainy condition. Additionally, a self&#8208;powered wireless light&#8208;intensity&#8208;monitoring system is demonstrated for real&#8208;time and all&#8208;day weather monitoring. This work provides useful guidance for designing high&#8208;efficiency TENG arrays integrated with solar panels for harvesting irregular raindrop energy and solar energy.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Near&#8208;Infrared Responsive J&#8208;Aggregates of Fused Quinoidal Tetracyanoindacenodithiophene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of J&#8208;aggregates based on quinoidal indacenodithiophenes are reported with an ultra&#8208;narrow bandwidth (full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum, FWHM&#160;=&#160;22&#160;nm) absoprtion peak located at 770&#160;nm. A combination of excited&#8208;state lifetime measurements and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements are employed to probe their J&#8208;aggregate behavior. NIR phototransistors exhibit consistent photoresponse throughout the illumination intensity range at selective wavelength.








Abstract
Narrowband photoresponsive molecules are highly coveted in high&#8208;resolution imaging, sensing, and monochromatic photodetection, especially those extending into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral range. Here, a new class of J&#8208;aggregating materials based on quinoidal indacenodithiophenes (IDTs) that exhibit an ultra&#8208;narrowband (full width half maxima of 22&#160;nm) NIR absorption peak centered at 770&#160;nm is reported. The spectral width is readily tuned by the length of the solubilizing alkyl group, with longer chains resulting in significant spectral narrowing. The J&#8208;aggregate behavior is confirmed by a combination of excited state lifetime measurements and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements. Their utility as electron&#8208;transporting materials is demonstrated in both transistor and phototransistor devices, with the latter demonstrating good response at NIR wavelengths (780&#160;nm) over a range of intensities.

         <title>Reprocessable and Chemically Recyclable Hard Vitrimers Based on Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Epoxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;crystalline epoxy vitrimers (LCEVs) are synthesized using imine and ester moieties as dynamic covalent bonds. The cured products are reprocessed by imine metathesis and transesterification. Moreover, the imine group is chemically decomposed and resin recycling is achieved via recombination. Repeated reprocessing and recycling are realized, and the products exhibit excellent thermal and mechanical properties owing to their LC nature.








Abstract
The rapid increase in demand for recyclable and reusable thermosets has necessitated the development of materials with chemical structures that exhibit these features. Thus, functional mesogenic epoxide monomers bearing both ester and imine groups that can be vitrimerized and recycled are reported herein. The compounds show mesophase characteristics at 100&#8211;200&#160;&#176;C and can be converted into hard epoxides by a common curing reaction. The obtained hard epoxides have high isotropic thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.64 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), which is derived from their highly ordered microstructures. The cured products can be easily reprocessed through imine metathesis and transesterification, and decomposed products can be obtained through imine hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions and subsequently be re&#8208;cured. Surprisingly, recycled materials can be repeatedly reprocessed or chemically decomposed. The reprocessed materials retain the properties of their pristine counterparts, and the recycled products preserve the advantages of the hard thermosets without alteration to any of their unique properties. A dehydration reaction occurs between the residual hydroxyl groups during the re&#8208;hardening, which dramatically increases the glass transition temperature by &#8776;60&#160;&#176;C. These reprocessable and recyclable vitrimers demonstrate the effectiveness and environmental friendliness of the molecular design strategy reported herein.

The cured products can be easily reprocessed through imine metathesis and transesterification, and decomposed products can be obtained through imine hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions and subsequently be re-cured. Surprisingly, recycled materials can be repeatedly reprocessed or chemically decomposed. The reprocessed materials retain the properties of their pristine counterparts, and the recycled products preserve the advantages of the hard thermosets without alteration to any of their unique properties. A dehydration reaction occurs between the residual hydroxyl groups during the re-hardening, which dramatically increases the glass transition temperature by &#8776;60&#160;&#176;C. These reprocessable and recyclable vitrimers demonstrate the effectiveness and environmental friendliness of the molecular design strategy reported herein.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Microenvironmentally Responsive Chemotherapeutic Prodrugs and CHEK2 Inhibitors Self&#8208;Assembled Micelles: Protecting Fertility and Enhancing Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A co&#8208;delivery micelle (BML@PMP) that consists of a reduction&#8208;sensitive paclitaxel prodrug (PMP) for chemotherapy and a CHEK2 inhibitor (BML277) is developed for both fertility protection and chemotherapy enhancement. The BML@PMP micelles enhance the antitumor effect by delivering a high dose of paclitaxel to the tumor and inhibiting DNA damage repair, and prevent fertility damage by inhibiting the CHEK2&#8208;TAp63&#945; pathway in the ovary.








Abstract
Chemotherapy is a widely used and effective adjuvant treatment for cancer, and it has unavoidable damage to female fertility, with statistics showing 38% of women who have received chemotherapy are infertile. How to reduce fertility toxicity while enhancing the oncologic chemotherapy is a clinical challenge. Herein, co&#8208;delivery micelles (BML@PMP) are developed, which are composed of a reduction&#8208;sensitive paclitaxel prodrug (PMP) for chemotherapy and a CHEK2 inhibitor (BML277) for both fertility protection and chemotherapy enhancement. BML@PMP achieves fertility protection through three actions: (1) Due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, BML@PMP is more enriched in the tumor, while very little in the ovary (about 1/10th of the tumor). (2) Glutathione (GSH) triggers the release of PTX, and with low levels of GSH in the ovary, the amount of PTX released in the ovary is correspondingly reduced. (3) BML277 inhibits oocyte apoptosis by inhibiting the CHEK2&#8208;TAp63&#945; pathway. Because of the different downstream targets of CHEK2 in tumor cells and oocytes, BML277 also enhances chemotherapeutic efficacy by reducing DNA damage repair which is activated through the CHEK2 pathway. This bidirectional effect of CHEK2 inhibitor&#8208;based co&#8208;delivery system represents a promising strategy for improving oncology treatment indices and preventing chemotherapy&#8208;associated fertility damage.

         <title>Stretchable Electrodes Based on Over&#8208;Layered Liquid Metal Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabrication of thin films with liquid metal is proposed using thermal evaporation. The oxide film on the liquid metal surface forms a unique structure as indium/oxide/gallium (InOG). The oxide film helps form conductivity and exhibits negative piezoresistivity by rupturing. InOG electrode exhibits controllable electrical properties and mechanical stability. InOG overcomes the limitations of conventional applications through unique properties.








Abstract
Liquid metals are attractive materials for stretchable electronics owing to their high electrical conductivity and near&#8208;zero Young's modulus. However, the high surface tension of liquid metals makes it difficult to form films. A novel stretchable film is proposed based on an over&#8208;layered liquid&#8208;metal network. An intentionally oxidized interfacial layer helps to construct uninterrupted indium and gallium nanoclusters and produces additional electrical pathways between the two metal networks under mechanical deformation. The films exhibit gigantic negative piezoresistivity (G&#8208;NPR), which decreased the resistance up to 85% during the first 50% stretching. This G&#8208;NPR property is due to the rupture of the metal oxides, which allows the formation of liquid eutectic gallium&#8208;indium (EGaIn) and the connection of the over&#8208;layered networks to build new electrical paths. The electrodes exhibiting G&#8208;NPR are complementarily combined with conventional electrodes to amplify their performance or achieve some unique operations.

         <title>Attenuating Metabolic Competition of Tumor Cells for Favoring the Nutritional Demand of Immune Cells by a Branched Polymeric Drug Delivery System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A branched polymeric drug delivery system can be used as a previously unknown metabolic modulator to improve the tumor immune microenvironment via interfering with the metabolic processes of tumor cells to increase the concentration of essential nutrients and reduce the level of immunosuppressive metabolites in the tumor microenvironment, thus creating a favorable environment for infiltrated immune cells.








Abstract
Tumor cells are dominant in the nutritional competition in the tumor microenvironment, and their metabolic abnormalities often lead to microenvironmental acidosis and nutrient deprivation, thereby impairing the function of immune cells and diminishing the antitumor therapeutic effect. Herein, a branched polymeric conjugate and its efficacy in attenuating the metabolic competition of tumor cells are reported. Compared with the control nanoparticles prepared from its linear counterpart, the branched&#8208;conjugate&#8208;based nanoparticles can more efficiently accumulate in the tumor tissue and interfere with the metabolic processes of tumor cells to increase the concentration of essential nutrients and reduce the level of immunosuppressive metabolites in the TME, thus creating a favorable environment for infiltrated immune cells. Its combined treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) achieves an enhanced antitumor effect. The work presents a promising approach for targeting metabolic competition in the TME to enhance the chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic effect against cancers.

         <dc:description>
A new nanoflake 2D material MXene is designed for a neural network nonlinear broadband activator on a chip and realized using waveguide spectroscopy. The proposed configurations are reconfigurable and can therefore be adjusted for various applications without the need to modify the physical structure of the proposed MXene&#8208;based activator configurations via tuning the wavelength of operation.








Abstract
2D metal carbides and nitrides (MXene) are promising material platforms for on&#8208;chip neural networks owing to their nonlinear saturable absorption effect. The localized surface plasmon resonances in metallic MXene nanoflakes may play an important role in enhancing the electromagnetic absorption; however, their contribution is not determined due to the lack of a precise understanding of its localized surface plasmon behavior. Here, a saturable absorber made of MXene thin film and a silicon waveguide with MXene flakes overlayer are developed to perform neuromorphic tasks. The proposed configurations are reconfigurable and can therefore be adjusted for various applications without the need to modify the physical structure of the proposed MXene&#8208;based activator configurations via tuning the wavelength of operation. The capability and feasibility of the obtained results of machine&#8208;learning applications are confirmed via handwritten digit classification task, with near 99% accuracy. These findings can guide the design of advanced ultrathin saturable absorption materials on a chip for a broad range of applications.

         <title>Trojan Horse Nanocapsule Enabled In Situ Modulation of the Phenotypic Conversion of Th17 Cells to Treg Cells for the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis in Mice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocapsule (nC)&#8208;coupled Th17 cells transmigrates across the blood&#8211;brain barrier and homes to the inflamed MS niche in a &#8220;Trojan Horse&#8221;&#8208;like manner. Upon ROS stimulation, (Aminooxy)&#8208;acetic acid is released from the nC, and subsequently enables in situ transformation of Th17 into Treg cells. This phenotypic conversion leads to a domino&#8208;like immune response that is conducive to MS therapy.








Abstract
Th17/Treg imbalance is closely related to the occurrence and development of multiple sclerosis (MS), and the transdifferentiation of Th17 cells into Treg cells may contribute to the resolution of inflammation, presenting a therapeutic strategy for MS. To modulate this phenotypic shift in situ, a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221;&#8208;like hybrid system, nanocapsule&#8208;coupled Th17 cells, is reported for MS treatment. Following intravenous injection into MS mice, the hybrid system efficiently transmigrates across the blood&#8211;brain barrier and homes to the inflamed MS niche. (Aminooxy)&#8208;acetic acid, a transdifferentiation inducer, is locally released upon the production of ROS and in turn taken up by Th17 cells. It is demonstrated that the Trojan horse hybrid system enables in situ phenotypic transdifferentiation of Th17 cells into anti&#8208;inflammatory Treg cells. This phenotypic conversion leads to a domino&#8208;like immune response that is conducive to MS therapy. Overall, this work highlights a new pathway for accurate modulation of the phenotypes of adoptively transferred cells in situ, from proinflammatory to anti&#8208;inflammatory for MS therapy, and may be broadly applicable for patients suffering from other autoimmune diseases.

     alt="Trojan Horse Nanocapsule Enabled In Situ Modulation of the Phenotypic Conversion of Th17 Cells to Treg Cells for the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis in Mice"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanocapsule (nC)-coupled Th17 cells transmigrates across the blood&#8211;brain barrier and homes to the inflamed MS niche in a &#8220;Trojan Horse&#8221;-like manner. Upon ROS stimulation, (Aminooxy)-acetic acid is released from the nC, and subsequently enables in situ transformation of Th17 into Treg cells. This phenotypic conversion leads to a domino-like immune response that is conducive to MS therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Th17/Treg imbalance is closely related to the occurrence and development of multiple sclerosis (MS), and the transdifferentiation of Th17 cells into Treg cells may contribute to the resolution of inflammation, presenting a therapeutic strategy for MS. To modulate this phenotypic shift in situ, a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221;-like hybrid system, nanocapsule-coupled Th17 cells, is reported for MS treatment. Following intravenous injection into MS mice, the hybrid system efficiently transmigrates across the blood&#8211;brain barrier and homes to the inflamed MS niche. (Aminooxy)-acetic acid, a transdifferentiation inducer, is locally released upon the production of ROS and in turn taken up by Th17 cells. It is demonstrated that the Trojan horse hybrid system enables in situ phenotypic transdifferentiation of Th17 cells into anti-inflammatory Treg cells. This phenotypic conversion leads to a domino-like immune response that is conducive to MS therapy. Overall, this work highlights a new pathway for accurate modulation of the phenotypes of adoptively transferred cells in situ, from proinflammatory to anti-inflammatory for MS therapy, and may be broadly applicable for patients suffering from other autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electron Lifetime of Over One Month in Disordered Organic Solid&#8208;State Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultralong charge&#8208;carrier lifetime of more than one month in a disordered film of an organic semiconductor stored at room temperature is demonstrated. The charge carriers stored in the film are stabilized by spontaneous orientation polarization. It is also revealed that the charge carriers retain spatial information due to their slow diffusion in the plane of the organic layer.








Abstract
Understanding intrinsic carrier lifetime in disordered organic solid&#8208;state semiconductors is essential for improving device performance in not only molecule&#8208;based optoelectronic devices such as organic solar cells (OSC) but also photocatalysts used for producing solar fuel cells. Carriers in disordered films are generally thought to have short lifetimes on a scale ranging from nanoseconds to milliseconds. These short carrier lifetimes cause loss of charges in OSCs and low quantum yields in photocatalysts and impede the future application of organic semiconductors to, for example, charge&#8208;storage&#8208;based memory devices. This study reports an ultralong intrinsic carrier lifetime of more than one month in a disordered film of an organic semiconductor stored at room temperature without external power. This extraordinary lifetime, which is several orders of magnitude longer than that generally believed possible in conventional organic semiconductors, arises from carrier stabilization by spontaneous orientation polarization, excited spin&#8208;triplet recycling, and blocking of recombination processes in disordered films.

         <title>Unlocking the Full Potential of Electron&#8208;Acceptor Molecules for Efficient and Stable Hole Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and stable hole injection into organic semiconductors is realized by controlling the charged states of acceptor molecules. The high electron affinity of a neutral acceptor molecule enables direct hole injection even into materials used for a blue&#8208;emitting layer, and highly efficient, pure&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with an extraordinarily low turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.67&#160;V are realized.








Abstract
Understanding the hole&#8208;injection mechanism and improving the hole&#8208;injection property are of pivotal importance in the future development of organic optoelectronic devices. Electron&#8208;acceptor molecules with high electron affinity (EA) are widely used in electronic applications, such as hole injection and p&#8208;doping. Although p&#8208;doping has generally been studied in terms of matching the ionization energy (IE) of organic semiconductors with the EA of acceptor molecules, little is known about the effect of the EA of acceptor molecules on the hole&#8208;injection property. In this work, the hole&#8208;injection mechanism in devices is completely clarified, and a strategy to optimize the hole&#8208;injection property of the acceptor molecule is developed. Efficient and stable hole injection is found to be possible even into materials with IEs as high as 5.8 eV by controlling the charged state of an acceptor molecule with an EA of about 5.0&#160;eV. This excellent hole&#8208;injection property enables direct hole injection into an emitting layer, realizing a pure blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode with an extraordinarily low turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.67&#160;V, a power efficiency of 29&#160;lm W&#8722;1, an external quantum efficiency of 28% and a Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage y coordinate of less than 0.10.

         <title>Tunable Photochromism of Spirooxazine in the Solid State: A New Design Strategy Based on the Hypochromic Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy based on the hypochromic effect is proposed to develop photochromic spirooxazine in the solid state, and tunable solid photochromism for spirooxazine is realized under mild conditions.








Abstract
As an important organic photofunctional material, spirooxazine (SO) usually does not exhibit photochromism in the solid state since the intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking impedes photoisomerization. Developing photochromic SO in the solid state is crucial for practical applications but is still full of challenges. Here, a series of spirooxazine derivatives (SO1&#8211;SO4) with bulky aromatic substituents at the 4&#8208; and 7&#8208;positions of the skeleton, which provide them with a large volume with which to undergo solid&#8208;state photochromism under mild conditions, is designed and synthesized. All the compounds SO1&#8211;SO4 exhibit tunable solid photochromism without ground colors, excellent fatigue resistance, and high thermal stability. Notably, it takes only 15&#160;s for SO4 to reach the saturation of absorption intensity, thought to represent the fastest solid&#8208;state photoresponse of spirooxazines. X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the intermediate compound SO0 and the products SO1&#8211;SO2 as well as computational studies suggest that the bulky aromatic groups can lead to a hypochromic effect, allowing for the photochromism of SO in the solid state. The ideal photochromic properties of these spirooxazines open a new avenue for their applications in UV printing, quick response code, and related fields.

Approaches capable of simultaneously treating cancer and protecting susceptible patients from lethal infections, such as coronavirus disease 2019, are highly desirable but prove to be difficult.

Abstract
Approaches capable of simultaneously treating cancer and protecting susceptible patients from lethal infections such as coronavirus disease 2019, are highly desirable but prove to be difficult. Here, dressing bacteria with a hybrid immunoactive nanosurface is reported to elicit dual anticancer and antiviral immunity. A combination of a checkpoint blocking antibody and a virus&#8208;specific antigen is covalently conjugated to polydopamine nanoparticles, which can be anchored onto bacterial surface, by a one&#8208;step in situ polymerization of dopamine under a cell&#8208;friendly condition. By virtue of the ability to colonize and penetrate deep tumor tissue, dressed bacteria enable sustained release and expanded exposure of carried immunoactivators to stimulate immune cells. In addition to a carrier role, bacteria are able to further provoke innate immunity due to the native immunogenicity of the pathogen&#8208;associated molecular patterns. Immunization with dressed bacteria promotes the maturation, and activation of antigen&#8208;presenting cells, which induces robust humoral and cellular immune responses in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. As evidenced by efficient production of viral&#8208;antigen&#8208;specific immunoglobulin G antibody in serum and significantly suppressed tumor growth in different models, dressing bacteria with a hybrid immunoactive nanosurface paves an avenue to prepare next&#8208;generation therapeutics for synergistic treatment and prevention.

         <title>Printing on Particles: Combining Two&#8208;Photon Nanolithography and Capillary Assembly to Fabricate Multimaterial Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of the capillary assembly of colloidal particles and two&#8208;photon polymerization nanoprinting allows the easy integration of multiple functional materials into complex 1D, 2D, and 3D&#8208;microstructures. This flexible method enables the fabrication of wide range of microscale devices, from thermoresponsive microactuators, to magnetically controlled &#8220;micromachines,&#8221; which can selectively capture and release particles in solution.








Abstract
Additive manufacturing at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale has seen a recent upsurge to suit an increasing demand for more elaborate structures. However, the integration of multiple distinct materials at small scales remains challenging. To this end, capillarity&#8208;assisted particle assembly (CAPA) and two&#8208;photon polymerization direct laser writing (2PP&#8208;DLW) are combined to realize a new class of multimaterial microstructures. 2PP&#8208;DLW and CAPA both are used to fabricate 3D templates to guide the CAPA of soft&#8208; and hard colloids, and to link well&#8208;defined arrangements of functional microparticle arrays produced by CAPA, a process that is termed &#8220;printing on particles.&#8221; The printing process uses automated particle recognition algorithms to connect colloids into 1D, 2D, and 3D tailored structures, via rigid, soft, or responsive polymer links. Once printed and developed, the structures can be easily re&#8208;dispersed in water. Particle clusters and lattices of varying symmetry and composition are reported, together with thermoresponsive microactuators, and magnetically driven &#8220;micromachines&#8221;, which can efficiently move, capture, and release DNA&#8208;coated particles in solution. The flexibility of this method allows the combination of a wide range of functional materials into complex structures, which will boost the realization of new systems and devices for numerous fields, including microrobotics, micromanipulation, and metamaterials.

         <title>Understanding Self&#8208;Assembly of Silica&#8208;Precipitating Peptides to Control Silica Particle Morphology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic silaffin&#8208;based peptides give rise to different template structures depending on stereochemistry and connectivity of the central residue. NMR experiments help to decipher the peptidic template structures. The resulting structure&#8211;activity relationship provides a key to rationally control the assembly of such peptides and thereby the resulting silica material as the peptidic precursor structures determine the materials final architecture.








Abstract
The most advanced materials are those found in nature. These evolutionary optimized substances provide highest efficiencies, e.g., in harvesting solar energy or providing extreme stability, and are intrinsically biocompatible. However, the mimicry of biological materials is limited to a few successful applications since there is still a lack of the tools to recreate natural materials. Herein, such means are provided based on a peptide library derived from the silaffin protein R5 that enables rational biomimetic materials design. It is now evident that biomaterials do not form via mechanisms observed in vitro. Instead, the material's function and morphology are predetermined by precursors that self&#8208;assemble in solution, often from a combination of protein and salts. These assemblies act as templates for biomaterials. The RRIL peptides used here are a small part of the silica&#8208;precipitation machinery in diatoms. By connecting RRIL motifs via varying central bi&#8208; or trifunctional residues, a library of stereoisomers is generated, which allows characterization of different template structures in the presence of phosphate ions by combining residue&#8208;resolved real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Understanding these templates in atomistic detail, the morphology of silica particles is controlled via manipulation of the template precursors.

         <title>Electrical Manipulation of Topological Phases in a Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;gated Cr&#8208;doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 magnetic topological insulator devices are fabricated by combining molecular beam epitaxial growth and&#160;2D transfer methods. The large gate&#8208;tunability using mica as the gate dielectric leads to the observation of the reversible transition between two distinct topological phases, namely the quantum anomalous Hall and the anomalous Hall insulator, via electric field tuning.








Abstract
Quantum anomalous Hall phases arising from the inverted band topology in magnetically doped topological insulators have emerged as an important subject of research for quantization at zero magnetic fields. Though necessary for practical implementation, sophisticated electrical control of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)&#8208;grown quantum anomalous Hall matter have been stymied by growth and fabrication challenges. Here, a novel procedure is demonstrated, employing a combination of thin&#8208;film deposition and 2D&#160;material stacking techniques, to create dual&#8208;gated devices of the MBE&#8208;grown quantum anomalous Hall insulator, Cr&#8208;doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3. In these devices, orthogonal control over the field&#8208;induced charge density and the electric displacement field is demonstrated. A thorough examination of material responses to tuning along each control axis is presented, realizing magnetic property control along the former and a novel capability to manipulate the surface exchange gap along the latter. Through electrically addressing the exchange gap, the capabilities to either strengthen the quantum anomalous Hall state or suppress it entirely and drive a topological phase transition to a trivial state are demonstrated. The experimental result is explained using first principle theoretical calculations, and establishes a practical route for in situ control of quantum anomalous Hall states and topology.

         <title>Actively Triggerable Metals via Liquid Metal Embrittlement for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Actively triggerable metals for biomedical applications combine the advantageous functional properties of metals with precise lifetime control. In this work, a biocompatible liquid metal is formulated into stimuli that can successfully trigger the on&#8208;demand and programmable breakdown of aluminum within different physiologically relevant environments. Additionally, three use cases for actively triggerable metals in biomedical devices are presented.








Abstract
Actively triggerable materials, which break down upon introduction of an exogenous stimulus, enable precise control over the lifetime of biomedical technologies, as well as adaptation to unforeseen circumstances, such as changes to an established treatment plan. Yet, most actively triggerable materials are low&#8208;strength polymers and hydrogels with limited long&#8208;term durability. By contrast, metals possess advantageous functional properties, including high mechanical strength and conductivity, that are desirable across several applications within biomedicine. To realize actively triggerable metals, a mechanism called liquid metal embrittlement is leveraged, in which certain liquid metals penetrate the grain boundaries of certain solid metals and cause them to dramatically weaken or disintegrate. In this work, it is demonstrated that eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn), a biocompatible alloy of gallium, can be formulated to reproducibly trigger the breakdown of aluminum within different physiologically relevant environments. The breakdown behavior of aluminum after triggering can further be readily controlled by manipulating its grain structure. Finally, three possible use cases of biomedical devices constructed from actively triggerable metals are demonstrated.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Hole Coherence and Spatial Self&#8208;Phase Modulation in the Anisotropic 3D Weyl Semimetal TaAs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatial self&#8208;phase modulation (SSPM), a third&#8208;order nonlinear optical response is observed in a Weyl semimetal TaAs. This extends previous SSPM discoveries in 0D, 1D, and 2D materials into 3D materials. Also amazing is that it reveals the long&#8208;sought laser&#8208;induced hole coherence. Furthermore, SSPM in a topological semimetal is reported.








Abstract
Laser&#8208;induced electron coherence is a fascinating topic in manipulating quantum materials. Recently, it has been shown that laser&#8208;induced electron coherence in 2D materials can produce a third&#8208;order nonlinear optical response spatial self&#8208;phase modulation (SSPM), which has been used to develop a novel all&#8208;optical switching scheme. However, such investigations have mainly focused on electron coherence, whereas laser&#8208;induced hole coherence is rarely explored. Here, the observation of the optical Kerr effect in 3D Weyl semimetal TaAs flakes is reported. The nonlinear susceptibility (&#967;(3)) is obtained, which exhibits a surprisingly high value (with &#967;one&#8722;layer(3)\[{\bm{\chi }}_{{\bf one}{\bm{ - }}{\bf layer}}^{{\bf (3)}}\] = 9.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;9 e.s.u. or 1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;16&#160;m2&#160;V&#8722;2 at 532&#160;nm). This cannot be explained by the conventional electron mobility, but can be well understood by the unique high anisotropic hole mobility of TaAs. The wind&#8208;chime model and &#967;(3) carrier mobility correlation adequately explain the results, suggesting the crucial role of laser&#8208;induced nonlocal ac hole coherence. These observations extend the understanding of SSPM from 2D to 3D quantum materials with anisotropic carrier mobility and from electron coherence to hole coherence.

&lt;p&gt;Laser-induced electron coherence is a fascinating topic in manipulating quantum materials. Recently, it has been shown that laser-induced electron coherence in 2D materials can produce a third-order nonlinear optical response spatial self-phase modulation (SSPM), which has been used to develop a novel all-optical switching scheme. However, such investigations have mainly focused on electron coherence, whereas laser-induced hole coherence is rarely explored. Here, the observation of the optical Kerr effect in 3D Weyl semimetal TaAs flakes is reported. The nonlinear susceptibility (&#967;&lt;sup&gt;(3)&lt;/sup&gt;) is obtained, which exhibits a surprisingly high value (with &#967;one&#8722;layer(3)\[{\bm{\chi }}_{{\bf one}{\bm{ - }}{\bf layer}}^{{\bf (3)}}\] = 9.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;9&lt;/sup&gt; e.s.u. or 1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;16&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 532&#160;nm). This cannot be explained by the conventional electron mobility, but can be well understood by the unique high anisotropic hole mobility of TaAs. The wind-chime model and &#967;&lt;sup&gt;(3)&lt;/sup&gt; carrier mobility correlation adequately explain the results, suggesting the crucial role of laser-induced nonlocal ac hole coherence. These observations extend the understanding of SSPM from 2D to 3D quantum materials with anisotropic carrier mobility and from electron coherence to hole coherence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reshaping de Novo Protein Switches into Bioresponsive Materials for Biomarker, Toxin, and Viral Detection</title>

Combining regenerated silk fibroin and de novo protein switches enables the design of a variety of sensing interfaces that have long shelf life and are highly sensitive and specific to numerous analytes such as pathogens, viruses, cancer markers, and toxins.








Abstract
De novo designed protein switches are powerful tools to specifically and sensitively detect diverse targets with simple chemiluminescent readouts. Finding an appropriate material host for de novo designed protein switches without altering their thermodynamics while preserving their intrinsic stability over time would enable the development of a variety of sensing formats to monitor exposure to pathogens, toxins, and for disease diagnosis. Here, a de novo protein&#8208;biopolymer hybrid that maintains the detection capabilities induced by the conformational change of the incorporated proteins&#160;in response to analytes of interest is generated in multiple, shelf&#8208;stable material formats without the need of refrigerated storage conditions. A set of functional demonstrator devices including personal protective equipment such as masks and laboratory gloves, free&#8208;standing films, air quality monitors, and wearable devices is presented to illustrate the versatility of the approach. Such formats are designed to be responsive to human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2), anti&#8208;hepatitis B (HBV) antibodies, Botulinum neurotoxin B (BoNT/B), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2). This combination of form and function offers wide opportunities for ubiquitous sensing in multiple environments by enabling a large class of bio&#8208;responsive interfaces of broad utility.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Responsive STAT3 Inhibitor Nanoprodrug Combined with Oncolytic Virus Elicits Synergistic Antitumor Immune Responses by Igniting Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combination therapy with oHSV&#160;+&#160;MPNPs boosts the effects of immune checkpoint therapy by inducing gasdermin&#8208;E&#8208;based tumor pyroptosis, reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment, and inducing effective immune memory, thus potentiating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 effects against local recurrence and pulmonary metastasis and consequently elongating the survival period. The nanoprodrugs&#160;+&#160;oncolytic viruses strategy represents a promising way to overcome immune checkpoint blockade resistance.








Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy shows excellent efficacy against malignancies; however, insufficient tumor immunogenicity and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) are considered as the two major stumbling blocks to a broad ICB response. Here, a combinational therapeutic strategy is reported, wherein TME&#8208;reactive oxygen species/pH dual&#8208;responsive signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 inhibitor nanoprodrugs MPNPs are combined with oncolytic herpes simplex virus 1 virotherapy to synergistically ignite pyroptosis for enhancing immunotherapy. MPNPs exhibit a certain level of tumor accumulation, reduce tumor cell stemness, and enhance antitumor immune responses. Furthermore, the simultaneous application of oncolytic viruses (OVs) confers MPNPs with higher tumor penetration capacity and remarkable gasdermin&#8208;E&#8208;mediated pyroptosis, thereby reshaping the TME and transforming &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors into &#8220;hot&#8221; ones. This &#8220;fire of immunity&#8221; strategy successfully activates robust T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent antitumor responses, potentiating ICB effects against local recurrence and pulmonary metastasis in preclinical &#8220;cold&#8221; murine triple&#8208;negative breast cancer and syngeneic oral cancer models. Collectively, this work may pave a new way and offer an unprecedented opportunity for the combination of OVs with nanomedicine for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Inter&#8208;Metal Interaction with a Threshold Effect in NiCu Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigating the inter&#8208;metal site distance effect of dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) can not only promote the full potential of DACs, but also guide the design of advanced atomically&#160;dispersed catalysts. In this work a peripherally distributed NiCu DAC is employed as a case study to investigate the distance (d)&#8208;dependent inter&#8208;metal interaction, and a newly&#160;proposed macro&#8208;descriptor is provided as the guidance for future designing DACs.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have become an emerging platform to provide more flexible active sites for electrocatalytic reactions with multi&#8208;electron/proton transfer, such as the CO2&#160;reduction reaction (CRR). However, the introduction of asymmetric dual&#8208;atom sites causes complexity in structure, leaving an incomprehensive understanding of the inter&#8208;metal interaction and catalytic mechanism. Taking NiCu DACs as an example, herein, a more rational structural model is proposed, and the distance&#8208;dependent inter&#8208;metal interaction is investigated by combining theoretical simulations and experiments, including density functional theory computation, aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy, synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure, and Monte Carlo experiments. A distance threshold around 5.3&#160;&#197; between adjacent Ni&#63743;N4&#160;and Cu&#63743;N4&#160;moieties is revealed to trigger effective electronic regulation and boost CRR performance on both selectivity and activity. A universal macro&#8208;descriptor rigorously correlating the inter&#8208;metal distance and intrinsic material features (e.g., metal loading and thickness) is established to guide the rational design and synthesis of advanced DACs. This study highlights the significance of identifying the inter&#8208;metal interaction in DACs, and helps bridge the gap between theoretical study and experimental synthesis of atomically dispersed catalysts with highly correlated active sites.

         <title>Pyridinic Nitrogen Sites Dominated Coordinative Engineering of Subnanometric Pd Clusters for Efficient Alkynes&#8217; Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridinic nitrogen&#8208;site&#8208;dominated coordinative engineering of subnanometric Pd clusters is proposed for efficient alkynes&#8217; semihydrogenation. The obtained catalyst Pd@PPy&#8208;600 exhibits excellent catalytic activity (99%) and selectivity (96%) for phenylacetylene semihydrogenation due to the abundant pyridinic nitrogen sites and interesting electron effects.








Abstract
Supported metal catalysts have played an important role in optimizing selective semihydrogenation of alkynes for fine chemicals. There into, nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons, as a type of promising support materials, have attracted extensive attentions. However, due to the general phenomenon of random doping for nitrogen species in the support, it is still atremendous challenge to finely identify which nitrogen configuration dominates the catalytic property of alkynes&#8217; semihydrogenation. Herein, it is reported that uniform mesoporous N&#8208;doped carbon spheres derived from mesoporous polypyrrole spheres are used as supports to immobilized subnanometric Pd clusters, which provide a particular platform to research the influence of nitrogen configurations on the alkynes&#8217; semihydrogenation. Comprehensive experimental results and density functional theory calculation indicate that pyridinic nitrogen configuration dominates the catalytic behavior of Pd clusters. The high contents of pyridinic nitrogen sites offer abundant coordination sites, which greatly reduces the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining reaction step and makes Pd clusters own high catalytic activity. The electron effect between pyridinic nitrogen sites and Pd clusters makes the reaction highly selective. Additionally, the good mesostructures also promote the fast transport of substrate. Based on the above, catalyst Pd@PPy&#8208;600 exhibits high catalytic activity (99%) and selectivity (96%) for phenylacetylene (C8H6) semihydrogenation.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Enhanced Microwave Attenuation in Titanate Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to create the high&#8208;entropy&#8208;stabilized (Ca0.2Sr0.2Ba0.2La0.2Pb0.2)TiO3&#160;perovskite that exhibits an enhanced effective microwave absorption band (90% absorption) is designed and developed. The favorable microstructural features, including abundant grain boundaries, oxygen defects, and strong shear strain caused by ultradense distorted lattices, can be achieved by regulating the entropy configuration.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs), which incorporate multiple&#8208;principal cations into single&#8208;phase crystals and interact with diverse metal ions, extend the border for available compositions and unprecedented properties. Herein, a high&#8208;entropy&#8208;stabilized (Ca0.2Sr0.2Ba0.2La0.2Pb0.2)TiO3&#160;perovskite is reported, and the effective absorption bandwidth (90% absorption) improves almost two times than that of BaTiO3. The results demonstrate that the regulation of entropy configuration can yield significant grain boundaries, oxygen defects, and an ultradense distorted lattice. These characteristics give rise to strong interfacial and defect&#8208;induced polarizations, thus synergistically contributing to the dielectric attenuation performance. Moreover, the large strains derived from the strong lattice distortions in the high&#8208;entropy perovskite offer varied transport for electron carriers. The high&#8208;entropy&#8208;enhanced positive/negative charges accumulation around grain boundaries and strain&#8208;concentrated location, quantitatively validated by electron holography, results in unusual dielectric polarization loss. This study opens up an effective avenue for designing strong microwave absorption materials to satisfy the increasingly demanding requirements of advanced and integrated electronics. This work also offers a paradigm for improving other interesting properties for HEOs through entropy engineering.

         <title>3D Printing of Self&#8208;Assembling Nanofibrous Multidomain Peptide Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multidomain peptides (MDPs), a class of self&#8208;assembling peptides, are used to 3D print complex, 3D structures. Multiple MDPs are demonstrated as printable, and oppositely charged MDPs are printed together into layered, porous constructs. MDPs are found to support high cell viability regardless of charge, while charge is shown to influence cellular behavior and morphology.








Abstract
3D printing has become one of the primary fabrication strategies used in biomedical research. Recent efforts have focused on the 3D printing of hydrogels to create structures that better replicate the mechanical properties of biological tissues. These pose a unique challenge, as soft materials are difficult to pattern in three dimensions with high fidelity. Currently, a small number of biologically derived polymers that form hydrogels are frequently reused for 3D printing applications. Thus, there exists a need for novel hydrogels with desirable biological properties that can be used as 3D printable inks. In this work, the printability of multidomain peptides (MDPs), a class of self&#8208;assembling peptides that form a nanofibrous hydrogel at low concentrations, is established. MDPs with different charge functionalities are optimized as distinct inks and are used to create complex 3D structures, including multi&#8208;MDP prints. Additionally, printed MDP constructs are used to demonstrate charge&#8208;dependent differences in cellular behavior in vitro. This work presents the first time that self&#8208;assembling peptides have been used to print layered structures with overhangs and internal porosity. Overall, MDPs are a promising new class of 3D printable inks that are uniquely peptide&#8208;based and rely solely on supramolecular mechanisms for assembly.

In article number 2209327, Guillermo Reyes, Orlando J. Rojas, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate carbon capture and utilization (CCU) in industrially relevant and reactive alkali cellulose solutions, which are transformed into hybrid, mineralized materials. They can be molded into supports for coral&#8208;reef restoration and in the production of structures relevant to ceramics and cement composites (Image: scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a sample with ca. 7 nm Au/Pt coating, colored according to energy&#8208;dispersive spectroscopy.

Tissue&#8211;Sensor Platforms
In article number 2208983, Uijung Yong, Donghwan Kim, Hojoong Kim, Woon&#8208;Hong Yeo, Jinah Jang, and co&#8208;workers report a biohybrid 3D&#8208;printing method for the fabrication of tissue&#8211;sensor platforms. The integration of electronics with living cardiac tissues makes it possible to continuously monitor their contractile force and, ultimately, of the drug&#8208;induced cardiotoxicity effects on cardiac tissues. This method can create a next&#8208;generation tissue&#8211;sensor platform for an effective drug development process.

         <title>Impact of Planar and Vertical Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors on Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given their low&#8208;temperature solution processability and mechanical flexibility, organic field&#8208;effect transistors are promising candidates for developing Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things technologies and realizing next&#8208;generation wearable applications. Here, the authors compare the performance of flexible transistors with the emerging vertical&#8208;transistor technology, outline the critical device fabrication and material&#8208;design strategies, and discuss their role and function in a wide range of flexible electronics applications.








Abstract
The development of flexible and conformable devices, whose performance can be maintained while being continuously deformed, provides a significant step toward the realization of next&#8208;generation wearable and e&#8208;textile applications. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) are particularly interesting for flexible and lightweight products, because of their low&#8208;temperature solution processability, and the mechanical flexibility of organic materials that endows OFETs the natural compatibility with plastic and biodegradable substrates. Here, an in&#8208;depth review of two competing flexible OFET technologies, planar and vertical OFETs (POFETs and VOFETs, respectively) is provided. The electrical, mechanical, and physical properties of POFETs and VOFETs are critically discussed, with a focus on four pivotal applications (integrated logic circuits, light&#8208;emitting devices, memories, and sensors). It is pointed out that the flexible function of the relatively newer VOFET technology, along with its perspective on advancing the applicability of flexible POFETs, has not been reviewed so far, and the direct comparison regarding the performance of POFET&#8208; and VOFET&#8208;based flexible applications is most likely absent. With discussions spanning printed and wearable electronics, materials science, biotechnology, and environmental monitoring, this contribution is a clear stimulus to researchers working in these fields to engage toward the plentiful possibilities that POFETs and VOFETs offer to flexible electronics.

         <title>Recent Research Progress of Organic Small&#8208;Molecule Semiconductors with High Electron Mobilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the structural modification strategies of organic small&#8208;molecule semiconductors with high electron mobilities, a promising candidate for the construction of next&#8208;generation complementary organic logic&#8208;digital circuits, to achieve chemical stability and high electron transport properties. In addition, the applications of n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule semiconductor materials based on high mobility in organic electronic devices, such as organic field&#8208;effect transistors, organic light&#8208;emitting transistors, organic photodetectors, and gas sensors, are introduced.








Abstract
Organic electronics has made great progress in the past decades, which is inseparable from the innovative development of organic electronic devices and the diversity of organic semiconductor materials. It is worth mentioning that both of these great advances are inextricably linked to the development of organic high&#8208;performance semiconductor materials, especially the representative n&#8208;type organic small&#8208;molecule semiconductor materials with high electron mobilities. The n&#8208;type organic small molecules have the advantages of simple synthesis process, strong intermolecular stacking, tunable molecular structure, and easy to functionalize structures. Furthermore, the n&#8208;type semiconductor is a remarkable and important component for constructing complementary logic circuits and p&#8208;n heterojunction structures. Therefore, n&#8208;type organic semiconductors play an extremely important role in the field of organic electronic materials and are the basis for the industrialization of organic electronic functional devices. This review focuses on the modification strategies of organic small molecules with high electron mobility at molecular level, and discusses in detail the applications of n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule semiconductor materials with high mobility in organic field&#8208;effect transistors, organic light&#8208;emitting transistors, organic photodetectors, and gas sensors.

         <title>A Novel &#8220;Inside&#8208;Out&#8221; Intraocular Nanomedicine Delivery Mode for Nanomaterials&#8217; Biological Effect Enhanced Choroidal Neovascularization Occlusion and Microenvironment Regulation</title>

A Pt and Au nanoparticle decorated zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 nanoplatform is developed to load indocyanine green for precise choroidal neovascularization occlusion and microenvironment regulation. A novel &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; intraocular nanomedicine delivery mode is exploited to penetrate the internal limiting membrane through M&#252;ller cells endocytosis. The mRNA expressions of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; and VEGF reduce by 90.2% and 81.7%, respectively, compared to verteporfin treatment.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is commonly used in choroidal neovascularization (CNV) treatment due to the superior light transmittance of the eye. However, PDT often leads to surrounding tissue damage and further microenvironmental deterioration, including exacerbated hypoxia, inflammation, and secondary neovascularization. In this work, Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and Au NPs decorated zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 nanoplatform is developed to load indocyanine green for precise PDT and microenvironment amelioration, which can penetrate the internal limiting membrane through M&#252;ller cells endocytosis and target to CNV by surface&#8208;grafted cyclo(Arg&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asp&#8211;d&#8208;Phe&#8211;Lys) after intravitreal injection. The excessive H2O2 in the CNV microenvironment is catalyzed by catalase&#8208;like Pt NPs for hypoxia relief and enhanced PDT occlusion of neovascular. Meanwhile, Au NPs show significant anti&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;angiogenesis properties in regulating macrophages and blocking vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Compared with verteporfin treatment, the mRNA expressions of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; and VEGF in the nanoplatform group are downregulated by 90.2% and 81.7%, respectively. Therefore, the nanoplatform realizes a comprehensive CNV treatment effect based on the high drug loading capacity and biosafety. The CNV treatment mode developed in this work provides a valuable reference for treating other diseases with similar physiological barriers that limit drug delivery and similar microenvironment.

         <title>Y&#8208;Type Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors with Outer Branched Side Chains and Inner Cyclohexane Side Chains for 19.36% Efficiency Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with outer branched side chains and inner cyclohexane side chains are designed for polymer solar cells with the power conversion efficiencies of 18.52% and 19.36% achieved in the binary and ternary blend devices, respectively, which are among the highest values for single&#8208;junction solar cells at present.








Abstract
Raising the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors can increase the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and thus the photovoltaic performance of the current top performing polymer solar cells (PSCs). One of the viable routes is demonstrated by the successful Y6 derivative of L8&#8208;BO with the branched alkyl chains at the outer side. This will introduce steric hindrance and reduce intermolecular aggregation, thus open up the bandgap and raise the LUMO energy level. To take further advantages of the steric hindrance influence on optoelectronic properties of Y6 derivatives, two Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors of BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4F and BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4Cl are designed and synthesized by adopting outer branched side chains and inner cyclohexane side chains. An outstanding Voc of 0.937&#160;V is achieved in the D18:BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4F binary blend devices along with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.52%. With the addition of BTP&#8208;eC9 to extend the absorption spectral coverage, a remarkable PCE of 19.36% is realized finally in the related ternary blend devices, which is one of the highest values for single&#8208;junction PSCs at present. The results illustrate the great potential of cyclohexane side chains in constructing high&#8208;performance non&#8208;fullerene acceptors and their PSCs.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Transparent, Chiral Organic Photodiodes with Incident Direction&#8208;Dependent Selectivity for Circularly Polarized Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semi&#8208;transparent organic photodiodes containing chiral non&#8208;fullerene acceptor and achiral polymer donor respond differently to left and right circularly polarized light. The preference switches when changing the direction of the incoming light. Circular selective absorption in combination with selective collection of carriers from a narrow space charge region can account for the change in polarization.








Abstract
Detection of the circular polarization of light is possible using chiral semiconductors, yet the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Semi&#8208;transparent chiral photodiodes allow for a simple experiment to investigate the basis of their selectivity: changing the side from which the diode is illuminated. A reversal of circular selectivity is observed in photocurrent generation when changing the direction of illumination on organic, bulk&#8208;heterojunction cells. The change in selectivity can be explained by a space&#8208;charge limitation on the collection of photocarriers in combination with preferential absorption of one of the circular polarizations of near&#8208;infrared light by the chiral non&#8208;fullerene acceptor. The space&#8208;charge limitation is supported by detailed measurements of frequency and intensity dependence of dc and ac photocurrents.

         <title>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Mediated Drug Delivery for First Aid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)&#8208;mediated first&#8208;aid system is developed for targeted drug delivery (uFAST), which enables autonomous administration of emergency therapeutics via UAVs to achieve timely first aid. The implementability and safety of the uFAST with a dual&#8208;mode glucagon microneedle patch in emergency care is well demonstrated in a severe hypoglycemic pig disease model.








Abstract
Timely administration of key medications toward patients with sudden diseases is critical to saving lives. However, slow transport of first&#8208;aid therapeutics and the potential absence of trained people for drug usage can&#160;lead&#160;to severe injuries or even death. Herein, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)&#8208;mediated first&#8208;aid system for targeted delivery (uFAST) is developed. It allows unattended administration of emergency therapeutics&#8208;loaded transdermal microneedle (MN) patches toward patients to relieve symptoms by a contact&#8208;triggered microneedle applicator (CTMA). The implementability and safety of the uFAST for first aid is demonstrated in a severe hypoglycemic pig model by automatically delivering a glucagon patch with immediate and bioresponsive dual release modes. This platform technique may facilitate the development of UAV&#8208;mediated first&#8208;aid treatments for other sudden diseases.

         <title>Dislocated Bilayer MOF Enables High&#8208;Selectivity Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D monolayer and 2D bilayer metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are constructed by a simple solvothermal method. The bilayer MOF is a novel dislocation 2D porphyrin&#8208;based MOF material that exhibits good structural stability as well as ultra&#8208;high CO selectivity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction (100% selectivity). This work offers a new strategy for the construction of bilayer MOFs and provides a new perspective for the customization of photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
The highly selective photoreduction of CO2 into valuable small&#8208;molecule chemical feedstocks such as CO is an effective strategy for addressing the energy crisis and environmental problems. However, it remains a challenge because the complex CO2 photoreduction process usually generates multiple possible products and requires a subsequent separation step. In this paper, 2D monolayer and bilayer porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are successfully constructed by adjusting the reaction temperature and solvent polarity with 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin as the light&#8208;harvesting ligand. The bilayer MOF is a low&#8208;dimensional MOF with a special structure in which the upper and lower layers are arranged in dislocation and are bridged by halogen ions. This bilayer MOF exhibits 100% ultra&#8208;high selectivity for the reduction of CO2 to CO under simulated sunlight without any cocatalyst or photosensitizer and can be recycled at least three times. The intrinsic mechanism of this photocatalytic CO2 reduction process is explored through experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

     alt="Dislocated Bilayer MOF Enables High-Selectivity Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D monolayer and 2D bilayer metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are constructed by a simple solvothermal method. The bilayer MOF is a novel dislocation 2D porphyrin-based MOF material that exhibits good structural stability as well as ultra-high CO selectivity for photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction (100% selectivity). This work offers a new strategy for the construction of bilayer MOFs and provides a new perspective for the customization of photocatalytic performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highly selective photoreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into valuable small-molecule chemical feedstocks such as CO is an effective strategy for addressing the energy crisis and environmental problems. However, it remains a challenge because the complex CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction process usually generates multiple possible products and requires a subsequent separation step. In this paper, 2D monolayer and bilayer porphyrin-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are successfully constructed by adjusting the reaction temperature and solvent polarity with 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-pyridyl)porphyrin as the light-harvesting ligand. The bilayer MOF is a low-dimensional MOF with a special structure in which the upper and lower layers are arranged in dislocation and are bridged by halogen ions. This bilayer MOF exhibits 100% ultra-high selectivity for the reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO under simulated sunlight without any cocatalyst or photosensitizer and can be recycled at least three times. The intrinsic mechanism of this photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction process is explored through experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work shows that the rational design of the number of layers in 2D MOF structures can tune the stability of these structures and opens a new avenue for the design of highly selective MOF photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multifunctional 3D&#8208;Printed Pollen Grain&#8208;Inspired Hydrogel Microrobots for On&#8208;Demand Anchoring and Cargo Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional hydrogel microrobot is created by different stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels with pollen grain&#8208;inspired microstructures. The robot is capable of conducting temperature&#8208;responsive on&#8208;demand surface attachment, magnetic locomotion, and pH&#8208;responsive cargo delivery toward biomedical applications.








Abstract
While a majority of wireless microrobots have shown multi&#8208;responsiveness to implement complex biomedical functions, their functional executions are strongly dependent on the range of stimulus inputs, which curtails their functional diversity. Furthermore, their responsive functions are coupled to each other, which results in the overlap of the task operations. Here, a 3D&#8208;printed multifunctional microrobot inspired by pollen grains with three hydrogel components is demonstrated: iron platinum (FePt) nanoparticle&#8208;embedded pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA), poly N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAM), and poly N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide acrylic acid (pNIPAM&#8208;AAc) structures. Each of these structures exhibits their respective targeted functions: responding to magnetic fields for torque&#8208;driven surface rolling and steering, exhibiting temperature responsiveness for on&#8208;demand surface attachment (anchoring), and pH&#8208;responsive cargo release. The versatile multifunctional pollen grain&#8208;inspired robots conceptualized here pave the way for various future medical microrobots to improve their projected performance and functional diversity.

         <title>Conjugated Coordination Polymer as a New Platform for Efficient and Selective Electroreduction of Nitrate into Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy for simultaneous enhancement of activity and selectivity toward nitrate electroreduction into ammonia (NRA) is demonstrated by utilizing Ni&#8208;based conjugated coordination polymer catalysts for the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. Coordination modulation can tailor their electrostatic attractions with the metal&#8208;hydrated cations that can regulate proton migration at the catalyst surface, promoting the NRA and inhibiting the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).








Abstract
Electroreduction of nitrate into ammonia (NRA) provides a sustainable route to convert the widespread nitrate pollutants into high&#8208;value&#8208;added products under ambient conditions, which unfortunately suffers from unsatisfactory selectivity due to the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Previous strategies of modifying the metal sites of catalysts often met a dilemma for simultaneously promoting activity and selectivity toward NRA. Here, a general strategy is reported to enable an efficient and selective NRA process through coordination modulation of single&#8208;atom catalysts to tailor the local proton concentration at the catalyst surface. By contrast, two analogous Ni&#8208;single&#8208;atom enriched conjugated coordination polymers (NiO4&#8208;CCP and NiN4&#8208;CCP) with different coordination motifs are investigated for the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. The NiO4&#8208;CCP catalyst exhibits an ammonia yield rate as high as 1.83&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 94.7% under a current density of 125&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming the NiN4&#8208;CCP catalyst. These experimental and theoretical studies both suggest that the strategy of coordination modulation can not only accelerate the NRA&#160;by adjusting the adsorption energies of NRA intermediates on the metal sites but also inhibit the HER through regulating the proton migration with contributions from the metal&#8208;hydrated cations adsorbed at the catalyst surface, thus achieving simultaneous enhancement of NRA selectivity and activity.

         <title>Unlocking High Capacity and Fast Na+ Diffusion of HxCrS2 by Proton&#8208;Exchange Pretreatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pretreatment of NaCrS2 to produce HxCrS2 results in a more robust and higher performing electrode by numerous measures. Proton exchange produces a heterostructure that permits fast diffusion while also seemingly unlocking reversible access to cationic redox, enabling high capacity. The unique biphasic structure of HxCrS2 may be generalizable to other materials, opening a new class of electrode materials.








Abstract
This study presents a new material, &#8220;HxCrS2&#8221; (denotes approximate composition) formed by proton&#8208;exchange of NaCrS2 which has a measured capacity of 728 mAh g&#8722;1 with significant improvements to capacity retention, sustaining over 700 mAh g&#8722;1 during cycling experiments. This is the highest reported capacity for a transition metal sulfide electrode and outperforms the most promising proposed sodium anodes to date. HxCrS2 exhibits a biphasic structure featuring alternating crystalline and amorphous lamella on the scale of a few nanometers. This unique structural motif enables reversible access to Cr redox in the material resulting in higher capacities than seen in the parent structure which features only S redox. Pretreatment by proton&#8208;exchange offers a route to materials such as HxCrS2 which provide fast diffusion and high capacities for sodium&#8208;ion&#160;batteries.

         <title>Ultrasensitive and Ultraprecise Pressure Sensors for Soft Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Making flexible sensors more precise is the focus of this research. It is found that by making the pressure sensing layer using pure materials&#160;and separating it from the rest of the sensor structure, the errors caused by the sensor's deformation can be reduced when it is subjected to external forces. This leads to improved precision and flexibility in sensing.








Abstract
Highly sensitive soft pressure sensors have attracted tremendous attention in recent years due to their great promise in robotics, healthcare, smart wearables, etc. Although high sensitivities can be realized by existing sensing mechanisms, they usually cause large random errors owing to inhomogeneous sensing layers, thus considerably reducing the sensing precision for practical applications. Herein, a pure&#8208;polymer and field emission bilayer structure (PFEBS)&#8208;based transduction mechanism is presented to successfully design an ultrasensitive and ultraprecise soft pressure sensor for the first time. This unique structure enables numerous tunneling electrons generated by field emission to be transmitted through the homogeneous sensing layer, which undergoes uniform deformation under subtle pressures, simultaneously achieving a sensing precision with variation &lt;1.62% and a sensitivity of 372.2 kPa&#8722;1. This study offers a new design strategy to develop next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance flexible pressure sensors for soft systems.

         <title>Highly Damping and Self&#8208;Healable Ionic Elastomer from Dynamic Phase Separation of Sticky Fluorinated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the heterogeneous structure of adipose tissue, the first example of damping self&#8208;healable ionic elastomer is reported, which features a dynamic phase&#8208;separated structure with energy&#8208;dissipating nanophases embedded in an elastic matrix. By virtue of phase separation and sticky liquid crystal assembly of fluorinated copolymers, this design reconciles elasticity and damping capacity, which are usually contradictive in previous ionic skins.








Abstract
Shock&#8208;induced low&#8208;frequency vibration damage is extremely harmful to bionic soft robots and machines that may incur the malfunction of fragile electronic elements. However, current skin&#8208;like self&#8208;healable ionic elastomers as the artificial sensing and protecting layer still lack the ability to dampen vibrations, due to their almost opposite design for molecular frictions to material's elasticity. Inspired by the two&#8208;phase structure of adipose tissue (the natural damping skin layer), here, a highly damping ionic elastomer with energy&#8208;dissipating nanophases embedded in an elastic matrix is introduced, which is formed by polymerization&#8208;induced dynamic phase separation of sticky fluorinated copolymers in the presence of lithium salts. Such a supramolecular design decouples the elastic and damping functions into two distinct phases, and thus reconciles a few intriguing properties including ionic conductivity, high stretchability, softness, strain&#8208;stiffening, elastic recovery, room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healability, recyclability, and most importantly, record&#8208;high damping capacity at the human motion frequency range (loss factor tan &#948;&#160;&gt;&#160;1 at 0.1&#8211;50&#160;Hz). This study opens the door for the artificial syntheses of high&#8208;performance damping ionic skins with robust sensing and protective applications in soft electronics and robotics.

         <title>Picoperovskites: The Smallest Conceivable Isolated Halide Perovskite Structures Formed within Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide perovskites CsPbBr3 and lead&#8208;free CsSnI3 form &#8220;picoperovskites&#8221; in 1.2&#8211;1.6&#160;nm&#8208;diameter single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes with cross&#8208;sectional unit&#8208;cell or sub&#8208;unit&#8208;cell dimensions. The smallest of these are bilayer inorganic polymers retaining ABX3 stoichiometry while intermediate&#8208;scale Cs3PbBr3 preserves Pb2+ by forming ordered vacancies. The largest Cs4Sn4Ix form alternates Cs4 and Sn4Ix layers along the nanotube cavities.








Abstract
Halide perovskite structures are revolutionizing the design of optoelectronic materials, including solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and photovoltaics when formed at the quantum scale. Four isolated sub&#8208;nanometer, or picoscale, halide perovskite structures formed inside &#8776;1.2&#8211;1.6&#160;nm single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) by melt insertion from CsPbBr3 and lead&#8208;free CsSnI3 are reported. Three directly relate to the ABX3 perovskite archetype while a fourth is a perovskite&#8208;like lamellar structure with alternating Cs4 and polyhedral Sn4Ix layers. In &#8776;1.4&#160;nm&#8208;diameter SWCNTs, CsPbBr3 forms Cs3PbIIBr5 nanowires, one ABX3 unit cell in cross section with the Pb2+ oxidation state maintained by ordered Cs+ vacancies. Within &#8776;1.2&#160;nm&#8208;diameter SWCNTs, CsPbBr3 and CsSnI3 form inorganic&#8208;polymer&#8208;like bilayer structures, one&#8208;fourth of an ABX3 unit cell in cross section with systematically reproduced ABX3 stoichiometry. Producing these smallest halide perovskite structures at their absolute synthetic cross&#8208;sectional limit enables quantum confinement effects with first&#8208;principles calculations demonstrating bandgap widening compared to corresponding bulk structural forms.

         <title>Rational Design of Platinum&#8211;Bismuth Sulfide Schottky Heterostructure for Sonocatalysis&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of sonocatalytic hydrogen evolution is first proposed. The synthesized platinum&#8211;bismuth sulfide&#160;nanoparticles exhibit ultrasound&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen production, glutathione oxidation, relieve hypoxia in vitro and in vivo, and effectively kill cancer cells by inhibiting cancer cell energy metabolism, increasing intratumoral reactive oxygen species levels, and inducing DNA damage.








Abstract
Conventional sonodynamic therapy is unavoidably limited by the tumor microenvironment, although many sonosensitizers have been developed to improve them to a certain extent. Given this, a concept of sonocatalytic hydrogen evolution is proposed, which is defined as an oxygen&#8208;independent therapeutics. To demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, the narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) is selected as the sonocatalyst and platinum (Pt) nanoparticles are grown in situ to optimize their catalytic performance. In this nanocatalytic system, the Pt nanoparticles help to capture sonoexcited electrons, whereas intratumoral overexpressed glutathione (GSH), as a natural hole sacrificial agent, can consume sonoexcited holes, which greatly improves the charge&#8208;separation efficiency and promotes controllable and sustainable H2&#160;generation. Even under hypoxic conditions, the Pt&#8208;Bi2S3&#160;nanoparticles can also produce sufficient H2&#160;under ultrasound irradiation. Mechanistically, mitochondrial dysfunction caused by H2&#160;and intratumoral redox homeostasis destruction by GSH depletion synergistically damage DNA to induce tumor cells apoptosis. At the same time, the Pt nanoparticles and holes can also trigger the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into O2&#160;to relieve tumor hypoxia,&#160;thus&#160;being synergistic with GSH depletion to reverse tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. The proposed sonocatalysis&#8208;mediated therapy will provide a new direction to realize facile and efficient cancer therapy.

         <title>Dual/Triple Template&#8208;Induced Evolved Emulsion for Controllable Construction of Anisotropic Carbon Nanoparticles from Concave to Convex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual/triple template&#8208;induced evolved emulsion strategy is developed for the precise construction of anisotropic mesoporous carbon nanoparticles. It not only endows the concave structure with adjustable size and meso&#8208;structure but also realizes the innovative transformation from concave to convex in a one&#8208;pot method. Moreover, the well&#8208;designed basin&#8208;concave and mountain&#8208;convex nanoparticles manifest excellent performance for improving drug release rate and enzyme catalytic efficiency.








Abstract
Anisotropic mesoporous carbon (AMC) nanoparticles with asymmetric external morphologies, topological internal structure, and superior performance of carbon species are attracting great attention because of their seductive features differentiating them from symmetric nanoparticles. However, a bewildering challenge but crucial desire remains to endow them with flexibly tunable morphology and pore structure. Herein, a dual/triple&#8208;templating evolved emulsion strategy for tunable fabrication of AMC nanoparticles with distinctive defined structure by interface&#8208;energy&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly is first reported based on a brand&#8208;new mechanism. It describes the possible formation process of the concave&#8208;cavity structure and allows for manipulation of the longitudinal and lateral sizes systematically by adjusting emulsion polarity and sodium oleate dosage, respectively. Interestingly, the internal pore structure can be rearranged into radial channels and the external morphology can realize structural transformation from concave to convex by innovatively introducing the third template n&#8208;hexanol, which is unprecedented at nanoscale. Remarkably, due to the excellent properties of carbon species and unique structural characteristics, AMC nanoparticles not only demonstrate good biocompatibility but also exhibit splendid performance in improving the dissolution and release rates of insoluble drug and enhancing the enzyme catalytic efficiency. Generally, this approach provides new inspiration and insights for expanding exquisite anisotropic nanomaterials for many potential applications.

         <title>A Breathable, Passive&#8208;Cooling, Non&#8208;Inflammatory, and Biodegradable Aerogel Electronic Skin for Wearable Physical&#8208;Electrophysiological&#8208;Chemical Analysis</title>

A breathable, passive&#8208;cooling, non&#8208;inflammatory, biodegradable, and flexible aerogel electronic skin is developed to monitor physical, electrophysiological, and metabolic biomarkers from the human body continuously and simultaneously.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of human health can be significantly improved by designing novel electronic skin (E&#8208;skin) platforms that mimic the characteristics and sensitivity of human skin. A high&#8208;quality E&#8208;skin platform that can simultaneously monitor multiple physiological and metabolic biomarkers without introducing skin discomfort or irritation is an unmet medical need. Conventional E&#8208;skins are either monofunctional or made from elastomeric films that do not include key synergistic features of natural skin, such as multi&#8208;sensing, breathability, and thermal management capabilities in a single patch. Herein, a biocompatible and biodegradable E&#8208;skin patch based on flexible gelatin methacryloyl aerogel (FGA) for non&#8208;invasive and continuous monitoring of multiple biomarkers of interest is engineered and demonstrated. Taking advantage of cryogenic temperature treatment and slow polymerization, FGA is fabricated with a highly interconnected porous structure that displays good flexibility, passive&#8208;cooling capabilities, and ultra&#8208;lightweight properties that make it comfortable to wear for long periods of time. It also provides numerous permeable capillary channels for thermal&#8208;moisture transfer, ensuring its excellent breathability. Therefore, the engineered FGA&#8208;based E&#8208;skin can simultaneously monitor body temperature, hydration, and biopotentials via electrophysiological sensors and detect glucose, lactate, and alcohol levels via electrochemical sensors. This work offers a previously unexplored materials strategy for next&#8208;generation E&#8208;skin platforms with superior practicality.

         <title>A Pseudocapacitor Diode Based on Ion&#8208;Selective Surface Redox Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pseudocapacitor diode is proposed for the first time, which is constructed by the ion&#8208;selective surface redox mechanism of spinel ZnCo2O4 in aqueous electrolyte KOH, thus successfully integrating the function of blocking the unidirectional current response of a diode into an aqueous pseudocapacitor with fast ion conduction capability.








Abstract
Supercapacitor diode (CAPode) is a novel device that integrates ion diode functionality into a conventional electrical double&#8208;layer capacitor and is expected to have great applications in emerging fields such as signal propagation, microcircuit rectification, logic operations, and neuromorphology. Here, a brand new pseudocapacitor diode is reported that has both high charge storage (50.2&#160;C&#160;g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mV&#160;s&#8722;1) and high rectification (the rectification ratio of 0.79 at 200&#160;mV&#160;s&#8722;1) properties, which is realized by the ion&#8208;selective surface redox reaction of spinel ZnCo2O4 in aqueous alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, an application of the integrated device is demonstrated in the logic gate of circuit system to realize the logic operations of &#8220;AND&#8221; and &#8220;OR&#8221;. This work not only expands the types of CAPodes, but also provides a train of thought for constructing high&#8208;performance capacitive ionic diodes.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Locked Tandem Fluorescent Probe for Imaging of Pyroptosis in Cancer Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;locked and tandem activatable probe (DTAP) is presented for real&#8208;time near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of intratumoral pyroptosis during cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in living mice. It provides a non&#8208;invasive tool to study the regulatory mechanism of pyroptosis during cancer therapy and predict cancer therapeutic efficacy, hence capable of being applied to optimize cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapies for precision medicine.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time imaging of programmed cancer cell death (PCD) is imperative to monitor cancer therapeutic efficacy and tailor therapeutic regimens; however, specific in vivo detection of intratumoral pyroptosis remains challenging. Herein, a dual&#8208;locked and tandem activatable probe (DTAP) is reported for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of intratumoral pyroptosis during cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in living mice. The probe comprises a hemicyanine dye dual&#8208;locked with an enzyme&#8208;responsive moiety that can be tandemly cleaved by pyroptosis&#8208;related biomarker (Caspase&#8208;1) and cancer biomarker (GGT) to turn on its NIRF signal. As pyroptosis plays a vital role in triggering anti&#8208;tumor immune responses, the activated signal of DTAP correlates well with the population of tumor&#8208;infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes and tumor growth inhibition, consequently permitting the prediction of cancer therapeutic efficacy. This study also provides a non&#8208;invasive technique to study the regulatory mechanism of pyroptosis in cancer therapy and to optimize cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapies for precision medicine.

         <title>Graph Analysis with Multifunctional Self&#8208;Rectifying Memristive Crossbar Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graph analysis based on the desired sneak current is performed using a self&#8208;rectifying memristor and a &#8220;metal cell at diagonalcrossbar array (mCBA)&#8221; structure. mCBA effectively extracts hidden information from complex networks without preprocessing and loss of information. Three graph algorithms (pathfinding, link prediction, community detection) and brain network&#8208;based attention&#8208;deficit/hyperactivity disorder classification are performed effectively based on the mCBA.








Abstract
Many big data have interconnected and dynamic graph structures growing over time. Analyzing these graphical data requires the hidden relationship between the nodes in the graphs to be identified, which has conventionally been achieved by finding the effective similarity. However, graphs are generally non&#8208;Euclidean, which does not allow finding it. In this study, the non&#8208;Euclidean graphs are mapped to a specific crossbar array (CBA) composed of self&#8208;rectifying memristors and metal cells at the diagonal positions. The sneak current, an intrinsic physical property in the CBA, allows for the identification of the similarity function. The sneak&#8208;current&#8208;based similarity function indicates the distance between the nodes, which can be used to predict the probability that unconnected nodes will be connected in the future, connectivity between communities, and neural connections in a brain. When all bit lines of the CBA are connected to the ground, the sneak current is suppressed, and the CBA can be used to search for adjacent nodes. This work demonstrates the physical calculation methods applied to various graphical problems&#160;using the CBA composed of the self&#8208;rectifying memristor based on the HfO2 switching layer. Moreover, such applications suffer less from the memristors&#8217; inherent issues related to their stochastic nature.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Guaranteed High Carrier Mobility in Quasi&#8208;2D Thermoelectric Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The horizontal mirror symmetry in BaAgSb vanishes the electron&#8211;phonon coupling mediated by phonons with purely out&#8208;of&#8208;plane vibrational vectors, which weakens the phonon&#8208;induced carrier scattering and triggers a record hole mobility among polycrystalline quasi&#8208;2D thermoelectrics. Such high mobility accompanied with intrinsically low thermal conductivity gives rise to excellent p&#8208;type thermoelectric performance in polycrystalline BaAgSb.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D semiconductors have garnered immense research interest for next&#8208;generation electronics and thermoelectrics due to their unique structural, mechanical, and transport properties. However, most quasi&#8208;2D semiconductors experimentally synthesized so far have relatively low carrier mobility, preventing the achievement of exceptional power output. To break through this obstacle, a route is proposed based on the crystal symmetry arguments to facilitate the charge transport of quasi&#8208;2D semiconductors, in which the horizontal mirror symmetry is found to vanish the electron&#8211;phonon coupling strength mediated by phonons with purely out&#8208;of&#8208;plane vibrational vectors. This is demonstrated in ZrBeSi&#8208;type quasi&#8208;2D systems, where the representative sample Ba1.01AgSb shows a high room&#8208;temperature hole mobility of 344 cm2 V&#8722;1 S&#8722;1, a record value among quasi&#8208;2D polycrystalline thermoelectrics. Accompanied by intrinsically low thermal conductivity, an excellent p&#8208;type zT of &#8776;1.3 is reached at 1012 K, which is the highest value in ZrBeSi&#8208;type compounds. This work uncovers the relation between electron&#8211;phonon coupling and crystal symmetry in quasi&#8208;2D systems, which broadens the horizon to develop high mobility semiconductors for electronic and energy conversion applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quasi-2D semiconductors have garnered immense research interest for next-generation electronics and thermoelectrics due to their unique structural, mechanical, and transport properties. However, most quasi-2D semiconductors experimentally synthesized so far have relatively low carrier mobility, preventing the achievement of exceptional power output. To break through this obstacle, a route is proposed based on the crystal symmetry arguments to facilitate the charge transport of quasi-2D semiconductors, in which the horizontal mirror symmetry is found to vanish the electron&#8211;phonon coupling strength mediated by phonons with purely out-of-plane vibrational vectors. This is demonstrated in ZrBeSi-type quasi-2D systems, where the representative sample Ba&lt;sub&gt;1.01&lt;/sub&gt;AgSb shows a high room-temperature hole mobility of 344 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; S&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a record value among quasi-2D polycrystalline thermoelectrics. Accompanied by intrinsically low thermal conductivity, an excellent p-type &lt;i&gt;zT&lt;/i&gt; of &#8776;1.3 is reached at 1012 K, which is the highest value in ZrBeSi-type compounds. This work uncovers the relation between electron&#8211;phonon coupling and crystal symmetry in quasi-2D systems, which broadens the horizon to develop high mobility semiconductors for electronic and energy conversion applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Sensitive Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Photodetectors with Over 450 Days Stability Enabled by Synergistic Engineering for Pulse Oximetry System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multifunctional additive 4&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoic acid (ATFBA), with terminal amino and carboxyl groups, passivates the surface defects and enhances the stability of the Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite, therefore resulting in high sensitivity and highly stable Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite photodetectors. In addition, the ATFBA&#8208;based photodetector has been integrated with a pulse oximetry visualization system, successfully yielding accurate blood oxygen saturation and heart rate.








Abstract
Low&#8208;bandgap tin (Sn)&#8208;lead (Pb) halide perovskites can achieve near&#8208;infrared response for photodetectors. However, the Sn&#8208;based devices suffer from notorious instability and high defect densities due to the oxidation propensity of Sn2+. Herein, a multifunctional additive 4&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoic acid (ATFBA) is presented, which can passivate surface defects and inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+ through hydrogen bonds and chelation coordination from the terminal amino and carboxyl groups. The perfluorinated benzene ring structure of ATFBA affords the passivator assembled at the grain boundaries to enhance the water resistance. With the synergistical passivation of these functional groups, the Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite photodetector exhibits a remarkable responsivity of 0.52&#160;A&#160;W&#8208;1 and an excellent specific detectivity of 5.34&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones at 850&#160;nm, along with remaining 97% of its initial responsivity over 450 days. Benefitting from high sensitivity, the photodetector is integrated into a pulse oximetry sensor visualization system, yielding accurate blood oxygen saturation and heart rate with less than 2% error. This work paves the avenue toward constructing high&#8208;performance and stable Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite photodetectors for practical applications.

         <title>Electrochemical Replication and Transfer for Low&#8208;Cost, Sub&#8208;100&#160;nm Patterning of Materials on Flexible Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new additive patterning technique, named electrochemical replication and transfer, is developed to pattern a wide variety of metals, semiconductors, and polymers with resolutions spanning from sub&#8208;100&#160;nm to many centimeters on flexible substrates at low cost and high throughput.








Abstract
The fabrication of high&#8208;resolution patterns on flexible substrates is an essential step in the development of flexible electronics. However, the patterning process on flexible substrates often requires expensive equipment and tedious lithographic processing. Here, a bottom&#8208;up patterning technique, termed electrochemical replication and transfer (ERT) is reported, which fabricates multiscale patterns of a wide variety of materials by selective electrodeposition of target materials on a predefined template, and subsequent transfer of the electrodeposited materials to a flexible substrate, while leaving the undamaged template for reuse for over 100 times. The additive and parallel patterning attribute of ERT allows the fabrication of multiscale patterns with resolutions spanning from sub&#8208;100&#160;nm to many centimeters simultaneously, which overcomes the trade&#8208;off between resolution and throughput of conventional patterning techniques. ERT is suitable for fabricating a wide variety of materials including metals, semiconductors, metal oxides, and polymers into arbitrary shapes on flexible substrates at a very low cost.

         <title>Stem Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated Microribbon Scaffolds Induce Regenerative Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses in a Critical&#8208;Size Cranial Bone Defect Model</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell membrane coating represents a biomimetic strategy for modifying the surface of biomaterials. Coating macroporous microribbon scaffolds with mesenchymal stem cell membrane (MSCM) enhances cranial bone healing via immunomodulation. Primed MSCM&#8208;coating contains ligands that promote M&#966; polarization toward M2, induce Treg differentiation and TCD8+ apoptosis, and enhance MSC osteogenesis. MSCM coating synergizes with BMP&#8208;2 to further accelerate bone regeneration while suppressing inflammation.








Abstract
Naturally&#8208;derived cell membranes have shown great promise in functionalizing nanoparticles to enhance biointerfacing functions for drug delivery applications. However, its potential for functionalizing macroporous scaffolds to enhance tissue regeneration in vivo remains unexplored. Engineering scaffolds with immunomodulatory functions represents an exciting strategy for tissue regeneration but is largely limited to soft tissues. Critical&#8208;sized bone defects cannot heal on their own, and the role of adaptive immune cells in scaffold&#8208;mediated healing of cranial bone defects remains largely unknown. Here, mensenchymal stem cell membrane (MSCM)&#8208;coated microribbon (&#181;RB) scaffolds for treating critical size cranial bone defects via targeting immunomodulation are reported. Confocal imaging and proteomic analyses are used to confirm successful coating and characterize the compositions of cell membrane coating. It is demonstrated that MSCM coating promotes macrophage (M&#966;) polarization toward regenerative phenotype, induces CD8+ T cell apoptosis, and enhances regulatory T cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo. When combined with a low dosage of BMP&#8208;2, MSCM coating further accelerates bone regeneration and suppresses inflammation. These results establish cell membrane&#8208;coated microribbon scaffolds as a promising strategy for treating critical size bone defects via immunomodulation. The platform may be broadly used with different cell membranes and scaffolds to enhance regeneration of multiple tissue types.

         <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer chip operated by LED is developed to detect SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and influenza viruses simultaneously. The ultrafast target enrichment (&#8776;500&#215;) followed by autonomous elution and amplification via photothermal activation enables limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection of 0.5 copies &#181;L&#8722;1. The sensitive detection in point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings comparable to standard polymerase chain reaction allows timely management of various pandemic situations that may be faced shortly.








Abstract
Prompt on&#8208;site diagnosis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with other respiratory infections will have minimized the global impact of the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic through rapid, effective management. However, no such multiplex point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) chip has satisfied a suitable sensitivity of gold&#8208;standard nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Here, a rapid multiplexed ultrasensitive sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer loop&#8208;mediated isothermal amplification (MUSAL) chip operated by simple LED&#8208;driven photothermal amplification to detect six targets from single&#8208;swab sampling is presented. First, the MUSAL chip allows ultrafast on&#8208;chip sample preparation with &#8776;500&#8208;fold preconcentration at a rate of 1.2&#160;mL min&#8722;1. Second, the chip enables contamination&#8208;free amplification using autonomous target elution into on&#8208;chip reagents by photothermal activation. Finally, the chip accomplishes multiplexed on&#8208;chip diagnostics of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and influenza viruses with a limit of detection (LoD) of 0.5 copies &#181;L&#8722;1. The rapid, ultrasensitive, cost&#8208;effective sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer chip with a multiplex capability will allow timely management of various pandemics situations that may be faced shortly.

         <title>A Super Tough, Rapidly Biodegradable, Ultrafast Hemostatic Bioglue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bioglue is composed of amidated&#8208;gelatin and Tetra&#8208;PEG&#8208;SS for rapid hemostasis in massive hemorrhage. The amino terminals in gelatin quickly react with active ester moieties in the PEG&#8208;SS, endowing the amino&#8208;gelatin&#8208;PEG glue firm and indiscriminate adhesion with various moist tissues (e.g., adhesively sealing cardiac hemorrhagic wounds). The bioglue provides a fascinating hemostatic approach for clinical hemostasis and emergency rescue.








Abstract
Death happening due to massive hemorrhage has been involved in military conflicts, traffic accidents, and surgical injuries of various human disasters. Achieving rapid and effective hemostasis to save lives is crucial in urgent massive bleeding situations. Herein, a covalent cross&#8208;linked AG&#8208;PEG glue based on extracellular matrix&#8208;like amino&#8208;gelatin (AG) and PEG derivatives is developed. The AG&#8208;PEG glue gelatinizes fast and exhibits firm and indiscriminate close adhesion with various moist tissues upon being dosed. The formed glue establishes an adhesive and robust barrier to seal the arterial, hepatic, and cardiac hemorrhagic wounds, enabling it to withstand up to 380&#160;mmHg blood pressure in comparison with normal systolic blood pressure of 60&#8211;180&#160;mmHg. Remarkably, massive bleeding from a pig cardiac penetrating hole with 6&#160;mm diameter is effectively stopped using the glue within 60&#160;s. Postoperative indexes of the treated pig gradually recover and the cardiac wounds regrow significantly at 14&#160;days. Possessing on&#8208;demand solubility, self&#8208;gelling, and rapid degradability, the AG&#8208;PEG glue may provide a fascinating stop&#8208;bleeding approach for clinical hemostasis and emergency rescue.

         <title>Terahertz Nonlinear Hall Rectifiers Based on Spin&#8208;Polarized Topological Electronic States in&#160;1T&#8208;CoTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A second&#8208;order nonlinear Hall effect response for high&#8208;efficiency terahertz rectification, is observed in the spin&#8208;polarized 1T&#8208;CoTe2, led by the zero&#8208;magnetic&#8208;field&#160;extrinsic contribution of topological electronic states. The Hall&#8208;rectifier, without invoking any semiconductor junctions or bias voltage, shows up room&#8208;temperature responsivity of over 0.1 A W&#8722;1, and a mean noise equivalent power of 1 pW Hz&#8722;1/2, opening up device implementation based on quantum&#8208;wavefunction engineering.








Abstract
The zero&#8208;magnetic&#8208;field nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) refers to the second&#8208;order transverse current induced by an applied alternating electric field; it indicates the topological properties of inversion&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking crystals. Despite several studies on the NLHE induced by the Berry&#8208;curvature dipole in Weyl semimetals, the direct current conversion by rectification is limited to very low driving frequencies and cryogenic temperatures. The nonlinear photoresponse generated by the NLHE at room temperature can be useful for numerous applications in communication, sensing, and photodetection across a high bandwidth. In this study, observations of the second&#8208;order NLHE in type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal CoTe2 under time&#8208;reversal symmetry are reported. This is determined by the disorder&#8208;induced extrinsic contribution on the broken&#8208;inversion&#8208;symmetry surface and room&#8208;temperature terahertz rectification without the need for semiconductor junctions or bias voltage. It is shown that remarkable photoresponsivity over 0.1 A W&#8722;1, a response time of approximately 710&#160;ns, and a mean noise equivalent power of 1 pW Hz&#8722;1/2 can be achieved at room temperature. The results open a new pathway for low&#8208;energy photon harvesting via nonlinear rectification induced by the NLHE in strongly spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupled and inversion&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking systems, promising a considerable impact in the field of infrared/terahertz photonics.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Ionizable Iron Nanoadjuvant Augments STING Activation for Personalized Vaccination Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;ionizable iron nanoadjuvant (PEIM) is developed to potentiate cancer vaccination immunotherapy. PEIM nanoadjuvant is coassembled from acid&#8208;ionizable&#160;copolymers with iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) and a stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist. PEIM nanoadjuvant effectively delivers tumor antigens to lymph nodes, amplifies STING activation and type&#8208;I interferon (IFN&#8208;I) production, and ultimately&#160;elicits antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell response to inhibit tumor growth.








Abstract
The critical challenge for cancer vaccine&#8208;induced T&#8208;cell immunity is the sustained activation of antigen cross&#8208;presentation in antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) with innate immune stimulation. In this study, it is first discovered that the clinically used magnetic contrast agents, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), markedly augment the type&#8208;I interferon (IFN&#8208;I) production profile of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist MSA&#8208;2 and achieve a 16&#8208;fold dosage&#8208;sparing effect in the human STING haplotype. Acid&#8208;ionizable copolymers are coassembled with IONPs and MSA&#8208;2 into iron nanoadjuvants to concentrate STING activation in the draining lymph nodes. The top candidate iron nanoadjuvant (PEIM) efficiently delivers the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) to CD169+ APCs and facilitates antigen cross&#8208;presentation to elicit a 55&#8208;fold greater frequency of antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocyte response than soluble antigen. PEIM@OVA nanovaccine immunization induces potent and durable antitumor immunity to prevent tumor lung metastasis and eliminate established tumors. Moreover, PEIM nanoadjuvant is applicable to deliver autologous tumor antigen and synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade therapy for prevention of postoperative tumor recurrence and distant metastasis in B16&#8208;OVA melanoma and MC38 colorectal tumor models. The acid&#8208;ionizable iron nanoadjuvant offers a generalizable and readily translatable strategy to augment STING cascade activation and antigen cross&#8208;presentation for personalized cancer vaccination immunotherapy.

         <title>Hierarchical Porous Monoliths of Steel with Self&#8208;Reinforcing Adaptive Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous steel structures combining ultralow weight and high mechanical efficiency are manufactured by printing, reducing, and sintering wet foams containing iron oxide precursor particles. By forming new load&#8208;bearing struts when compressed, the porous structures are able to reversibly stiffen in response to nonuniform stresses, a behavior that conceptually resembles the unique adaptive properties of human bone.








Abstract
Porous structures offer an attractive approach to reduce the amount of natural resources used while maintaining relatively high mechanical efficiency. However, for some applications the drop in mechanical properties resulting from the introduction of porosity is too high, which has limited the broader utilization of porous materials in industry. Here, it is shown that steel monoliths can be designed to display high mechanical efficiency and reversible self&#8208;reinforcing properties when made with porous architectures with up to three hierarchical levels. Ultralight steel structures that can float on water and autonomously adapt their stiffness are manufactured by the thermal reduction and sintering of 3D printed foam templates. Using distinct mechanical testing techniques, image analysis, and finite element simulations, the mechanisms leading to the high mechanical efficiency and self&#8208;stiffening ability of the hierarchical porous monoliths are studied. The design and fabrication of mechanically stable porous monoliths using iron as a widely available natural resource is expected to contribute to the future development of functional materials with a more sustainable footprint.

Gold/aluminum micro&#8208;strips repeat along a specific direction and periodically form overlaps and gaps in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner like the patterns of a zebra. After compounding with semiconducting supramolecular nanowires, an output voltage of 140&#160;V can be achieved on a flexible substrate upon illumination.








Abstract
The mutual conversion between light and electricity lies at the heart of optoelectronic and photonic applications. Maximization of the photoelectric conversion is a long&#8208;term goal that can be pursued via the fabrication of devices with ad&#8208;hoc architectures. In this framework, it is of utter importance to harvest and transform light irradiation into high electric potential in&#160;specific area for driving functional dielectrics that respond to pure electric field. Here, a nano&#8208;fabrication technology has been devised featuring double self&#8208;alignment that is applied to construct zebra&#8208;like asymmetric heterojunction arrays. Such nanostructured composite, which covers a surface area of 5&#160;&#215;&#160;4&#160;mm2 and contains 500 periodic repeating units, is capable of photo generating voltages as high as 140&#160;V on a flexible substrate. This approach represents a leap over the traditional functionalization process based on simply embedding materials into devices by demonstrating the disruptive potential of integrating oriented nanoscale device components into meta&#8208;material.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Promoted Co&#8208;Production of Dihydroisoquinoline and H2O2 over Defective Zn3In2S6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;functional and defective Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst is developed for the simultaneous efficient photocatalytic co&#8208;syntheses of dihydroisoquinoline and H2O2, which shows the highest rate for both reactions up to date.








Abstract
One of the most sustainable and promising approaches for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production in a low&#8208;cost and environment&#8208;friendly way is photosynthesis, which, however, suffers from poor carrier utilization and low H2O2 productivity. The addition of proton donors such as isopropanol or ethanol can increase H2O2 production, which, unfortunately, will inevitably elevate the entire cost while wasting the oxidizing power of holes (h+). Herein, the tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs) is employed as a distinctive proton donor for the thermodynamically feasible and selective semi&#8208;dehydrogenation reaction to highly valuable dihydroisoquinolines (DHIQs), and meanwhile, to couple with and promote H2O2 generation in one photoredox reaction under the photocatalysis by dual&#8208;functional Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst. Surprisingly, the suitably defective Zn3In2S6 offers an excellent and near&#8208;stoichiometric co&#8208;production performance of H2O2 and DHIQs at unprecedentedly high rates of 66.4 and 62.1&#160;mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1 under visible light (&#955;&#160;&#8805; 400&#160;nm), respectively, which outperforms all the previously available reports even though sacrificial agents&#160;were&#160;employed in those reports. Additionally, photocatalytic redox reaction mechanism demonstrates that H2O2 can be generated through multiple pathways, highlighting the synergistic effect among ROS (&#183;O2&#8208; and 1O2), h+ and proton donor, which has been ignored in previous studies.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Wavelength Light&#8208;Responsive Metal&#8211;Phenolic Network&#8208;Based Microrobots for Reactive Species Scavenging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a hollow metal&#8211;phenolic network&#8208;based microrobot with spray&#8208;coated asymmetric capping is reported capable of moving under both near&#8208;infrared irradiation and ultraviolet irradiation without fuel. With multi&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;responsiveness, tunable size of the particles, and great reactive oxygen and nitrogen species scavenging capacity, the proposed microrobots can be ideal for future in vivo analytical sensing and medical treatment.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven microrobots with different propulsion mechanisms have attracted great attention in microrobot synthesis and applications. However, current systems rely heavily on precious metals, using a complex synthesis process and limited working wavelength. It is therefore of great interest to fabricate microrobots that can be driven by multi&#8208;wavelength irradiation and with simple components. Here, metal&#8211;phenolic network (MPN)&#8208;based microrobots are synthesized using a sacrificial polystyrene bead template and an extra capping is added to regulate their symmetry. The hollow MPN microrobots with different layers of capping are capable of moving under both near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, without fuel. The velocity of the microrobots under irradiation is altered by the thickness of the asymmetric capping and their motion could be manipulated remotely by switching the NIR or UV irradiation on and off. With light&#8208;driven mobility, the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) scavenging activity of the microrobots is significantly increased. Therefore, this proposed microrobot system provides a synthesis strategy to develop asymmetric light&#8208;navigated microrobots for future medical treatment with tunable structure, multi&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;responsive mobility, and great RONS scavenging capacity.

         <dc:description>
Integrating a coordination polymer catalyst consisting of Cu(I) and benzimidazole units linked via Cu(I)&#8208;imidazole coordination bonds in a cation exchange membrane&#8208;based membrane electrode assembly enables stable acetate electrosynthesis for 190&#160;h, while achieving direct collection of concentrated acetate, an average single&#8208;pass utilization of 50%, and an average acetate full&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 15% at 250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Upgrading carbon dioxide/monoxide to multi&#8208;carbon C2+ products using renewable electricity offers one route to more sustainable fuel and chemical production. One of the most appealing products is acetate, the profitable electrosynthesis of which demands a catalyst with higher efficiency. Here, a coordination polymer (CP) catalyst is reported that consists of Cu(I) and benzimidazole units linked via Cu(I)&#8208;imidazole coordination bonds, which enables selective reduction of CO to acetate with a 61% Faradaic efficiency at &#8722;0.59 volts versus the reversible hydrogen electrode at a current density of 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in flow cells. The catalyst is integrated in a cation exchange membrane&#8208;based membrane electrode assembly that enables stable acetate electrosynthesis for 190&#160;h, while achieving direct collection of concentrated acetate (3.3 molar) from the cathodic liquid stream, an average single&#8208;pass utilization of 50% toward CO&#8208;to&#8208;acetate conversion, and an average acetate full&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 15% at a current density of 250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Intracellular Glucose&#8208;Depriving Polymer Micelles for Antiglycolytic Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glucose&#8208;responsive polymer is designed, considering the unique metabolism of cancer cells. The polymer exhibits micellar&#8208;structure stability during blood circulation and accumulates in tumor tissues. Specific binding between the polymer and intracellular glucose induces glucose deprivation in tumor cells. Glucose metabolism is particularly inhibited; the lack of energy in tumor cells is intensified, leading to tumor suppression.








Abstract
A new anticancer strategy to exploit abnormal metabolism of cancer cells rather than to merely control the drug release or rearrange the tumor microenvironment is reported. An antiglycolytic amphiphilic polymer, designed considering the unique metabolism of cancer cells (Warburg effect) and aimed at the regulation of glucose metabolism, is synthesized through chemical conjugation between glycol chitosan (GC) and phenylboronic acid (PBA). GC&#8208;PBA derivatives form stable micellar structures under physiological conditions and respond to changes in glucose concentration. Once the micelles accumulate at the tumor site, intracellular glucose capture occurs, and the resultant energy deprivation through the inhibition of aerobic glycolysis remarkably suppresses tumor growth without significant side effects in vivo. This strategy highlights the need to develop safe and effective cancer treatment without the use of conventional anticancer drugs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Nanocrystalline Structures from Freestanding Oxide Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scientific exploration of nanomaterials has led to massive growth in understanding and applications of quantum materials at the nanoscale. A route for fabrication of nanocrystalline oxide structures of exceptional quality utilizing self&#8208;assembly of freestanding membranes transferred on appropriate substrates is presented. The microstructure of the nanocrystals exhibits exceptional quality, characterized by a pristine crystal structure and uniform stoichiometry after self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
The exploration of crystalline nanostructures enhances the understanding of quantum phenomena occurring in spatially confined quantum matter and may lead to functional materials with unforeseen applications. A novel route to fabricating nanocrystalline oxide structures of exceptional quality is presented. This is achieved by utilizing a self&#8208;assembly process of ultrathin membranes composed of the desired oxide. The thermally induced self&#8208;assembly of nanocrystalline structures is driven by dewetting the oxide membranes once they are lifted off and transferred onto sapphire surfaces. In three successive steps, the process provides nanovoids, nanowires, and nanocrystals. Regardless of substrate orientation, the nanostructures are highly anisotropic in shape due to material retraction favoring low&#8208;index crystalline lattice directions of the membranes. The orientation of the nanostructures is provided precisely by the crystal lattice of the transferred membrane. The microstructure of the nanocrystals exhibits exceptional quality, characterized by a pristine crystal structure and uniform stoichiometry, both maintained all the way down to the well&#8208;developed crystalline facets. The demonstrated self&#8208;assembly process holds the potential to improve the understanding of surface diffusion phenomena at the interface of materials, which is important for advancing epitaxial growth technology and paves the way to fabricating crystalline nanostructures by the transfer and self&#8208;assembly of membranes.

         <title>HACS: Helical Auxetic Yarn Capacitive Strain Sensors with Sensitivity Beyond the Theoretical Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Capacitive strain sensors are theoretically limited in their sensitivity. In this work, stretchable and flexible strain sensors are fabricated using a helical auxetic yarn structure providing access to auxetic character in the fiber form. The helical auxetic capacitive sensors (HACS) are able to access sensitivity beyond the theoretical limit, determined to be because of an engulfment phenomenon that occurs as a result of the materials employed and the auxetic character.








Abstract
The development of flexible strain sensors over the past decade has focused on accessing high strain percentages and high sensitivity (i.e., gauge factors). Strain sensors that employ capacitance as the electrical signal to correlate to strain are typically restricted in sensitivity because of the Poisson effect. By employing auxetic structures, the limits of sensitivity for capacitive sensors have been exceeded, which has improved the competitiveness of this modality of sensing. In this work, the first employment of helical auxetic yarns as capacitive sensors is presented. It is found that the response of the helical auxetic yarn capacitive sensors (termed as HACS) is dependent on the two main fabrication variables&#8212;the ratio of diameters and the helical wrapping length. Depending on these variables, sensors that respond to strain with increasing or decreasing capacitance values can be obtained. A greater auxetic character results in larger sensitivities accessible at smaller strains&#8212;a characteristic that is not commonly found when accessing high gauge factors. In addition, the highest sensitivity for auxetic capacitive sensors reported thus far is obtained. A mechanism of sensor response that explains both the variable capacitance response and the high gauge factors obtained experimentally is proposed.

         <title>Fully Optical in Operando Investigation of Ambient Condition Electrical Switching in MoS2 Nanodevices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically thin MoS2 electrical switches are characterized for the first time in operando and in ambient conditions through a non&#8208;invasive spectroscopy&#8208;based method. The study sheds light on the &#8211; controversial and still debated &#8211; dynamics driving the switching mechanism. It reveals volatile metallic filaments percolating interatomic spacing in MoS2 and stresses the impact of transfer residues on the electrical performance of switches.








Abstract
MoS2 nanoswitches have shown superb ultralow switching energies without excessive leakage currents. However, the debate about the origin and volatility of electrical switching is unresolved due to the lack of adequate nanoimaging of devices in operando. Here, three optical techniques are combined to perform the first noninvasive in situ characterization of nanosized MoS2 devices. This study reveals volatile threshold resistive switching due to the intercalation of metallic atoms from electrodes directly between Mo and S atoms, without the assistance of sulfur vacancies. A &#8220;semi&#8208;memristive&#8221; effect driven by an organic adlayer adjacent to MoS2 is observed, which suggests that nonvolatility can be achieved by careful interface engineering. These findings provide a crucial understanding of nanoprocess in vertically biased MoS2 nanosheets, which opens new routes to conscious engineering and optimization of 2D electronics.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Reconstruction of Conductive Filaments in HfOx&#8208;Based Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductive filaments (CFs) with different morphologies after forming, set, and reset operations are clearly revealed in HfOx&#8208;based memristors by the 3D reconstruction of c&#8208;AFM technique. Multiple conductive filaments are successfully observed in the devices with three different resistive states. The rupture location of CFs after reset is also observed clearly.








Abstract
HfOx&#8208;based memristor has been studied extensively as one of the most promising memories for the excellent nonvolatile data storage and computing&#8208;in&#8208;memory capabilities. However, the resistive switching mechanism, relying on the formation and rupture of conductive filaments (CFs) during device operations, is still under debate. In this work, the CFs with different morphologies after different operations&#8212;forming, set, and reset&#8212;are clearly revealed for the first time by 3D reconstruction of conductive atomic force microscopy (c&#8208;AFM) images. Intriguingly, multiple CFs are successfully observed in HfOx&#8208;based memristor devices with three different resistive states. CFs after forming, set, and reset exhibit the typical morphologies of hourglass, inverted&#8208;cone, and short&#8208;cone, respectively. The rupture location of CFs after the reset operation is also observed clearly. These findings reveal the microscopic behaviors underlying the resistive switching, which could pave the road to design and optimize oxide&#8208;based memristors for both memory and computing applications.

         <title>Dissolvable Self&#8208;Locking Microneedle Patches Integrated with Immunomodulators for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
An advanced projection micro&#8208;stereolithography 3D printer&#8208;based self&#8208;locking dissolvable microneedle is presented as a mass&#8208;producible and cost&#8208;effective transdermal drug delivery platform for precise microdose delivery of drugs in a minimally invasive manner. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a novel combination immunotherapy approach proposed to improve melanoma treatment efficacy shows a significantly higher efficacy when delivered via self&#8208;locking microneedles than intratumoral injection.








Abstract
Advancements in micro&#8208;resolution 3D printers have significantly facilitated the development of highly complex mass&#8208;producible drug delivery platforms. Conventionally, due to the limitations of micro&#8208;milling machineries, dissolvable microneedles (MNs) are mainly fabricated in cone&#8208;shaped geometry with limited drug delivery accuracy. Herein, to overcome the limitations of conventional MNs, a novel projection micro&#8208;stereolithography 3D printer&#8208;based self&#8208;locking MN for precise skin insertion, adhesion, and transcutaneous microdose drug delivery is presented. The geometry of self&#8208;locking MN consists of a sharp skin&#8208;penetrating tip, a wide skin interlocking body, and a narrow base with mechanical supports fabricated over a flexible hydrocolloid patch to improve the accuracy of skin penetration into irregular surfaces. Melanoma, a type of skin cancer, is selected as the model for the investigation of self&#8208;locking MNs due to its irregular and uneven surface. In vivo immunotherapy efficacy is evaluated by integrating SD&#8208;208, a novel transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946; (TGF&#8208;&#946;) inhibitor that suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of tumors, and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 (aPD&#8208;L1 Ab), an immune checkpoint inhibitor that induces T cell&#8208;mediated tumor cell death, into self&#8208;locking MNs and comparing them with intratumoral injection. Evaluation of (aPD&#8208;L1 Ab)/SD&#8208;208 delivery effectiveness in B16F10 melanoma&#8208;bearing mice model confirms significantly improved dose efficacy of self&#8208;locking MNs compared with intratumoral injection.

         <title>Holographically Activatable Nanoprobe via Glutathione/Albumin&#8208;Mediated Exponential Signal Amplification for High&#8208;Contrast Tumor Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A holographically activatable nanoprobe caging manganese tetraoxide is reported for tumor&#8208;selective contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging, which is accomplished through both glutathione/albumin&#8208;mediated cascade signal amplification in tumors and rapid elimination in normal tissues.








Abstract
Glutathione (GSH)&#8208;activatable probes hold great promise for in vivo cancer imaging, but are restricted by their dependence on non&#8208;selective intracellular GSH enrichment and uncontrollable background noise. Here, a holographically activatable nanoprobe caging manganese tetraoxide is shown for tumor&#8208;selective contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) through cooperative GSH/albumin&#8208;mediated cascade signal amplification in tumors and rapid elimination in normal tissues. Once targeting tumors, the endocytosed nanoprobe effectively senses the lysosomal microenvironment to undergo instantaneous decomposition into Mn2+ with threshold GSH concentration of &#8776; 0.12&#160;mm for brightening MRI signals, thus achieving high contrast tumor imaging and flexible monitoring of GSH&#8208;relevant cisplatin resistance during chemotherapy. Upon efficient up&#8208;regulation of extracellular GSH in&#160;tumor via exogenous injection, the relaxivity&#8208;silent interstitial nanoprobe remarkably evolves into Mn2+ that are further captured/retained and re&#8208;activated into ultrahigh&#8208;relaxivity&#8208;capable complex by stromal albumin in the tumor, and simultaneously allows the renal clearance of off&#8208;targeted nanoprobe in the form of Mn2+ via lymphatic vessels for suppressing background noise to distinguish tiny liver metastasis. These findings demonstrate the concept of holographic tumor activation via both tumor GSH/albumin&#8208;mediated cascade signal amplification and simultaneous background suppression for precise tumor malignancy detection, surveillance, and surgical guidance.

         <title>Cooperative Electronic Structure Modulator of Fe Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalyst for High Energy and Long Cycle Li&#8211;S Pouch Cell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of electron exchangeable binding sites comprising thiophene S and oxidized S, adjacent to Fe single atom electrocatalysts, improves Li2S redox kinetics by modulating d&#8208;orbital level of Fe single atom via electron exchange. These specially designed electrocatalysts enable realization of a 1 A h level Li&#8211;S pouch cell with high gravimetric energy density and long cycle stability.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy and long cycle lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) pouch cells are limited by the insufficient capacities and stabilities of their cathodes under practical electrolyte/sulfur (E/S), electrolyte/capacity (E/C), and negative/positive (N/P) ratios. Herein, an advanced cathode comprising highly active Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is reported to form 320.2&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 multistacked Li&#8211;S pouch cells with total capacity of &#8776;1 A h level, satisfying low E/S (3.0), E/C (2.8), and N/P (2.3) ratios and high sulfur loadings (8.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). The high&#8208;activity Fe SAC is designed by manipulating its local environments using electron&#8208;exchangeable binding (EEB) sites. Introducing EEB sites comprising two different types of S species, namely, thiophene&#8208;like&#8208;S (&#8211;S) and oxidized&#8208;S (&#8211;SO2), adjacent to Fe SACs promotes the kinetics of the Li2S redox reaction by providing additional binding sites and modulating the Fe d&#8208;orbital levels via electron exchange with Fe. The &#8211;S donates the electrons to the Fe SACs, whereas &#8211;SO2 withdraws electrons from the Fe SACs. Thus, the Fe d&#8208;orbital energy level can be modulated by the different &#8211;SO2/&#8211;S ratios of the EEB site, controlling the electron donating/withdrawing characteristics. This desirable electrocatalysis is maximized by the intimate contact of the Fe SACs with the S species, which are confined together in porous carbon.

         <title>Modular Approach to Creating Functionalized Surface Arrays of Molecular Qubits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method to create 2D arrays of molecular spin qubits is reported. The quantum properties are retained and the quantum coherence times are improved compared to bulk conditions.








Abstract
The quest for developing quantum technologies is driven by the promise of exponentially faster computations, ultrahigh performance sensing, and achieving thorough understanding of many&#8208;particle quantum systems. Molecular spins are excellent qubit candidates because they feature long coherence times, are widely tunable through chemical synthesis, and can be interfaced with other quantum platforms such as superconducting qubits. A present challenge for molecular spin qubits is their integration in quantum devices, which requires arranging them in thin films or monolayers on surfaces. However, clear proof of the survival of quantum properties of molecular qubits on surfaces has not been reported so far. Furthermore, little is known about the change in spin dynamics of molecular qubits going from the bulk to monolayers. Here, a versatile bottom&#8208;up method is reported to arrange molecular qubits as functional groups of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) on surfaces, combining molecular self&#8208;organization and click chemistry. Coherence times of up to 13 &#181;s demonstrate that qubit properties are maintained or even enhanced in the monolayer.

         <title>Solvation and Interfacial Engineering Enable &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C Operation of Graphite/NCM Batteries at Energy Density over 270 Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic barriers related to Li+ transport at low temperatures is knocked down by formulating a weakly&#8208;solvated electrolyte containing Na+ as a hetero&#8208;cation additive, where a Li&#8208;Na hybrid SEI is identified to favor Li+ migration through the multiple LiF/NaF grain boundaries. As such, the electrolyte affords a 2 Ah, 270&#160;Wh&#160;Kg&#8722;1 graphite/NCM523 pouch cell with discharge capacity of 108.7 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.








Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) that can operate under low temperature (LT) conditions are essential for applications in orbital missions, subsea areas, and electric vehicles. Unfortunately, severe capacity loss is witnessed due to tremendous kinetic barriers that emerge at LT. Herein, to surmount such kinetic limitations, a low dielectric environment is tamed throughout the bulk electrolyte, which efficaciously brought the Li+ desolvation energy down to 30.76 kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1. At the meantime, the adoption of sodium cations (Na+) is proposed as a hetero&#8208;cation additive, and a Li&#8208;Na hybrid and fluoride&#8208;rich interphase is further identified via preferential reduction of Na+&#8208;(solvent/anion) clusters, which is found to efficiently facilitate Li+ migration through the LiF/NaF grain boundaries. Based on a N/P ratio of 1.1, the graphite/LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM) full cell (cathode loading of &#8776;18.5&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) delivers a capacity as high as 125.1 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 under &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C with prolonged cycling to 100 cycles. Finally, a 270&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 graphite/NCM pouch cell is assembled, which affords a discharge capacity of 108.7 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 under &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C during the initial cycles. With an eye to both fundamental and practical aspects, this work will propel additional advancements and allow LIBs to fill more roles under extreme operation temperatures than ever before.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Reaction Heterogeneity During Calcination of Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature calcination used for Li&#8208;ion battery particle synthesis is chemically imaged. Various parallel and serial combinations of heterogeneous reactions, such as the thermal aerobic/anaerobic decomposition, Li2CO3 decomposition, Li2&#8208;O insertion/diffusion, and O2 insertion/diffusion, prevail during the calcination reaction. The anaerobic decomposition of the precursor core slows down Li2&#8208;O incorporation.








Abstract
During solid&#8208;state calcination, with increasing temperature, materials undergo complex phase transitions with heterogeneous solid&#8208;state reactions and mass transport. Precise control of the calcination chemistry is therefore crucial for synthesizing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides (LiNi1&#8208;x&#8208;yCoxMnyO2, NRNCM) as cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Although the battery performance depends on the chemical heterogeneity during NRNCM calcination, it has not yet been elucidated. Herein, through synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray, mass spectrometry microscopy, and structural analyses, it is revealed that the temperature&#8208;dependent reaction kinetics, the diffusivity of solid&#8208;state lithium sources, and the ambient oxygen control the local chemical compositions of the reaction intermediates within a calcined particle. Additionally, it is found that the variations in the reducing power of the transition metals (i.e., Ni, Co, and Mn) determine the local structures at the nanoscale. The investigation of the reaction mechanism via imaging analysis provides valuable information for tuning the calcination chemistry and developing high&#8208;energy/power density lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>In Situ Absorption Characterization Guided Slot&#8208;Die&#8208;Coated High&#8208;Performance Large&#8208;Area Flexible Organic Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ absorption measurement is used to investigate the aggregation behavior of acceptors during slot&#8208;die&#8208;coating. The 1 cm2 flexible device can reach a power conversion efficiency of 13.70%, with excellent shelf stability and upscaling ability. The connected modules (180 cm2) can effectively power a smartphone, showing great potential for future applications.








Abstract
Slot&#8208;die coating is recognized as the most compatible method for the roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) processing of large&#8208;area flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the photovoltaic performance of large&#8208;area flexible OSC lags significantly behind that of traditional spin&#8208;coating devices. In this work, two acceptors, Qx&#8208;1 and Qx&#8208;2, show quite different film&#8208;formation kinetics in the slot&#8208;die coating process. In situ absorption spectroscopy indicates that the excessive crystallinity of Qx&#8208;2 provides early phase separation and early aggregation, resulting in oversized crystal domains. Consequently, the PM6:Qx&#8208;1&#8208;based 1&#160;cm2 flexible device exhibits an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.70%, which is the best performance among the slot&#8208;die&#8208;coated flexible devices; in contrast, the PM6:Qx&#8208;2 blend shows a pretty poor efficiency, which is lower than 1%. Moreover, the 30 cm2 modules based on PM6:Qx&#8208;1, containing six 5 cm2 sub&#8208;cells, exhibit a PCE of 12.20%. After being stored in a glove box for over 6000&#160;h, the PCE remains at 103% of its initial values, indicating excellent shelf stability. Therefore, these results show a promising future strategy for the upscaling fabrication of flexible large&#8208;area OSCs.

         <title>Over 19% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells by Regulating Multidimensional Intermolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular interactions are ubiquitous and elusive in organic solar cells. Herein, the complicated relationship between multidimensional intermolecular interactions in active layers and photovoltaic performance is disclosed. The results show that complex interactions are critical to synergistically regulating comprehensive properties, including molecular assembly, stacking orientations, charge transport, and morphology management, which helps to achieve an efficiency over 19% in ternary devices.








Abstract
Research on organic solar cells (OSCs) has progressed through material innovation and device engineering. However, well&#8208;known and ubiquitous intermolecular interactions, and particularly their synergistic effects, have received little attention. Herein, the complicated relationship between photovoltaic conversion and multidimensional intermolecular interactions in the active layers is investigated. These interactions are dually regulated by side&#8208;chain isomerization and end&#8208;cap engineering of the acceptors. The phenylalkyl featured acceptors (LA&#8208;series) exhibit stronger crystallinity with preferential face&#8208;on interactions relative to the alkylphenyl attached isomers (ITIC&#8208;series). In addition, the PM6&#160;and LA&#8208;series acceptors exhibit moderate donor/acceptor interactions compared to those of the strongly interacting PM6/ITIC&#8208;series pairs, which helps to enhance phase separation and charge transport. Consequently, the output efficiencies of all LA series acceptors are over 14%. Moreover, LA&#8208;series acceptors show appropriate compatibility, host/guest interactions, and crystallinity relationships with BTP&#8208;eC9, thereby leading to uniform and well&#8208;organized &#8220;alloy&#8208;like&#8221; mixed phases. In particular, the highly crystalline LA23&#160;further optimizes multiple interactions and ternary microstructures, which results in a high efficiency of 19.12%. Thus, these results highlight the importance of multidimensional intermolecular interactions in the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.

Drug Delivery
Timely administration of emergency therapeutics is critical for patients with sudden&#8208;onset illnesses. In article number 2208648, Haojian Lu, Jicheng Yu, Zhen Gu, and co&#8208;workers develop an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)&#8208;mediated first&#8208;aid system (uFAST), which enables the autonomous administration of emergency therapeutics via a UAV without the involvement of an additional or conscious person to achieve timely first aid.

Capacitive Strain Sensors
In article number 2209321, Tyler J. Cuthbert, Carlo Menon, and co&#8208;workers present a novel capacitive strain sensor that accesses sensitivity beyond the theoretical limit. The helical auxetic capacitive sensor (HACS) employs a two&#8208;component yarn structure allowing tuneable sensitivity and accessible strain ranges. The HACS sensitivity is found to be from an engulfment phenomenon, which is predicted with a geometric model and analyzed by X&#8208;ray &#956;CT scanning.

Nonlinear Hall Effect
As the heart and with the tremendous applications of terahertz technology, photodetectors suffer from considerable drawbacks imposed by weak optical absorption, and inefficient charge&#8208;separation mechanisms. In article number 2209557, Antonio Politano, Lin Wang, and co&#8208;workers report the nonlinear Hall effect operating at terahertz frequencies within strong spin&#8208;polarized topological states in CoTe2 without invoking any semiconductor junctions or bias voltage, opening up fascinating route toward quantum wavefunction engineering.

Cathode Calcination
In article number 2207076, Sugeun Jo, Keeyoung Jung, Jongwoo Lim, and co&#8208;workers show how solid&#8208;state reaction heterogeneity affects the high&#8208;temperature calcination of Li&#8208;ion battery particles. Various parallel and serial combinations of the thermal (an)aerobic decomposition and Li2&#8211;O insertion/diffusion are chemically imaged during the calcination reaction. The cover image features the calcination intermediates that facilitate the surface Li2&#8211;O incorporation, which is impeded by the anaerobically decomposed phase in the particle core.

Aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) and fiber complement each other for making remarkble progress in smart flexible materials. This article provides a comprehensive and fundamental overview of the basic concepts, structure&#8208;function relationship, seminal and recent studies, and the potential directions for future developments regarding AIEgen&#8208;based fiber from the view of mesoscale and macroscale.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) have recently been developed at a tremendous pace in the area of organic luminescent materials by virtue of their superior properties. However, the practical applications of AIEgens still face the challenge of transforming AIEgens from molecules into materials. Till now, many AIEgens have been integrated into fiber, endowing the fiber with prominent fluorescence and/or photosensitizing capacities. AIEgens and fiber complement each other for making progress in flexible smart materials, in which the utilization of AIEgens creates new application possibilities for fiber, and the fiber provides an excellent carrier for AIEgens towards realizing the conversion from molecule to materials and an ideal platform to research the aggregate state of AIEgens in mesoscale and macroscale. This review begins with a brief summary of the recent advances related to some typical AIEgens with various functions and the technology for the fabrication of AIEgen&#8208;functionalized fiber. The most representative applications are then highlighted by focusing on energy conversion, personal protective equipment, biomedical, sensor, and fluorescence&#8208;related fields. Finally, the challenges, opportunities, and tendencies in future development are discussed in detail. This review hopes to inspire innovation in AIEgens and fiber from the view of mesoscale and macroscale.

         <title>Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers: From Light&#8208;Controlled Small Molecules to Smart Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control over supramolecular interactions is an important part of the toolbox for developing functional materials. The design of supramolecular polymers with light&#8208;triggered molecules allows remote control of supramolecular polymers and materials with high spatiotemporal precision. Here, a perspective review of various approaches and major advances toward photoresponsive supramolecular polymers with controlled functions is presented.








Abstract
Photoresponsive supramolecular polymers are well&#8208;organized assemblies based on highly oriented and reversible noncovalent interactions containing photosensitive molecules as (co&#8208;)monomers. They have attracted increasing interest in smart materials and dynamic systems with precisely controllable functions, such as light&#8208;driven soft actuators, photoresponsive fluorescent anticounterfeiting and light&#8208;triggered electronic devices. The present review discusses light&#8208;activated molecules used in photoresponsive supramolecular polymers with their main photo&#8208;induced changes, e.g., geometry, dipole moment, and chirality. Based on these distinct changes, supramolecular polymers formed by light&#8208;activated molecules exhibit photoresponsive disassembly and reassembly. As a consequence, photo&#8208;induced supramolecular polymerization, &#8220;depolymerization,&#8221; and regulation of the lengths and topologies are observed. Moreover, the light&#8208;controlled functions of supramolecular polymers, such as actuation, emission, and chirality transfer along length scales, are highlighted. Furthermore, a perspective on challenges and future opportunities is presented. Besides the challenge of moving from harmful UV light to visible/near IR light avoiding fatigue, and enabling biomedical applications, future opportunities include light&#8208;controlled supramolecular actuators with helical motion, light&#8208;modulated information transmission, optically recyclable materials, and multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular systems.

         <title>Unraveling the Plasma Protein Corona by Ultrasonic Cavitation Augments Active&#8208;Transporting of Liposome in Solid Tumor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transcytosis&#8208;targeting peptide&#8208;decorated reconfigurable liposome (LPGL) is capable of ultrasound&#8208;induced liposomal reassembly and protein&#8208;corona decortication. Ultrasound irradiation induces size&#8208;transformation of the LPGL and decorticates the surface protein corona by lipid membrane reassembly, whereby the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization is regained, ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis is initiated, and efficient tumor accumulation and penetration is achieved, leading to potent antitumor activity.








Abstract
Ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated targeted drug delivery has been widely recognized as a promising strategy for improving the clinical efficacy of&#160;nanomedicines but is attenuated by the binding of plasma protein on the surface of nanoparticles to form a protein corona. Here, it is shown that ultrasonic cavitation can be used to unravel surface plasma coronas on liposomal nanoparticles through ultrasound (US)&#8208;induced liposomal reassembly. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the method, transcytosis&#8208;targeting&#8208;peptide&#8208;decorated reconfigurable liposomes (LPGLs) loaded with gemcitabine (GEM) and perfluoropentane (PFP) are developed for cancer&#8208;targeted therapy. In the blood circulation, the targeting peptides are deactivated by the plasma corona and lose their targeting capability. Once they reach tumor blood vessels, US irradiation induces transformation of the LPGLs from nanodrops into microbubbles via liquid&#8211;gas phase transition and decorticate the surface corona by reassembly of the lipid membrane. The activated liposomes regain the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization, initiate ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis, achieve efficient tumor accumulation and penetration, and lead to potent antitumor activity in multiple tumor models of patient&#8208;derived tumor xenografts. This study presents an effective strategy to tackle the fluid biological barriers of the protein corona and develop transcytosis&#8208;targeting liposomes for active tumor transport and efficient cancer therapy.

         <title>Realizing Highly Efficient Sonodynamic Bactericidal Capability through the Phonon&#8211;Electron Coupling Effect Using Two&#8208;Dimensional Catalytic Planar Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D catalytic planar defects have been rationally designed and engineered for reversing the ultrasonic silence of Ti3C2, dramatically realizing the highly efficient sonodynamic bactericidal therapy. It is unveiled that the electron's origin, electron transfer, and the visible O2&#160;activation pathway triggered by ultrasound are attributed to the phonon&#8211;electron coupling effect.








Abstract
Conferring catalytic defects in sonosensitizers is of paramount importance in reinforcing sonodynamic therapy. However, the formation of such 0D defects is governed by the Schottky defect principle. Herein, 2D catalytic planar defects are designed within Ti3C2&#160;sheets to address this challenge. These specific planar slip dislocations with abundant Ti3+ species (Ti3C2&#8208;SD(Ti3+)) can yield surface&#8208;bound O due to the effective activation of O2, thus resulting in a substantial amount of 1O2&#160;generation and the 99.72%&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03% bactericidal capability subject to ultrasound (US) stimulation. It is discovered that the 2D catalytic planar defects can intervene in electron transfer through the phonon drag effect&#8212;a coupling effect between surface electrons and US&#8208;triggered phonons&#8212;that simultaneously contributes to a dramatic decrease in O2&#160;activation energy from 1.65&#160;to 0.06&#160;eV. This design has achieved a qualitative leap in which the US catalytic site has transformed from 0D to 2D. Moreover, it is revealed that the electron origin, electron transfer, and visible O2&#160;activation pathway triggered by US can be attributed to the phonon&#8211;electron coupling effect.

     alt="Realizing Highly Efficient Sonodynamic Bactericidal Capability through the Phonon&#8211;Electron Coupling Effect Using Two-Dimensional Catalytic Planar Defects"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2D catalytic planar defects have been rationally designed and engineered for reversing the ultrasonic silence of Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, dramatically realizing the highly efficient sonodynamic bactericidal therapy. It is unveiled that the electron's origin, electron transfer, and the visible O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;activation pathway triggered by ultrasound are attributed to the phonon&#8211;electron coupling effect.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conferring catalytic defects in sonosensitizers is of paramount importance in reinforcing sonodynamic therapy. However, the formation of such 0D defects is governed by the Schottky defect principle. Herein, 2D catalytic planar defects are designed within Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;sheets to address this challenge. These specific planar slip dislocations with abundant Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; species (Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-SD(Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;)) can yield surface-bound O due to the effective activation of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thus resulting in a substantial amount of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;generation and the 99.72%&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03% bactericidal capability subject to ultrasound (US) stimulation. It is discovered that the 2D catalytic planar defects can intervene in electron transfer through the phonon drag effect&#8212;a coupling effect between surface electrons and US-triggered phonons&#8212;that simultaneously contributes to a dramatic decrease in O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;activation energy from 1.65&#160;to 0.06&#160;eV. This design has achieved a qualitative leap in which the US catalytic site has transformed from 0D to 2D. Moreover, it is revealed that the electron origin, electron transfer, and visible O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;activation pathway triggered by US can be attributed to the phonon&#8211;electron coupling effect. After coating with neutrophil membrane (NM) proteins, the NM-Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-SD(Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) sheets further demonstrate a 6-log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;reduction in methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; burden in the infected bony tissue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Stretchable and Biocompatible Wrinkled Nanoclay&#8208;Composite Hydrogel With Enhanced Sensing Capability for Precise Detection of Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bioinspired nanoclay&#8208;composite wrinkled hydrogel sensor is developed with excellent mechanical and biocompatible properties and high and reliable sensing capacity due to the structural&#8211;mechanical&#8211;electrical integrity of the wrinkle micropattern and nanoclay&#8208;reinforced interpenetrating crosslinked network. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, this hydrogel sensor can accurately localize the region where myocardial infarction occurs, showing promise for real&#8208;time monitoring of pathological heart tissue.








Abstract
It is challenging to balance high biocompability with good mechanical&#8211;electrical sensing performance, especially when triggering inflammatory stress response after in vivo implantation. Herein, a bioinspired wrinkle&#8208;reinforced adaptive nanoclay&#8208;interlocked soft strain&#8208;sensor based on a highly stretchable and elastic ionic&#8208;conductive hydrogel is reported. This novel nanoclay&#8208;composite hydrogel exhibits excellent tensile properties and high sensing capacity with steady and reliable sensing performance due to the structural&#8211;mechanical&#8211;electrical integrity of the nanoclay crosslinked and nano&#8208;reinforced interpenetrating network. The incorporation of amphiphilic ions provides the hydrogel with significant protein resistance, reducing its non&#8208;specific adsorption to proteins upon implantation, improving its biosafety as an implanted device, and maintaining the authenticity of the sensing results. Based on the revealed sensing enhanced mechanism based on hierarchical ordered structures as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, this hydrogel sensor is demonstrated to be able to&#160;accurately localize the region where myocardial infarction occurs and may become a novel strategy for real&#8208;time monitoring of pathological changes in heart disease.

         <title>Synergistic Surface Modification of Tin&#8211;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic surface modification of mixed Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite films by the combination of piperazine and C60 pyrrolidine tris&#8208;acid realizes narrow&#8208;bandgap solar cells with power conversion efficiencies up to 22.7% and substantially elongated stability.








Abstract
Interfaces in thin&#8208;film photovoltaics play a pivotal role in determining device efficiency and longevity. In this work, the top surface treatment of mixed tin&#8211;lead (&#8776;1.26&#160;eV) halide perovskite films for p&#8211;i&#8211;n solar cells is studied. Charge extraction is promoted by treating the perovskite surface with piperazine. This compound reacts with the organic cations at the perovskite surface, modifying the surface structure and tuning the interfacial energy level alignment. In addition, the combined treatment with C60 pyrrolidine tris&#8208;acid (CPTA) reduces hysteresis and leads to efficiencies up to 22.7%, with open&#8208;circuit voltage values reaching 0.90&#160;V, &#8776;92% of the radiative limit for the bandgap of this material. The modified cells also show superior stability, with unencapsulated cells retaining 96% of their initial efficiency after &gt;2000 h of storage in N2 and encapsulated cells retaining 90% efficiency after &gt;450 h of storage in air. Intriguingly, CPTA preferentially binds to Sn2+ sites at film surface over Pb2+ due to the energetically favored exposure of the former, according to first&#8208;principles calculations. This work provides new insights into the surface chemistry of perovskite films in terms of their structural, electronic, and defect characteristics and this knowledge is used to fabricate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solar cells.

         <title>Magnetic Skyrmion Transistor Gated with Voltage&#8208;Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor is presented using spatially uniform voltage&#8208;controlled magnetic anisotropy. A gate operation can control the translational motion of a magnetic skyrmion. Utilizing the gate&#8208;controlled skyrmion motion technique, the authors expect various skyrmion logic devices to be demonstrated in the future.








Abstract
The paradigm shift of information carriers from charge to spin has long been awaited in modern electronics. The invention of the spin&#8208;information transistor is expected to be an essential building block for the future development of spintronics. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor working at room temperature, which has never been demonstrated experimentally, is introduced. With the spatially uniform control of magnetic anisotropy, the shape and topology of a skyrmion when passing the controlled area can be maintained. The findings will open a new route toward the design and realization of skyrmion&#8208;based spintronic devices in the near future.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency and Mechanically Robust All&#8208;Polymer Organic Photovoltaic Cells Enabled by Optimized Fibril Network Morphology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By synthesizing a high weight&#8208;average molecular weight polymer donor PBDB&#8208;TF and combining a ternary blending strategy, favorable phase separation morphology featuring more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance can be attained. A maximum power conversion efficiency of 18.2% (certified value of 17.7%) with excellent mechanical properties in all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic cells is demonstrated.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells possessing high photovoltaic performance and mechanical robustness are promising candidates for flexible wearable devices. However, developing photoactive materials with good mechanical properties and photovoltaic performance so far remains challenging. In this work, a polymer donor PBDB&#8208;TF with a high weight&#8208;average molecular weight (Mw) is introduced to enable highly efficient all&#8208;polymer OPV cells featuring excellent mechanical reliability. By incorporating the high&#8208;Mw PBDB&#8208;TF as a third component into the PBQx&#8208;TF:PY&#8208;IT blend, the bulk heterojunction morphology is finely tuned with a more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, affording efficient pathways for charge transport as well as mechanical stress dissipation. Hence, all&#8208;polymer OPV cells based on the ternary blend film demonstrate a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.2% with an outstanding fill factor of 0.796. The flexible OPV cell delivers a decent PCE of 16.5% with high mechanical stability. These results present a promising strategy to address the mechanical properties and boost the photovoltaic performance of all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.

These results present a promising strategy to address the mechanical properties and boost the photovoltaic performance of all-polymer OPV cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Switchable&#8208;Wettability Surfaces for Multi&#8208;Path Directional Transportation of Droplets and Subaqueous Bubbles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D dumbbell&#8208;patterned functional surface featured by switchable wettability is proposed to achieve the multi&#8208;path parallel directional transportation of both water droplets and subaqueous bubbles. This programmable, easy&#8208;fabricable, highly&#8208;efficient, and cost&#8208;effective fluidic system with strong robustness against structural defects is ready for versatile fluid transportation supporting both liquid&#8208; and gas&#8208;phase matters.








Abstract
Conventional engineered surfaces for fluid manipulation are hindered by the set wettability, and thus they can only achieve spontaneous transport of single&#8208;phase fluid, namely liquid or gas. Moreover, fluid transport systems that are robust to path defects have yet to be fully explored. Here, unprecedentedly, a universal wettability switching strategy is developed for achieving programmable directional transport of both droplets and subaqueous bubbles on a dumbbell&#8208;patterned functional surface (DPFS), featuring in strong robustness, high efficiency, and effective cost. By tuning the superwettability of DPFS through octadecyltrichlorosilane treatment and ultraviolet&#8208;C selective irradiation, the transport fluid can alternate between liquid and gas. The material's switchable superwettability regulates the fluid directed dynamics within the confined pattern, in which the sustaining fluid propelling relies on the surface energy difference between the starting and terminal sites. This enables the construction of multiple channels, which works synergistically with ultralow&#8208;volume&#8208;loss transport to impart the fluidic system with strong robustness against path defects. Underlying the completion of complex microfluidics tasks, spatially&#8208;selective cooling devices and subaqueous gas microreactors are successfully demonstrated. This energy&#8208;consumption&#8208;free fluid transport system opens a new avenue for on&#8208;chip programmable fluid manipulation, promoting innovative applications requiring rational control of two&#8208;phase fluid transport.

         <title>Efficient Red Light Emitting Diodes Based on a Zero&#8208;Dimensional Organic Antimony Halide Hybrid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly luminescent zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic antimony bromide hybrid containing semiconducting organic cation is developed for the first time, with which electrically driven red light emitting diodes (LEDs) are fabricated to exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.12%, a peak luminance of 5957&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a current efficiency of 14.2 cd A&#8722;1.








Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have recently emerged as a new class of light emitting materials with exceptional color tunability. While near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (PLQEs) are routinely obtained for a large number of 0D OMHHs, it remains challenging to apply them as emitter for electrically driven light emitting diodes (LEDs), largely due to the low conductivity of wide bandgap organic cations. Here, the development of a new OMHH, triphenyl(9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl) phosphonium antimony bromide (TPPcarzSbBr4), as emitter for efficient LEDs, which consists of semiconducting organic cations (TPPcarz+) and light emitting antimony bromide anions (Sb2Br82&#8722;), is reported. By replacing one of the phenyl groups in a well&#8208;known tetraphenylphosphonium cation (TPP+) with an electroactive phenylcarbazole group, a semiconducting TPPcarz+ cation is developed for the preparation of red emitting 0D TPPcarzSbBr4 single crystals with a high PLQE of 93.8%. With solution processed TPPcarzSbBr4 thin films (PLQE of 86.1%) as light emitting layer, red LEDs are fabricated to exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.12%, a peak luminance of 5957&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a current efficiency of 14.2&#160;cd A&#8722;1, which are the best values reported to date for electroluminescence devices based on 0D OMHHs.

         <title>Construction of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films via Crosslinking&#8208;Induced Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small clusters in the early growth steps of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be stabilized by modulators to form fluidic precursors (denoted as preMOFs) with good processibility. Then, the removal of solvents and modulators will trigger the crosslinking of preMOFs and lead to the formation of continuous MOF films.








Abstract
The construction of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films is a crucial step for integrating them into technical applications. However, due to the crystallization nature, it is difficult to grow most MOFs spontaneously or process them into films. Here, a convenient strategy is demonstrated for constructing MOF films by using modulators to achieve homogeneous assembly of MOF clusters. Small clusters in the early growth steps of MOFs can be stabilized by modulators to form fluidic precursors with good processibility. Then, simple removal of modulators will trigger the crosslinking of MOF clusters and lead to the formation of continuous films. This strategy is universal for the fabrication of several types of MOF films with large scale and controllable thickness, which can be deposited on a variety of substrates as well as can be patterned in micro/nano resolution. Additionally, versatile composite MOF films can be easily synthesized by introducing functional materials during the crosslinking process, which brings them broader application prospects.

         <title>Microscale Combinatorial Libraries for the Discovery of High&#8208;Entropy Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscale combinatorial libraries are introduced as a new method for exploration of polyelemental material systems. Composition gradients of quinary material systems are produced and characterized for crystal properties and electrocatalytic activity. The small dimensions of microscale combinatorial libraries enable efficient screening of thousands of compositions. Highly active electrocatalysts are identified in the systems Ru&#8211;Rh&#8211;Pd&#8211;Ir&#8211;Pt and Co&#8211;Ni&#8211;Mo&#8211;Pd&#8211;Pt.








Abstract
Polyelemental material systems, specifically high&#8208;entropy alloys, promise unprecedented properties. Due to almost unlimited combinatorial possibilities, their exploration and exploitation is hard. This challenge is addressed by co&#8208;sputtering combined with shadow masking to produce a multitude of microscale combinatorial libraries in one deposition process. These thin&#8208;film composition spreads on the microscale cover unprecedented compositional ranges of high&#8208;entropy alloy systems and enable high&#8208;throughput characterization of thousands of compositions for electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions using nanoscale scanning electrochemical cell microscopy. The exemplary exploration of the composition space of two high&#8208;entropy alloy systems provides electrocatalytic activity maps for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution as well as oxygen reduction reactions. Activity optima in the system Ru&#8211;Rh&#8211;Pd&#8211;Ir&#8211;Pt are identified, and active noble&#8208;metal lean compositions in the system Co&#8211;Ni&#8211;Mo&#8211;Pd&#8211;Pt are discovered. This illustrates that the proposed microlibraries are a holistic discovery platform to master the multidimensionality challenge of polyelemental systems.

         <title>Unusual Spectrally Reproducible and High Q&#8208;Factor Random Lasing in Polycrystalline Tin Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly spectrally reproducible multimode random lasing is observed in thin polycrystalline films of tin iodide perovskite that cannot be explained by a strong mode localization. The observed spectral reproducibility can be due to the strong inhomogeneous broadening of photoluminescence spectra measured in tin&#8208;based perovskites on the basis of a comparison with an analogous Pb&#8208;based counterpart.








Abstract
An unusual spectrally reproducible near&#8208;IR random lasing (RL) with no fluctuation of lasing peak wavelength is disclosed in polycrystalline films of formamidinium tin triiodide perovskite, which have been chemically stabilized against Sn2+ to Sn4+ oxidation. Remarkably, a quality Q&#8208;factor as high as &#8776;104 with an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold as low as 2&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2 (both at 20&#160;K) are achieved. The observed spectral reproducibility is unprecedented for semiconductor thin film RL systems and cannot be explained by the strong spatial localization of lasing modes. Instead, it is suggested that the spectral stability is a result of such an unique property of Sn&#8208;based perovskites as a large inhomogeneous broadening of the emitting centers, which is a consequence of an intrinsic structural inhomogeneity of the material. Due to this, lasing can occur simultaneously in modes that are spatially strongly overlapped, as long as the spectral separation between the modes is larger than the homogeneous linewidth of the emitting centers. The discovered mechanism of RL spectral stability in semiconductor materials, possessing inhomogeneous broadening, opens up prospects for their practical use as cheap sources of narrow laser lines.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Organohydrogel Artificial Muscle with Compartmentalized Anisotropic Actuation Under Microdomain Confinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organohydrogel actuator achieving the combination of high speed, high actuation strength, and large material size is proposed. The water is confined in hydrophobic microdomains in organohydrogel, thus realizing a compartmentalization actuation mode similar to muscle. This strategy can break through the limitations that originated from the traditional solvent diffusion actuation mechanism, inspiring gel actuator design.








Abstract
Current hydrogel actuators mostly suffer from weak actuation strength and low responsive speed owing to their solvent diffusion&#8208;induced volume change mechanism. Here a skeletal muscle&#8208;inspired organohydrogel actuator is reported in which solvents are confined in hydrophobic microdomains. Organohydrogel actuator is driven by compartmentalized directional network deformation instead of volume change, avoiding the limitations that originate from solvent diffusion. Organohydrogel actuator has an actuation frequency of 0.11&#160;Hz, 110 times that of traditional solvent diffusion&#8208;driven hydrogel actuators (&lt;10&#8722;3&#160;Hz), and can lift more than 85 times their own weight. This design achieves the combination of high responsive speed, high actuation strength, and large material size, proposing a strategy to fabricate hydrogel actuators comparable with skeletal muscle performance.

         <title>Direct Conversion of Liquid Organic Precursor into 3D Laser&#8208;Induced Graphene Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A goal in graphene synthesis is to establish routes for preparing graphene materials from liquids instead of conventional solid or gaseous sources. This work reports the production of graphene materials with tunable composition directly from liquid precursor. A fundamentally new graphene 3D&#8208;printing system is further developed for constructing 3D graphene materials with high structural integrity unachievable by traditional printing strategy.








Abstract
Among the different states of matter, liquids have particular advantages in terms of easy handling and recycling, which has been manifested in various chemosynthetic reactions, but remains underexplored in graphene synthesis. This work reports the direct conversion of liquid organic precursor into versatile 3D graphene materials using rapid laser irradiation. The liquid precursor allows for easy fabrication of graphene with significant 3D architectures, including powders, patterned composite structures, and substrate&#8208;free films. Taking advantage of the high compatibility of liquid precursor with a wide range of dopants, the 3D graphene can be further engineered together with various functional components, especially the high loading (&#8776;15 wt.%) and well&#8208;dispersed (an average diameter of less than 50&#160;nm) high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles. Furthermore, combined with the 3D printing strategy, the rapid construction of graphene with complex and accurate 3D shapes is demonstrated via a selective in situ laser transforming (SLT) strategy. With the high structural integrity unachievable by traditional 3D printing methods, the obtained objects show an electrical conductivity of 4380 S&#160;m&#8722;1 and a compressive modulus of 31.8&#160;MPa. The results reported in this work will open up a new way for the fabrication of functional carbon materials with customizable shapes and components.

         <title>Bioengineering of High Cell Density Tissues with Hierarchical Vascular Networks for Ex Vivo Whole Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method is shown to fabricate an in vitro model of millimeter&#8208;sized scaffold&#8208;free tissues whose cell density is &#8776;200 million cells mL&#8722;1, corresponding to those of native tissues. The supply of oxygen and nutrition is extremely significant for such tissues. Therefore, a hierarchical vascular network containing capillaries and an artificial channel for perfusion are formed.








Abstract
The development of tissue&#8208;like structures such as cell sheets, spheroids, and organoids has contributed to progress in regenerative medicine. Simultaneous achievement of scale up and high cell density of these tissues is challenging because sufficient oxygen cannot be supplied to the inside of large, high cell density tissues. Here, in vitro fabrication of vessels to supply oxygen to the inside of millimeter&#8208;sized scaffold&#8208;free tissues whose cell density is &#8776;200 million cells mL&#8722;1, corresponding to those of native tissues, is shown. Hierarchical vascular networks by anastomosis of capillaries and a large vessel are essential for oxygen supply, whereas a large vessel or capillary networks alone make negligible contributions to the supply. The hierarchical vascular networks are formed by a top&#8208;down approach, which offers a new option for ex vivo whole organs without decellularization and 3D&#8208;bioprinting.

         <title>Thermally Crosslinked Hole Conductor Enables Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with 23.9% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple small molecule 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine is developed for in situ fabrication of polymer hole conductor (CL&#8208;MCz) via a facile and low&#8208;temperature cross&#8208;linking technology. The device with CL&#8208;MCz yields a champion power conversion efficiency of 23.9% along with an extremely low energy loss down to 0.41 eV.








Abstract
Poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hole transport material (HTM) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, unsatisfied surface properties of PTAA and high energy disorder in the bulk film hinder the further enhancement of device performance. Herein, a simple small molecule 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine (MCz&#8208;VPOZ) is strategically developed for in situ fabrication of polymer hole conductor (CL&#8208;MCz) via a facile and low&#8208;temperature cross&#8208;linking technology. The resulting polymer CL&#8208;MCz offers high energy ordering and improved electrical conductivity, as well as appropriate energy&#8208;level alignment, enabling efficient charge carrier collection in the devices. Meanwhile, CL&#8208;MCz synchronously provides satisfied surface wettability and interfacial functionalization, facilitating the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with fewer bulk iodine vacancies and suppressed carrier recombination. Significantly, the device with CL&#8208;MCz yields a champion efficiency of 23.9% along with an extremely low energy loss down to 0.41 eV, which represents the highest reported efficiency for non&#8208;PTAA&#8208;based polymer HTMs in inverted PSCs. Furthermore, the corresponding unencapsulated devices exhibit competitive shelf&#8208;life stability under various operational stressors up to 2500 h, reflecting high promises of CL&#8208;MCz in the scalable PSC application. This work underscores the promising potential of the cross&#8208;linking approach in preparing low&#8208;cost, stable, and efficient polymer HTMs toward reliable PSCs.

Herein, a simple small molecule 10-(4-(3,6-dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)-3,7-bis(4-vinylphenyl)-10H-phenoxazine (MCz-VPOZ) is strategically developed for in situ fabrication of polymer hole conductor (CL-MCz) via a facile and low-temperature cross-linking technology. The resulting polymer CL-MCz offers high energy ordering and improved electrical conductivity, as well as appropriate energy-level alignment, enabling efficient charge carrier collection in the devices. Meanwhile, CL-MCz synchronously provides satisfied surface wettability and interfacial functionalization, facilitating the formation of high-quality perovskite films with fewer bulk iodine vacancies and suppressed carrier recombination. Significantly, the device with CL-MCz yields a champion efficiency of 23.9% along with an extremely low energy loss down to 0.41 eV, which represents the highest reported efficiency for non-PTAA-based polymer HTMs in inverted PSCs. Furthermore, the corresponding unencapsulated devices exhibit competitive shelf-life stability under various operational stressors up to 2500 h, reflecting high promises of CL-MCz in the scalable PSC application. This work underscores the promising potential of the cross-linking approach in preparing low-cost, stable, and efficient polymer HTMs toward reliable PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A New Class of Cluster&#8211;Matrix Nanocomposite Made of Fully Miscible Components</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prospect for creating highly metastable nanocomposite materials made from fully miscible alloy systems, like Ni&#8211;Cu, is opened. The cluster ion beam deposition technique allows stabilization of 2000&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;clusters in a Cu&#8208;matrix with varying macroscopic concentration. Consequently, unique magnetic and magnetotransport properties are evident as a function of cluster concentration and enthalpy&#8208;driven cluster dissolution.








Abstract
Nanocomposite materials, consisting of two or more phases, at least one of which has a nanoscale dimension, play a distinctive role in materials science because of the multiple possibilities for tailoring their structural properties and, consequently, their functionalities. In addition to the challenges of controlling the size, size distribution, and volume fraction of nanometer phases, thermodynamic stability conditions limit the choice of constituent materials. This study goes beyond this limitation by showing the possibility of achieving nanocomposites from a bimetallic system, which exhibits complete miscibility under equilibrium conditions. A series of nanocomposite samples with different compositions are synthesized by the co&#8208;deposition of 2000&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;clusters and a flux of Cu&#8208;atoms using a novel cluster ion beam deposition system. The retention of the metastable nanostructure is ascertained from atom probe tomography (APT), magnetometry, and magnetotransport studies. APT confirms the presence of nanoscale regions with &#8776;100 at% Ni. Magnetometry and magnetotransport studies reveal superparamagnetic behavior and magnetoresistance stemming from the single&#8208;domain ferromagnetic Ni&#8208;clusters embedded in the Cu&#8208;matrix. Essentially, the magnetic properties of the nanocomposites can be tailored by the precise control of the Ni concentration. The initial results offer a promising direction for future research on nanocomposites consisting of fully miscible elements.

         <title>Efficient Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells on Industrially Compatible Textured Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an anion&#8208;engineered additive strategy is reported to modify the crystallization process of perovskite films on industrially feasible double&#8208;side textured silicon, which enables conformal deposition with improved film crystallinity and reduced trap density. This allows the fabrication of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with efficiencies of 28.9% (certified efficiency of 27.9%) and 25.1% for areas of 1 and 16&#160;cm2, respectively.








Abstract
Monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells promise power&#8208;conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit of single&#8208;junction solar cells. The conformal deposition of perovskites on industrially feasible textured silicon solar cells allows for both lowered manufacturing costs and a higher matched photocurrent density, compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art tandems using front&#8208;side flat or mildly textured silicon. However, the inferior crystal quality of perovskite films grown on fully&#8208;textured silicon compromises the photovoltaic performance. Here, an anion&#8208;engineered additive strategy is developed to control the crystallization process of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite films, which enables improved film crystallinity, reduced trap density, and conformal deposition on industrially textured silicon. This strategy allows the fabrication of 28.6%&#8208;efficient perovskite/silicon heterojunction tandem solar cells (certified 27.9%, 1&#160;cm2). This approach is compatible with the scalable fabrication of tandems on industrially textured silicon, demonstrating an efficiency of 25.1% for an aperture area of 16&#160;cm2. The anion&#8208;engineered additive significantly improves the operating stability of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells, and the encapsulated tandem solar cells retain over 80% of their initial performance following 2000&#160;h of operation under full 1&#8208;sun illumination in ambient conditions.

         <title>Observation of Multi&#8208;Directional Energy Transfer in a Hybrid Plasmonic&#8211;Excitonic Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrafast charge and energy exchange across the interface of a hybrid plasmonic heterostructure are explored with momentum resolved electron spectroscopy and diffraction. The results identify a multi&#8208;directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal, driven by a non&#8208;linear plasmon&#8211;exciton interaction. Non&#8208;radiative exciton recombination, electron&#8211;phonon coupling, and diffusive charge&#8208;transfer determine the subsequent energy backflow.








Abstract
Hybrid plasmonic devices involve a nanostructured metal supporting localized surface plasmons to amplify light&#8211;matter interaction, and a non&#8208;plasmonic material to functionalize charge excitations. Application&#8208;relevant epitaxial heterostructures, however, give rise to ballistic ultrafast dynamics that challenge the conventional semiclassical understanding of unidirectional nanometal&#8208;to&#8208;substrate energy transfer. Epitaxial Au nanoislands are studied on WSe2 with time&#8208; and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and femtosecond electron diffraction: this combination of techniques resolves material, energy, and momentum of charge&#8208;carriers and phonons excited in the heterostructure. A strong non&#8208;linear plasmon&#8211;exciton interaction that transfers the energy of sub&#8208;bandgap photons very efficiently to the semiconductor is observed, leaving the metal cold until non&#8208;radiative exciton recombination heats the nanoparticles on hundreds of femtoseconds timescales. The results resolve a multi&#8208;directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal. Electron&#8211;phonon coupling and diffusive charge&#8208;transfer determine the subsequent energy flow. This complex dynamics opens perspectives for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications, while providing a constraining experimental testbed for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art&#160;modelling.

         <title>Multimorphic Materials: Spatially Tailoring Mechanical Properties via Selective Initiation of Interpenetrating Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two disparate polymer networks are created simultaneously using non&#8208;interacting chemical reactions and light as a stimulus. Upon turning the light on, the polymers want to phase&#8208;separate like oil and water, but the process is hindered as they interlock. Thus, the degree and location of phase separation, and in&#8208;turn mechanical properties, can be precisely controlled by the &#8220;flick of a switch&#8221;.








Abstract
Access to multimaterial polymers with spatially localized properties and robust interfaces is anticipated to enable new capabilities in soft robotics, such as smooth actuation for advanced medical and manufacturing technologies. Here, orthogonal initiation is used to create interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) with spatial control over morphology and mechanical properties. Base catalyzes the formation of a stiff and strong polyurethane, while blue LEDs initiate the formation of a soft and elastic polyacrylate. IPN morphology is controlled by when the LED is turned &#8220;on&#8221;, with large phase separation occurring for short time delays (&#8776;1&#8211;2 min) and a mixed morphology for longer time delays (&gt;5&#160;min), which is supported by dynamic mechanical analysis, small angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and atomic force microscopy. Through tailoring morphology, tensile moduli and fracture toughness can be tuned across &#8776;1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude. Moreover, a simple spring model is used to explain the observed mechanical behavior. Photopatterning produces &#8220;multimorphic&#8221; materials, where morphology is spatially localized with fine precision (&lt;100&#160;&#181;m), while maintaining a uniform chemical composition throughout to mitigate interfacial failure. As a final demonstration, the fabrication of hinges represents a possible use case for multimorphic materials in soft robotics.

         <title>Fast and Dynamic Mapping of the Protein Corona on Nanoparticle Surfaces by Photocatalytic Proximity Labeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein corona broadly affects the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo. Here, a photocatalytic proximity labeling technology in nanoparticles (nano&#8208;PPL) is developed for in situ labeling of corona proteins. Nano&#8208;PPL exhibits a significantly improved temporal resolution (5 s duration) and reveals precise dynamics of protein coronas on anionic and cationic nanoparticles. This technology represents a significant methodological advance toward nano&#8208;protein interactions.








Abstract
Protein corona broadly affects the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo. Although it has been widely studied by multiple strategies like centrifugal sedimentation, the rapidly forming mechanism and the dynamic structure of the protein corona at the seconds level remains challenging. Here, a photocatalytic proximity labeling technology in nanoparticles (nano&#8208;PPL) is developed. By fabricating a &#8220;core&#8208;shell&#8221; nanoparticle co&#8208;loaded with chlorin e6 catalyst and biotin&#8208;phenol probe, nano&#8208;PPL technology is validated for the rapid and precise labeling of corona proteins in situ. Nano&#8208;PPL significantly improves the temporal resolution of nano&#8208;protein interactions to 5 s duration compared with the classical centrifugation method (&gt;30 s duration). Furthermore, nano&#8208;PPL achieves the fast and dynamic mapping of the protein corona on anionic and cationic nanoparticles, respectively. Finally, nano&#8208;PPL is deployed to verify the effect of the rapidly formed protein corona on the initial interaction of nanoparticles with cells. These findings highlight a significant methodological advance toward nano&#8208;protein interactions in the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo.

         <title>Imaging Guided Endogenic H2&#8208;Augmented Electrochemo&#8208;Sonodynamic Domino Co&#8208;therapy of Tumor in Vivo</title>

A highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective imaging&#8208;guided/&#8208;assessed H2&#8208;therapy of tumors based on a joint electrochemo&#8208;sonodynamic treatment (H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy) is developed. The endogenic H2&#8208;triggered &#8220;domino effect&#8221; in tumor tissue is clearly revealed. The developed H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy guided by US imaging in vivo will open up a feasible new way for green, economic, and effective treatment of cancer in the future.








Abstract
Precise and on&#8208;demand release of sufficient hydrogen (H2) to tumor sites remains a key challenge for emerging H2&#8208;oncotherapy, and little is known about the physiological effects of &#8220;abundant&#8221; H2 on complex tumor microenvironments (TME). Here, a highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective imaging&#8208;guided/&#8208;assessed H2&#8208;therapy of tumors based on a joint electrochemo&#8208;sonodynamic treatment (H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy) with strong &#8220;domino effect&#8221; triggered by endogenous H2 generation at tumor sites is reported to speedily eliminate tumor tissue (&#8804;80&#160;mm3) within 1&#160;day. Adequate H2 is controllably generated in tumor sites through mild electrochemistry in vivo due to acidic TME by using clinical acupuncture Fe needles as electrodes. Besides starvation damage due to gas blockage/destruction of vessels, nano&#8208;/micro&#8208;bubbles of H2 formed in situ can elevate the tumor's internal temperature and burst vessels to further destroy the tumor&#160;under ultrasound irradiation. Remarkably, vulnerable homeostasis of TME is disturbed as H2 also participates in the physiological activity of tumor cells, leading to tumor dysfunction. Last but not least, the body's inflammatory response to cancer is reduced after the treatment, which is beneficial for the body's immune system during post&#8208;treatment recovery. Based on all of these merits, the H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy provides a potentially safe and viable therapeutic strategy for future clinical applications.

         <title>Formation Mechanism and Bandgap Reduction of GaN&#8211;ZnO Solid&#8208;Solution Thin Films Fabricated by Nanolamination of Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanolamination of GaN and ZnO layers by atomic layer deposition is employed to fabricate (GaN)1&#8722;x(ZnO)x homogenous solid&#8208;solution films with 0.39 &#8806; x &#8806; 0.79 by varying the cycle ratios. The density functional theory calculations using a superlattice model are performed to evaluate and validate the reduction of bandgaps that results in enhanced visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Nanolamination of GaN and ZnO layers by atomic layer deposition (ALD) is employed to fabricate GaN&#8211;ZnO homogenous solid&#8208;solution thin films because it offers more precise control of the stoichiometry. By varying the ALD cycle ratios of GaN:ZnO from 5:10 to 10:5, the (GaN)1&#8722;x(ZnO)x films with 0.39 &#8806; x &#8806; 0.79 are obtained. The formation of solid solution is explained based on the atomic stacking and preferred orientation of the layers of GaN and ZnO. However, the growth rates of GaN and ZnO during the lamination process are different from those of pure GaN and ZnO films. It is found that GaN grows faster on ZnO, whereas ZnO grows slower on GaN. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed using a superlattice model for GaN and ZnO laminated layers fabricated by ALD to understand the difference of density of states (DOS) and evaluate the bandgaps for various atomic configurations in the solid&#8208;solution films. The band positions are experimentally defined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Significant bandgap reduction of the solid solutions is observed, which can be explained by the DOS from the DFT calculations. Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is conducted to confirm the applicability of the solid&#8208;solution films.

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Induced Micrometer&#8208;Scale Charge&#8208;Carrier Diffusion in Organic Bulk Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;mobility fullerene liquid crystal is introduced into the active layer of organic solar cells (OSCs) to provide a fast channel for charge&#8208;carrier transport, reduce energetic disorder and trap density via enhancing crystallization, and then realize micrometer&#8208;scale charge&#8208;carrier diffusion, leading to the impressive power conversion efficiencies of 15.23% for OSCs with the thickness approaching 500 nm.








Abstract
The short charge&#8208;carrier diffusion length (LD) (100&#8211;300&#160;nm) in organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) impedes the further improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs), especially for thick&#8208;film (&gt;400&#160;nm) devices matching with industrial solution processing. Here a facile method is developed to efficiently increase LD and then improve PCEs of OSCs via introducing a fullerene liquid crystal, F1, into the active layer. F1 combines the inherent high electron mobility of fullerene and strong self&#8208;assembly capacity of liquid crystal, providing a fast channel for charge&#8208;carrier transport&#160;and reducing energetic disorder and trap density in BHJ film via enhancing crystallization. Typically, in PM6:Y6:F1 BHJ, the enhanced charge&#8208;carrier mobility (&gt;10&#8722;2 cm&#8722;2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and prolonged charge&#8208;carrier lifetime (55.3 &#181;s) are acquired to realize the record LD of 1.6 or 2.4&#160;&#181;m for electron or hole, respectively, which are much higher than those of the PM6:Y6 binary sample and comparable to or even better than those values reported for some inorganic/hybrid materials, such as CuInxGa(1&#8722;x)Se2 (CIGS) and perovskite thin films. Benefitting from the micrometer&#8208;scale LD, the PM6:Y6:F1 ternary OSCs sustain a remarkable PCE of 15.23% with the active layer thickness approaching 500&#160;nm.

         <title>Electron Conductive and Transparent Hydrogels for Recording Brain Neural Signals and Neuromodulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to break the current bottleneck of implantable materials, which demonstrate a suit of desirable performances including matched modulus, good transparency, and high conductivity. The hydrogel electrode is successfully utilized for optogenetic neuromodulation and simultaneously recording the brain's neural signals, establishing the correlation between brain neural signals and corresponding limb behavior.








Abstract
Recording brain neural signals and optogenetic neuromodulations open&#160;frontiers in decoding brain neural information and neurodegenerative disease therapeutics. Conventional implantable probes suffer from modulus mismatch with biological tissues and an irreconcilable tradeoff between transparency and electron conductivity. Herein, a strategy is proposed to address these tradeoffs, which generates conductive and transparent hydrogels with polypyrrole&#8208;decorated microgels as cross&#8208;linkers. The optical transparency of the electrodes can be attributed to the special structures that allow light waves to bypass the microgel particles and minimize their interaction. Demonstrated by probing the hippocampus of rat brains, the biomimetic electrode shows a prolonged capacity for simultaneous optogenetic neuromodulation and recording of brain neural signals. More importantly, an intriguing brain&#8211;machine interaction is realized, which involves signal input to the brain, brain neural signal generation, and controlling limb behaviors. This breakthrough work represents a significant scientific advancement toward decoding brain neural information and developing neurodegenerative disease therapies.

         <title>Strain Engineering of Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Enables Exceptional Cyclability in Pouch&#8208;Type Full Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a super&#8208;dispersed Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathode, which consists of the elongated and radially aligned primary particles with rich oxygen stable {001} planes. The resultant cathode effectively homogenizes the intragranular and intergranular strain and greatly inhibits the Li/Ni disordering and lattice oxygen loss during de&#8208;/lilthiation, leading to superior electrochemical performances at various rates and operating temperatures.








Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are at the forefront of the development of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries, yet the extensive applications are retarded by the deteriorative capacity and thermal instability. Herein, an in situ co&#8208;precipitation strategy is implemented to achieve the novel super&#8208;dispersed Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathode that consists of the elongated and radially aligned primary particles with increased oxygen stable {001} planes. The unique microstructure homogenizes the intragranular and intergranular strain distribution and stabilizes the spherical secondary particles, effectively inhibiting microcrack formation and propagation and surface degradation. The super&#8208;dispersed Nb doping prevents the Li/Ni disordering and lattice oxygen escape, thereby further strengthening the crystal structure and thermal stability. Accordingly, this cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 229.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C with much better retention at 55 &#176;C and 5 C after 100 cycles than the conventional Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. In a pouch&#8208;type full cell, it exhibits exceptionally long life with a capacity retention of 91.9% at 1 C after 500 cycles and 80.5% at 5 C after 2000 cycles within 3.0&#8211;4.2&#160;V, greatly prolonging the service period to cater to the lightweight and intelligence of electric vehicles.

         <title>Transparent Porous Conductive Substrates for Gas&#8208;Phase Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transparent gas diffusion electrodes are developed via the F&#8208;doped SnO2 coating of SiO2 fused fiber felts. These highly porous and conductive substrates are amenable to the disposition of various semiconductors and are employed herein to demonstrate photoelectrode membrane assemblies for solar&#8208;driven H2 production in a gas&#8208;phase flow cell.








Abstract
Gas diffusion electrodes are essential components of common fuel and electrolysis cells but are typically made from graphitic carbon or metallic materials, which do not allow light transmittance and thus limit the development of gas&#8208;phase based photoelectrochemical devices. Herein, the simple and scalable preparation of F&#8208;doped SnO2 (FTO) coated SiO2 interconnected fiber felt substrates is reported. Using 2&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m diameter fibers at a loading of 4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the resulting substrates have porosity of 90%, roughness factor of 15.8, and Young's Modulus of 0.2&#160;GPa. A 100 nm conformal coating of FTO via atmospheric chemical vapor deposition gives sheet resistivity of 20 &#177; 3 &#937; sq&#8722;1 and loss of incident light of 41% at illumination wavelength of 550&#160;nm. The coating of various semiconductors on the substrates is established including Fe2O3 (chemical bath deposition), CuSCN and Cu2O (electrodeposition), and conjugated polymers (dip coating), and liquid&#8208;phase photoelectrochemical performance commensurate with flat FTO substrates is confirmed. Finally, gas phase H2 production is demonstrated with a polymer semiconductor photocathode membrane assembly at 1&#8208;Sun photocurrent density on the order of 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and Faradaic efficiency of 40%.

         <title>Dual Topology of Dirac Electron Transport and Photogalvanic Effect in Low&#8208;Dimensional Topological Insulator Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stacking layer number&#8208;dependent electron structure, quantum properties, and circularly (linearly) polarized photogalvanic effect are assessed in the low&#8208;dimensional dual topological superlattices (TSLs) (Bi2Se3)&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N. The results show that the surface electronic structure of the dual TSLs is highly tunable and well&#8208;regulated for quantum transport and photoexcitation, which shed light on engineering for opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic applications.








Abstract
Dual topological insulators, simultaneously protected by time&#8208;reversal symmetry and crystalline symmetry, open great opportunities to explore different symmetry&#8208;protected metallic surface states. However, the conventional dual topological states located on different facets hinder integration into planar opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic devices. Here, dual topological superlattices (TSLs) Bi2Se3&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N with limited stacking layer number N are constructed. Angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron emission spectra of the TSLs identify the coexistence and adjustment of dual topological surface states on Bi2Se3 facet. The existence and tunability of spin&#8208;polarized dual&#8208;topological bands with N on Bi2Se3 facet result in an unconventionally weak antilocalization effect (WAL) with variable WAL coefficient &#945; (maximum close to 3/2) from quantum transport experiments. Most importantly, it is identified that the spin&#8208;polarized surface electrons from dual topological bands exhibit circularly and linearly polarized photogalvanic effect (CPGE and LPGE). It is anticipated that the stacked dual&#8208;topology and stacking layer number controlled bands evolution provide a platform for realizing intrinsic CPGE and LPGE. The results show that the surface electronic structure of the dual TSLs is highly tunable and well&#8208;regulated for quantum transport and photoexcitation, which shed light on engineering for opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic applications.

         <title>Ferroelectric Domain Control of Nonlinear Light Polarization in MoS2 via PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 Thin Films and Free&#8208;Standing Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferroelectric domain patterning enabled approach is developed to achieve nanoscale reconfigurable modulation of the amplitude and polarization of SHG light in MoS2 interfaced with PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 thin films and membranes. The light polarization exhibits threefold symmetry at polar domains and twofold symmetry at domain walls. This study opens up new opportunities for developing smart nano&#8208;photonics and optical computing systems.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as MoS2 exhibit exceptionally strong nonlinear optical responses, while nanoscale control of the amplitude, polar orientation, and phase of the nonlinear light in TMDCs remains challenging. In this work, by interfacing monolayer MoS2 with epitaxial PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) thin films and free&#8208;standing PZT membranes, the amplitude and polarization of the second harmonic generation (SHG) signal are modulated via ferroelectric domain patterning, which demonstrates that PZT membranes can lead to in&#8208;operando programming of nonlinear light polarization. The interfacial coupling of the MoS2 polar axis with either the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polar domains of PZT or the in&#8208;plane polarization of domain walls tailors the SHG light polarization into different patterns with distinct symmetries, which are modeled via nonlinear electromagnetic theory. This study provides a new material platform that enables reconfigurable design of light polarization at the nanoscale, paving the path for developing novel optical information processing, smart light modulators, and integrated photonic circuits.

         <title>Fast and Durable Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction at the Electron&#8208;Deficient Ruthenium&#8211;Ruthenium Oxide Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructure is designed as an efficient electrocatalyst toward the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). The interfacial Ru and RuO2 domains are the optimal H and OH adsorption sites, respectively. The Ru domains are electron deficient and show substantially improved inoxidizability. The results highlight the significance of establishing robust and multifunctional heterointerfaces toward fast alkaline HOR and beyond.








Abstract
The slow hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics under alkaline conditions remain a critical challenge for the practical application of alkaline exchange membrane fuel cells. Herein, Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructures are designed with abundant active Ru&#8211;RuO2 interface domains as efficient electrocatalysts for the HOR in alkaline media. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that interfacial Ru and RuO2 domains at Ru&#8211;RuO2 interfaces are the optimal H and OH adsorption sites, respectively, endowing the well&#8208;defined Ru(100)/RuO2(200) interface as the preferential region for fast alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis. More importantly, the metallic Ru domains become electron deficient due to the strong interaction with RuO2 domains and show substantially improved inoxidizability, which is vital to maintain durable HOR electrocatalytic activity. The optimal Ru/RuO2 heterostructured electrocatalyst exhibits impressive alkaline HOR activity with an exchange current density of 8.86&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and decent durability. The exceptional electrocatalytic performance of Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructure can be attributed to the robust and multifunctional Ru&#8211;RuO2 interfaces endowed by the unique metal&#8211;metal oxide domains.

         <title>Weakening Li+ De&#8208;solvation Barrier for Cryogenic Li&#8211;S Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antecedent theoretical simulations decipher the correlation between lithium salt concentration and Li+ desolvation barrier in the electrolyte, indicating dilute electrolytes can enhance kinetics of sulfur cathode effectively. This insight endows Li&#8211;S pouch cells with an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 350 Wh kg&#8208;1 at 0 &#176;C, demonstrating great&#160;potential for&#160;cryogenic&#160;Li&#8211;S&#160;batteries.








Abstract
Li&#8211;S batteries hold promise for pushing cell&#8208;level energy densities beyond 300&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 while operating at low temperatures (LTs, below 0&#160;&#176;C). However, the capacity release of existing Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs is still barely satisfactory, and there is almost no verification of the practicability of Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs in the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell. Here, antecedent molecular dynamics (MDs) combined with density functional theory analysis are used to systematically investigate Li+ solvation structure in conventional Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs, which unprecedentedly reveals the positive correlation between lithium salt concentration and Li+ de&#8208;solvation barrier, indicating dilute electrolytes can enhance the Li+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics and thus improve the capacity performance of cryogenic Li&#8211;S batteries. These insights derived from theoretical simulations invested Li&#8211;S batteries with a 67.34% capacity retention at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C compared to their room temperature performance. In particular, an Ah&#8208;level Li&#8211;S pouch cell using dilute electrolytes with a high sulfur loading (5.6&#160;mg cm&#8208;2) and lean electrolyte condition is fabricated, which delivers a discharge capacity of about 1000 mAh g&#8208;1 and ultra&#8208;high energy density of 350&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 at 0&#160;&#176;C, offering a promising route toward a practical high&#8208;energy cryogenic Li&#8211;S battery.

         <title>3D Cold&#8208;Trap Environment Printing for Long&#8208;Cycle Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative 3D cold trap environment printing technology (3DCEP) is proposed in this work to fabricate a MXene/Zn&#8208;P aerogel anode with highly aligned arrangement. Benefitting from unique high lattice matching and physical confinement effects inside the electrode, it can effectively inhibit the Zn dendrite growth and Zn&#8208;P corrosion in electrolytes. Finally, a 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P//MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF full cell with long cyclic life can be realized.








Abstract
Zn powder (Zn&#8208;P)&#8208;based anodes are always regarded as ideal anode candidates for zinc ion batteries owing to their low cost and ease of processing. However, the intrinsic negative properties of Zn&#8208;P&#8208;based anodes such as easy corrosion and uncontrolled dendrite growth have limited their further applications. Herein, a novel 3D cold&#8208;trap environment printing (3DCEP) technology is proposed to achieve the MXene and Zn&#8208;P (3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P) anode with highly ordered arrangement. Benefitting from the unique inhibition mechanism of high lattice matching and physical confinement effects within the&#160;3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode, it can effectively homogenize the Zn2+ flux and alleviate the Zn deposition rate of the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode during Zn plating&#8211;stripping. Consequently, the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode exhibits a superior cycling lifespan of 1400&#160;h with high coulombic efficiency of &#8776;9.2% in symmetric batteries. More encouragingly, paired with MXene and Co doped MnHCF cathode via 3D cold&#8208;trap environment printing (3 DCEP&#8208;MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF), the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P//3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF full battery delivers high cyclic durability with the capacity retention of 95.7% after 1600 cycles. This study brings an inspired universal pathway to rapidly fabricate a reversible Zn anode with highly ordered arrangement in a cold environment for micro&#8208;zinc storage systems.

         <title>Many&#8208;Body Correlations and Exciton Complexes in CsPbBr3 Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many&#8208;body interactions in exciton complexes are crucial in many devices, for example, lasers, LEDs, and quantum light sources. Here, a combination of single quantum&#8208;dot photoluminescence spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures and configuration&#8208;interaction calculations reveals the size&#8208;dependent binding energies of trions (7&#8211;17&#160;meV) and biexcitons (15&#8211;30&#160;meV) in CsPbBr3&#160;quantum dots.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;halide perovskite (LHP) (CsPbX3, X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I) quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a competitive platform for classical light&#8208;emitting devices (in the weak light&#8211;matter interaction regime, e.g., LEDs and laser), as well as for devices exploiting strong light&#8211;matter interaction at room temperature. Many&#8208;body interactions and quantum correlations among photogenerated exciton complexes play an essential role, for example, by determining the laser threshold, the overall brightness of LEDs, and the single&#8208;photon purity in quantum light sources. Here, by combining cryogenic single&#8208;QD photoluminescence spectroscopy with configuration&#8208;interaction (CI) calculations, the size&#8208;dependent trion and biexciton binding energies are addressed. Trion binding energies increase from 7&#160;to 17&#160;meV for QD sizes decreasing from 30&#160;to 9&#160;nm, while the biexciton binding energies increase from 15&#160;to 30&#160;meV, respectively. CI calculations quantitatively corroborate the experimental results and suggest that the effective dielectric constant for biexcitons slightly deviates from the one of the single excitons, potentially as a result of coupling to the lattice in the multiexciton regime. The findings here provide a deep insight into the multiexciton properties in all&#8208;inorganic LHP QDs, essential for classical and quantum optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Engineering the Electronic Structure of Single&#8208;Atom Iron Sites with Boosted Oxygen Bifunctional Activity for Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to create a single&#8208;atom Fe catalyst on a mesoporous NC material by engineering the electronic structures of the metal sites is reported. This catalyst achieves remarkable electrocatalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction&#160;and oxygen evolution reaction, and demonstrates great potential in zinc&#8211;air batteries. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the optimized electronic structure of Fe1N4O1 moieties contributes to excellent electrocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries typically require efficient, durable, and inexpensive bifunctional electrocatalysts to support oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). However, sluggish kinetics and mass transportation challenges must be addressed if the performance of these catalysts is to be enhanced. Herein, a strategy to fabricate a catalyst comprising atomically dispersed iron atoms supported on a mesoporous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support (Fe SAs/NC) with accessible metal sites and optimized electronic metal&#8211;support interactions is developed. Both the experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the engineered electronic structures of the metal active sites can regulate the charge distribution of Fe centers to optimize the adsorption/desorption of oxygenated intermediates. The Fe SAs/NC containing Fe1N4O1 sites achieves remarkable ORR activity over the entire pH range, with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.93, 0.83, and 0.75&#160;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) in alkaline, acidic, and neutral electrolytes, respectively. In addition, it demonstrates a promising low overpotential of 320&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for OER in alkaline conditions. The zinc&#8211;air battery assembled with Fe SAs/NC exhibits superior performance than that of Pt/C+RuO2 counterpart in terms of peak power density, specific capacity, and cycling stability. These findings demonstrate the importance of the electronic structure engineering of metal sites in directing catalytic activity.

         <title>Initiating Reversible Aqueous Copper&#8211;Tellurium Conversion Reaction with High Volumetric Capacity through Electrolyte Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper&#8211;tellurium conversion reaction with high volumetric capacity of 3927&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3 and long discharge plateau are investigated. The thermodynamic&#8211;kinetic asymmetries of the Cu&#8211;Te multiphase&#8208;conversion and oxidation&#8208;failure mechanisms are systematically revealed. The developed precise electrolyte engineering overcomes inherent oxidative distress and extends the cycling life of the battery by about three orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Pursuing conversion&#8208;type cathodes with high volumetric capacity that can be used in aqueous environments remains rewarding and challenging. Tellurium (Te) is a promising alternative electrode due to its intrinsic attractive electronic conductivity and high theoretical volumetric capacity yet still to be explored. Herein, the kinetically/thermodynamically co&#8208;dominat copper&#8211;tellurium (Cu&#8211;Te) alloying phase&#8208;conversion process and corresponding oxidation failure mechanism of tellurium are investigated using in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and comprehensive ex situ characterization techniques. By virtue of the fundamental insights into the tellurium electrode, facile and precise electrolyte engineering (solvated structure modulation or reductive antioxidant addition) is implemented to essentially tackle the dramatic capacity loss in tellurium, affording reversible aqueous Cu&#8211;Te conversion reaction with an unprecedented ultrahigh volumetric capacity of up to 3927&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3, a flat long discharge plateau (capacity proportion of &#8776;81%), and an extraordinary level of capacity retention of 80.4% over 2000 cycles at 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 of which lifespan thousand&#8208;fold longer than Cu&#8211;Te conversion using CuSO4&#8211;H2O electrolyte. This work paves a significant avenue for expanding high&#8208;performance conversion&#8208;type cathodes toward energetic aqueous multivalent&#8208;ion batteries.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;function colloidal quantum dot (QD) devices that operate as a high&#8208;current density light emitting diode and an optically excited laser are demonstrated. The device structure has been optimized to reduce optical losses and allow for efficient wave&#8208;guiding within the active QD layer. This demonstration represents an important milestone toward the practical implementation of a colloidal QD laser diode.








Abstract
Laser diodes based on solution&#8208;processable materials can benefit numerous technologies including integrated electronics and photonics, telecommunications, and medical diagnostics. An attractive system for implementing these devices is colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). The progress towards a QD laser diode has been hampered by rapid nonradiative Auger decay of optical&#8208;gain&#8208;active multicarrier states, fast device degradation at high current densities required for laser action, and unfavorable competition between optical gain and optical losses in a multicomponent device stack. Here&#160;we&#160;resolve some of these challenges and demonstrate optically excited lasing from fully functional high&#8208;current density electroluminescent (EL) devices with an integrated optical resonator. This advance has become possible due to excellent optical gain properties of continuously graded QDs and a refined device architecture, which allows for highly efficient light amplification in a thin, EL&#8208;active QD layer.

         <title>Macroscale Fabrication of Lightweight and Strong Porous Carbon Foams through Template&#8208;Coating Pair Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>

The manufacturing of low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon materials on a macroscopic length scale has a significant impact on the construction, packaging, and transportation industries. Presented herein is a tunable platform for macroscale fabrication of lightweight and strong pyrolytic carbon foams through template&#8208;coating pair design.








Abstract
Manufacturing of low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon foams can benefit the construction, transportation, and packaging industries. One successful route to lightweight and mechanically strong carbon foams involves pyrolysis of polymeric architectures, which is inevitably accompanied by drastic volumetric shrinkage (usually &gt;98%). As such, a challenge of these materials lies in maintaining bulk dimensions of building struts that span orders of magnitude difference in length scale from centimeters to nanometers. This work demonstrates fabrication of macroscale low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon foams that feature exceptional dimensional stability through pyrolysis of robust template&#8208;coating pairs. The template serves as the architectural blueprint and contains strength&#8208;imparting properties (e.g., high node density and small strut dimensions); it is composed of a low char&#8208;yielding porous polystyrene backbone with a high carbonization&#8208;onset temperature. The coating serves to imprint and transcribe the template architecture into pyrolytic carbon; it is composed of a high char&#8208;yielding conjugated polymer with a relatively low carbonization&#8208;onset temperature. The designed carbonization mismatch enables structural inheritance, while the decomposition mismatch affords hollow struts, minimizing density. The carbons synthesized through this new framework exhibit remarkable dimensional stability (&#8776;80% dimension retention; &#8776;50% volume retention) and some of the highest specific strengths (&#8776;0.13&#160;GPa g&#8722;1 cm3) among reported carbon foams derived from porous polymer templates.

         <title>Well&#8208;Defined Fullerene Bisadducts Enable High&#8208;Performance Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;dependent effects of the four fullerene bisadduct regioisomers on the device performance of tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells are systemically investigated. Benefiting from the favorable molecular packing, energy level alignment, and interfacial interaction, the trans&#8208;3&#8208;based devices yield a champion efficiency of 14.58% with a certified efficiency of 14.30%, representing one of the best&#8208;performing tin&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) are attracting intense research interest due to their excellent optoelectric properties and eco&#8208;friendly features. To further improve the device performance, developing new fullerene derivatives as electron transporter layers (ETLs) is highly demanded. Four well&#8208;defined regioisomers (trans&#8208;2, trans&#8208;3, trans&#8208;4, and e) of diethylmalonate&#8208;C60 bisadduct (DCBA) are isolated and well characterized. The well&#8208;defined molecular structure enables us to investigate the real structure&#8208;dependent effects on photovoltaic performance. It is found that the chemical structures of the regioisomers not only affect their energy levels, but also lead to significant differences in their molecular packings and interfacial contacts. As a result, the devices with trans&#8208;2, trans&#8208;3, trans&#8208;4, and e as ETLs yield efficiencies of 11.69%, 14.58%, 12.59%, and 10.55%, respectively, which are higher than that of the as&#8208;prepared DCBA&#8208;based (10.28%) device. Notably, the trans&#8208;3&#8208;based device also demonstrates a certified efficiency of 14.30%, representing one of the best&#8208;performing TPSCs.

         <title>Control of Molecular Orbital Ordering Using a van der Waals Monolayer Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling and tuning the orbital ordering in a single molecule using a monolayer ferroelectric substrate is realized. This is achieved by adsorbing transition metal phthalocyanine (TMPc) molecules on a ferroelectric monolayer SnTe. The orbital order is probed using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments, and it is demonstrated that it can be controllably changed by switching the polarization direction of the underlying ferroelectric monolayer.








Abstract
2D ferroelectric materials provide a promising platform for the electrical control of quantum states. In particular, due to their 2D nature, they are suitable for influencing the quantum states of deposited molecules via the proximity effect. Here, electrically controllable molecular states in phthalocyanine molecules adsorbed on monolayer ferroelectric material SnTe are reported. The strain and ferroelectric order in SnTe are found to create a transition between two distinct orbital orders in the adsorbed phthalocyanine molecules. By controlling the polarization of the ferroelectric domain using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), it is successfully demonstrated that orbital order can be manipulated electrically. The results show how ferroelastic coupling in 2D systems allows for control of molecular states, providing a starting point for ferroelectrically switchable molecular orbital ordering and ultimately, electrical control of molecular&#160;magnetism.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme with Asymmetric Electron Distribution for Tumor Catalytic Therapy by Disrupting Tumor Redox and Energy Metabolism Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the drawbacks of current nanozyme catalytic therapy, a novel Ir&#63743;N5 single&#8208;atom/Cer nanoagent with asymmetric electron distribution is developed, which can improve the efficiency of multienzyme&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions through a substrate&#8208;recyclable manner, thereby disrupting the intracellular redox and energy metabolism homeostasis to achieve efficient tumor therapy.








Abstract
Nanozyme catalytic therapy triggered by tumor&#8208;specific endogenous stimuli is an emerging tumor therapy that attracts wide attention. However, the current therapeutic efficacy of nanozyme catalytic therapy is severely limited by the catalytic efficiency of nanozymes and the concentration of endogenous reaction substrates. Herein, a novel and efficient Ir&#63743;N5 single&#8208;atom (Ir&#63743;N5 SA) nanozyme is developed with multiple enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activities. Due to the synergistic effect of central Ir single&#8208;atom and axial N coordination, Ir&#63743;N5 SA exhibits better enzymatic catalytic performance than Ir&#63743;N4 SA. At tumor sites, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can generate a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through oxidase (OXD)&#8208;like and peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like catalytic activities. Moreover, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can also generate O2 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through catalase (CAT)&#8208;like and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase (NOX)&#8208;like catalytic activities, realizing the efficient nanozyme catalytic therapy in a substrate&#8208;cycle manner. Additionally, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can effectively break the intracellular NADH/NAD+ cycle balance by mimicking NOX, and then cooperate with fatty acid synthase cerulenin (Cer) to interfere with the energy metabolism homeostasis of tumor cells. Consequently, the designed Ir&#63743;N5 SA/Cer nanoagent can disrupt redox and metabolic homeostasis in the tumor region through an enzyme&#8208;mimicking cascade reaction, effectively overcoming the shortcomings of current nanozyme catalytic therapy.

         <title>Monolithic Tandem Vertical Electrochemical Transistors for Printed Multi&#8208;Valued Logic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design of high&#8208;speed electrochemical ternary logic transistor is presented. A vertically stacked dual channel heterostructure enables a clear manifestation of multiple logic states in 1&#160;V input&#8211;output voltage ranges, through a simple chemical&#8208;tuning of semiconductor materials.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have recently emerged as a feasible candidate to realize the next generation of printable electronics. Especially, their chemical versatility and the unique redox&#8208;based operating principle have provided new possibilities in high&#8208;functioning logic circuitry beyond the traditional binary Boolean logic. Here, a simple strategy to electrochemically realize monolithic multi&#8208;valued logic transistors is presented, which is one of the most promising branches of transistor technology in the forthcoming era of hyper Moore's law. A vertically stacked heterogeneous dual&#8208;channel architecture is introduced with a patterned reference electrode, which enables a facile manifestation of stable and equiprobable ternary logic states with a reduced transistor footprint. The dual&#8208;ion&#8208;penetration mechanism coupled with ultrashort vertical channel even allows a very&#8208;high accessing frequency to multiple logic states reaching over 10&#160;MHz.

&lt;p&gt;A new design of high-speed electrochemical ternary logic transistor is presented. A vertically stacked dual channel heterostructure enables a clear manifestation of multiple logic states in 1&#160;V input&#8211;output voltage ranges, through a simple chemical-tuning of semiconductor materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have recently emerged as a feasible candidate to realize the next generation of printable electronics. Especially, their chemical versatility and the unique redox-based operating principle have provided new possibilities in high-functioning logic circuitry beyond the traditional binary Boolean logic. Here, a simple strategy to electrochemically realize monolithic multi-valued logic transistors is presented, which is one of the most promising branches of transistor technology in the forthcoming era of hyper Moore's law. A vertically stacked heterogeneous dual-channel architecture is introduced with a patterned reference electrode, which enables a facile manifestation of stable and equiprobable ternary logic states with a reduced transistor footprint. The dual-ion-penetration mechanism coupled with ultrashort vertical channel even allows a very-high accessing frequency to multiple logic states reaching over 10&#160;MHz. Furthermore, printed arrays of ternary logic gates with full voltage swing within 1&#160;V are demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal Anodes with Ultrahigh Reversibility Enabled by the Closest Packing Crystallography for Sustainable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy is reported to construct dendrite&#8208;free metal anodes with multiple crystal structures (hexagonal close&#8208;packed, face&#8208;centered cubic, and body&#8208;centered cubic) on single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) substrates, which epitaxially match the closest packed facets of metals. The closest packed facets of metal anodes aligned horizontally with substrates, resulting in compact planar construction and excellent chemical stability. Consequently, the metal anodes display high reversibility and outstanding performance.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing annual electricity generated from sustainable and intermittent energy such as wind and solar power requires cost effective and reliable electrochemical energy storage. Rechargeable batteries based on multivalent metal anodes such as Zn, Al, and Fe, taking advantage of large&#8208;scale production and affordable cost, have emerged as promising candidates. However, the uncontrollable dendrite&#8208;like metal deposition on regular substrate caused by disordered metal crystallization usually leads to premature failure of batteries and even safety concerns when the dendrite bridges the electrodes. Here it is reported that a series of metal anodes (Zn, Co, Al, Ni, and Fe) with multiple crystal structures (hexagonal close&#8208;packed, face&#8208;centered cubic, and body&#8208;centered cubic) can achieve dendrite&#8208;free and epitaxial deposition on single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) substrates enabled by the closest packing crystallography. Moreover, the closest packed facets are aligned horizontally with the substrates, resulting in compact planar construction and excellent chemical stability even at an unprecedented current density of 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. The full cells under a practical anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode capacity ratio of 2.3 show a cycling life span of over 800 cycles with Coulombic efficiency of &gt;&#160;99.9%. The universal approach of regulating metal electrodeposition in this work is expected to boost the development of emerging sustainable energy storage/conversion devices.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Cation Composition Engineering of Hybrid Cs1&#8722;xFAxPbBr3 Nanocrystals for Self&#8208;Healing Electronics Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel post&#8208;synthesis cesium/formamidinium (Cs/FA) mixed&#8208;cation perovskite nanocrystals possess high structural and optoelectronic properties for integration in self&#8208;healing polymer composites. Entropic&#8208;driven self&#8208;healing not only enhances white backlight display performance, but also sustains the working performance of a shattered&#8211;repaired glass substrate laser, thereby representing potentially major advances in optoelectronics and photonics applications.








Abstract
Mixed&#8208;cation hybrid perovskite nanocrystal (HPNC) with high crystallinity, color purity, and tunable optical bandgap offers a practical pathway toward next&#8208;generation&#160;displays. Herein, a two&#8208;step modified hot&#8208;injection combined with cation compositional engineering and surface treatment to synthesize high&#8208;purity cesium/formamidinium lead bromide HPNCs(Cs1&#8208;xFAxPbBr3) is presented. The optimized Cs0.5FA0.5PbBr3 light&#8208;emitting devices (LEDs) exhibit uniform luminescence of 3500&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a prominent current efficiency of 21.5&#160;cd A&#8722;1. As a proof of concept, a self&#8208;healing polymer (SHP) integrated with white LED backlight and laser prototypes exhibited 4 h autonomous self&#8208;healing through the synergistic effect of weak reversible imine bonds and stronger H&#8208;bonds. First, the SHP&#8208;HPNCs&#8208;initial and SHP&#8208;HPNCs&#8208;cut possess high long&#8208;term stability and dramatically suppressed lead leakage as low as 0.6&#160;ppm along with a low leakage rate of 1.11 &#215; 10&#8722;5 cm2 and 3.36 &#215; 10&#8722;5 cm2 even over 6 months in water. Second, the Cs0.5FA0.5PbBr3 HPNCs and SHP&#8208;induced shattered&#8211;repaired perovskite glass substrate show the lowest lasing threshold values of 1.24 and 8.58 &#181;J cm&#8722;2, respectively. This work provides an integrative and in&#8208;depth approach to exploiting SHP with intrinsic and entropic self&#8208;healing capabilities combined with HPNCs to develop robust and reliable soft&#8208;electronic backlight and laser applications.

Organic Metal Halide Hybrids
Efficient electroluminescent devices can now be fabricated using solution&#8208;processed thin films based on 0D organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs). In article number 2209417, Biwu Ma and co&#8208;workers develop a highly luminescent 0D OMHH containing organic semiconducting cations, which successfully addresses the issues of low conductivity and poor energy alignment of existing 0D OMHHs for electrically driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs).

         <title>Resistive Switching Crossbar Arrays Based on Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resistive switching devices made of layered materials (LMs) have shown interesting performance. However, most studies employ fabrication methods and device structures that are not industry&#8208;relevant. In this review, the focus is on the status of crossbar arrays of LMs.








Abstract
Resistive switching (RS) devices are metal/insulator/metal cells that can change their electrical resistance when electrical stimuli are applied between the electrodes, and they can be used to store and compute data. Planar crossbar arrays of RS devices can offer a high integration density (&gt;108&#160;devices mm&#8722;2) and this can be further enhanced by stacking them three&#8208;dimensionally. The advantage of using layered materials (LMs) in RS devices compared to traditional phase&#8208;change materials and metal oxides is that their electrical properties can be adjusted with a higher precision. Here, the key figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit and procedures to implement LM&#8208;based RS devices are defined. LM&#8208;based RS devices fabricated using methods compatible with industry are identified and discussed. The focus is on small devices (size&#160;&lt;&#160;9&#160;&#181;m2) arranged in crossbar structures, since larger devices may be affected by artifacts, such as grain boundaries and flake junctions.

     alt="Resistive Switching Crossbar Arrays Based on Layered Materials"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resistive switching devices made of layered materials (LMs) have shown interesting performance. However, most studies employ fabrication methods and device structures that are not industry-relevant. In this review, the focus is on the status of crossbar arrays of LMs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resistive switching (RS) devices are metal/insulator/metal cells that can change their electrical resistance when electrical stimuli are applied between the electrodes, and they can be used to store and compute data. Planar crossbar arrays of RS devices can offer a high integration density (&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;devices mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and this can be further enhanced by stacking them three-dimensionally. The advantage of using layered materials (LMs) in RS devices compared to traditional phase-change materials and metal oxides is that their electrical properties can be adjusted with a higher precision. Here, the key figures-of-merit and procedures to implement LM-based RS devices are defined. LM-based RS devices fabricated using methods compatible with industry are identified and discussed. The focus is on small devices (size&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;9&#160;&#181;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) arranged in crossbar structures, since larger devices may be affected by artifacts, such as grain boundaries and flake junctions. How to enhance device performance, so to accelerate the development of this technology, is also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
