         <title>Cycloruthenated Self&#8208;Assembly with Metabolic Inhibition to Efficiently Overcome Multidrug Resistance in Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
In this study we report the synthesis and the evaluation of the efficacy of a cycloruthenated complex, RuZ, to overcome multi&#8208;drug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells. RuZ could self&#8208;assemble into nanoaggregates in the cell culture medium and resulted in a high intracellular concentration of RuZ in MDR cancer cells. The self&#8208;assembly significantly decreased oxygen consumption and inhibited glycolysis, which decreased cellular ATP levels. The reduction in ATP levels and its low affinity for the ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters (which mediate MDR) significantly increased the retention of RuZ by MDR cancer cells. Furthermore, RuZ increased cellular oxidative stress, inducing DNA damage, and in combination with the aforementioned effects of RuZ, increased the apoptosis of cancer cells. Proteomic profiling analysis suggested that the RuZ primarily decreased the expression of proteins that mediate glycolysis and aerobic mitochondrial respiration and increased the expression of proteins involved in apoptosis. RuZ inhibited the proliferation of 35 cancer cell lines, of which 7 cell lines were resistant to clinical drugs. It was also active in doxorubicin&#8208;resistant MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231/Adr mouse tumor xenograft. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first to show that self&#8208;assembled cycloruthenated complexes are efficacious in inhibiting the growth of MDR cancer cells.

         <title>2D Cu9S5/PtS2/WSe2 Double Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor with High Current Gain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Bipolar junction transistor (BJT), one important circuit element in the integrated circuits, is now widely used in high&#8208;speed computation and communication for its capability of high&#8208;power signal amplification. 2D materials and their heterostructures are promising in building high&#8208;amplification and high&#8208;frequency BJTs because they can be naturally thin and highly designable in tailoring components properties. However, currently the low emitter injection efficiency results in only moderate current gain achieved in the pioneer researches, severely restraining its future development. Herein, we show an elaborately designed double heterojunction bipolar transistor (DHBT) can greatly promote the injection efficiency, improving the current gain by order of magnitude. In this DHBT we use high&#8208;doping&#8208;density wide&#8208;bandgap 2D Cu9S5 as emitter and narrow&#8208;bandgap PtS2 as base. This heterostructure efficiently suppress the current ratio of reverse electron flux from base and increase the injection efficiency. By exploiting this high injection efficiency, our DHBT experimentally achieves an excellent common&#8208;base current gain (&#945; = ~0.996) and common&#8208;emitter current gain (&#946; = ~910). This work systematically explores the electrical behavior of 2D materials based DHBT, and provides deep insight of the architecture design for building high gain DHBT, which may promote the applications of 2D&#8208;materials based heterojunctions in the fields of integrated circuits.

         <title>Mesenchymal Stem Cell&#8208;derived Extracellular Vesicles with High PD&#8208;L1 Expression for Autoimmune Diseases Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Autoimmune diseases are the third most common disease influencing the quality of life of many patients. Here, we develop a PD&#8208;L1+ mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) derived extracellular vesicles (MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) using lentivirus&#8208;mediated gene transfection technology for reconfiguration of the local immune microenvironment of affected tissue in autoimmune diseases. MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 exhibits an impressive ability to regulate various activated immune cells to an immunosuppressed state in vitro. More importantly, in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)&#8208;induced ulcerative colitis (UC) and imiquimod&#8208;induced psoriasis mouse models, we observe a significantly high accumulation of MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 in the inflamed tissues compared to the PD&#8208;L1+ MSCs. Therapeutic efficiency in both UC and psoriasis mouse disease models is demonstrated using MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 to reshape the inflammatory ecosystem in the local immune context. We develop a technology using MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 as a natural delivery platform for autoimmune diseases treatment with high clinical potential.

         <title>Liquid metal&#8208;enabled Mechanical energy&#8208;induced CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We report a green carbon capture and conversion technology offering scalability and economic viability for mitigating CO2 emissions. The technology uses suspensions of gallium liquid metal to reduce CO2 into carbonaceous solid products and O2 at near room temperature. The nonpolar nature of the liquid gallium interface allows the solid products to instantaneously exfoliate, hence keeping active sites accessible. The solid co&#8208;contributor of silver&#8208;gallium rods ensures a cyclic sustainable process. The overall process relies on mechanical energy as the input, which drives nano dimensional triboelectrochemical reactions. When a gallium/silver fluoride mix at 7:1 mass ratio is employed to create the reaction material, 92% efficiency was obtained at the remarkably low input energy of 230 kW&#8729;h for the capture and conversion of a tonne of CO2. This green technology presents an economical solution for CO2 emissions.

         <title>Design Quasi&#8208;MOF Nanospheres as Dynamic Electrocatalyst toward Accelerated Sulfur Reduction Reaction for High Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

Abstract
Lithium sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have been considered as one of the most promising next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries owing to its high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the sluggish kinetics of the sulfur reduction reaction process, which is so far insufficiently explored, still impedes its practical application.&#160;Metal organic frameworks (MOF) are widely investigated as&#160;sulfur immobilizer, but the interactions and catalytic activity of lithium polysulfides (LiPs) on metal nodes are weak due to the presence of organic ligands. Herein, we present a strategy to design Quasi&#8208;MOF nanospheres, which has a transition&#8208;state structure between MOF and metal oxide, via controlled ligand exchange strategy to serve as sulfur electrocatalyst. The Quasi&#8208;MOF not only inherits the porous structure of MOF, but also exposes abundant metal nodes to act as active sites, rendering strong LiPs absorbability. The reversible deligandation/ligandation of Quasi&#8208;MOF and its impact on the durability of catalyst over the course of electrochemical process has been acknowledged, which confers a remarkable catalytic activity. Attributed to these structural advantages, Quasi&#8208;MOF delivers a decent discharge capacity and low capacity fading rate over long&#8208;term cycling. This work not only offers insight into the rational design of Quasi&#8208;MOF based composite, but also provides guidance for the application in Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Conversion&#8208;type Non&#8208;metal Elemental Tellurium Anode with High Utilization for Mild/alkaline Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), generally established on an excessive metallic Zn anode and aqueous electrolytes, suffer from severe dendrites and gassing issues at Zn side, resulting in poor cycling life. Substituting Zn metal anode with non&#8208;Zn ones is a promising strategy for solving these problems, whereas this is still restricted by the limited anode alternatives. Herein, by replacing metal Zn with chalcogen element tellurium (Te), we reported a conversion&#8208;type Te based ZIB that can work in both mild and alkaline electrolytes. As expected, the as&#8208;assembled mild Te/MnO2 and alkaline Te/Ni(OH)2 cells deliver remarkable capacities up to 106 and 161 mAh g&#8211;1anode+cathode, respectively, with a high utilization of anode (50.1% for the Te/MnO2 and 38.9% for the Te/Ni(OH)2), which surpass all ZIBs. Ultra&#8208;long cycling life (over 75% capacity retention after 5000 cycles) was achieved in the two systems, benefiting from the stable conversion mechanisms (mild: Te to ZnTe2 to ZnTe; alkaline: ZnTe to Te to TeO2) with thoroughly eliminated dendrites and gassing. Moreover, high gravimetric energy density of ZIBs was also achieved, which are 176.3&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1anode+cathdoe (Te/Ni(OH)2) and 81&#160;Wh Kg&#8211;1anode+cathode (Te/MnO2), respectively. This work sheds light on the development of advanced conversion&#8208;type anode for high&#8208;performance batteries with superior stability.

         <title>Viologen&#8208;Immobilized Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Film Enabling Highly Efficient Electrochromic Device for Solar&#8208;Powered Smart Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electrochromic devices (ECDs) have emerged as a unique class of optoelectronic devices for the development of smart windows. However, current ECDs typically suffer from low coloration efficiency (CE) and high energy consumption, which have thus hindered their practical applications, especially as components in solar&#8208;powered EC windows. Here, we demonstrate the high&#8208;performance ECDs with a fully crystalline viologen&#8208;immobilized 2D polymer (V2DP) thin film as the color&#8208;switching layer. The high density of vertically oriented pore channels (pore size, &#8764;4.5&#160;nm; pore density, &#8764;5.8 &#215; 1016 m&#8722;2) in the synthetic V2DP film enables high utilization of redox&#8208;active viologen moieties and benefits for Li+ ion diffusion/transport. As a result, the as&#8208;fabricated ECDs achieve a rapid switching speed (coloration, 2.8 s; bleaching, 1.2 s), and a high CE (989 cm2 C&#8722;1), and low energy consumption (21.1 &#956;W cm&#8722;2). Moreover, we manage to fabricate transmission&#8208;tunable, self&#8208;sustainable EC window prototypes by vertically integrating the V2DP ECDs with transparent solar cells. This work sheds light on designing electroactive 2D polymers with molecular precision for optoelectronics and paves a practical route toward developing self&#8208;powered EC windows to offset the electricity consumption of buildings.

         <title>Asymmetric Elimination Reaction on Chiral Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The production of enantiopure materials and molecules is of uttermost relevance in research and industry in numerous contexts, ranging from non&#8208;linear optics to asymmetric synthesis. In the context of the latter, we have investigated dehalogenation, which is an essential reaction step for a broad class of chemical reactions. Specifically, dehalogenation of prochiral 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;7&#8208;methylbenz(a)anthracene (BMA) on prototypical, chiral, intermetallic PdGa{111} surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Enantioselective halogen elimination is demonstrated by combining temperature&#8208;programmed x&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and density functional theory. On the PdGa{111} surfaces, the difference in debromination temperatures for the two BMA surface enantiomers amounts up to unprecedented 46 K. The significant dependence of the dehalogenation temperature of the BMA surface enantiomers on the atomic termination of the PdGa{111} surfaces, implies that the ensemble effect is pronounced in this reaction step. These findings evidence enantiospecific control and hence promote intrinsically chiral crystals for asymmetric on&#8208;surface synthesis.

         <title>Dense Silicon Nanowire Networks Grown on a Stainless Steel Fiber Cloth: A Flexible and Robust Anode for Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Silicon nanowires (Si NWs) have great promise as an anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their very high specific capacity. Achieving adequate mass loadings for binder&#8211;free Si NWs have been restricted by low surface area, mechanically unstable and poorly conductive current collectors (CC), as well as complicated and expensive fabrication routes. Herein, we report a tunable mass loading and dense Si NW growth on a highly conductive, flexible, fire&#8208;resistant and mechanically robust interwoven stainless steel fiber cloth (SSFC) using a simple glassware setup. The SSFC CC facilitates dense growth of Si NWs where its open structure allows a buffer space for expansion/contraction during Li&#8211;cycling. The Si NWs@SSFC anode displays a stable performance for 500 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of more than 99.5%. Galvanostatic cycling of the Si NWs@SSFC anode with a mass loading of 1.32&#160;mg.cm&#8211;2 achieves a stable areal capacity of &#8764;2 mAh.cm&#8211;2 at 0.2C after 200 cycles. Si NWs@SSFC anodes with different mass loadings were characterized before and after cycling by SEM and TEM to examine the effects of Li&#8211;cycling on the morphology. Notably, our approach allows the large&#8211;scale fabrication of robust and flexible binder&#8211;free Si NWs@SSFC architectures, which makes it viable for practical applications in high energy density LIBs.

         <title>Advances in Catalytic Applications of Zeolite&#8208;Supported Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent research progresses on the catalytic applications of zeolite&#8208;supported metal catalysts for diverse reactions (e.g., hydrogenation reactions, dehydrogenation reactions, oxidation reactions, hydroisomerization, and selective catalytic reduction of NOx with ammonia) are comprehensively summarized. Some current limitations and future perspectives on challenges and opportunities for this subject are also highlighted.








Abstract
Zeolites possessing large specific surface areas, ordered micropores, and adjustable acidity/basicity have emerged as ideal supports to immobilize metal species with small sizes and high dispersities. In recent years, the zeolite&#8208;supported metal catalysts have been widely used in diverse catalytic processes, showing excellent activity, superior thermal/hydrothermal stability, and unique shape&#8208;selectivity. In this review, a comprehensive summary of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art achievements in catalytic applications of zeolite&#8208;supported metal catalysts are presented for important heterogeneous catalytic processes in the last five years, mainly including 1) the hydrogenation reactions (e.g., CO/CO2 hydrogenation, hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds, and hydrogenation of nitrogenous compounds); 2) dehydrogenation reactions (e.g., alkane dehydrogenation and dehydrogenation of chemical hydrogen storage materials); 3) oxidation reactions (e.g., CO oxidation, methane oxidation, and alkene epoxidation); and 4) other reactions (e.g., hydroisomerization reaction and selective catalytic reduction of NOx with ammonia reaction). Finally, some current limitations and future perspectives on the challenge and opportunity for this subject are pointed out. It is believed that this review will inspire more innovative research on the synthesis and catalysis of zeolite&#8208;supported metal catalysts and promote their future developments to meet the emerging demands for practical applications.

         <title>Direct Measurement of Oxygen Mass Transport at the Nanoscale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method based on atom probe tomography for the direct measurement of ion kinetics at the nanoscale is reported. Extremely high 3D resolution (&lt;1&#160;nm) and straight correlation with local cation distribution are demonstrated for the exemplary case of a mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor exhibiting enhanced grain boundary oxygen diffusivity.








Abstract
Tuning oxygen mass transport properties at the nanoscale offers a promising approach for developing high performing energy materials. A number of strategies for engineering interfaces with enhanced oxygen diffusivity and surface exchange have been proposed. However, the origin and the magnitude of such local effects remain largely undisclosed to date due to the lack of direct measurement tools with sufficient resolution. In this work, atom probe tomography with sub&#8208;nanometer resolution is used to study oxygen mass transport on oxygen&#8208;isotope exchanged thin films of lanthanum chromite. A direct 3D visualization of nanoscaled highly conducting oxygen incorporation pathways along grain boundaries, with reliable quantification of the oxygen kinetic parameters and correlative link to local chemistries, is presented. Combined with finite element simulations of the exact nanostructure, isotope exchange&#8208;atom probe tomography allowed quantifying an enhancement in the grain boundary oxygen diffusivity and in the surface exchange coefficient of lanthanum chromite of about 4 and 3 orders of magnitude, respectively, compared to the bulk. This remarkable increase of the oxygen kinetics in an interface&#8208;dominated material is unambiguously attributed to grain boundary conduction highways thanks to the use of a powerful technique that can be straightforwardly extended to the study of currently inaccessible multiple nanoscale mass transport phenomena.

         <title>Emissive Charge&#8208;Transfer States at Hybrid Inorganic/Organic Heterojunctions Enable Low Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination and High&#8208;Performance Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient charge generation mediated by an emissive charge&#8208;transfer state is observed in hybrid heterojunctions comprising the inorganic semiconductor copper thiocyanate and common organic semiconductors. This enables the fabrication of solar cells with very low voltage losses and highly sensitive photodetectors that can detect sub&#8208;picowatt near&#8208;infrared light.








Abstract
Hybrid devices based on a heterojunction between inorganic and organic semiconductors have offered a means to combine the advantages of both classes of materials in optoelectronic devices, but, in practice, the performance of such devices has often been disappointing. Here, it is demonstrated that charge generation in hybrid inorganic&#8211;organic heterojunctions consisting of copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) and a variety of molecular acceptors (ITIC, IT&#8208;4F, Y6, PC70BM, C70, C60) proceeds via emissive charge&#8208;transfer (CT) states analogous to those found at all&#8208;organic heterojunctions. Importantly, contrary to what has been observed at previous organic&#8211;inorganic heterojunctions, the dissociation of the CT&#8208;exciton and subsequent charge separation is efficient, allowing the fabrication of planar photovoltaic devices with very low non&#8208;radiative voltage losses (0.21&#160;&#177; &#8197;0.02&#160;V). It is shown that such low non&#8208;radiative recombination enables the fabrication of simple and cost&#8208;effective near&#8208;IR (NIR) detectors with extremely low dark current (4 pA cm&#8722;2) and noise spectral density (3 fA Hz&#8722;1/2) at no external bias, leading to specific detectivities at NIR wavelengths of just under 1013 Jones, close to the performance of commercial silicon photodetectors. It is believed that this work demonstrates the possibility for hybrid heterojunctions to exploit the unique properties of both inorganic and organic semiconductors for high&#8208;performance opto&#8208;electronic devices.

         <title>Precise Subcellular Organelle Targeting for Boosting Endogenous&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Mediated Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The properties of the tumor microenvironment, the principle, methods, and the advantages of endogenous chemical substances stimulated tumor therapies and subcellular&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeting nanoplatforms are emphasized, which will provide attractive points toward the exploitation of precise medicines and clinical translation of multifunctional nanomedicines.








Abstract
Though numerous external&#8208;stimuli&#8208;triggered tumor therapies, including phototherapy, radiotherapy, and sonodynamic therapy have made great progress in cancer therapy, the low penetration depth of the laser, safety concerns of radiation, the therapeutic resistance, and the spatio&#8208;temporal constraints of the specific equipment restrict their convenient clinical applications. What is more, the inherent physiological barriers of the tumor microenvironment (TME), including hypoxia, heterogeneity, and high expression of antioxidant molecules also restrict the efficiency of tumor therapy. As a result, the development of nanoplatforms responsive to endogenous stimuli (such as glucose, acidic pH, cellular redox events, and etc.) has attracted great attention for starvation therapy, ion therapy, prodrug&#8208;mediated chemotherapy, or enzyme&#8208;catalyzed therapy. In addition, nanomedicines can be modified by some targeted units for precisely locating in subcellular organelles and boosting the destroying of tumor tissue, decreasing the dosage of nanoagents, reducing side effects, and enhancing the therapeutic efficiency. Herein, the properties of the TME, the advantages of endogenous stimuli, and the principles of subcellular&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted strategies will be emphasized. Some necessary considerations for the exploitation of precision medicine and clinical translation of multifunctional nanomedicines in the future are also pointed out.

         <title>Bioactive Synthetic Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic polymers as intrinsically bioactive agents. This review presents new opportunities in the development of synthetic polymers with the ability to selectively recognize and bind biological targets, to exert anticancer and/or antibacterial activity, and others that can agglutinate or otherwise bind to viruses.








Abstract
Synthetic polymers are omnipresent in society as textiles and packaging materials, in construction and medicine, among many other important applications. Alternatively, natural polymers play a crucial role in sustaining life and allowing organisms to adapt to their environments by performing key biological functions such as molecular recognition and transmission of genetic information. In general, the synthetic and natural polymer worlds are completely separated due to the inability for synthetic polymers to perform specific biological functions; in some cases, synthetic polymers cause uncontrolled and unwanted biological responses. However, owing to the advancement of synthetic polymerization techniques in recent years, new synthetic polymers have emerged that provide specific biological functions such as targeted molecular recognition of peptides, or present antiviral, anticancer, and antimicrobial activities. In this review, the emergence of this generation of bioactive synthetic polymers and their bioapplications are summarized. Finally, the future opportunities in this area are discussed.

         <title>Optimized Photoclick (Bio)Resins for Fast Volumetric Bioprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Volumetric printing enables the generation of centimeter&#8208;sized free&#8208;form 3D objects within seconds. Optimized photoclick&#8208;based photoresins show ideal biophysical and photochemical properties resulting in fast and biocompatible volumetric bioprinting. Thiol&#8211;norbornene photo&#8208;crosslinking outperforms chain&#8208;growth systems permitting significant reduction of radical generation and polymer concentration. This simple and scalable synthesis method opens new avenues for widespread use of photoclick resins in light&#8208;mediated biofabrication.








Abstract
Volumetric printing (VP) is a light&#8208;mediated technique enabling printing of complex, low&#8208;defect 3D objects within seconds, overcoming major drawbacks of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer additive manufacturing. An optimized photoresin is presented for VP in the presence of cells (volumetric bioprinting) based on fast thiol&#8211;ene step&#8208;growth photoclick crosslinking. Gelatin&#8208;norbornene (Gel&#8208;NB) photoresin shows superior performance, both in physicochemical and biocompatibility aspects, compared to (meth&#8208;)acryloyl resins. The extremely efficient thiol&#8211;norbornene reaction produces the fastest VP reported to date (&#8776;10 s), with significantly lower polymer content, degree of substitution (DS), and radical species, making it more suitable for cell encapsulation. This approach enables the generation of cellular free&#8208;form constructs with excellent cell viability (&#8776;100%) and tissue maturation potential, demonstrated by development of contractile myotubes. Varying the DS, polymer content, thiol&#8211;ene ratio, and thiolated crosslinker allows fine&#8208;tuning of mechanical properties over a broad stiffness range (&#8776;40&#160;Pa to &#8776;15&#160;kPa). These properties are achieved through fast and scalable methods for producing Gel&#8208;NB with inexpensive, off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf reagents that can help establish it as the gold standard for light&#8208;mediated biofabrication techniques. With potential applications from high&#8208;throughput bioprinting of tissue models to soft robotics and regenerative medicine, this work paves the way for exploitation of VPs unprecedented capabilities.

Gelatin-norbornene (Gel-NB) photoresin shows superior performance, both in physicochemical and biocompatibility aspects, compared to (meth-)acryloyl resins. The extremely efficient thiol&#8211;norbornene reaction produces the fastest VP reported to date (&#8776;10 s), with significantly lower polymer content, degree of substitution (DS), and radical species, making it more suitable for cell encapsulation. This approach enables the generation of cellular free-form constructs with excellent cell viability (&#8776;100%) and tissue maturation potential, demonstrated by development of contractile myotubes. Varying the DS, polymer content, thiol&#8211;ene ratio, and thiolated crosslinker allows fine-tuning of mechanical properties over a broad stiffness range (&#8776;40&#160;Pa to &#8776;15&#160;kPa). These properties are achieved through fast and scalable methods for producing Gel-NB with inexpensive, off-the-shelf reagents that can help establish it as the gold standard for light-mediated biofabrication techniques. With potential applications from high-throughput bioprinting of tissue models to soft robotics and regenerative medicine, this work paves the way for exploitation of VPs unprecedented capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystal Phase Transition Creates a Highly Active and Stable RuCX Nanosurface for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal phase&#8208;transition of Ru/C from cubic&#8208;close&#8208;packing to hexagonal&#8208;close&#8208;packing creates a ruthenium carbide (RuCX, X&#160;&lt;&#160;1) nanosurface on Ru nanocrystal. The as&#8208;created RuCX nanosurface presents a highly active and stable performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. Density functional theory calculations predict the RuCX sites as bifunctional configurations for improving alkaline HER kinetics.








Abstract
Although metastable crystal structures have received much attention owing to their utilization in various fields, their phase&#8208;transition to a thermodynamic structure has attracted comparably little interest. In the case of nanoscale crystals, such an exothermic phase&#8208;transition releases high energy within a confined surface area and reconstructs surface atomic arrangement in a short time. Thus, this high&#8208;energy nanosurface may create novel crystal structures when some elements are supplied. In this work, the creation of a ruthenium carbide (RuCX, X&#160;&lt;&#160;1) phase on the surface of the Ru nanocrystal is discovered during phase&#8208;transition from cubic&#8208;close&#8208;packed to hexagonal&#8208;close&#8208;packed structure. When the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is tested in alkaline media, the RuCX exhibits a much lower overpotential and good stability relative to the counterpart Ru&#8208;based catalysts and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C catalyst. Density functional theory calculations predict that the local heterogeneity of the outermost RuCX surface promotes the bifunctional HER mechanism by providing catalytic sites for both H adsorption and facile water dissociation.

         <title>Design and Demystify the Lithium Metal Interface towards Highly Reversible Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The reversible lithium (Li) plating/stripping is essentially required for building practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries based on Li metal chemistry, which unfortunately remains a severe challenge yet. In this contribution, we demonstrate that through the rational regulation of strong Li+&#8722;anion coordination structures in a highly compatible low&#8208;polarity solvent, 2&#8208;methyl tetrahydrofuran (MeTHF), the Li plating/stripping assisted by a nucleation modulation procedure delivers a remarkably high average Coulombic efficiency (CE) under rather demanding conditions (99.7% and 99.5% under 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 3.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 and 3.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 3.0 mAh cm&#8722;2, respectively). The exceedingly reversible cycling obtained herein is fundamentally correlated with the flattened Li deposition and minimized SEI generation/reconstruction in the customized condition, which notably restrains the growth rates of both dead Li0 (0.0120 mAh/cycle) and SEI&#8208;Li+ (0.0191 mAh/cycle) during consecutive cycles. Benefiting from the efficient Li plating/stripping manner, the assembled anode&#8208;free Cu|LiFePO4 (2.7 mAh cm&#8722;2) coin and pouch cells exhibit impressive capacity retention of 43.8% and 41.6% after 150 cycles, respectively, albeit no optimization on the test conditions. This work provides guidelines into the targeted interfacial design of high&#8208;efficiency working Li anode, aiming to pave the way for the practical deployment of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries.

         <title>Processing of Self&#8208;healing Polymers for Soft Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Soft robots are, due to their softness, inherently safe and adapt well to unstructured environments. However, they are prone to various damage types. Self&#8208;healing polymers address this vulnerability. Self&#8208;healing soft robots can recover completely from macroscopic damage, extending their lifetime. For developing healable soft robots, various formative and additive manufacturing methods have been exploited to shape self&#8208;healing polymers into complex structures. Additionally, several novel manufacturing techniques, noted as (re)assembly binding techniques that are specific to self&#8208;healing polymers, have been created. This paper reviews the wide variety of processing techniques of self&#8208;healing polymers for robotics available in literature, and thoroughly discusses limitations and opportunities. Based on defined requirements for soft robots, these techniques are critically compared and validated. A strong focus is drawn to the reversible covalent and (physico)chemical cross&#8208;links present in the self&#8208;healing polymers that do not only endow healability to the resulting soft robotic components, but are also beneficial in many manufacturing techniques. They solve current obstacles in soft robots, including the formation of robust multi&#8208;material parts, recyclability and stress relaxation. This review bridges two promising research fields, and guides the reader towards selecting a suitable processing method based on a self&#8208;healing polymer and the intended soft robotics&#160;application.

         <title>Compensating electronic effect enables fast site&#8208;to&#8208;site electron transfer over ultrathin RuMn nanosheet branches toward highly electroactive and stable water splitting</title>

Abstract
To improve the electroactivity and stability of electrocatalysts, various modulation strategies have been applied in nanocatalysts. Among different methods, heteroatom doping has been considered as an effective method, which modifies the local bonding environments and the electronic structures. Meanwhile, the design of novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanostructures also offers new opportunities for achieving efficient electrocatalysts. In this work, Mn&#8208;doped ultrathin Ru nanosheet branches (RuMn NSBs), a newly reported 2D nanostructure, has been synthesized. With the ultrathin and naturally abundant edges, the RuMn NSBs have exhibited bifunctionalities of hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction with high electroactivity and durability in different electrolytes. Experimental characterizations have revealed that Ru&#8208;O bonds are shortened due to Mn doping, which is the key factor that leads to improved electrochemical performances. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have confirmed that the introduction of Mn enables flexible modulations on the valence states of Ru sites. The inversed redox state evolutions of Ru and Mn sites not only improve the electroactivity for the water splitting but also the long&#8208;term stability due to the pinning effect of Ru sites. This work has provided important inspirations for the design of future advanced Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts with high performances and durability.

         <title>Loading Single&#8208;Ni Atoms on Assembled Hollow N&#8208;rich Carbon Plates for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The rational design of catalysts&#8217; spatial structure is vitally important to boost the catalytic performance through exposing the active sites, enhancing the mass transfer, and confining the reactants. Herein, a dual&#8208;linker zeolitic tetrazolate framework&#8208;engaged strategy is developed to construct assembled hollow plates (AHP) of N&#8208;rich carbon (NC), which is loaded with single&#8208;Ni atoms to form a highly efficient electrocatalyst (designated as Ni&#8208;NC(AHP)). In the carbonization process, the thermally unstable linker (5&#8208;aminotetrazole) serves as the self&#8208;sacrificial template and the other linker (2&#8208;methylimidazole) mainly serves as the carbon and nitrogen source to form hollow NC matrix. The formed Ni&#8208;NC(AHP) catalyst possesses enhanced mesoporosity and more available surface area, thus promoting mass transport and affording abundant accessible single&#8208;Ni sites. These features contribute to remarkable performance for electrochemical CO2 reduction with exceptionally high selectivity of nearly 100% towards CO in a wide potential range and dramatically enhanced CO partial current density.

Herein, a dual-linker zeolitic tetrazolate framework-engaged strategy is developed to construct assembled hollow plates (AHP) of N-rich carbon (NC), which is loaded with single-Ni atoms to form a highly efficient electrocatalyst (designated as Ni-NC(AHP)). In the carbonization process, the thermally unstable linker (5-aminotetrazole) serves as the self-sacrificial template and the other linker (2-methylimidazole) mainly serves as the carbon and nitrogen source to form hollow NC matrix. The formed Ni-NC(AHP) catalyst possesses enhanced mesoporosity and more available surface area, thus promoting mass transport and affording abundant accessible single-Ni sites. These features contribute to remarkable performance for electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction with exceptionally high selectivity of nearly 100% towards CO in a wide potential range and dramatically enhanced CO partial current density.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Optoelectronic Properties of Low&#8208;Bandgap Halide Perovskites for Solar Cell Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;bandgap tin&#8208;containing halide perovskites have recently demonstrated impressive photovoltaic performances owing to their unique optoelectronic properties, which are yet to be fully explored. A perspective on the absorption, carrier generation, recombination, and transport phenomena in these materials is provided, underscoring an interesting interplay between doping, defects, and degradation that needs to be controlled for future optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Riding on the coat tails of rapid developments in single&#8208;junction halide perovskite solar cells, all&#8208;perovskite multijunction solar cells have recently garnered significant attention, with the highest power&#8208;conversion efficiency already reaching 25.6%. Much of this progress has been fueled by the rapid rise in the photovoltaic performance of low&#8208;bandgap halide perovskite absorbers, materials, which, to date, have only been achievable by the partial or complete substitution of lead with tin. However, much room still exists to develop a more critical understanding of key material properties in these low&#8208;bandgap perovskites. Herein, the key optoelectronic properties of absorption, carrier generation, recombination, and transport in these tin&#8208;containing perovskites are discussed, showing that intrinsic doping distinctively impacts many of these properties, thereby rendering this class of halide perovskites unique within the family. Current understanding of the mechanisms that degrade optoelectronic performance in these materials and the corresponding devices are also summarized. These collective results highlight an important interplay between doping, defects, and degradation that will need to be controlled. Finally, the current gaps in understanding of these low&#8208;bandgap perovskites are outlined, thereby providing guidelines for further research, which will unlock their full potential for realizing a plethora of high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Powered Piezo&#8208;Bioelectric Device Regulates Tendon Repair&#8208;Associated Signaling Pathways through Modulation of Mechanosensitive Ion Channels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under physiological conditions, ion&#8208;channels activity limit membrane depolarization and regulate ion concentration&#8208;dependent signaling cascades. In response to injury or mechanical loading, the activity and expression of the ion&#8208;channels increases, and unspecific tissue&#8208;repair signaling pathways activate, resulting in ectopic calcification. By modulating the mechanosensitive ion&#8208;channels&#8217; expression, electromechanical stimulation regulates specific signaling pathways activation to promote tendon over bone formation processes.








Abstract
Tendon disease constitutes an unmet clinical need and remains a critical challenge in the field of orthopaedic surgery. Innovative solutions are required to overcome the limitations of current tendon grafting approaches, and bioelectronic therapies show promise in treating musculoskeletal diseases, accelerating functional recovery through the activation of tissue regeneration&#8208;specific signaling pathways. Self&#8208;powered bioelectronic devices, particularly piezoelectric materials, represent a paradigm shift in biomedicine, negating the need for battery or external powering and complementing existing mechanotherapy to accelerate the repair processes. Here, the dynamic response of tendon cells to a piezoelectric collagen&#8208;analogue scaffold comprised of aligned nanoscale fibers made of the ferroelectric material poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene) is shown. It is demonstrated that motion&#8208;powered electromechanical stimulation of tendon tissue through piezo&#8208;bioelectric device results in ion channel modulation in vitro and regulates specific tissue regeneration signaling pathways. Finally, the potential of the piezo&#8208;bioelectronic device in modulating the progression of tendinopathy&#8208;associated processes in vivo, using a rat Achilles acute injury model is shown. This study indicates that electromechanical stimulation regulates mechanosensitive ion channel sensitivity and promotes tendon&#8208;specific over non&#8208;tenogenic tissue repair processes.

         <title>Electrochemistry&#8208;Induced Improvements of Mechanical Strength, Self&#8208;Healing, and Interfacial Adhesion of Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemistry strategy to enable functional improvements of hydrogels is reported. In comparison with an untreated one, the mechanical strength can be improved by 7.37 times, the interfacial adhesion energy to 1400 J m&#8722;2, and the healing efficiency to 100%, showing a general feature for the rapid generation of multifunctional hydrogels for biomedical and engineering applications.








Abstract
Hydrogels have demonstrated great potential in biomedical and engineering areas. To improve the physical performance, development of efficient physical/chemical protocols is essential. Herein, an electrochemistry functionalization strategy that is capable of enabling the functional improvements of hydrogel is reported. The electrochemistry functionalization is demonstrated on a hydrogel model of polyacrylamide (PAAm)@&#954;&#8208;carrageenan. The electrochemistry reaction generates metal ions (Fe3+) that migrate and coordinate with the sulfate groups of &#954;&#8208;carrageenan resulting in the prominent function improvements. In comparison with untreated PAAm@&#954;&#8208;carrageenan hydrogel, it can improve the mechanical strength by 7.37 times, and can increase the interfacial adhesion energy of the hydrogel on a glass surface from 0 to 1400 J m&#8722;2, stronger than the bonding strength of tendons (adhesion energy: &#8776;800 J m&#8722;2). Two pieces of hydrogel strips integrate into an intact structure by the electrochemistry functionalization, where the healing efficiency reaches 100% in comparison to the untreated hydrogel. The most significant development is that it enables functional patterning on the hydrogel by the electrode assembly, which provides the hydrogel with modular sensitivity to external pressure. Therefore, it can be a general protocol for rapid generation of multifunctional hydrogels for biomedical and engineering developments.

         <dc:description>
A novel material&#8208;based method of regulating dendritic cell (DC)&#8211;T&#8208;cell synaptic contact for adoptive DC vaccine engineering is reported. Graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets serve as a &#8220;nanozipper&#8221; or &#8220;double&#8208;sided tape&#8221; facilitating the formation and aggregation of DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell immune synapses to elicit robust cytotoxic T cell immune responses against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection. Cytoskeleton&#8208;dependent membrane&#8208;positioning of intercellular cell adhesion molecule&#8208;1 (ICAM&#8208;1) might be the underlying mechanism.








Abstract
Dendritic cell (DC) vaccines are used for cancer and infectious diseases, albeit with limited efficacy. Modulating the formation of DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell synapses may greatly increase their efficacy. The effects of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets on DCs and DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell synapse formation are evaluated. In particular, size&#8208;dependent interactions are observed between GO nanosheets and DCs. GOs with diameters of &gt;1 &#181;m (L&#8208;GOs) demonstrate strong adherence to the DC surface, inducing cytoskeletal reorganization via the RhoA&#8208;ROCK&#8208;MLC pathway, while relatively small GOs (&#8776;500 nm) are predominantly internalized by DCs. Furthermore, L&#8208;GO treatment enhances DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell synapse formation via cytoskeleton&#8208;dependent membrane positioning of integrin ICAM&#8208;1. L&#8208;GO acts as a &#8220;nanozipper,&#8221; facilitating the aggregation of DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell clusters to produce a stable microenvironment for T cell activation. Importantly, L&#8208;GO&#8208;adjuvanted DCs promote robust cytotoxic T cell immune responses against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike 1, leading to &gt;99.7% viral RNA clearance in mice infected with a clinically isolated SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 strain. These findings highlight the potential value of nanomaterials as DC vaccine adjuvants for modulating DC&#8211;T&#8208;cell synapse formation and provide a basis for the development of effective COVID&#8208;19 vaccines.

         <title>Reproducible X&#8208;ray Imaging with a Perovskite Nanocrystal Scintillator Embedded in a Transparent Amorphous Network Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;limited growth strategy is proposed to construct CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, which features X&#8208;imaging with excellent resolution (16.8&#160;lp&#160;mm&#8722;1). More importantly, the blurred X&#8208;ray images of the damaged perovskite NCs, due to irradiation at high dose rate, are well refreshed by a thermal treatment. This discovery broadens the research and application of the scintillators and opens a new chapter.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are emerging scintillator materials in X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. However, the vulnerable structure of perovskites triggers unreliable performance when they are utilized in X&#8208;ray detectors under cumulative dose irradiation. Herein, a self&#8208;limited growth strategy is proposed to construct CsPbBr3 nanocrystals that are embedded in a transparent amorphous network structure, featuring X&#8208;imaging with excellent resolution (&#8776;16.8&#160;lp&#160;mm&#8722;1), and fast decay time (&#964;&#160;=&#160;27&#160;ns). Interestingly, it is found that the performance degradation of the scintillator, caused by the damage from high&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation, can be fully recovered after a facile thermal treatment process. This indicates a superior recycling behavior of the explored perovskites scintillator for practical applications. The recoverability of the as&#8208;explored scintillator is attributed to the low atom&#8208;migration rate in the amorphous network with high&#8208;viscosity (1&#160;&#215;&#160;1014&#160;cP). This result highlights the practical settlement of the promising perovskites for long&#8208;term, cost&#8208;effective scintillator devices.

         <title>Adaptive Cylindrical Wireless Metasurfaces in Clinical Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metasurface with homogeneous field distribution and nonlinear resonant modes is proposed. Adaptability is achieved using nonlinear elements, enabling the metasurface to be applicable to all clinical sequences without any parameters modified, also allowing two to four times signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio enhancement. The proposed design paves the way for the clinical applications of metasurfaces in magnetic resonance imaging.








Abstract
The signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) is one of the most important criteria for evaluating the image quality in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and metasurfaces with unique electromagnetic properties provide a novel method for SNR improvement. However, their applications in clinical MRI are highly restricted by the inhomogeneous enhancement of the magnetic field and interference in the radio frequency (RF) transmitting field. In this study, an adaptive cylindrical wireless metasurface (ACWM) with homogeneous field enhancement and adaptive resonant modes is reported. The ACWM automatically switches its resonant modes between the partial (transmitting period) and whole (receiving period) resonance, which enables it to not only eliminate the interference in RF transmitting field, but also greatly enhance the SNR. Its adaptability also makes the ACWM applicable to all common clinical sequences without any modifications in the scan parameters. The SNR of MRI images of the human wrist, acquired with ACWM, is two to four times compared with the conventional coil. This work offers a practical control method to fill the scientific knowledge gaps between the preclinical research and medical applications for metasurfaces, and suggests a novel and powerful tool for diagnosing and evaluating human diseases.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Derived Nanoparticles with Notch&#8208;1 Suppressor Delivery Promote Hypoxic Cell&#8211;Cell Packing and Inhibit Angiogenesis Acting as a Two&#8208;Edged Sword</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;derived nanoparticles (CMNPs) promote physical tightening of cell&#8211;cell interactions and cell packing, thereby inducing hypoxia as a favorable setting for cancer progression and cartilage development. The conjugation of aptamers to CMNPs suppresses Notch&#8208;1 signaling&#8208;mediated angiogenesis with consequent activation of anti&#8208;cancer and chondroprotective effects (&#8220;two&#8208;edged sword&#8221;) in a xenograft model of human laryngeal cancer.








Abstract
Cell&#8211;cell interactions regulate intracellular signaling via reciprocal contacts of cell membranes in tissue regeneration and cancer growth, indicating a critical need of membrane&#8208;derived tools in studying these processes. Hence, cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;derived nanoparticles (CMNPs) are produced using tonsil&#8208;derived mesenchymal stem cells (TMSCs) from children owing to their short doubling time. As target cell types, laryngeal cancer cells are compared to&#160;bone&#8208;marrow&#8208;derived MSCs (BMSCs) because of their cartilage damaging and chondrogenic characteristics, respectively. Treating spheroids of these cell types with CMNPs exacerbates&#160;interspheroid&#160;hypoxia with robust maintenance of the cell&#8211;cell interaction signature for 7 days. Both cell types prefer a hypoxic environment, as opposed to blood vessel formation that is absent in cartilage but is required for cancer growth. Hence, angiogenesis is inhibited by displaying the Notch&#8208;1 aptamer on CMNPs. Consequently, laryngeal cancer growth is suppressed efficiently in contrast to improved chondroprotection observed in a series of cell and animal experiments using a xenograft mouse model of laryngeal cancer.&#160;Altogether, CMNPs execute&#160;a two&#8208;edged sword function of&#160;inducing hypoxic cell&#8211;cell packing, followed by suppressing angiogenesis to promote&#160;laryngeal cancer death and chondrogenesis&#160;simultaneously.&#160;This study presents a previously unexplored therapeutic strategy for anti&#8208;cancer and chondroprotective treatment using CMNPs.

         <title>Exceptionally High Blocking Temperature of 17 K in a Surface&#8208;Supported Molecular Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;monolayers of Dy2@C80(CH2Ph) dimetallofullerene single&#8208;molecule magnets are prepared on a graphene monolayer by electrospray deposition. Magnetic hysteresis and relaxation time measurements show that the magnetic moment remains stable for 100 s at 17 K, marking the blocking temperature TB(100), being not only in excellent agreement with that of the bulk but also representing by far the highest one detected for a surface&#8208;supported single&#8208;molecule magnet.








Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) are among the most promising building blocks for future magnetic data storage or quantum computing applications, owing to magnetic bistability and long magnetic relaxation times. The practical device integration requires realization of 2D surface assemblies of SMMs, where each magnetic unit shows magnetic relaxation being sufficiently slow at application&#8208;relevant temperatures. Using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism, it is shown that sub&#8208;monolayers of Dy2@C80(CH2Ph) dimetallofullerenes prepared on graphene by electrospray deposition exhibit magnetic behavior fully comparable to that of the bulk. Magnetic hysteresis and relaxation time measurements show that the magnetic moment remains stable for 100 s at 17 K, marking the blocking temperature TB(100), being not only in excellent agreement with that of the bulk sample but also representing by far the highest one detected for a surface&#8208;supported single&#8208;molecule magnet. The reported findings give a boost to the efforts to stabilize and address the spin degree of freedom in molecular magnets aiming at the realization of SMM&#8208;based spintronic units.

         <title>Evaporation&#8208;Induced rGO Coatings for Highly Sensitive and Non&#8208;Invasive Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer in the PSA Gray Zone</title>

A circulating tumor cell (CTC)&#8208;chip based on evaporation&#8208;induced wrinkled reduced graphene oxide coating can achieve highly sensitive and non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of prostate cancer in the prostate&#8208;specific antigen (PSA) gray zone. Compared with the low diagnostic sensitivity (58.3%) of regular PSA&#8208;based tests, a combination of CTC detection and PSA&#8208;based tests via machine&#8208;learning analysis can greatly upgrade the diagnostic sensitivity of this disease to 91.7%.








Abstract
The prostate&#8208;specific antigen (PSA) has been widely used for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer during routine check&#8208;ups. However, the low sensitivity of regular PSA tests in the PSA gray zone often means that patients are required to undergo further invasive needle biopsy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, which may lead to potential overdiagnosis and overtreatment. In this study, a circulating tumor cell (CTC)&#8208;chip based on an evaporation&#8208;induced reduced graphene oxide (rGO) coating is presented, which enables a highly specific and non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of prostate cancer in the PSA gray zone. During the evaporation process of the rGO dispersion, the Marangoni effect induces the self&#8208;assembly of a hierarchical micro/nanowrinkled rGO coating, which can capture CTCs after subsequent surface modification of capture agents. Compared to the low diagnostic sensitivity (58.3%) of regular PSA tests, a combination of CTC detection and PSA&#8208;based hematological tests via machine&#8208;learning analysis can greatly upgrade the diagnostic sensitivity of this disease to 91.7% in clinical trial. Therefore, this study provides a non&#8208;invasive alternative with high sensitivity for the diagnosis of prostate cancer in the PSA gray zone.

         <title>Fused&#8208;Silica 3D Chiral Metamaterials via Helium&#8208;Assisted Microcasting Supporting Topologically Protected Twist Edge Resonances with High Mechanical Quality Factors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel helium&#8208;assisted microcasting approach is introduced to fabricate 3D fused&#8208;silica microstructures. For a 3D chiral fused&#8208;silica metamaterial beam, the existence of topologically protected twist&#8208;edge resonances with large mechanical quality factors of 2850 is demonstrated. The microcasting approach can likely be translated to many other materials, and to complex architectures that are not amenable to direct 3D laser printing.








Abstract
It is predicted theoretically that a 1D diatomic chain of 3D chiral cells can support a topological bandgap that allows for translating a small time&#8208;harmonic axial movement at one end of the chain into a resonantly enhanced large rotation of an edge state at the other end. This edge state is topologically protected such that an arbitrary mass of a mirror at the other end does not shift the eigenfrequency out of the bandgap. Herein, this complex 3D laser&#8208;beam&#8208;scanner microstructure is realized in fused&#8208;silica form. A novel microcasting approach is introduced that starts from a hollow polymer cast made by standard 3D laser nanoprinting. The cast is evacuated and filled with helium, such that a highly viscous commercial glass slurry is sucked in. After UV curing and thermal debinding of the polymer, the fused&#8208;silica glass is sintered at 1225&#160;&#176;C under vacuum. Detailed optical measurements reveal a mechanical quality factor of the twist&#8208;edge resonance of 2850 at around 278&#160;kHz resonance frequency under ambient conditions. The microcasting approach can likely be translated to many other glasses, to metals and ceramics, and to complex architectures that are not or not yet amenable to direct 3D laser printing.

         <title>Manipulating the Local Coordination and Electronic Structures for Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic Ni&#8211;Fe selenide&#8208;derived (oxy)hydroxide nanocage electrocatalysts are in situ generated by inheriting the structure of the pre&#8208;catalyst. The successful manipulation of the local coordination and electronic structures of the electrocatalyst enables superior electrocatalytic activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based nanomaterials can exhibit extraordinary electrocatalytic performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by harnessing the structural evolution during catalysis and the synergistic effect between elements. However, the structure of active centers in bimetallic/multimetallic catalysts is under long&#8208;time debate in the catalysis community. Here, an efficient bimetallic Ni&#8211;Fe selenide&#8208;derived OER electrocatalyst is reported and the structure&#8211;activity correlation during the OER evolution studied. By combining experiments and theoretical calculations,&#160;a conceptual advance is provided, in that the local coordination structure distortion and disordering of active sites inherited from the pre&#8208;catalyst and post&#8208;formed by a further reconstruction are responsible for boosting the OER performance. The active center is identified on Ni sites showing moderate bindings with oxygenous intermediates rather than Fe sites with strong and poisonous adsorptions. These findings provide crucial understanding in manipulating the local coordination and electronic structures toward rational design and fabrication of efficient OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Optimizing Electronic Quality Factor toward High&#8208;Performance Ge1&#8722;x&#8722;yTaxSbyTe Thermoelectrics: The Role of Transition Metal Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nexus between electronic quality factor and thermoelectric figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;doped GeTe, which can serve as a facile yet efficient descriptor for high&#8208;throughput screening of good thermoelectric materials, is explained. To clarify this point, Ta&#8208;doped GeTe is designed with optimized electronic quality factor, rendering a figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit over 2.0 and a conceptional efficiency over 15%.








Abstract
Owing to high intrinsic figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit implemented by multi&#8208;band valleytronics, GeTe&#8208;based thermoelectric materials are promising for medium&#8208;temperature applications. Transition metals are widely used as dopants for developing high&#8208;performance GeTe thermoelectric materials. Herein, relevant work is critically reviewed to establish a correlation among transition metal doping, electronic quality factor, and figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit of GeTe. From first&#8208;principle calculations, it is found that Ta, as an undiscovered dopant in GeTe, can effectively converge energy offset between light and heavy conduction band extrema to enhance effective mass at high temperature. Such manipulation is verified by the increased Seebeck coefficient of synthesized Ge1&#8722;x&#8722;yTaxSbyTe samples from 160 to 180 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at 775 K upon doping Ta, then to 220 &#181;V K&#8722;1 with further alloying Sb. Characterization using electron microscopy also reveals the unique herringbone structure associated with multi&#8208;scale lattice defects induced by Ta doping, which greatly hinder phonon propagation to decrease thermal conductivity. As a result, a figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit of &#8776;2.0 is attained in the Ge0.88Ta0.02Sb0.10Te sample, reflecting a maximum heat&#8208;to&#8208;electricity efficiency up to 17.7% under a temperature gradient of 400 K. The rationalized beneficial effects stemming from Ta doping is an important observation that will stimulate new exploration toward high&#8208;performance GeTe&#8208;based thermoelectric materials.

         <title>A Powerful One&#8208;Step Puffing Carbonization Method for Construction of Versatile Carbon Composites with High&#8208;Efficiency Energy Storage</title>

         <dc:description>
A powerful one&#8208;step puffing carbonization technology is proposed to synthesize versatile multiscale carbon&#8208;based composites (e.g. carbon/metal oxides, carbon/metal carbides, carbon/metal sulfides, carbon/metals, metal/semiconductors, etc.) with controlled morphology, adjustable dimensions and tunable composition on a large scale. As a representative example, a sulfur&#8208;doped cross&#8208;linked puffed carbon (SCPC)/Li2S electrode shows extraordinary performance with superior rate capability and ultrastable cycling life.








Abstract
Carbon materials play a critical role in the advancement of electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Currently, it is still a great challenge to fabricate versatile carbon&#8208;based composites with controlled morphology, adjustable dimension, and tunable composition by a one&#8208;step synthesis process. In this work, a powerful one&#8208;step maltose&#8208;based puffing carbonization technology is reported to construct multiscale carbon&#8208;based composites on large scale.

&lt;p&gt;A powerful one-step puffing carbonization technology is proposed to synthesize versatile multiscale carbon-based composites (e.g. carbon/metal oxides, carbon/metal carbides, carbon/metal sulfides, carbon/metals, metal/semiconductors, etc.) with controlled morphology, adjustable dimensions and tunable composition on a large scale. As a representative example, a sulfur-doped cross-linked puffed carbon (SCPC)/Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S electrode shows extraordinary performance with superior rate capability and ultrastable cycling life.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon materials play a critical role in the advancement of electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Currently, it is still a great challenge to fabricate versatile carbon-based composites with controlled morphology, adjustable dimension, and tunable composition by a one-step synthesis process. In this work, a powerful one-step maltose-based puffing carbonization technology is reported to construct multiscale carbon-based composites on large scale. A quantity of composite examples (e.g., carbon/metal oxides, carbon/metal nitrides, carbon/metal carbides, carbon/metal sulfides, carbon/metals, metal/semiconductors, carbon/carbons) are prepared and demonstrated with required properties. These well-designed composites show advantages of large porosity, hierarchical porous structure, high conductivity, tunable components, and proportion. The formation mechanism of versatile carbon composites is attributed to the puffing-carbonization of maltose plus in situ carbothermal reaction between maltose and precursors. As a representative example, Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is in situ implanted into a hierarchical porous cross-linked puffed carbon (CPC) matrix to verify its application in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The designed S-doped CPC/Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S cathode shows superior electrochemical performance with higher rate capacity (621 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 2 C), smaller polarization and enhanced long-term cycles as compared to other counterparts. The research provides a general way for the construction of multifunctional component-adjustable carbon composites for advanced energy storage and conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design of Highly Stable and Active MXene&#8208;Based Bifunctional ORR/OER Double&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni1/Ni2&#8208; and Fe1/Ni2&#8208;modified MXene&#8208;based double&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) show the most promising bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performances. The bifunctional catalytic activities of DACs improve with increasing strain. Theoretical models are presented for plotting the polarization curves of OER/ORR catalysis to demonstrate the bifunctional catalytic performance of the studied catalysts.








Abstract
Designing highly active and bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts has attracted great interest toward metal&#8211;air batteries. Herein, an efficient solution to the search for MXene&#8208;based bifunctional catalysts is proposed by introducing non&#8208;noble metals such as Fe/Co/Ni at the surfaces. These results indicate that the ultrahigh activities in Ni1/Ni2&#8208; and Fe1/Ni2&#8208;modified MXene&#8208;based double&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) for bifunctional ORR/OER are better than those of well&#8208;known unifunctional catalysts with low overpotentials, such as Pt(111) for the ORR and IrO2(110) for the OER. Strain can profoundly regulate the catalytic activities of MXene&#8208;based DACs, providing a novel pathway for tunable catalytic behavior in flexible MXenes. An electrochemical model, based on density functional theory and theoretical polarization curves, is proposed to reveal the underlying mechanisms, in agreement with experimental results. Electronic structure analyses indicate that the excellent catalytic activities in the MXene&#8208;based DACs are attributed to the electron&#8208;capturing capability and synergistic interactions between Fe/Co/Ni adsorbents and MXene substrate. These findings not only reveal promising candidates for MXene&#8208;based bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts but also provide new theoretical insights into rationally designing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free bifunctional DACs.

         <title>Orbital Angular Momentum from Self&#8208;Assembled Concentric Nanoparticle Rings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concentric rings of plasmonic nanoparticles are fabricated by self&#8208;assembling supramolecular nanocomposites on lithographically patterned surfaces. After assembly, the arrays of concentric rings generate high&#8208;quality orbital angular momentum (OAM). Due to their unique ability to self&#8208;regulate the distribution of each building block, supramolecular nanocomposites are a robust assembly platform. In this work, they accommodate variations in pattern dimension, nanoparticle loading, and nanoparticle ring size.








Abstract
Ring&#8208;shaped nanostructures can focus, filter, and manipulate electromagnetic waves, but are challenging to incorporate into devices using standard nanofabrication techniques. Directed self&#8208;assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) on lithographically patterned templates has successfully been used to fabricate concentric rings and spirals as etching masks. However, this method is limited by BCP phase behavior and material selection. Here, a straightforward approach to generate ring&#8208;shaped nanoparticle assemblies in thin films of supramolecular nanocomposites is demonstrated. DSA is used to guide the formation of concentric rings with radii spanning 150&#8211;1150&#160;nm and ring widths spanning 30&#8211;60&#160;nm. When plasmonic nanoparticles are used, ring nanodevice arrays can be fabricated in one step, and the completed devices produce high&#8208;quality orbital angular momentum (OAM). Nanocomposite DSA simplifies and streamlines nanofabrication by producing metal structures without etching or deposition steps; it also introduces interparticle coupling as a new design axis. Detailed analysis of the nanoparticle ring assemblies confirms that the supramolecular system self&#8208;regulates the spatial distribution of its components, and thus exhibits a degree of flexibility absent in DSA of BCPs alone, where structures are determined by polymer&#8208;pattern incommensurability. The present studies also provide guidelines for developing self&#8208;regulating DSA as an alternative to incommensurability&#8208;driven methods.

         <title>A Supramolecular Antidote to Macromolecular Toxins Prepared through Coassembly of Macrocyclic Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular detoxification is an emerging strategy for treating poisoning; however, developing supramolecular therapeutic materials as an antidote to macromolecular toxins is challenging. To overcome this challenge, a heteromultivalent coassembling material (CCA&#8208;CD) comprising macrocyclic amphiphiles is developed. The CCA&#8208;CD binds with melittin strongly and selectively, and significantly alleviates its toxicity, serving as a novel supramolecular antidote used for melittin poisoning treatment.








Abstract
Poisoning is a leading cause of admission to medical emergency departments and intensive care units. Supramolecular detoxification, which involves injecting supramolecular receptors that bind with toxins to suppress their biological activity, is an emerging strategy for poisoning treatment; it has few requirements and a broad application scope. However, it is still a formidable challenge to design supramolecular therapeutic materials as an antidote to macromolecular toxins, because the large size, flexible conformation, and presence of multiple and diverse binding sites of biomacromolecules hinder their recognition. Herein, a supramolecular antidote to macromolecular toxins is developed through the coassembly of macrocyclic amphiphiles, relying on heteromultivalent recognition between the coassembled components and toxic macromolecules. The coassembly of amphiphilic cyclodextrin and calixarene strongly and selectively captures melittin, a toxin studied herein; this imparts various therapeutic effects such as inhibiting the interactions of melittin with cell membranes, alleviating melittin cytotoxicity and hemolytic toxicity, reducing the mortality rate of melittin&#8208;poisoned mice, and mitigating damage to major organs. The use of the proposed antidote overcomes the limitation of supramolecular detoxification applicability to only small&#8208;molecular toxins. The antidote can also detoxify other macromolecular toxins as long as selective and strong binding is achieved because of the coassembling tunability.

         <title>3D Temporary&#8208;Magnetized Soft Robotic Structures for Enhanced Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a mechanically guided, compressive&#8208;buckling process, a set of judiciously engineered 3D soft robotic structures can be developed based on magnetic materials. Under the precise control of the external magnetic&#8208;field, the temporary&#8208;magnetized 3D structures can achieve various tethered locomotion. Further integration with functional devices (piezoelectric energy harvester, solar cell) allows for enhanced energy harvesting, and potentially multimodal sensing and robotic interfaces.








Abstract
The advent of functional materials offers tremendous potential in a broad variety of areas such as electronics, robotics, and energy devices. Magnetic materials are an attractive candidate that enable multifunctional devices with capabilities in both sensing and actuation. However, current magnetic devices, especially those with complex motion modalities, rely on permanently magnetized materials with complicated, non&#8208;uniform magnetization profiles. Here, based on magnetic materials with temporary&#8208;magnetization, a mechanically guided assembly process successfully converts laser&#8208;patterned 2D magnetic materials into judiciously engineered 3D structures, with dimensions and geometries ranging from mesoscale 3D filaments, to arrayed centimeter&#8208;scale 3D membranes. With tailorable mechanical properties and highly adjustable geometries, 3D soft structures can exhibit various tethered locomotions under the precise control of magnetic fields, including local deformation, unidirectional tilting, and omnidirectional rotation, and can serve as dynamic surfaces for further integration with other functional materials or devices. Examples demonstrated here focus on energy&#8208;harvesting systems, including 3D piezoelectric devices for noncontact conversion of mechanical energy and active motion sensing, as well as 3D solar tracking systems. The design strategy and resulting magnetic&#8208;controlled 3D soft structures hold great promise not only for enhanced energy harvesting, but also for multimodal sensing, robotic interfaces, and biomedical devices.

With tailorable mechanical properties and highly adjustable geometries, 3D soft structures can exhibit various tethered locomotions under the precise control of magnetic fields, including local deformation, unidirectional tilting, and omnidirectional rotation, and can serve as dynamic surfaces for further integration with other functional materials or devices. Examples demonstrated here focus on energy-harvesting systems, including 3D piezoelectric devices for noncontact conversion of mechanical energy and active motion sensing, as well as 3D solar tracking systems. The design strategy and resulting magnetic-controlled 3D soft structures hold great promise not only for enhanced energy harvesting, but also for multimodal sensing, robotic interfaces, and biomedical devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sweet Electronics: Honey&#8208;Gated Complementary Organic Transistors and Circuits Operating in Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of edible electronics devices requires unconventional solutions, in particular, the use of functional food&#8208;based materials in the design. An inherently safe and nutritive compound, honey, is hereby proposed as an effective gating medium for the realization of air&#8208;stable complementary organic transistors and circuits operating at low voltage (&lt;1&#160;V) and featuring other distinctive electronic functionalities.








Abstract
Sustainable harnessing of natural resources is key moving toward a new&#8208;generation electronics, which features a unique combination of electronic functionality, low cost, and absence of environmental and health hazards. Within this framework, edible electronics, of which transistors and circuits are a fundamental component, is an emerging field, exploiting edible materials that can be safely ingested, and subsequently digested after performing their function. Dielectrics are a critical functional element of transistors, often constituting their major volume. Yet, to date, there are only scarce examples of electrolytic food&#8208;based materials able to provide low&#8208;voltage operation of transistors at ambient conditions. In this context, a cost&#8208;effective and edible substance, honey, is proposed to be used as an electrolytic gate viscous dielectric in electrolyte&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). Both n&#8208; and p&#8208;type honey&#8208;gated OFETs (HGOFETs) are demonstrated, with distinctive features such as low voltage (&lt;1 V)&#160;operation, long&#8208;term shelf life and operation stability in air, and compatibility with large&#8208;area fabrication processes, such as inkjet printing on edible tattoo&#8208;paper. Such complementary devices enable robust honey&#8208;based integrated logic circuits, here exemplified by inverting logic gates and ring oscillators. A marked device responsivity to humidity provides promising opportunities for sensing applications, specifically, for moisture control of dried or dehydrated food.

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Organic Core/Multi&#8208;Shell Microwires for Trichromatic White&#8208;Light Sources</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through regulating the noncovalent interactions between organic semiconductor molecules (|ECT, DgpC&#8208;TCNB = &#8722;18.35&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1|&#160;&gt;&#160;|ECT, DgpC&#8208;TFP = &#8722;13.45&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1|&#160;&gt;&#160;|E&#960;&#8211;&#960;, DgpC = &#8722;6.81&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1|), a hierarchical self&#8208;assembly approach of horizontal epitaxial&#8208;growth is demonstrated for the precise synthesis of organic core/double&#8208;shell microwires with radial red&#8211;green&#8211;blue (RGB) substructures for miniaturized white&#8208;light sources (CIE [0.34, 0.36]).








Abstract
White&#8208;light&#8208;emissive organic micro/nanostructures hold exotic potential applications in full&#8208;color displays, on&#8208;chip wavelength&#8208;division multiplexing, and backlights of portable display devices, but are rarely realized in organic core/shell heterostructures. Herein, through regulating the noncovalent interactions between organic semiconductor molecules, a hierarchical self&#8208;assembly approach of horizontal epitaxial&#8208;growth is demonstrated for the fine synthesis of organic core/mono&#8208;shell microwires with multicolor emission (red&#8211;green, red&#8211;blue, and green&#8211;blue) and especially organic core/double&#8208;shell microwires with radial red&#8211;green&#8211;blue (RGB) emission, whose components are dibenzo[g,p]chrysene (DgpC)&#8208;based charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes. In fact, the desired lattice mismatching (&#8776;2%) and the excellent structure compatibility of these CT complexes facilitate the epitaxial&#8208;growth process for the facile synthesis of organic core/shell microwires. With the RGB&#8208;emissive substructures, these core/double&#8208;shell organic microwires are microscale white&#8208;light sources (CIE [0.34, 0.36]). Besides, the white&#8208;emissive core/double&#8208;shell microwires demonstrate the fascinating full&#8208;spectrum light transportation from 400 to 700&#160;nm. This work indeed opens up a novel avenue for the accurate construction of organic core/shell heterostructures, which provides an attractive platform for the organic integrated optoelectronics.

         <title>Time&#8211;Temperature Integrating Optical Sensors Based on Gradient Colloidal Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A colloidal stopband&#8208;based time&#8211;temperature integrator is introduced, which can monitor the thermal history of a specific system over an adjustable time and temperature range. The fabrication of a binary colloidal crystal gradient comprising same&#8208;sized, monodisperse particles with distinct glass transition temperatures are the key components for this type of integrating sensor.








Abstract
Manipulation&#8208;free and autonomous recording of temperature states for extended periods of time is of increasing importance for food spoilage and battery safety assessment. An optical readout is preferred for low&#8208;tech visual inspection. Here, a concept for time&#8211;temperature integrators based on colloidal crystals is introduced. Two unique features in this class of advanced materials are combined: 1) the film&#8208;formation kinetics can be controlled by orders of magnitude based on mixtures of particles with distinct glass transition temperatures. 2) A gradual variation of the particle mixture along a linear gradient of the colloidal crystal enables local readout. Tailor&#8208;made latex particles of identical size but different glass transition temperatures provide a homogenous photonic stopband. The disappearance of this opalescence is directly related to the local particle ratio and the exposure to a time and temperature combination. This sensing material can be adjusted to report extended intermediate and short excessive temperature events, which makes it specifically suitable for long&#8208;term tracing and threshold applications.

         <title>3D Printing of Elastomeric Bioinspired Complex Adhesive Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D&#8208;printing&#8208;based fabrication approach is utilized for creating complex elastomeric microstructural adhesives directly. Two hybrid bioinspired structure designs are demonstrated, combining the strengths of gecko&#8208;inspired microfiber adhesives with springtail&#8208; and octopus&#8208;inspired microstructures to enable complex adhesives toward various real&#8208;world applications.








Abstract
Bioinspired elastomeric structural adhesives can provide reversible and controllable adhesion on dry/wet and synthetic/biological surfaces for a broad range of commercial applications. Shape complexity and performance of the existing structural adhesives are limited by the used specific fabrication technique, such as molding. To overcome these limitations by proposing complex 3D microstructured adhesive designs, a 3D elastomeric microstructure fabrication approach is implemented using two&#8208;photon&#8208;polymerization&#8208;based 3D printing. A custom aliphatic urethane&#8208;acrylate&#8208;based elastomer is used as the 3D printing material. Two designs are demonstrated with two combined biological inspirations to show the advanced capabilities enabled by the proposed fabrication approach and custom elastomer. The first design focuses on springtail&#8208; and gecko&#8208;inspired hybrid microfiber adhesive, which has the multifunctionalities of side&#8208;surface liquid super&#8208;repellency, top&#8208;surface liquid super&#8208;repellency, and strong reversible adhesion features in a single fiber array. The second design primarily centers on octopus&#8208; and gecko&#8208;inspired hybrid adhesive, which exhibits the benefits of both octopus&#8208; and gecko&#8208;inspired microstructured adhesives for strong reversible adhesion on both wet and dry surfaces, such as skin. This fabrication approach could be used to produce many other 3D complex elastomeric structural adhesives for future real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Crosslinked Dynamic Hydrogel Incorporating {Mo154} with pH and NIR Responsiveness for Chemo&#8208;Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual pH&#8208; and near infra&#8208;red (NIR)&#8208;responsive hydrogel is developed composed of benzylaldehyde functionalized poly(ethylene glycol), poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) functionalized chitosan, and a polyoxometalate {Mo154}. Crosslinked by Schiff base and electrostatic interactions, the hydrogel has dynamic networks, injectability, and fast self&#8208;healing properties. Combining doxorubicin and NIR laser irradiation, the hydrogel shows thermal ablation of cancer cells and simultaneous release of drugs for chemo&#8208;photothermal therapy.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates are an emerging class of molecular clusters, with well&#8208;defined structures and chemical compositions that are produced through simple, low&#8208;cost, and highly reproducible methods. In particular, the wheel&#8208;shaped cluster {Mo154} is a promising photothermal agent due to its intervalence charge transfer transitions. However, its toxicity hinders its systemic administration, being the development of a localized delivery system still incipient. Herein, an injectable and self&#8208;healing hydrogel of easy preparation and administration is developed, incorporating both {Mo154} and doxorubicin for synergistic photothermal and chemotherapy applications. The hydrogel is composed of benzylaldehyde functionalized polyethylene glycol, poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) functionalized chitosan and {Mo154}. The gelation occurs within 60&#160;s at room temperature, and the dual crosslinking by Schiff base and electrostatic interactions generates a dynamic network, which enables self&#8208;healing after injection. Moreover, the hydrogel delivers chemotherapeutic drugs, with a release triggered by dual near infra&#8208;red (NIR) radiation and pH changes. This stimuli&#8208;responsive release system along with the photothermal conversion ability of the hydrogel allows the simultaneous combination of photothermal and chemotherapy. This synergic system efficiently ablates the cancer tumor in vivo with no systemic toxicity. Overall, this work paves the way for the development of novel {Mo154}&#8208;based systems, incorporated in self&#8208;healing and injectable hydrogels for dual chemo&#8208;photothermal therapy.

         <title>Antibacterial Gel Coatings Inspired by the Cryptic Function of a Mussel Byssal Peptide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In addition to its role in wet adhesion, it is discovered that a peptide (Mfp&#8208;529&#8208;47) derived from the foot pad of mussels exhibits cryptic antibacterial activity. This discovery inspires the design of antibacterial adhesive hydrogels that kill bacteria by two mechanisms: surface&#8208;contact membrane disruption and oxidative killing. The lead material, MIKA2, inhibits bacterial colonization on titanium implants in mice.








Abstract
Although the adhesive and cohesive nature of mussel byssal proteins have long served to inspire the design of materials embodying these properties, their characteristic amino acid compositions suggest that they might also serve to inspire an unrelated material function not yet associated with this class of protein. Herein, it is demonstrated that a peptide derived from mussel foot protein&#8208;5, a key protein in mussel adhesion, displays antibacterial properties, a yet unreported activity. This cryptic function serves as inspiration for the design of a new class of peptide&#8208;based antibacterial adhesive hydrogels prepared via self&#8208;assembly, which are active against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. The gels exert two mechanisms of action, surface&#8208;contact membrane disruption and oxidative killing affected by material&#8208;produced H2O2. Detailed studies relating amino acid composition and sequence to material mechanical adhesion/cohesion and antibacterial activity affords the MIKA2 adhesive gel, a material with a superior activity that is shown to inhibit colonization of titanium implants in mice.

         <title>Monte Carlo Simulations Reveal New Design Principles for Efficient Nanoradiosensitizers Based on Nanoscale Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation study reveals nanoscale metal&#8211;organic frameworks (nMOFs) as superior radiosensitizers over non&#8208;porous nanoparticles. The porous lattice model shows improved radiosensitization regardless of radiation source and lattice size. An optimal dose enhancement can be achieved by tuning the geometry of the lattice, providing the theoretical basis for the design of nMOFs for radiotherapy.








Abstract
Nanoscale metal&#8211;organic frameworks (nMOFs) have recently been shown to provide better radiosensitization than solid nanoparticles (NPs) when excited with X&#8208;rays. Here, a Monte Carlo simulation of different radiosensitization effects by NPs and nMOFs using a lattice model consisting of 3D arrays of nanoscale secondary building units (SBUs) is reported. The simulation results reveal that lattices outperform solid NPs regardless of radiation sources or particle sizes via enhanced scatterings of photons and electrons within the lattices. Optimum dose enhancement can be achieved by tuning SBU size and inter&#8208;SBU distance.

         <title>Cactus&#8208;Spine&#8208;Inspired Sweat&#8208;Collecting Patch for Fast and Continuous Monitoring of Sweat</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sweat&#8208;collecting patch with high sweat&#8208;collection efficiency is developed. The patch uses cactus&#8208;spine&#8208;inspired wedge&#8208;shaped wettability&#8208;patterned channels, which induce a unidirectional Laplace pressure that transports the sweat to the sensing&#8208;area spontaneously without leaving it inside the channel. A sensor based on the patch responds quickly to biochemicals in sweat and the patch enables the continuous monitoring of biochemical changes in sweat.








Abstract
A sweat sensor is expected to be the most appropriate wearable device for noninvasive healthcare monitoring. However, the practical use of sweat sensors is impeded by irregular and low sweat secretion rates. Here, a sweat&#8208;collecting patch that can collect sweat efficiently for fast and continuous healthcare monitoring is demonstrated. The patch uses cactus&#8208;spine&#8208;inspired wedge&#8208;shaped wettability&#8208;patterned channels on a hierarchical microstructured/nanostructured surface. The channel shape, in combination with the superhydrophobic/superhydrophilic surface materials, induces a unidirectional Laplace pressure that transports the sweat to the sensing area spontaneously even when the patch is aligned vertically. The patch demonstrates superior sweat&#8208;collecting efficiency and reduces the time required to fill the sensing area by transporting sweat almost without leaving it inside the channel. Therefore, a sensor based on the patch responds quickly to biochemicals in sweat, and the patch enables the continuous monitoring of changes in sweat biochemicals according to their changes in the wearer's blood.

         <title>Engineered Extracellular Matrices with Integrated Wireless Microactuators to Study Mechanobiology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in vitro biomimetic platform that provides independent control over geometry, mechanics, and structure over extracellular matrices is introduced. Remote application of forces using robotically controlled magnetic microactuators triggers native mechanobiology responses including intracellular signaling and directed migration. A digital twin complements the platform by reporting stresses generated upon actuation.








Abstract
Mechanobiology explores how forces regulate cell behaviors and what molecular machinery are responsible for the sensing, transduction, and modulation of mechanical cues. To this end, probing of cells cultured on planar substrates has served as a primary experimental setting for many decades. However, native extracellular matrices (ECMs) consist of fibrous protein assemblies where the physical properties spanning from the individual fiber to the network architecture can influence the transmission of forces to and from the cells. Here, a robotic manipulation platform that allows wireless, localized, and programmable deformation of an engineered fibrous ECM is introduced. A finite&#8208;element&#8208;based digital twin of the fiber network calibrated against measured local and global parameters enables the calculation of deformations and stresses generated by different magnetic actuation schemes across a range of network properties. Physiologically relevant mechanical forces are applied to cells cultured on the fiber network, statically or dynamically, revealing insights into the effects of matrix&#8208;borne forces and deformations as well as force&#8208;mediated matrix remodeling on cell migration and intracellular signaling. These capabilities are not matched by any existing approach, and this versatile platform has the potential to uncover fundamental mechanisms of mechanobiology in settings with greater relevance to living tissues.

         <title>Promoting Energy Transfer via Manipulation of Crystallization Kinetics of Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskites for Efficient Green Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homogeneous distribution of different&#8208;n phases and more efficient energy transfer is realized in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites. The origin is found to be the manipulation of the crystallization kinetics, where the addition of potassium restricts the nucleation of high&#8208;n phases and allows the growth of low&#8208;n phases, resulting in an external quantum efficiency of 18.15%.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D (Q&#8208;2D) perovskites are promising materials applied in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) due to their high exciton binding energy and quantum confinement effects. However, Q&#8208;2D perovskites feature a multiphase structure with abundant grain boundaries and interfaces, leading to nonradiative loss during the energy&#8208;transfer process. Here, a more efficient energy transfer in Q&#8208;2D perovskites is achieved by manipulating the crystallization kinetics of different&#8208;n phases. A series of alkali&#8208;metal bromides is utilized to manipulate the nucleation and growth of Q&#8208;2D perovskites, which is likely associated with the Coulomb interaction between alkali&#8208;metal ions and the negatively charged PbBr64&#8211; frames. The incorporation of K+ is found to restrict the nucleation of high&#8208;n phases and allows the subsequent growth of low&#8208;n phases, contributing to a spatially more homogeneous distribution of different&#8208;n phases and promoted energy transfer. As a result, highly efficient green Q&#8208;2D perovskites LEDs with a champion EQE of 18.15% and a maximum brightness of 25 800&#160;cd m&#8211;2 are achieved. The findings affirm a novel method to optimize the performance of Q&#8208;2D perovskite LEDs.

         <title>An Optogenetics&#8208;Inspired Flexible van der Waals Optoelectronic Synapse and its Application to a Convolutional Neural Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible van der Waals (vdW) optoelectronic synapse fabricated on 2D vdW layered rhenium disulfide, which features an inherent photosensitive memory nature derived from the persistent photoconductivity effect, is proposed. Following in&#8208;depth analysis including density functional theory calculations on rhenium disulfide, its feasibility for hardware neural networks with learning ability is demonstrated using a convolutional neural network composed of vdW optoelectronic synapses.








Abstract
Optogenetics refers to a technique that uses light to modulate neuronal activity with a high spatiotemporal resolution, which enables the manipulation of learning and memory functions in the human brain. This strategy of controlling neuronal activity using light can be applied for the development of intelligent systems, including neuromorphic and in&#8208;memory computing systems. Herein, a flexible van der Waals (vdW) optoelectronic synapse is reported, which is a core component of optogenetics&#8208;inspired intelligent systems. This synapse is fabricated on 2D vdW layered rhenium disulfide (ReS2) that features an inherent photosensitive memory nature derived from the persistent photoconductivity (PPC) effect, successfully mimicking the dynamics of biological synapses. Based on first&#8208;principles calculations, the PPC effect is identified to originate from sulfur vacancies in ReS2 that have an inherent tendency to form shallow defect states near the conduction band edges and under optical excitation lead to large lattice relaxation. Finally, the feasibility of applying the synapses in optogenetics&#8208;inspired intelligent systems is demonstrated via training and inference tasks for the CIFAR&#8208;10 dataset using a convolutional neural network composed of vdW optoelectronic synapse devices.

         <title>Spontaneous Topological Magnetic Transitions in NdCo5 Rare&#8208;Earth Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous magnetic biskyrmion lattices and the successive transformation into enclosed in&#8208;plane domains over a broad temperature range of 120&#8211;282 K is directly observed by in situ cooling a hexagonal rare&#8208;earth NdCo5 alloy in Lorentz TEM. The ability to manipulate topological magnetization by anisotropy invites application exploration of novel topological magnetic spin textures and physical mechanisms in rare&#8208;earth magnets.








Abstract
Particle&#8208;like magnetic textures with nanometric sizes, such as skyrmions, are potentially suitable for designing high&#8208;efficiency information bits in future spintronics devices. In general, the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions and dipolar interactions are the dominant factors for generating nonlinear spin configurations. However, to stabilize the topological skyrmions, an external magnetic field is usually required. In this study, the spontaneous emergence of skyrmions is directly observed, together with the unique successive topological domain evolution during the spin reorientation transition in a neodymium&#8211;cobalt (NdCo5) rare&#8208;earth magnet. On decreasing the temperature, nanometric skyrmion lattices evolve into enclosed in&#8208;plane domains (EIPDs) similar to mini bar&#8208;magnets with size below 120&#160;nm. The internal magnetization rotates with magnetic anisotropy, demonstrating the ability to manipulate the mini bar&#8208;magnets. The nanoscale EIPD lattices remain robust over the wide temperature range of 241&#8211;167 K, indicating the possibility of high&#8208;density in&#8208;plane magnetic information storage. The generation of spontaneous magnetic skyrmions and the successive domain transformation in the traditional NdCo5 rare&#8208;earth magnet may prompt application exploration for topological magnetic spin textures with novel physical mechanisms in versatile magnets.

         <title>Self&#8208;Induced Type&#8208;I Band Alignment at Surface Grain Boundaries for Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultralow surface temperature on perovskite films is constructed, then surface perovskite lattice is etched by the condensed moisture. Therefore, PbI2 is produced and type&#8208;I band alignment at the upper surface grain boundaries is formed, which significantly reduces the interface loss of carriers and improves the efficiency of perovskite solar cells to 23.2%.








Abstract
The open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is reported to be significantly weakened by carrier loss at the film surface. Here, the moisture condensation at only the upper surface of perovskite films is controlled by constructing an ultralow surface temperature. Then, type&#8208;I band alignment can be formed at the surface grain boundaries due to the etching effect of trace amounts of condensed moisture. The beneficially constructed surface type&#8208;I band alignment can effectively repel carriers and return them to the inside of the grain, significantly avoiding the carrier loss at films surface. As a result, a superior carrier lifetime exceeding 2.5&#160;&#181;s is obtained and the VOC of PSC is remarkably boosted from 1.07 to 1.17&#160;V. The minimum VOC deficit of only 0.39&#160;V enables a substantial gain in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 20.2% to 22.4% in one&#8208;step spin&#8208;coating methods. Moreover, this innovation is versatile and a champion PCE of 23.2% is also achieved in two&#8208;step spin&#8208;coating methods.

         <title>Reversible Dendritic&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Reinforced Polymer Gel for Bioinspired Adaptable Adhesive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystal&#8208;fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer gel adhesive is prepared by introducing room&#8208;temperature crystallizable solvent into the polymer network, realizing ultrastrong adhesion strength and universal interface adaptability. The adhesive ensures the high adhesion strength to the hard interface and excellent peeling toughness to soft biological tissues and can be adjusted via external stimuli, which achieves superior detachability and recycling performance.








Abstract
High&#8208;strength and reversible adhesion technology, which is a universal phenomenon in nature but remains challenging for artificial synthesis, is essential for the development of modern science. Existing adhesive designs without interface versatility hinder their application to arbitrary surfaces. Bioinspired by creeper suckers, a crystal&#8208;fiber reinforced polymer gel adhesive with ultrastrong adhesion strength and universal interface adaptability is creatively prepared via introducing a room&#8208;temperature crystallizable solvent into the polymer network. The gel adhesive formed by hydrogen bonding interaction between crystal fibers and polymer network can successfully realize over 9.82&#160;MPa reversible adhesion strength for rough interface and 406.87 J m&#8722;2 peeling toughness for skin tissue. In situ anchoring is achieved for adapting to different geometrical surfaces. The adhesion performance can be significantly improved with the further increase of the interfacial roughness and hydrophilicity, whose dissipation mechanism is simulated by finite element analysis. The melting&#8211;crystallization equilibrium of the crystal fibers is proved by synchrotron radiation scattering. Accordingly, reversible phase&#8208;transition triggered by light and heat can realize the controlled adhere&#8211;detach recycle. Later adjustments to the monomers or crystals are expected to broaden its applications to various fields such as bioelectronics, electronic processing, and machine handling.

         <title>A Micrometer&#8208;Sized Silicon/Carbon Composite Anode Synthesized by Impregnation of Petroleum Pitch in Nanoporous Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A micrometer&#8208;sized silicon/carbon composite anode developed by facile and scalable impregnation of petroleum pitch that stabilizes nanoporous Si against sintering at high temperature is reported. The composite anode including single nanometer&#8208;sized primary particles shielded by pitch&#8208;derived carbon exhibits outstanding battery performance such as 80% capacity retention after 450 cycles in the full cell system.








Abstract
Porous silicon (Si)/carbon nanocomposites have been extensively explored as a promising anode material for high&#8208;energy lithium (Li)&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, shrinking of the pores and sintering of Si in the nanoporous structure during fabrication often diminishes the full benefits of nanoporous Si. Herein, a scalable method is reported to preserve the porous Si nanostructure by impregnating petroleum pitch inside of porous Si before high&#8208;temperature treatment. The resulting micrometer&#8208;sized Si/C composite maintains a desired porosity to accommodate large volume change and high conductivity to facilitate charge transfer. It also forms a stable surface coating that limits the penetration of electrolyte into nanoporous Si and minimizes the side reaction between electrolyte and Si during cycling and storage. A Si&#8208;based anode with 80% of pitch&#8208;derived carbon/nanoporous Si enables very stable cycling of a Si||Li(Ni0.5Co0.2Mn0.3)O2 (NMC532) battery (80% capacity retention after 450 cycles). It also leads to low swelling in both particle and electrode levels required for the next generation of high&#8208;energy LIBs. The process also can be used to preserve the porous structure of other nanoporous materials that need to be treated at high temperatures.

         <title>Lithiation&#8208;Enabled High&#8208;Density Nitrogen Vacancies Electrocatalyze CO2 to C2 Products</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to produce C2 products is attractive but is still challenged by low activity and poor selectivity. A Cu3Nx catalyst with abundant nitrogen vacancies induced by lithiation/delithiation presents a much&#8208;improved Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;82% for C2 products due to the lower energy barriers of the key C2 pathway intermediates.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to produce valuable C2 products is attractive but still suffers with relatively poor selectivity and stability at high current densities, mainly due to the low efficiency in the coupling of two *CO intermediates. Herein, it is demonstrated that high&#8208;density nitrogen vacancies formed on cubic copper nitrite (Cu3Nx) feature as efficient electrocatalytic centers for CO&#8211;CO coupling to form the key OCCO* intermediate toward C2 products. Cu3Nx with different nitrogen densities are fabricated by an electrochemical lithium tuning strategy, and density functional theory calculations indicate that the adsorption energies of CO* and the energy barriers of forming key C2 intermediates are strongly correlated with nitrogen vacancy density. The Cu3Nx catalyst with abundant nitrogen vacancies presents one of the highest Faradaic efficiencies toward C2 products of 81.7&#160;&#177; 2.3% at &#8722;1.15&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (without ohmic correction), corresponding to the partial current density for C2 production as &#8722;307&#160;&#177; 9 mA cm&#8722;2. An outstanding electrochemical stability is also demonstrated at high current densities, substantially exceeding CuOx catalysts with oxygen vacancies. The work suggests an attractive approach to create stable anion vacancies as catalytic centers toward multicarbon products in electrochemical CO2 reduction.

         <title>Truth and Myth of Phase Coexistence in Methylammonium Lead Iodide Perovskite Thin Film via Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 40, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites have attracted substantial interest as the most favorable prospective material for efficient photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices. However, their extreme sensitivity to electron beam radiation makes it difficult to obtain their intrinsic structure by transmission electron microscopy and can even lead to significant misidentifications. In 2018, the coexistence of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) in the cubic and tetragonal phase using electron microscopy and electron diffraction techniques was reported in article &#8220;Self&#8208;Organized Superlattice and Phase Coexistence inside Thin Film Organometal Halide Perovskite&#8221;. Herein, however, that claim is challenged by comparing their experimental data to simulated diffraction patterns and arguing that their perovskite samples may have been damaged due to excessive electron beam irradiation. Consequently, true phase coexistence was not observed in that previously reported work, rather merely the decomposition products of MAPbI3.

Abstract
In response to the Comment on article &#8220;Self&#8208;Organized Superlattice and Phase Coexistence inside Thin Film Organometal Halide Perovskite&#8221;, it is suggested that the facts that the existence of hexagonal PbI2 is discrepant in 3D crystallographic interpretation and that observation of (01&#175;0) and (100) reflections occurs in general, together make the challenges that were raised in the published Comment less convincing. In addition, a new transmission electron microscopy method using direction&#8208;selective electron beam damage of the organometal halide perovskite is disclosed.

Photothermal Materials
In article number 2007761, Shiqi Wang, H&#233;lder Santos, and co&#8208;workers introduce a polyoxometalate {Mo154}&#8208;incorporating, dual&#8208;crosslinked dynamic hydrogel (Mo154Gel) formed by Schiff base and electrostatic interactions. Mo154Gel shows exceptional photothermal conversion, and pH&#8208; and near&#8208;infrared&#8208;laser&#8208;triggered drug release. This work paves the way for the development of novel {Mo154}&#8208;based platforms incorporated in self&#8208;healing and injectable hydrogels for combinatorial chemo&#8208;photothermal cancer therapy.

Cancer Therapy
A two&#8208;edged&#8208;sword strategy for anticancer and chondroprotective treatment is approached by combining two key players, as reported by Mi&#8208;Lan Kang, Hak&#8208;Joon Sung, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2101558. Cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;derived nanoparticles (CMNPs) induce hypoxic cell&#8211;cell packing seen commonly in cancer growth and chondrogenesis. Notch&#8208;1 suppressor display on CMNPs inhibits angiogenesis efficiently, thereby promoting anticancer growth and prochondrogenesis simultaneously. This study suggests an unprecedented therapeutic strategy for laryngeal cancer which damages cartilage progressively.

Tendon Repair
Piezoelectricity is present in all living beings and provides the basis for mechanisms of tissue regeneration. In article number 2008788, Marc A. Fernandez&#8208;Yague, Manus J. Biggs, and co&#8208;workers show that tendon cell function can be controlled by electrical stimulation and introduce a new implantable stimulator device powered by body movement paving the way for a new class of regenerative electrical therapies without the use of drugs or external stimulation.

Optoelectronic Synapses
In article number 2102980, a flexible optoelectronic synapse fabricated on 2D van der Waals (vdW) layered rhenium disulfide, which features an inherent photosensitive memory nature derived from the persistent photoconductivity effect, is presented by Yong&#8208;Hoon Kim, Jin&#8208;Hong Park, and co&#8208;workers. After in&#8208;depth analysis including density functional theory calculations on rhenium disulfide, its feasibility for a hardware neural network with learning ability is also demonstrated using a convolutional neural network composed of vdW optoelectronic synapses.

Noninvasive Healthcare Monitoring
In article number 2102740, Kilwon Cho and co&#8208;workers report a sweat&#8208;collecting patch with directional sweat transportation, enabling fast and continuous monitoring of sweat by a sensor. The wedge&#8208;shaped wettability patterns of the patch are inspired by spines of cacti; the channel shape, in combination with the superhydrophobic/superhydrophilic surface materials, induces a unidirectional Laplace pressure that transports the sweat to the sensing&#8208;area fast and spontaneously.

Collodial Gradient Materials
Colloidal gradient materials introduce local variation of the physical properties to well&#8208;established colloidal crystals. In article number 2101948, Markus Retsch and co&#8208;workers describe a method to fabricate such colloidal gradient materials. Using such structures as time&#8211;temperature integrating sensors is just one application that showcases the potential of this materials class.

         <title>Polymorphic Phases of Metal Chlorides in the Confined 2D Space of Bilayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Unprecedented two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal chloride structures were grown between sheets of bilayer graphene through intercalation of metal and chlorine atoms. Numerous spatially confined 2D phases of AlCl3 and CuCl2 distinct from their typical bulk forms were found, and the transformations between these new phases under the electron beam were directly observed by in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Our density functional theory calculations confirmed the metastability of the atomic structures derived from the STEM experiments and provided insights into the electronic properties of the phases, which range from insulators to semimetals. Additionally, the co&#8208;intercalation of different metal chlorides was found to create completely new hybrid systems; in&#8208;plane quasi&#8208;1D AlCl3/CuCl2 heterostructures were obtained. The existence of polymorphic phases hints at the unique possibilities for fabricating new types of 2D materials with diverse electronic properties confined between graphene sheets.

         <title>Gradient H&#8208;bonding Binder Enables Stable High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Si&#8208;Based Anodes in Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Alleviating large stress is critical for high&#8208;energy batteries with large volume change upon cycling, yet this still presents a challenge. Here, we report a gradient hydrogen&#8208;bonding binder for high&#8208;capacity silicon&#8208;based anodes that are highly desirable for the next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The well&#8208;defined gradient hydrogen bonds, with a successive bond energy of &#8211;2.88 &#8764; &#8211;10.04&#160;kcal mol&#8211;1, can effectively release the large stress of silicon via the sequential bonding cleavage. This can avoid recurrently abrupt structure fracture of traditional binder due to lack of gradient energy dissipation. Certainly, this regulated binder endows stable high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity silicon&#8208;based electrodes &gt;3&#160;mAh cm&#8211;2. Beyond proof of concept, this work demonstrates a 2 Ah silicon&#8208;based pouch cell with an impressive capacity retention of 80.2% after 700 cycles (0.028% decay/cycle) based on this gradient hydrogen&#8208;bonding binder, making it more promising for practical application.

         <title>Digital Light Processing&#8208;based Bioprinting with Composable Gradients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recapitulation of complex tissues signifies a remarkable challenge and, to date, only few approaches have emerged that can efficiently reconstruct necessary gradients in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) constructs. This is true even though mimicry of these gradients is of great importance to establish the functionality of engineered tissues and devices. Here, a composable&#8208;gradient digital light processing (DLP)&#8208;based (bio)printing system is developed for the first time, utilizing the unprecedented integration of a microfluidic mixer for the generation of either continual or discrete gradients of desired (bio)inks in real time. Notably, the precisely controlled gradients are composable on&#8208;the&#8208;fly by facilely adjusting the (bio)ink flow ratios. In addition, this setup is designed in such a way that no washing steps are needed when exchanging the gradient (bio)inks, further enhancing our time&#8208; and (bio)ink&#8208;saving strategy. Various planar and 3D structures exhibiting continual gradients of materials, of cell densities, of growth factor concentrations, of hydrogel stiffness, and of porosities in horizontal and/or vertical direction, are exemplified. The composable fabrication of multifunctional gradients strongly support the potential of our unique bioprinting system in numerous biomedical applications.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Perovskite Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Artificial Synapses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are distinctive semiconductors that exhibit both ionic and electronic transport and are promising for artificial synapses. However, developing a 3&#8208;terminal transistor artificial synapse with the perovskite channel remains elusive due to the lack of a proper technique to regulate mobile ions in a non&#8208;volatile manner. Here, we report solution&#8208;processed perovskite transistor for artificial synapses through the implementation of a ferroelectric gate. The ferroelectric polarisation provides a non&#8208;volatile electric field on the perovskite, leading to fixation of the mobile ions and hence modulation of the electronic conductance of the channel. Multi&#8208;state channel conductance is realized by partial ferroelectric polarisation. The ferroelectric&#8208;gated perovskite transistor is successfully used as an artificial synapse that emulates basic synaptic functions such as long&#8208;term plasticity with excellent linearity, short&#8208;term as well as spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity. Our strategy to regulate ion dynamics in the perovskites using the ferroelectric gate suggests a generic route to employ perovskites for synaptic electronics.

         <title>Facet&#8208;dependent Surface Charge and Hydration of Semiconducting Nanoparticles at Variable pH</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Understanding structure and function of solid&#8208;liquid interfaces is essential for the development of nanomaterials for various applications including heterogeneous catalysis in liquid phase processes and water splitting for storage of renewable electricity. The characteristic anisotropy of crystalline nanoparticles is believed to be essential for their performance but remains poorly understood and difficult to characterize. We use dual scale Atomic Force Microscopy to measure electrostatic and hydration forces of faceted semiconducting SrTiO3 nanoparticles in aqueous electrolyte at variable pH. We demonstrate (i) the ability to quantify strongly facet&#8208;dependent surface charges yielding isoelectric points of the dominant {100} and {110} facets that differ by as much as 2&#160;pH units, ii) facet&#8208;dependent accumulation of oppositely charged (SiO2) particles, and iii) that atomic scale defects can be resolved but are in fact rare for the samples investigated. Atomically resolved images and facet&#8208;dependent oscillatory hydration forces suggest a microscopic charge generation mechanism that explains colloidal scale electrostatic forces.

         <title>Revamping Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries for High Cell&#8208;Level Energy Density by Synergistic Utilization of Polysulfide Additives and Artificial Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical approach for achieving a high &#8220;cell&#8208;level&#8221; energy density using lithium polysulfides (LPS) containing electrolytes and Li2S&#8208;phobic artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (A&#8208;SEI) layers is presented. The synergistic effects from the LPS and A&#8208;SEI result in superior cell&#8208;level volumetric energy densities (&#8776;650&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1) and large cumulative energy densities considering cycling life. 








Abstract
Despite the high theoretical capacity of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, a high cell&#8208;level energy density and a long cycling life are barely achieved, mainly due to the large electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio, polysulfide (PS) shuttle causing the loss of active sulfur, and the formation of passivation layers on the Li anode. To raise the energy density, holding PS in the cathode has been the most popular approach. Still, it has failed, particularly, when the sulfur loading is high enough to have energy densities similar to those of commercial Li&#8208;ion batteries. Here, a practical approach of achieving high &#8220;cell&#8208;level&#8221; energy densities is attempted using lithium PS (LPS)&#8208;containing electrolytes instead of a pure electrolyte, reducing the electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio and PS diffusion out of the cathode due to concentration differences. Meanwhile, the persistent problems including PS passivation and Li dendrites are suppressed using Li2S&#8208;phobic artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (A&#8208;SEI) layers on Li metal. The synergistic effects from the LPS additives and A&#8208;SEI result in a superior cell&#8208;level volumetric energy density of 650&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1 as well as large cumulative energy densities considering cycling life. This approach provides an important stepping stone to realize commercial Li&#8211;S batteries rivaling the current Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Physiologically Self&#8208;Regulated, Fully Implantable, Battery&#8208;Free System for Peripheral Nerve Restoration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A physiologically self&#8208;regulated, fully implantable, battery&#8208;free neural electrical stimulation system is successfully constructed to produce physiologically electrical signals for the acceleration of regeneration and functional recovery of peripheral nerve injury.








Abstract
The long&#8208;segment peripheral nerve injury (PNI) represents a global medical challenge, leading to incomplete nerve tissue recovery and unsatisfactory functional reconstruction. However, the current electrical stimulation (ES) apparatuses fail perfect nerve repair due to their inability of the variable synchronous self&#8208;regulated function with physiological states. It is urgent to develop an implantable ES platform with physiologically adaptive function to provide instantaneous and nerve&#8208;preferred ES. Here, a physiologically self&#8208;regulated electrical signal is generated by integrating a novel tribo/piezoelectric hybrid nanogenerator with a nanoporous nerve guide conduit to construct a fully implantable neural electrical stimulation (FI&#8208;NES) system. The optimal neural ES parameters completely originate from the body itself and are highly self&#8208;responsive to different physiological states. The morphological evaluation, representative protein expression level, and functional reconstruction of the regenerated nerves are conducted to assess the PNI recovery process. Evidence shows that the recovery effect of 15&#160;mm length nerve defects under the guidance of the FI&#8208;NES system is significantly close to the autograft. The designed FI&#8208;NES system provides an effective method for long&#8208;term accelerating the recovery of PNI in vivo and is also appropriate for other tissue injury or neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Cellulose&#8208;Based Hybrid Aerogels: Strategies toward Design and Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently developed cellulose&#8208;based hybrid aerogels provide a powerful material platform with synergistic and enhanced functionalities for diverse applications brought about by combining the inherent attributes of cellulose with organic/inorganic components. The design, characterization, and performance of predominant types of cellulose&#8208;hybrid aerogels are examined with an eye toward future perspectives to make these materials achieve even greater heights.








Abstract
The brittle nature of early aerogels developed from inorganic precursors fueled the discovery of their organic counterparts. Prominent among these organics are cellulose aerogels because of their natural abundance, biocompatibility, sustainable precursors, and tunable properties. The hierarchical structure of cellulose, from polymers to nano/microfibers, further facilitates fabrication of materials across multiple length scales with added applicability. However, the inherent flammability, structural fragility, and low thermal stability have limited their use. Recently developed cellulose&#8208;based hybrid aerogels offer strong potential owing to their tunability and enhanced functionality brought about by combining the inherent properties of cellulose with organic and inorganic components. A survey of the historical background and scientific achievements in the design and development of cellulose&#8208;based hybrid aerogel materials is encompassed here. The impacts of incorporating organic and inorganic ingredients with cellulose and the corresponding synergistic effects are discussed in terms of their design and functionality. The underlying principles governing the structural integration and functionality enhancement are also analyzed. The latest developments of cellulose&#8208;based hybrid aerogels fabricated from nontraditional incipient aerogels, such as fibrous webs, are also explored. Finally, future opportunities that could make these materials achieve even greater impacts through improved scalability, rationally designed synthesis, and multifunctional properties are discussed.

         <title>Organic Electrochemical Transistors for In Vivo Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the role of organic electrochemical transistors in different in vivo bioelectronic applications, ranging from human electrophysiology to plant interfacing. Particular emphasis is given on analysing the key materials design and device design aspects that make these devices ideal for addressing future in vivo biological systems. Finally, some challenges, limitations, and future applications are critically assessed.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are presently a focus of intense research and hold great potential in expanding the horizons of the bioelectronics industry. The notable characteristics of OECTs, including their electrolyte&#8208;gating, which offers intimate interfacing with biological environments, and aqueous stability, make them particularly suitable to be operated within a living organism (in vivo). Unlike the existing in vivo bioelectronic devices, mostly based on rigid metal electrodes, OECTs form a soft mechanical contact with the biological milieu and ensure a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio because of their powerful amplification capability. Such features make OECTs particularly desirable for a wide range of in vivo applications, including electrophysiological recordings, neuron stimulation, and neurotransmitter detection, and regulation of plant processes in vivo. In this review, a systematic compilation of the in vivo applications is presented that are addressed by the OECT technology. First, the operating mechanisms, and the device design and materials design principles of OECTs are examined, and then multiple examples are provided from the literature while identifying the unique device properties that enable the application progress. Finally, one critically looks at the future of the OECT technology for in vivo bioelectronic applications.

         <title>Promoting Oral Mucosal Wound Healing with a Hydrogel Adhesive Based on a Phototriggered S&#8208;Nitrosylation Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a new coupling reaction, an easily operated hydrogel adhesive that features thin&#8208;layer fabrication, ultrafast gelation, appropriate elasticity, and excellent tissue adhesion is developed. This hydrogel adhesive matches the material requirements for oral mucosal treatment and establishes a conducive microenvironment for tissue growth, thus notably shortening the healing time of mucosal wounds.








Abstract
The wet and highly dynamic environment of the mouth makes local treatment of oral mucosal diseases challenging. To overcome this, a photo&#8208;crosslinking hydrogel adhesive is developed inspired by the success of light&#8208;curing techniques in dentistry. The adhesive operates on a fast (within 5 s) phototriggered S&#8208;nitrosylation coupling reaction and employs imine anchoring to connect to host tissues. Unlike other often&#8208;used clinical agents that adhere weakly and for short durations, this thin, elastic, adhesive, and degradable cyclic o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid gel protects mucosal wounds from disturbance by liquid rinsing, oral movement, and friction for more than 24 h. The results from both rat and pig oral mucosa repair models demonstrate that this new gel adhesive creates a favorable microenvironment for tissue repair and can shorten tissue healing time. This study thus illustrates a therapeutic strategy with the potential to advance the treatment of oral mucosal defects in the clinic.

The results from both rat and pig oral mucosa repair models demonstrate that this new gel adhesive creates a favorable microenvironment for tissue repair and can shorten tissue healing time. This study thus illustrates a therapeutic strategy with the potential to advance the treatment of oral mucosal defects in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Systematic Review of Metal Halide Perovskite Crystallization and Film Formation Mechanism Unveiled by In Situ GIWAXS</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review illustrates how to obtain and understand in situ GIWAXS data, summarizes and assesses recent results of in situ GIWAXS studies on versatile perovskite photovoltaic systems that elucidate the crystallization and film formation mechanisms in terms of material compositions, film deposition methods, and film treatment procedures.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are of fundamental interest in the research of modern thin&#8208;film optoelectronic devices, owing to their widely tunable optoelectronic properties and solution processability. To obtain high&#8208;quality perovskite films and ultimately high&#8208;performance perovskite devices, it is crucial to understand the film formation mechanisms, which, however, remains a great challenge, due to the complexity of perovskite composition, dimensionality, and processing conditions. Nevertheless, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) technique enables one to bridge the complex information with device performance by revealing the crystallization pathways during the perovskite film formation process. In this review, the authors illustrate how to obtain and understand in situ GIWAXS data, summarize and assess recent results of in situ GIWAXS studies on versatile perovskite photovoltaic systems, aiming at elucidating the distinct features and common ground of film formation mechanisms, and shedding light on future opportunities of employing in situ GIWAXS to study the fundamental working mechanisms of highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells toward mass production.

         <title>Molecular Cleavage of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks and Application to Energy Storage and Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods are critically reviewed to prepare postsynthesis metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) by molecular cleavage of coordination bonds based on distinct functions and fundamental design principles. Applications are highlighted to electrocatalysis and renewable batteries for energy storage and conversion. A critical perspective on understanding and development of molecular cleavage of MOFs is provided.








Abstract
The physicochemical properties of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) significantly depend on composition, topology, and porosity, which can be tuned via synthesis. In addition to a classic direct synthesis, postsynthesis modulations of MOFs, including ion exchange, installation, and destruction, can significantly expand the application. Because of a limitation of the qualitative hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) theory, posttreatment permits regulation of MOF structure by cleaving chemical bonds at the molecular level. Here, methods of coordination bond scission to tailor the structure are critically appraised and the application to energy storage and conversion is assessed. MOF structures synthesized by molecular&#8208;level coordination bond cleavage are described and the corresponding MOFs for electrocatalysis and renewable battery applications are evaluated. Significant emphasis is placed on various coordination bond cleavage to tune properties, including chemical groups, electronic structures, and morphologies. The review concludes with a critical perspective on practical application, together with challenges and future outlook for this emerging field.

         <title>Acceptor Modulation Strategies for Improving the Electron Transport in High&#8208;Performance Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review illustrates the significance of improving electron transport of semiconducting polymers. To improve the electron mobilities, acceptor modulation strategies are summarized and discussed. The introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups into polymers is also involved. High&#8208;performance organic field&#8208;effect transistors are reviewed. The relationship between device performance and chemical structure, energy levels, molecular packing orientation, and processing condition is comprehensively discussed.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance ambipolar and electronic type semiconducting polymers are essential for fabricating various organic optoelectronic devices and complementary circuits. This review summarizes the strategies of improving the electron transport of semiconducting polymers via acceptor modulation strategies, which include the use of single, dual, triple, multiple, and all acceptors as well as the fusion of multiple identical acceptors to obtain new heterocyclic acceptors. To further improve the electron transport of semiconducting polymers, the introduction of strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups can enhance the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of donors and acceptors, thereby facilitating electron injection and suppressing hole accumulation. In addition, the relationships between the molecular structure, frontier molecular orbital energy levels, thin film morphology, microstructure, processing conditions, and device performances are also comprehensively discussed. Finally, the challenges encountered in this research area are proposed and the future outlook is presented.

         <title>Atomic Structure Evolution of Pt&#8211;Co Binary Catalysts: Single Metal Sites versus Intermetallic Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Key factors determining whether the alloying or atomization of Pt NPs on a single Co site rich carbon support are dynamically revealed, including initial Pt loadings, particle sizes, the nature of the carbon supports, and the annealing conditions. The corresponding ordered Pt3Co intermetallic and single Pt/Co site (i.e., PtC3N/CoN4) catalysts are evaluated for the ORR. The established structure&#8211;property correlations shed light on the design of advanced Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Due to their exceptional catalytic properties for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and other crucial electrochemical reactions, PtCo intermetallic nanoparticle (NP) and single atomic (SA) Pt metal site catalysts have received considerable attention. However, their formation mechanisms at the atomic level during high&#8208;temperature annealing processes remain elusive. Here, the thermally driven structure evolution of Pt&#8211;Co binary catalyst systems is investigated using advanced in situ electron microscopy, including PtCo intermetallic alloys and single Pt/Co metal sites. The pre&#8208;doping of CoN4 sites in carbon supports and the initial Pt NP sizes play essential roles in forming either Pt3Co intermetallics or single Pt/Co metal sites. Importantly, the initial Pt NP loadings against the carbon support are critical to whether alloying to L12&#8208;ordered Pt3Co NPs or atomizing to SA Pt sites at high temperatures. High Pt NP loadings (e.g., 20%) tend to lead to the formation of highly ordered Pt3Co intermetallic NPs with excellent activity and enhanced stability toward the ORR. In contrast, at a relatively low Pt loading (&lt;6&#160;wt%), the formation of single Pt sites in the form of PtC3N is thermodynamically favorable, in which a synergy between the PtC3N and the CoN4 sites could enhance the catalytic activity for the ORR, but showing insufficient stability.

         <title>Phototriggered Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Direct Generation of 4D Soft Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to realize remote spatio&#8208;temporal control of luminescence behavior of materials through a phototriggered aggregation&#8208;induced emission (PTAIE) process is reported. With the strategy, laser&#8208;mediated mask&#8208;free writing and transformable 4D soft patterns of AIE&#8208;active gels are realized.








Abstract
Microscopic control of macroscopic phenomena is one of the core subjects in materials science. Particularly, the spatio&#8208;temporal control of material behaviors through a non&#8208;contact way is of fundamental importance but is difficult to accomplish. Herein, a strategy to realize remote spatio&#8208;temporal control of luminescence behaviors is reported. A multi&#8208;arm salicylaldehyde benzoylhydrazone&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)/metal&#8208;ion system, of which the fluorescence can be gated by the UV irradiation with time dependency, is developed. By changing the metal&#8208;ion species, the fluorescence emission and the intensity can also be tuned. The mechanism of the UV&#8208;mediated fluorescence change is investigated, and it is revealed that a phototriggered aggregation&#8208;induced emission (PTAIE) process contributes to the behaviors. The AIEgen is further covalently integrated into a polymeric network and the formed gel/metal&#8208;ion system can achieve laser&#8208;mediated mask&#8208;free writing enabled by the PTAIE process. Moreover, by further taking advantage of the time&#8208;dependent self&#8208;healing property of hydrazone&#8208;based dynamic covalent bond, transformable 4D soft patterns are generated. The findings and the strategy increase the ways to manipulate molecules on the supramolecule or aggregate level. They also show opportunities for the development of controllable smart materials and expand the scope of the materials in advanced optoelectronic applications.

Particularly, the spatio-temporal control of material behaviors through a non-contact way is of fundamental importance but is difficult to accomplish. Herein, a strategy to realize remote spatio-temporal control of luminescence behaviors is reported. A multi-arm salicylaldehyde benzoylhydrazone-based aggregation-induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)/metal-ion system, of which the fluorescence can be gated by the UV irradiation with time dependency, is developed. By changing the metal-ion species, the fluorescence emission and the intensity can also be tuned. The mechanism of the UV-mediated fluorescence change is investigated, and it is revealed that a phototriggered aggregation-induced emission (PTAIE) process contributes to the behaviors. The AIEgen is further covalently integrated into a polymeric network and the formed gel/metal-ion system can achieve laser-mediated mask-free writing enabled by the PTAIE process. Moreover, by further taking advantage of the time-dependent self-healing property of hydrazone-based dynamic covalent bond, transformable 4D soft patterns are generated. The findings and the strategy increase the ways to manipulate molecules on the supramolecule or aggregate level. They also show opportunities for the development of controllable smart materials and expand the scope of the materials in advanced optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lead&#8208;Dominated Hyperfine Interaction Impacting the Carrier Spin Dynamics in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
The outstanding optical quality of lead halide perovskites inspires studies of their potential for the optical control of carrier spins as pursued in other materials. Entering largely uncharted territory, time&#8208;resolved pump&#8208;probe Kerr rotation is used to explore the coherent spin dynamics of electrons and holes in bulk FA0.9Cs0.1PbI2.8Br0.2 and to determine key parameters characterizing their spins interactions, such as the g&#8208;factors and relaxation times. The demonstrated long spin dynamics and narrow g&#8208;factor distribution prove the perovskites as promising competitors for conventional semiconductors in spintronics. The dynamic nuclear polarization via spin&#8208;oriented holes is realized and the identification of the 207Pb isotope in optically&#8208;detected nuclear magnetic resonance proves that the hole&#8208;nuclei interaction is dominated by the lead ions. A detailed theoretical analysis accounting for the specifics of the lead halide perovskite materials allows the evaluation of the underlying hyperfine interaction constants, both for electrons and holes. Recombination and spin dynamics evidence that at low temperatures photogenerated electrons and holes are localized at different regions of the perovskite crystal, resulting in their long lifetimes up to 44&#160;&#956;s. Our&#160;findings form the base for the tailored development of spin&#8208;optoelectronic applications for the large family of lead halide perovskites and their&#160;nanostructures.

         <title>Training the Polarization in Integrated La0.15Bi0.85FeO3&#8208;Based Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalities of BiFeO3&#8208;based magnetoelectric multiferroic heterostructures rely on the controlled manipulation of its ferroelectric domains and of the corresponding net in&#8208;plane polarization, as this aspect guides the voltage&#8208;controlled magnetic switching. Chemical substitution has emerged as a key to push the energy dissipation of the BiFeO3 into the attojoule range but appears to result in a disordered domain configuration. Using non&#8208;invasive optical second&#8208;harmonic generation on heavily La&#8208;substituted BiFeO3 films, we show that a weak net in&#8208;plane polarization remains imprinted in the pristine films despite the apparent domain disorder. We find that this ingrained net in&#8208;plane polarization can be trained with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electric fields compatible with applications. Operando studies on capacitor heterostructures treated in this way show the full restoration of the domain configuration of pristine BiFeO3 along with a giant net in&#8208;plane polarization enhancement. Thus, our experiments reveal a surprising robustness of the net in&#8208;plane polarization of BiFeO3 against chemical modification, an important criterion in ongoing attempts to integrate magnetoelectric materials into energy&#8208;efficient devices.

         <title>3D Printing Scaffold Vaccine for Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cancer vaccine platform has attracted great interest in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Here, we developed a 3D printed scaffolds loaded with immunoregulators for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. The rapid manufacturing and precise molding based on 3D printing can realize the mass manufacturing of cancer vaccines and personalized design. Meanwhile, compared to the traditional hydrogel, the 3D&#8208;scaffold with porous structure endowed it similar functions compared with real lymphoid organs by recruitment of a great number of immune cells, leading to the formation of &#8220;artificial tertiary lymphoid structures (aTLS)&#8221;, where is a promising site to enhance both humoral and cellular immune responses. Efficient anticancer immunity is induced when combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to inhibit the tumor growth. We further demonstrate personalized anti&#8208;tumor scaffold vaccines for filling of tumor site after surgery to prevent cancer metastasis. Taken together, these results promise the 3D printing scaffold vaccine as the potential strategy for cancer vaccine therapy in the future.

         <title>Acoustophoretic Liquefaction For 3D Printing Ultrahigh Viscosity Nanoparticle Suspensions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acoustic liquefaction approach to enhance the flow of yield stress fluids during digital light processing (DLP) based 3D printing is reported. This enhanced flow enables processing of ultrahigh viscosity resins (&#956;app &gt;&#160;3700 Pa&#183;s at shear rates &#947; = 0.01 s&#8211;1) based on silica particles in a silicone photopolymer. Numerical simulations of the acousto&#8208;mechanical coupling in the DLP resin feed system at different agitation frequencies predicts local resin flow velocities exceeding 100 mm&#183;s&#8211;1 at acoustic transduction frequencies of 110 s&#8211;1. Under these conditions, highly loaded particle suspensions (weight fractions, f = 0.23) can be printed successfully in complex geometries. Such mechanically reinforced composites possess a tensile toughness 2000% greater than the neat photopolymer. Beyond an increase in processible viscosities, acoustophoretic liquefaction DLP (AL&#8208;DLP) creates a transient reduction in apparent viscosity that promotes resin recirculation and decreases viscous adhesion. As a result, AL&#8208;DLP improves the printed feature resolution by more than 25%, increases printable object sizes by over 50 times, and can build parts &gt;&#160;3 &#215; faster when compared to conventional methodologies.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Thermal Switching of Individual Plasmonically Activated Spin Crossover Nanoparticle Imaged by Ultrafast Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin Crossover (SCO) is a promising switching phenomenon when implemented in electronic devices as molecules, thin films or nanoparticles. Among the properties modulated along this phenomenon, optically induced mechanical changes are of tremendous importance as they can work as fast light&#8208;induced mechanical switches or allow to investigate and control microstructural strains and fatigability. The development of characterization techniques probing nanoscopic behaviour with high spatio&#8208;temporal resolution allows to trigger and visualize such mechanical changes of individual nanoscopic objects. Here we use Ultrafast Transmission Electron Microscopy (UTEM) to precisely probe the length changes of individual switchable nanoparticles induced thermally by nanosecond laser pulses. This allows us to reveal the mechanisms of spin switching, leading to the macroscopic expansion of SCO materials. This study was conducted on individual pure SCO nanoparticles and SCO nanoparticles encapsulating gold nanorods that serve for plasmonic heating under laser pulses. Length changes are compared with time&#8208;resolved optical measurements performed on an assembly of these particles.

Gene therapy has shown great potential for neurodegenerative diseases with complex pathology. However, its therapeutic effect is limited due to the delivery barriers and its own single function. Herein, self&#8208;catalytic small interfering RNA (siRNA) nanocarriers (S/Ce&#8208;PABMS) are developed to catalyze delivery process and treatment process for synergistic treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. On the one hand, the rough surface of S/Ce&#8208;PABMS mediated by ceria (CeO2) nanozymes can catalyze cellular uptake in the delivery process, so that S/Ce&#8208;PABMS with acetylcholine analogs penetrate the blood&#8208;brain barrier and enter neurons more effectively. On the other hand, CeO2 nanozymes can catalyze the treatment process by scavenging excess reactive oxygen species, and cooperate with siRNA targeting SNCA to decrease the &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) aggregation and alleviate the parkinsonian pathology. Moreover, the S/Ce&#8208;PABMS treatment reduces the number of activated microglia and regulates the release of inflammatory cytokine, thereby relieving neuroinflammation. After treatment with S/Ce&#8208;PABMS, dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease model mice has been significantly alleviated. The finding shows that the self&#8208;catalytic nanocarriers S/Ce&#8208;PABMS have great potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Coupling Spin Defects in a Layered Material to Nanoscale Plasmonic Cavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride, and specifically the negatively charged boron vacancy (VB&#8211;) centres, are emerging candidates for quantum sensing. However, the VB&#8211; defects suffer from low quantum efficiency and as a result exhibit weak photoluminescence. In this work, we demonstrate a scalable approach to dramatically enhance the VB&#8211; emission by coupling to a plasmonic gap cavity. The plasmonic cavity is composed of a flat gold surface and a silver cube, with few&#8208;layer hBN flakes positioned in between. Employing these plasmonic cavities, we extracted two orders of magnitude in photoluminescence enhancement associated with a corresponding 2&#8208;fold enhancement in optically detected magnetic resonance contrast. The work will be pivotal to progress in quantum sensing employing 2D materials, and realisation of nanophotonic devices with spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride.

         <title>Low&#8208;bandgap Organic Bulk&#8208;heterojunction Enabled Efficient and Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead halide perovskite and organic solar cells (PSCs and OSCs) are considered as the prime candidates currently for clean energy applications due to their solution and low&#8208;temperature processibility. Nevertheless, the substantial photon loss in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region and relatively large photovoltage deficit need to be improved to enable their uses in high&#8208;performance solar cells. To mitigate these disadvantages, we integrate low&#8208;bandgap organic bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) layer into inverted PSCs to construct facile hybrid solar cells (HSCs). By optimizing the BHJ components, we achieve an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.80%, with a decent open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.146&#160;V and extended photo&#8208;response over 950&#160;nm for rigid HSCs. The resultant devices also exhibit superior long&#8208;term (over 1000 h) ambient&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability compared to those from single&#8208;component PSCs and OSCs. More importantly, a champion PCE of 21.73% and excellent mechanical durability can also be achieved in flexible HSCs, which is the highest efficiency reported for flexible solar cells to date. Taking advantage of these impressive device performance, we have successfully integrated flexible HSCs into a power source for wearable sensors to demonstrate real&#8208;time temperature monitoring.

         <title>Synthesis of Pd3Sn and PdCuSn Nanorods with L12 Phase for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal phase of nanomaterials is one of the key parameters to determine their physicochemical property and performance in various applications. However, it still remains a great challenge to synthesize nanomaterials with different crystal phases while maintaining the same composition, size and morphology. Here, we report a facile, one&#8208;pot, wet&#8208;chemical method to synthesize Pd3Sn nanorods with the comparable size and morphology but different crystal phases, i.e., the ordered intermetallic and disordered alloy with the L12 and face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phases, respectively. The crystal phase of the as&#8208;synthesized Pd3Sn nanorods is easily tuned by altering the types of tin precursors and solvents. Moreover, our approach can also be used to synthesize ternary PdCuSn nanorods with the L12 crystal phase. When used as electrocatalysts, the L12 Pd3Sn nanorods exhibit superior electrocatalytic performance towards the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) compared to their fcc counterpart. Impressively, compared to the L12 Pd3Sn nanorods, the ternary L12 PdCuSn nanorods exhibit more enhanced electrocatalytic performance towards EOR, yielding a high mass current density up to 6.22 A mgPd&#8211;1, which are superior to the commercial Pd/C catalyst and among the best reported Pd&#8208;based EOR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Quantifying Anionic Diffusion in Two&#8208;Dimensional Halide Perovskites Lateral Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anionic diffusion strongly impacts the stability of halide perovskite materials, but it is still not well&#8208;understood. Here, we report a quantitative investigation of in&#8208;plane thermally driven anionic inter&#8208;diffusion in a series of novel 2D and quasi&#8208;2D halide perovskites lateral heterostructures. The calculated diffusion coefficients (D) reveal the inhibition of Br&#8208;I inter&#8208;diffusion with bulky &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic cations compared with short&#8208;chain aliphatic organic cations. Furthermore, halide diffusion was found to be faster in quasi&#8208;2D (n &gt;&#160;1) than 2D perovskites (n = 1). The increment becomes less apparent as the &#8220;n&#8221; number increases, akin to the quantum confinement effect observed for band gaps. These trends are rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations of free energy barriers for halide diffusion that reveal mechanisms for suppressing diffusion. This work provides important fundamental insights on the anionic migration and diffusion process in halide perovskite materials.

         <title>Chirality Bias Tissue Homeostasis By Manipulating Immunological Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
The physiological chirality of extracellular environments is substantially affected by pathological diseases. However, how this stereochemical variation drives host immunity remains poorly understood. Here, we report that pathology&#8208;mimetic M&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;but not physiology&#8208;mimetic P&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;act as a defense mechanism that helps to restore tissue homeostasis by manipulating immunological response. Quantitative multi&#8208;omics in vivo and in vitro showed that M&#8208;nanofibrils significantly inhibited inflammation and promoted tissue regeneration by upregulating M2 macrophage polarization and downstream immune signaling compared with P&#8208;nanofibrils. Molecular analysis and theoretical simulation demonstrated that M&#8208;chirality displayed higher stereo&#8208;affinity to cellular binding, which induced higher cellular contractile stress and activated mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZOl to conduct Ca2+ influx. In turn, the nuclear transfer of STAT was biased by Ca2+ influx to promote M2 polarization. These findings underscore the structural mechanisms of disease, providing design basis for immunotherapy with bionic functional materials.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Molybdenum Carbide MXenes for Enhanced Selective Detection of Humidity in Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) open up novel opportunities in gas sensing with high sensitivity at room temperature. Herein, we have successfully synthesized 2D Mo2CTx flakes with high aspect ratio. We study the chemiresistive effect in a sub&#8208;&#956;m MXene multilayer for different organic vapors and humidity at 101&#8211;104&#160;ppm in dry air. Reasonably, the low&#8208;noise resistance signal allows the detection of H2O down to 10&#160;ppm. Moreover, humidity suppresses the response of Mo2CTx to organic analytes due to the blocking of adsorption active sites. By measuring the impedance of MXene layers as a function of ac frequency in the 10&#8722;2&#8208;106&#160;Hz range, we show that operation principle of the sensor is dominated by resistance change rather than capacitance variations. The sensor transfer function allows us to conclude that the Mo2CTx chemiresistance is mainly originating from electron transport through inter&#8208;flake potential barriers with heights up to 0.2&#160;eV. DFT calculations, elucidating the Mo2C surface interaction with organic analytes and H2O, explain the experimental data as an energy shift of the density of states under the analyte's adsorption which induces increasing electrical resistance.

         <title>Heterointerface Engineering in Electromagnetic Absorbers: New Insights and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electromagnetic (EM) absorbers play an increasingly essential role in electronic information age, even towards coming intelligent life. The remarkable merits of heterointerface engineering and its peculiar EM characteristics inject a fresh and infinite vitality to design high&#8208;efficiency and stimuli&#8208;responsive EM absorbers. However, there still exist huge challenges in understanding and reinforcing these interface effects from the micro and macro perspectives. Herein, the EM response mechanisms of interfacial effects are dissected in depth, and advanced characterization as well as theoretical techniques is highly focused on. Then, the representative optimization strategies are systematically discussed with an emphasis on component selection and structural design. More importantly, the most cutting&#8208;edge smart EM functional devices based on heterointerface engineering are reported as highlights. Finally, current challenges and concrete suggestion are proposed, and future perspectives on this promising field are predicted as well.

         <title>Functionalized Iron&#8722;Nitrogen&#8722;Carbon Electrocatalyst Provides a Reversible Electron Transfer Platform for Efficient Uranium Extraction from Seawater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uranium extraction from seawater provides an opportunity for sustainable fuel supply to nuclear power plants. Herein, we demonstrate an adsorption&#8722;electrocatalysis strategy for efficient uranium extraction from seawater using a functionalized iron&#8722;nitrogen&#8722;carbon (Fe&#8722;Nx&#8722;C&#8722;R) catalyst, comprising N&#8722;doped carbon capsules supporting FeNx single&#8722;atom sites and surface chelating amidoxime groups (R). The amidoxime groups bring hydrophilicity to the adsorbent and offer surface&#8722;specific binding sites for UO22+ capture. The site&#8722;isolated FeNx centres reduce adsorbed UO22+ to UO2+. Subsequently, through electrochemical reduction of the FeNx sites, unstable U(V) ions are re&#8722;oxidized to U(VI) in the presence of Na+ resulting in the generation of solid Na2O(UO3&#183;H2O)x, which can easily be collected. Fe&#8722;Nx&#8722;C&#8722;R reduced the uranium concentration in seawater from &#8764;3.5 ppb to below 0.5 ppb with a calculated capacity of &#8764;1.2 mg&#183;g&#8722;1 within 24 h. To the best of our knowledge, the developed system is the first to use the adsorption of uranyl ions and electrodeposition of solid Na2O(UO3.H2O)x for the extraction of uranium from seawater. Our important discoveries guide technology development for the efficient extraction of uranium from seawater.

         <title>Ultrafast Digital Fabrication of Designable Architectured Liquid Crystalline Elastomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
The muscle&#8208;like activities of liquid crystalline elastomers (LCE) offer great potential for designing future soft machines. Their motion complexity, however, relies on inflexible and cumbersome mesogen alignment techniques. Here, a digital photocuring method for ultrafast template&#8208;free fabrication of LCE artificial muscles capable of designable complex motions is reported. Our method utilizes the intrinsic light attenuation in the through&#8208;plane direction to create mesogen alignment for reversible bending action. To turn this simple actuation into complex motions, the principles of muscles are borrowed which realize diverse motions through the cooperative actions of otherwise simple contraction/expansion of individual muscle bundles. Specifically, the spatio&#8208;temporal digital light is utilized to design LCE architectures composed of strategically arranged bending modules. As such, LCE capable of highly designable motions can be fabricated within 25 seconds light curing without employing any physical alignment templates, which offers an attractive option towards designing functionally diverse soft machines.

         <title>Controllable Nonclassical Conductance Switching in Nanoscale Phase&#8208;Separated (PbI2)1&#8208;x(BiI3)x Layered Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered 2D (PbI2)1&#8208;x(BiI3)x materials exhibit a nonlinear dependence in structural and charge transport properties unanticipated from the combination of PbI2 and BiI3. Within (PbI2)1&#8208;x(BiI3)x crystals phase integration yields deceptive structural features, while phase boundary separation leads to new conductance switching behavior observed as large peaks in current during current&#8208;voltage (I&#8208;V) measurements (&#177;100&#160;V). Temperature and time dependent electrical measurements demonstrate the behavior is attributed to ionic transport perpendicular to the layers. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) reveals the structure of (PbI2)1&#8208;x(BiI3)x is a &#8220;brick wall&#8221; consisting of two phases, Pb&#8208;rich and Bi&#8208;rich. These brick&#8208;like features are 10s nm a side and we posit that iodide ion transport at the interfaces of these regions is responsible for the conductance switching action.

         <title>Nano&#8208;Encapsulation and Confined Growth Kinetics of Lithium Crystals in One&#8208;Dimensional Carbon Hosts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encapsulation of lithium in the confined spaces within individual nanocapsules is intriguing and highly desirable for developing high&#8208;performance Li metal anodes. This work aims for a mechanistic understanding of Li encapsulation and its confined growth kinetics inside one&#8208;dimensional enclosed spaces. To achieve this, we employ amorphous carbon nanotubes as a model host using in situ transmission electron microscopy. The carbon shells have dual roles, providing geometric/mechanical constraints and electron/ion transport channels, which profoundly alter the Li growth patterns. Li growth/dissolution takes place via atom addition/removal at the free surfaces through Li+ diffusion along the shells in the electric field direction, resulting in the formation of unusual Li structures, such as poly&#8208;crystalline nanowires and free&#8208;standing two&#8208;dimensional ultrathin (1&#8208;2&#160;nm) Li membranes. Such confined front&#8208;growth processes are dominated by Li {110} or {200} growing faces, distinct from the root growth of single&#8208;crystal Li dendrites outside the nanotubes. Controlled experiments show that high lithiophilicity and permeability, enabled by sufficient nitrogen/oxygen doping, is critical for the stable encapsulation of lithium inside carbonaceous nanocapsules. First&#8208;principles&#8208;based calculations reveal that N/O doping can reduce the diffusion barrier for Li+ penetration, and facilitate Li filling driven by energy minimization associated with the formation of low&#8208;energy Li/C interfaces.

         <title>Encapsulation of Metallic Zn in Hybrid MXene/Graphene Aerogel as Stable Zn Anode for Foldable Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three&#8208;dimensional (3D) host can effectively mitigate the dendritic growth of zinc (Zn) metal anode. However, the increased electrode/electrolyte reaction area using the 3D substrate accelerates the passivation and corrosion at the anode interface, ultimately degrading the electrochemical performance. Here, an oriented freezing process is used to create a flexible MXene/graphene scaffold. Based on the abundant zincophilic traits and micropores in the structure, Zn is densely encapsulated inside the host by the electrodeposition process. During cycling, the composite anode endows an in&#8208;situ solid electrolyte interface with zinc fluoride at the electrode/electrolyte interface due to inherent fluorine terminations in MXene, efficiently inhibiting the dendritic growth. Furthermore, the design of distributing bulk Zn in a 3D microscale manner suppresses hydrogen evolution reactions (3.8&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and passivation through in/ex&#8208;situ tests. As a result, in a symmetrical cell test, the electrode has a long&#8208;cycling life of over 1000 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. After continuous single&#8208;folding followed by double folding, a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state foldable cell with the composite anode and LiMn2O4 cathode (60% depth of discharge) maintains high&#8208;capacity retention of over 91%. This research presents a revolutionary encapsulating idea for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries, as well as foldable investigation.

         <title>Dynamic Nanoconfinement Enabled Highly Stretchable and Supratough Polymeric Materials with Desirable Healability and Biocompatibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lightweight polymeric materials are highly attractive platforms for many potential industrial applications in aerospace, soft robots and biological engineering fields. For these real&#8208;world applications, it is vital for them to exhibit a desirable combination of great&#8208;toughness, large&#8208;ductility and high&#8208;strength together with good healability and biocompatibility. However, existing material design strategies usually fail to achieve such a performance portfolio due to their different and even mutually exclusive governing mechanisms. To overcome these hurdles, herein, for the first time we propose a dynamic hydrogen&#8208;bonded nanoconfinement concept and demonstrate the design of highly stretchable and supratough biocompatible poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) with well&#8208;dispersed dynamic nanoconfinement phases induced by hydrogen&#8208;bond (H&#8208;bond) crosslinking. Because of H&#8208;bond crosslinking and dynamic nanoconfinement, the as&#8208;prepared PVA nanocomposite film exhibits a world&#8208;record toughness of 425&#160;&#177; 31&#160;MJ m&#8722;3 in combination with a tensile strength of 98&#160;MPa and a large break strain of 550%, representing the best of its kind and even outperforming most natural and artificial materials. In addition, the final polymer exhibits a good self&#8208;healing ability and biocompatibility. This work affords new opportunities for creating mechanically robust, healable and biocompatible polymeric materials, which hold great promise for applications, such as soft robots and artificial ligaments.

         <title>Suppressing High&#8208;Current&#8208;Induced Phase Separation in Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Oxides by Electrochemically Manipulating Dynamic Lithium Distribution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the cycling rate&#8208;dependent kinetics is crucial for managing the performance of batteries in high&#8208;power applications. Although high cycling rates may induce reaction heterogeneity and affect battery lifetime and capacity utilization, such phase transformation dynamics are poorly understood and uncontrollable. In this study, synchrotron&#8208;based operando X&#8208;ray diffraction is performed to monitor the high&#8208;current&#8208;induced phase transformation kinetics of LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2. The sluggish Li diffusion at high Li content induces different phase transformations during charging and discharging, with strong phase separation and homogeneous phase transformation during charging and discharging, respectively. Moreover, by exploiting the dependence of Li diffusivity on the Li content and electrochemically tuning the initial Li content and distribution, phase separation pathway can be redirected to solid solution kinetics at a high charging rate of 7C. Finite element analysis further elucidates the effect of the Li&#8208;content&#8208;dependent diffusion kinetics on the phase transformation pathway. Our findings suggest a new direction for optimizing fast&#8208;cycling protocols based on the intrinsic properties of the materials.

         <title>Exploring the Pb1&#8208;xSrxHfO3 System and Potential for High Capacitive Energy Storage Density and Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hafnate perovskites PbHfO3 (antiferroelectric) and SrHfO3 (&#8220;potential&#8221; ferroelectric) are studied as epitaxial thin&#8208;film heterostructures on SrTiO3 (001) substrates with the added opportunity of observing a morphotropic phase boundary in the Pb1&#8208;xSrxHfO3 system akin to that in PbZrxTi1&#8208;xO3. The resulting (240)&#8208;oriented PbHfO3 (Pba2) films were found to exhibit antiferroelectric switching with a saturation polarization &#8275;53 &#956;C/cm2 at 1.6 MV/cm and a weak&#8208;field dielectric constant &#8776;186 at 298 K. Temperature&#8208;dependent dielectric measurements revealed an antiferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transition at &#8764;518 K. Further, (002)&#8208;oriented SrHfO3 films were synthesized, but were found to not exhibit ferroelectric behavior; nor did we observe evidence of a recently reported polar P4mm phase. Instead, the SrHfO3 films were found to exhibit a weak&#8208;field dielectric constant &#8776;25 at 298 K and no signs of a structural transition to a polar phase as a function of temperature (77&#8208;623 K) and electric field (&#8208;3 MV/cm to 3 MV/cm). While the lack of ferroelectric order in SrHfO3 removed the potential for a PbZrxTi1&#8208;xO3&#8208;like morphotropic phase boundary, we proceeded to explore the structural and property evolution of the Pb1&#8208;xSrxHfO3 (0 &#8804; x &lt;&#160;1) system. Strontium alloying was found to increase the electric&#8208;breakdown strength (EB) and decrease the hysteresis loss resulting in concurrent enhancement of the capacitive energy storage density (Ur) and efficiency (&#951;). An optimum composition (Pb0.5Sr0.5HfO3) was found to produce the best combination of EB = 5.12&#160;&#177; 0.5 MV/cm, Ur = 77&#160;&#177; 5 J/cm3, and &#951; = 97&#160;&#177; 2%; well out&#8208;performing PbHfO3 and other antiferroelectric oxides.

         <title>Physical Disruption of Solid Tumors by Immunostimulatory Microrobots Enhances Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of immunotherapy with other forms of treatment is an emerging strategy for boosting antitumor responses. By combining multiple modes of action, these combinatorial therapies can improve clinical outcomes through unique synergisms. Here, we show a microrobot&#8208;based strategy that integrates tumor tissue disruption with biological stimulation for cancer immunotherapy. The microrobot is fabricated by loading bacterial outer membrane vesicles onto a self&#8208;propelling micromotor, which can react with water to generate a propulsion force. When administered intratumorally to a solid tumor, the disruption of the local tumor tissue coupled with the delivery of an immunostimulatory payload led to complete tumor regression. Additionally, treatment of the primary tumor resulted in the simultaneous education of the host immune system, enabling it to control the growth of distant tumors. Overall, this work introduces a distinct application of microrobots in cancer immunotherapy and offers an attractive strategy for amplifying cancer treatment efficacy when combined with conventional therapies.

         <title>Strongly Anisotropic Strain&#8208;tunability of Excitons in Exfoliated ZrSe3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
We study the effect of uniaxial strain on the band structure of ZrSe3, a semiconducting material with a marked in&#8208;plane structural anisotropy. By using a modified 3&#8208;point bending test apparatus, thin ZrSe3 flakes were subjected to uniaxial strain along different crystalline orientations monitoring the effect of strain on their optical properties through micro&#8208;reflectance spectroscopy. The obtained spectra showed excitonic features that blueshift upon uniaxial tension. This shift is strongly dependent on the direction along which the strain is being applied. When the flakes are strained along the b&#8208;axis, the exciton peak shifts at &#8764; 60&#8211;95 meV/%, while along the a&#8208;axis, the shift only reaches &#8764; 0&#8211;15 meV/%. Ab initio calculations were conducted to study the influence of uniaxial strain, applied along different crystal directions, on the band structure and reflectance spectra of ZrSe3, exhibiting a remarkable agreement with the experimental results.

         <title>Ten Years of Progress in the Synthesis and Development of MXenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) are among the largest 2D material families. MXenes&#8217; unique properties, such as their metal&#8208;like electrical conductivity, render them quite useful in a large number of applications including energy storage, optoelectronic, biomedical, communications, and environmental. A brief historical overview of the first 10 years of MXene research and a perspective on their synthesis and future development are provided.








Abstract
Since their discovery in 2011, the number of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) has steadily increased. Currently more than 40 MXene compositions exist. The ultimate number is far greater and in time they may develop into the largest family of 2D materials known. MXenes&#8217; unique properties, such as their metal&#8208;like electrical conductivity reaching &#8776;20&#160;000 S cm&#8722;1, render them quite useful in a large number of applications, including energy storage, optoelectronic, biomedical, communications, and environmental. The number of MXene papers and patents published has been growing quickly. The first MXene generation is synthesized using selective etching of metal layers from the MAX phases, layered transition metal carbides and carbonitrides using hydrofluoric acid. Since then, multiple synthesis approaches have been developed, including selective etching in a mixture of fluoride salts and various acids, non&#8208;aqueous etchants, halogens, and molten salts, allowing for the synthesis of new MXenes with better control over their surface chemistries. Herein, a brief historical overview of the first 10 years of MXene research and a perspective on their synthesis and future development are provided. The fact that their production is readily scalable in aqueous environments, with high yields bodes well for their commercialization.

         <title>Micropatterns Fabricated by Photodimerization&#8208;Induced Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward yet powerful strategy to fabricate micropatterns on film surfaces is developed by spatially regulating the photodimerization and mass transport of maleimide. This technology integrates the characteristics of top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up methods, providing a versatile basis for applications in microfluidic channels, composite gratings, devices, and functional systems.








Abstract
Pattern technology plays an important role in the generation of microstructures with different functionalities and morphologies. In this report, a straightforward and versatile strategy is presented for spatially regulating the growth of a microstructure on a surface by the photodimerization of maleimide (MI). Upon exposure of ultraviolet (UV) light, photodimerization of MI in a film comprising furan&#8208;grafted polymer and bismaleimide (BMI) produces a chemical gradient, which can drive the diffusion of BMI from the unexposed to the exposed region and from the bottom to the surface, resulting in the growth of micropatterns. Sequential crosslinking induced by the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between MI and furan maintains the stability of pattern shape. Theoretical modeling with reaction&#8208;diffusion equations reveal that as photodimerization moves the system far from thermodynamic equilibrium, the formation of a chemical potential gradient requires the redistribution of matter, resulting in the formation of topographies. Directional molecular motion induced by UV light can generate complex morphology, and produce materials with unique optical functions, such as charming&#8208;ordered gratings. This straightforward method of fabricating micropatterns by photodimerization&#8208;induced diffusion is successfully applied to patterned curved surfaces, microfluidic channels and encapsulation of integrated light emitting diode chips.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Covalent Organic Framework Cathodes for Enhanced Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise molecular manipulation of redox&#8208;active groups in covalent organic framework (COF) units shows that quinone&#8208;functionalized COFs significantly enhance the specific capacity, elevate the discharge potential, and improve the competitiveness of Zn2+ against H+ intercalation through a stronger coordination bond between cations and C&#63742;O/C&#63742;N groups.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are potentially promising electrode materials for electrochemical charge storage applications thanks to their pre&#8208;designable reticular chemistry with atomic precision, allowing precise control of pore size, redox&#8208;active functional moieties, and stable covalent frameworks. However, studies on the mechanistic and practical aspects of their zinc&#8208;ion storage behavior are still limited. In this study, a strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of COF cathodes in zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) by introducing the quinone group into 1,4,5,8,9,12&#8208;hexaazatriphenylene&#8208;based COFs is reported. Electrochemical characterization demonstrates that the introduction of the quinone groups in the COF significantly pushes up the Zn2+ storage capability against H+ and elevates the average (dis&#8208;)charge potential in aqueous ZIBs. Computational and experimental analysis further reveals the favorable redox&#8208;active sites that host Zn2+/H+ in COF electrodes and the root cause for the enhanced electrochemical performance. This work demonstrates that molecular engineering of the COF structure is an effective approach to achieve practical charge storage performance.

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Eu&#8208;MOF on Perovskite Solar Cells with Improved Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu&#8208;MOF is introduced to the field of perovskite solar cells. Both Eu ions and organic ligands reduce the defect concentration. More over, due to the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer effect, Eu&#8208;MOF improves the light utilization. Meanwhile, it also turns tensile strain to compressive strain. Finally, the device performance, in efficiency and stability, is increased dramatically due to the synergetic effects.








Abstract
Enhancing device lifetime is one of the essential challenges in perovskite solar cells. The ultrathin Eu&#8208;MOF layer is introduced at the interface between the electron&#8208;transport layer and the perovskite absorber to improve the device stability. Both Eu ions and organic ligands in the MOF can reduce the defect concentration and improve carrier transport. Moreover, due to the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer effect, Eu&#8208;MOF in perovskite films can improve light utilization and reduce the decomposition under ultraviolet light. Meanwhile, Eu&#8208;MOF also turns tensile strain to compressive strain in the perovskite films. As a result, the corresponding devices achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.16%. In addition, the devices retain 96% of their original PCE after 2000 h under the relative humidity of 30% and 91% of their original PCE after 1200 h after continuous 85&#160;&#176;C aging condition in N2.

         <title>Bitter Flavored, Soft Composites for Wearables Designed to Reduce Risks of Choking in Infants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bitter&#8208;flavored formulations in soft encapsulating layers and hydrogel adhesives for skin&#8208;interfaced wireless devices reduce risks of choking with infants. A bitter dopant, denatonium benzoate, integrated into soft silicone elastomers and hydrogels triggers a reflexive response when dissolved in saliva. Demonstrations in a variety of devices for physiological monitoring highlight the compatibility of these unusual composite materials in clinical&#8208;grade wearables.








Abstract
Wireless, skin&#8208;integrated devices for continuous, clinical&#8208;quality monitoring of vital signs have the potential to greatly improve the care of patients in neonatal and pediatric intensive&#8208;care units. These same technologies can also be used in the home, across a broad spectrum of ages, from beginning to end of life. Although miniaturized forms of such devices minimize patient burden and improve compliance, they represent life&#8208;threatening choking hazards for infants. A materials strategy is presented here to address this concern. Specifically, composite materials are introduced as soft encapsulating layers and gentle adhesives that release chemical compounds designed to elicit an intense bitter taste when placed in the mouth. Reflexive reactions to this sensation strongly reduce the potential for ingestion, as a safety feature. The materials systems described involve a non&#8208;toxic bitterant (denatonium benzoate) as a dopant in an elastomeric (poly(dimethylsiloxane)) or hydrogel matrix. Experimental and computational studies of these composite materials and the kinetics of release of the bitterant define the key properties. Incorporation into various wireless skin&#8208;integrated sensors demonstrates their utility in functional systems. This simple strategy offers valuable protective capabilities, with broad practical relevance to the welfare of children monitored with wearable devices.

         <title>A Highly Compressible and Stretchable Carbon Spring for Smart Vibration and Magnetism Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous spring&#8208;like all&#8208;carbon material achieving both elastic compressibility and stretchability at large strain from &#8722;80% to 80% is obtained when a unique long&#8208;range lamellar multi&#8208;arch microstructure is designed. The excellent mechanical performance combined with the intrinsic advantages of carbon makes it a promising platform for making smart vibration and magnetism sensors that can work at extreme temperatures.








Abstract
Porous carbon materials demonstrate extensive applications for their attractive characteristics. Mechanical flexibility is an essential property guaranteeing their durability. After decades of research efforts, compressive brittleness of porous carbon materials is well resolved. However, reversible stretchability remains challenging to achieve due to the intrinsically weak connections and fragile joints of the porous carbon networks. Herein, it is presented that a porous all&#8208;carbon material achieving both elastic compressibility and stretchability at large strain from &#8722;80% to 80% can be obtained when a unique long&#8208;range lamellar multi&#8208;arch microstructure is introduced. Impressively, the porous all&#8208;carbon material can maintain reliable structural robustness and durability under loading condition of cyclic compressing&#8211;stretching process, similar to a real metallic spring. The unique performance renders it as a promising platform for making smart vibration and magnetism sensors, even capable of operating at extreme temperatures. Furthermore, this study provides valuable insights for creating highly stretchable and compressible porous materials from other neat inorganic components for diverse applications in future.

         <title>Hollow InVO4 Nanocuboid Assemblies toward Promoting Photocatalytic N2 Conversion Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The InVO4 superstructure with a cube&#8208;shaped skeleton and hollow interior is synthesized. The closely ordered assembly of nanocuboids improves the separation of electron&#8211;hole pairs through promoted charge transfer among neighboring building blocks. This promising charge mobility feature contributes to the pronounced photocatalytic performance of InVO4 superstrucure toward N2 fixation into NH3.








Abstract
The unique InVO4 mesocrystal superstructure, particularly with cubical skeleton and hollow interior, which consists of numerous nanocube building blocks, closely stacking by stacking, aligning by aligning, and sharing the same crystallographic orientations, is successfully fabricated. The synergy of a reaction&#8208;limited aggregation and an Ostwald ripening process is reasonably proposed for the growth of this unique superstructure. Both single&#8208;particle surface photovoltage and confocal fluorescence spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the long&#8208;range ordered mesocrystal superstructures can significantly retard the recombination of electron&#8211;hole pairs through the creation of a new pathway for anisotropic electron flow along the inter&#8208;nanocubes. This promising charge mobility feature of the superstructure greatly contributes to the pronounced photocatalytic performance of the InVO4 mesocrystal toward fixation of N2 into NH3 with the quantum yield of 0.50% at wavelength of 385&#160;nm.

         <title>Ultrafast Bubble Bursting by Superamphiphobic Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superamphiphobic surfaces for ultrafast bubble bursting are introduced. Liquid flame spray is fast and scalable, and allows tuning of the nano&#8208; and micrometer&#8208;scale architecture of hierarchical surface structures. Bubbles burst rapidly upon contact and the gas is absorbed into the surface structures. The recorded rates are enhanced by a factor of 3 relative to previously reported results.








Abstract
Controlling bubble motion or passively bursting bubbles using solid interfaces is advantageous in numerous industrial applications including flotation, catalysis, electrochemical processes, and microfluidics. Current research has explored the formation, dissolution, pinning, and rupturing of bubbles on different surfaces. However, the ability to tune and control the rate of bubble bursting is not yet achieved. Scaling down surface&#8208;induced bubble bursting to just a few milliseconds is important for any application. In this work, the hierarchical structure of superamphiphobic surfaces is tuned in order to rapidly rupture contacting bubbles. Surfaces prepared using liquid flame spray show ultrafast bubble bursting (down to 2&#160;ms) and superior durability. The coatings demonstrate excellent mechanical and chemical stability even in the presence of surface&#8208;active species. Air from the ruptured bubble is absorbed into the aerophilic Cassie&#8208;state. Long&#8208;term applicability is demonstrated by preventing the accumulation of air in the plastron via a connection of the plastron to the environment. The times recorded for bubble rupture and complete reorganization of air are reduced by approximately a factor of 3 compared to previously reported values. The concept is utilized to passively control surfactant&#8208;rich foam in froth flotation. Material collection efficiency increased by more than 60&#160;times compared to controls.

         <title>Synaptic Plasticity Powering Long&#8208;Afterglow Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synaptic indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IGZO) layer is integrated into a novel organic light&#8208;emitting transistor (OLET) device. The UV&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoinduced synaptic effect is used to power a persistent bright afterglow emission in an organic light&#8208;emitting material. The unique OLETs are integrated in active&#8208;matrix light&#8208;emitting arrays operating as visual UV sensors capable of long&#8208;lifetime green&#8208;light emission in the irradiated regions.








Abstract
Long&#8208;lasting luminescence in optoelectronic devices is highly sought after for applications in optical data storage and display technology. While in light&#8208;emitting diodes this is achieved by exploiting long&#8208;afterglow organic materials as active components, such a strategy has never been pursued in light&#8208;emitting transistors, which are still rather unexplored and whose technological potential is yet to be demonstrated. Herein, the fabrication of long&#8208;afterglow organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (LAOLETs) is reported whose operation relies on an unprecedented strategy based on a photoinduced synaptic effect in an inorganic indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IGZO) semiconducting channel layer, to power a persistent electroluminescence in organic light&#8208;emitting materials. Oxygen vacancies in the IGZO layer, produced by irradiation at &#955;&#160;= 312&#160;nm, free electrons in excess yielding to a channel conductance increase. Due to the slow recombination kinetics of photogenerated electrons to oxygen vacancies in the channel layer, the organic material can be fueled by postsynaptic current and displays a long&#8208;lived light&#8208;emission (hundreds of seconds) after ceasing UV irradiation. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the LAOLETs are integrated in active&#8208;matrix light&#8208;emitting arrays operating as visual UV sensors capable of long&#8208;lifetime green&#8208;light emission in the irradiated regions.

         <title>A Zwitterionic Polyurethane Nanoporous Device with Low Foreign&#8208;Body Response for Islet Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zwitterionic nanofibrous islet encapsulation device made of sulfobetaine&#8208;modified polyurethane is reported. The device is mechanically robust, effective in preventing cell entrance or escape, hydrophilic with facile mass transfer, and biocompatible with low levels of fibrotic deposition in mice, dogs, and pigs. These attributes make it an attractive candidate for safe delivery of insulin&#8208;producing cells to treat type 1 diabetes.








Abstract
Encapsulation of insulin&#8208;producing cells is a promising strategy for treatment of type 1 diabetes. However, engineering an encapsulation device that is both safe (i.e., no cell escape and no breakage) and functional (i.e., low foreign&#8208;body response (FBR) and high mass transfer) remains a challenge. Here, a family of zwitterionic polyurethanes (ZPU) with sulfobetaine groups in the polymer backbone is developed, which are fabricated into encapsulation devices with tunable nanoporous structures via electrospinning. The ZPU encapsulation device is hydrophilic and fouling&#8208;resistant, exhibits robust mechanical properties, and prevents cell escape while still allowing efficient mass transfer. The ZPU device also induces a much lower FBR or cellular overgrowth upon intraperitoneal implantation in C57BL/6 mice for up to 6 months compared to devices made of similar polyurethane without the zwitterionic modification. The therapeutic potential of the ZPU device is shown for islet encapsulation and diabetes correction in mice for &#8776;3 months is demonstrated. As a proof of concept, the scalability and retrievability of the ZPU device in pigs and dogs are further demonstrated. Collectively, these attributes make ZPU devices attractive candidates for cell encapsulation therapies.

         <title>High&#8208;Strength and Nonfouling Zwitterionic Triple&#8208;Network Hydrogel in Saline Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy is developed to achieve both high mechanical strength and excellent nonfouling properties in saline environments, important for biomedical and engineering applications, by constructing a pure zwitterionic triple&#8208;network hydrogel. Strong chain entanglement and electrostatic interactions provide effective energy dissipation to improve the mechanical strength and toughness of the hydrogel.








Abstract
Zwitterionic hydrogels have received great attention due to their excellent nonfouling and biocompatible properties, but they suffer from weak mechanical strength in the saline environments important for biomedical and engineering applications due to the &#8220;anti&#8208;polyelectrolyte&#8221; effect. Conventional strategies to introduce hydrophobic or non&#8208;zwitterionic components to increase mechanical strength compromise their nonfouling properties. Here, a highly effective strategy is reported to achieve both high mechanical strength and excellent nonfouling properties by constructing a pure zwitterionic triple&#8208;network (ZTN) hydrogel. The strong electrostatic interaction and network entanglement within the triple&#8208;network structure can effectively dissipate energy to toughen the hydrogel and achieve high strength, toughness, and stiffness in saline environments (compressive fracture stress 18.2 &#177; 1.4&#160;MPa,&#160;toughness 1.62 &#177; 0.03&#160;MJ m&#8211;3,&#160;and modulus 0.66 &#177; 0.03&#160;MPa&#160;in seawater environments). Moreover, the ZTN hydrogel is shown to strongly resist the attachment of proteins, bacteria, and cells. The results provide a fundamental understanding to guide the design of tough nonfouling zwitterionic hydrogels for a broad range of applications.

         <title>Modular Assembly of Tumor&#8208;Penetrating and Oligomeric Nanozyme Based on Intrinsically Self&#8208;Assembling Protein Nanocages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
It remains challenging to precisely control and reproducibly formulate nanomedicines. A nanomaterial&#8208;based synthetic biology strategy is established for tailoring oligomeric nanostructures and a series of artificial metalloenzymes in a precisely controlled manner, which offers an option for tailored anticancer nanomedicines that have a high degree of control over both geometry and valency.








Abstract
Biomimetic design of nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like characteristics has emerged as a promising method for the generation of novel therapeutics. However, synthesis of nanomaterials while maintaining a high degree of control over both geometry and valency poses a prominent challenge. Herein, the authors introduce a nanomaterial&#8208;based synthetic biology strategy for accurate and quantitative tailoring of high&#8208;ordered nanostructures that uses a &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; hierarchical incorporation of protein building blocks. The assembled nano&#8208;oligomers possessed tunable protein motifs and multivalent binding domains, which facilitated prolonged blood circulation time, accumulation within tumor cells through direct targeting of cell receptors, and deep tumor tissue penetration via a transcytosis mechanism. Using these protein/protein nano&#8208;oligomers as scaffolds, the authors created a new series of artificial nano&#8208;scaled metalloenzymes (nanozymes) by the in situ incorporation of metal nanoclusters within the cavity of the protein nanocages. Nanozymes were&#160;capable of mimicking peroxidase&#8208;like activity and generated cytotoxic free radicals. Compared to nanozyme alone, the systemic delivery of oligomeric nanozymes demonstrated significantly enhanced therapeutic and anti&#8208;tumor benefits. This study shows a new insight into nanotechnology by taking advantage of synthetic biotechnology.

         <title>Hydrophilicity&#8208;Hydrophobicity Transformation, Thermoresponsive Morphomechanics, and Crack Multifurcation Revealed by AIEgens in Mechanically Strong Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>

The direct visualization of microphase separation and easy differentiation of hydrophilicity&#8211;hydrophobicity transformation is achieved in a facile, high&#8208;contrast, and noninvasive manner by using luminogens with aggregation&#8208;induced emission as fluorescent indicators. Based on the morphological observation and mechanical study, the concept of morphomechanics with a comprehensive mechanism clarification is proposed.








Abstract
Biomimetic exploration of stimuli&#8208;responsive and crack&#8208;resistant hydrogels is of great academic and practical significance, although the rational design of tough hydrogels is limited by insufficient mechanism study due to the lack of imaging techniques to &#8220;see&#8221; hydrogels at mesoscale level. A series of composite hydrogels with compartmentalized thermal response is designed by incorporating aggregation&#8208; and polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorescent probes in a poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) network grafted with poly(N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) side&#8208;chains. The fluorescence technique is explored as a powerful tool to directly visualize their hydrophilicity&#8208;hydrophobicity transformation and the composition&#8208;dependent microphase separation. Based on the morphological observation and mechanical measurements, the concept of morphomechanics with a comprehensive mechanism clarification is proposed. In this regard, the thermoresponsive toughening is attributed to the formation of multiple noncovalent interactions and the conformational changes of PNIPAM chains. The enhanced fracture energy by crack multifurcation is related to the tearing&#8208;like disruption of weak interfaces between the separated phases.

         <title>Metavalent Bonding in Crystalline Solids: How Does It Collapse?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metavalent bonding in solids is shown to differ significantly from covalent bonding, as demonstrated by pronounced property changes for optical, vibrational, electronic, and structural properties upon the transition from covalent to metavalent bonding. This insight and the resulting map showing trends in chemical bonding and material properties can be used to design and tailor materials.








Abstract
The chemical bond is one of the most powerful, yet much debated concepts in chemistry, explaining property trends in solids. Recently, a novel type of chemical bonding was&#160;identified in several higher chalcogenides, characterized by a unique property portfolio, unconventional bond breaking, and sharing of about one electron between adjacent atoms. This metavalent bond is a fundamental type of bonding in solids, besides covalent, ionic, and metallic bonding, raising the pertinent question as to whether there is a well&#8208;defined transition between metavalent and covalent bonds. Here, three different pseudo&#8208;binary lines, namely, GeTe1&#8722;xSex, Sb2Te3(1&#8722;x)Se3x, and Bi2&#8722;2xSb2xSe3, are studied, and a sudden change in several properties, including optical absorption &#949;2(&#969;), optical dielectric constant &#949;&#8734;, Born effective charge Z*, electrical conductivity, as well as bond breaking behavior for a critical Se or Sb concentration, is evidenced. These findings provide a blueprint to experimentally explore the influence of metavalent bonding on attractive properties of phase&#8208;change materials and thermoelectrics. Particularly important is its impact on optical properties, which can be tailored by the amount of electrons shared between adjacent atoms. This correlation can be used to design optoelectronic materials and to explore systematic changes in chemical bonding with stoichiometry and atomic arrangement.

         <title>Photonic Bandgap in Achiral Liquid Crystals&#8212;A Twist on a Twist</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photonic bandgap phenomenon is observed in a liquid crystalline phase built of achiral molecules, in which a tendency to twist is caused by steric interactions between strongly bent molecules. A selective reflection of visible light appears due to unwinding of the helical structure at the transition between two smectic phases having a single&#8208; and double&#8208;helical structure.








Abstract
Achiral mesogenic molecules are shown to be able to spontaneously assemble into liquid crystalline smectic phases having either simple or double&#8208;helical structures. At the transition between these phases, the double&#8208;helical structure unwinds. As a consequence, in some temperature range, the pitch of the helix becomes comparable to the wavelength of visible light and the selective reflection of light in the visible range is observed. The photonic bandgap phenomenon is reported for achiral liquid crystals.

         <title>A Sustainable and Flexible Microbrush&#8208;Faced Triboelectric Generator for Portable/Wearable Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microbrush&#8208;faced triboelectric nanogenerator featuring high robustness, outstanding sustainability, and excellent durability displays remarkable capability for mechanical energy harvesting in separate working modes. Human&#8208;being&#8208;interactive triboelectrification with this device reveals outstanding power generation and durability, suggesting that it can serve as a power source for various types of handheld electronics.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are put forward as a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy&#8208;scavenging technology for self&#8208;powered electronics, but their severe wear and degradation driven by inevitable friction can pose significant durability and sustainability concerns. Here, an array of microfibers is reported that functions as a robust and sustainable TENG in both in&#8208;plane sliding and vertical contact&#8208;separation modes, with excellent electrical potential as high as 20&#160;V and a high cyclability of 3000. The design flexibility of this microbrush TENG (MB&#8208;TENG) on the counter materials facilitates the further improvement of electrical outputs, benefiting numerous applications of human&#8208;interactive triboelectrification. Significantly, these MB&#8208;TENGs offer sufficient output power for successfully driving a smartwatch as well as an electromyography module. This technology uses a simple and cost&#8208;effective manner to provide a robust and reliable monolithic TENG module, which is expected to serve as a promising energy&#8208;harvesting source for self&#8208;powered electronics in the near future.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Cooperative Transition in Molecular Electronic Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A major challenge in a supramolecular electronic crystal is switchable control of its hidden phase. The cooperative tuning of K&#8208;TCNQ through a pulsed electromagnetic field into an emergent electronic disorder state, enabling access to a long&#8208;lived (over 400 days) hidden conducting phase, is found. A switchable magneto&#8208;electronic bistability is realized in a broad temperature range from 2 to 360 K.








Abstract
The competing and non&#8208;equilibrium phase transitions, involving dynamic tunability of cooperative electronic and magnetic states in strongly correlated materials, show great promise in quantum sensing and information technology. To date, the stabilization of transient states is still in the preliminary stage, particularly with respect to molecular electronic solids. Here, a dynamic and cooperative phase in potassium&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (K&#8208;TCNQ) with the control of pulsed electromagnetic excitation is demonstrated. Simultaneous dynamic and coherent lattice perturbation with 8 ns&#160;pulsed laser (532&#160;nm, 15 MW&#160;cm&#8722;2, 10 Hz)&#160;in such a molecular electronic crystal initiates a stable long&#8208;lived (over 400 days) conducting paramagnetic state (&#8776;42 &#937;cm), showing the charge&#8211;spin bistability over a broad temperature range from 2 to 360 K. Comprehensive noise spectroscopy, in situ high&#8208;pressure measurements, electron spin resonance (ESR), theoretical model, and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) studies provide further evidence that such a transition is cooperative, requiring a dedicated charge&#8211;spin&#8211;lattice decoupling to activate and subsequently stabilize nonequilibrium phase. The cooperativity triggered by ultrahigh&#8208;strain&#8208;rate (above 106 s&#8722;1) pulsed excitation offers a collective control toward the generation and stabilization of strongly correlated electronic and magnetic orders in molecular electronic solids and offers unique electro&#8208;magnetic phases with technological promises.

The cooperativity triggered by ultrahigh-strain-rate (above 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) pulsed excitation offers a collective control toward the generation and stabilization of strongly correlated electronic and magnetic orders in molecular electronic solids and offers unique electro-magnetic phases with technological promises.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Daratumumab Immunopolymersome&#8208;Enabled Safe and CD38&#8208;Targeted Chemotherapy and Depletion of Multiple Myeloma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immuno&#8208;nanomedicines are emerging targeted cancer therapeutics that might reshape the clinical treatment scheme. Novel fabrication of small and smart daratumumab immunopolymersomes is presented carrying vincristine sulfate that induce extraordinary potency and selectivity while mitigating systemic toxicity toward orthotopic multiple myeloma in vivo.








Abstract
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a second ranking hematological malignancy. Despite the fast advancement of new treatments such as bortezormib and daratumumab, MM patients remain incurable and tend to eventually become relapsed and drug&#8208;resistant. Development of novel therapies capable of depleting MM cells is strongly needed. Here, daratumumab immunopolymersomes carrying vincristine sulfate (Dar&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR) are reported for safe and high&#8208;efficacy CD38&#8208;targeted chemotherapy and depletion of orthotopic MM in vivo. Dar&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR made by postmodification via strain&#8208;promoted click reaction holds tailored antibody density (2.2, 4.4 to 8.7 Dar per IPs), superb stability, small size (43&#8211;49&#160;nm), efficacious VCR loading, and glutathione&#8208;responsive VCR release. Dar4.4&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR induces exceptional anti&#8208;MM activity with an IC50 of 76 &#215; 10&#8722;12 m to CD38&#8208;positive LP&#8208;1&#160;MM cells, 12&#8208; and 20&#8208;fold enhancement over nontargeted Ps&#8208;VCR and free VCR controls, respectively. Intriguingly, mice bearing orthotopic LP&#8208;1&#8208;Luc MM following four cycles of i.v. administration of Dar4.4&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR at 0.25&#160;mg VCR equiv. kg&#8722;1 reveal complete depletion of LP&#8208;1&#8208;Luc cells, superior survival rate to all controls, and no body weight loss. The bone and histological analyses indicate bare bone and organ damage. Dar&#8208;IPs&#8208;VCR appears as a safe and targeted treatment for CD38&#8208;overexpressed hematological malignancies.

         <title>Improving the Stability of Non&#8208;Noble&#8208;Metal M&#8211;N&#8211;C Catalysts for Proton&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Fuel Cells through M&#8211;N Bond Length and Coordination Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective and universal strategy is developed to improve the stability of M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts in half&#8208;cell and H2&#8211;O2/air fuel cells by accurately regulating the M&#63743;N bond length/coordination. Interestingly, the Fe&#63743;N bond length/coordination of the catalysts are strongly dependent on the binding constant of Fe3+ and polymer in the precursors, which can be linked with their performance degradation in fuel cells.








Abstract
An effective and universal strategy is developed to enhance the stability of the non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal M&#8211;Nx/C catalyst in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) by improving the bonding strength between metal ions and chelating polymers, i.e., poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) homopolymer and poly(acrylic acid&#8211;maleic acid) (P(AA&#8208;MA)) copolymer with different AA/MA ratios. M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveal that the optimal P(AA&#8208;MA)&#8211;Fe&#8211;N catalyst with a higher Fe3+&#8211;polymer binding constant possesses longer Fe&#63743;N bonds and exclusive Fe&#8211;N4/C moiety compared to PAA&#8211;Fe&#8211;N, which consists of &#8776;15% low&#8208;coordinated Fe&#8211;N2/N3 structures. The optimized P(AA&#8208;MA)&#8211;Fe&#8211;N catalyst exhibits outstanding ORR activity and stability in both half&#8208;cell and PEMFC cathodes, with the retention rate of current density approaching 100% for the first 37 h at 0.55&#160;V in an H2&#8211;air fuel cell. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the Fe&#8211;N4/C site could optimize the difference between the adsorption energy of the Fe atoms on the support (Ead) and the bulk cohesive energy (Ecoh) relative to Fe&#8211;N2/N3 moieties, thereby strongly stabilizing Fe centers against demetalation.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly tunable superconducting&#8211;semiconducting hybrid junction based on intrinsic germanium (i&#8208;Ge) nanowires is revealed. Low&#8208;temperature transport measurements of ultrascaled monolithic Al&#8211;Ge&#8211;Al nanowire heterostructures featuring monocrystalline Al leads and abrupt Al&#8211;Ge interfaces demonstrate that such i&#8208;Ge quantum dot devices can be tuned to access three distinct regimes: single&#8208;hole&#8208;filling quantum dots, an intermediate sub&#8208;gap states regime, and a superconducting regime.








Abstract
Superconductor&#8211;semiconductor&#8211;superconductor heterostructures are attractive for both fundamental studies of quantum phenomena in low&#8208;dimensional hybrid systems as well as for future high&#8208;performance low power dissipating nanoelectronic and quantum devices. In this work, ultrascaled monolithic Al&#8211;Ge&#8211;Al nanowire heterostructures featuring monocrystalline Al leads and abrupt metal&#8211;semiconductor interfaces are used to probe the low&#8208;temperature transport in intrinsic Ge (i&#8208;Ge) quantum dots. In particular, demonstrating the ability to tune the Ge quantum dot device from completely insulating, through a single&#8208;hole&#8208;filling quantum dot regime, to a supercurrent regime, resembling a Josephson field effect transistor with a maximum critical current of 10 nA at a temperature of 390 mK. The realization of a Josephson field&#8208;effect transistor with high junction transparency provides a mechanism to study sub&#8208;gap transport mediated by Andreev states. The presented results reveal a promising intrinsic Ge&#8208;based architecture for hybrid superconductor&#8211;semiconductor devices for the study of Majorana zero modes and key components of quantum computing such as gatemons or gate tunable superconducting quantum interference devices.

         <title>Anisotropic Iridescence and Polarization Patterns in a Direct Ink Written Chiral Photonic Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by natural examples of patterned iridescence, an ink based on a chiral nematic liquid crystal that can be processed with a direct ink writer 3D printer is shown. Tuning the writing direction and speed leads to the programmed formation of a slanted photonic axis that exhibits atypical iridescence and polarization selectivity.








Abstract
The iridescence of structural color and its polarization characteristics originate from the nanoscale organization of materials. A major challenge in materials science is generating the bright, lustrous hues seen in nature through nanoscale engineering, while simultaneously controlling interaction of the material with different light polarizations. In this work, a suitable chiral nematic liquid crystal elastomer ink is synthesized for direct ink writing, which self&#8208;assembles into a chiral photonic structure. Tuning the writing direction and speed leads to the programmed formation of a slanted photonic axis, which exhibits atypical iridescence and polarization selectivity. After crosslinking, a freely programmable, chiroptical photonic polymer material is obtained. The strongly perspective&#8208;dependent appearance of the material can function as specialized anticounterfeit markers, as optical elements in decorative iridescent coatings, or, as demonstrated here, in optically based signaling features.

     alt="Anisotropic Iridescence and Polarization Patterns in a Direct Ink Written Chiral Photonic Polymer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by natural examples of patterned iridescence, an ink based on a chiral nematic liquid crystal that can be processed with a direct ink writer 3D printer is shown. Tuning the writing direction and speed leads to the programmed formation of a slanted photonic axis that exhibits atypical iridescence and polarization selectivity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iridescence of structural color and its polarization characteristics originate from the nanoscale organization of materials. A major challenge in materials science is generating the bright, lustrous hues seen in nature through nanoscale engineering, while simultaneously controlling interaction of the material with different light polarizations. In this work, a suitable chiral nematic liquid crystal elastomer ink is synthesized for direct ink writing, which self-assembles into a chiral photonic structure. Tuning the writing direction and speed leads to the programmed formation of a slanted photonic axis, which exhibits atypical iridescence and polarization selectivity. After crosslinking, a freely programmable, chiroptical photonic polymer material is obtained. The strongly perspective-dependent appearance of the material can function as specialized anticounterfeit markers, as optical elements in decorative iridescent coatings, or, as demonstrated here, in optically based signaling features.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Symmetry Breaking in Chiral Magnetic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel domain growth behaviors are observed with respect to in&#8208;plane magnetic fields in [Co/Ni/Pt] multilayers with chiral N&#233;el&#8208;type domain walls (DWs), including growth perpendicular to the in&#8208;plane field axis. Accounting for steady&#8208;state DW dynamics, the reported model successfully predicts the magnetization and energetic profiles that promote these asymmetries. These results expand the utility of DW motion in probing chiral magnetism.








Abstract
The Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) in magnetic systems stabilizes spin textures with preferred chirality, applicable to next&#8208;generation memory and computing architectures. In perpendicularly magnetized heavy&#8208;metal/ferromagnet films, the interfacial DMI originating from structural inversion asymmetry and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling favors chiral N&#233;el&#8208;type domain walls (DWs) whose energetics and mobility remain at issue. Here, a new effect is characterized in which domains expand unidirectionally in response to a combination of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane magnetic fields, with the growth direction controlled by the in&#8208;plane field strength. These growth directionalities and symmetries with applied fields cannot be understood from static treatments alone. The authors theoretically demonstrate that perpendicular field torques stabilize steady&#8208;state magnetization profiles highly asymmetric in elastic energy, resulting in a dynamic symmetry breaking consistent with the experimental findings. This phenomenon sheds light on the mechanisms governing the dynamics of N&#233;el&#8208;type DWs and expands the utility of field&#8208;driven DW motion to probe and control chiral DWs.

&lt;p&gt;Novel domain growth behaviors are observed with respect to in-plane magnetic fields in [Co/Ni/Pt] multilayers with chiral N&#233;el-type domain walls (DWs), including growth perpendicular to the in-plane field axis. Accounting for steady-state DW dynamics, the reported model successfully predicts the magnetization and energetic profiles that promote these asymmetries.

         <title>Reduced Intrinsic Non&#8208;Radiative Losses Allow Room&#8208;Temperature Triplet Emission from Purely Organic Emitters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substitution of a hydrogen atom with an N&#8208;phenyl ring is demonstrated to convert an organic material without phosphorescence emission into a molecular system exhibiting efficient and ultralong afterglow phosphorescence at room temperature, originating from a reduction of intrinsic non&#8208;radiative molecular relaxations, which can be used for data safety applications.








Abstract
Persistent luminescence from triplet excitons in organic molecules is rare, as fast non&#8208;radiative deactivation typically dominates over radiative transitions. This work demonstrates that the substitution of a hydrogen atom in a derivative of phenanthroimidazole with an N&#8208;phenyl ring can substantially stabilize the excited state. This stabilization converts an organic material without phosphorescence emission into a molecular system exhibiting efficient and ultralong afterglow phosphorescence at room temperature. Results from systematic photophysical investigations, kinetic modeling, excited&#8208;state dynamic modeling, and single&#8208;crystal structure analysis identify that the long&#8208;lived triplets originate from a reduction of intrinsic non&#8208;radiative molecular relaxations. Further modification of the N&#8208;phenyl ring with halogen atoms affects the afterglow lifetime and quantum yield. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, an anticounterfeiting device is demonstrated with a time&#8208;dependent Morse code feature for data encryption based on these emitters. A fundamental design principle is outlined to achieve long&#8208;lived and emissive triplet states by suppressing intrinsic non&#8208;radiative relaxations in the form of molecular vibrations or rotations.

         <title>54 cm2 Large&#8208;Area Flexible Organic Solar Modules with Efficiency Above 13%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient large&#8208;area flexible solar cells and modules are demonstrated based on a printable, transparent, low&#8208;surface&#8208;roughness, flexible electrode (silver nanowires:zinc&#8208;chelated polyethylenimine). A power conversion efficiency of 13.2% is obtained for a 54 cm2 solar module. The flexible electrode is also demonstrated in high&#8208;performance flexible quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes.








Abstract
Development of large&#8208;area flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) is highly desirable for their practical applications. However, the efficiency of the large&#8208;area flexible OSCs severely lags behind small&#8208;area devices. Here, efficient large&#8208;area flexible single cells with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.1% and 12.6% for areas of 6 and 10 cm2, and flexible modules with a PCE of 13.2% (54 cm2) based on poly(ethylene terephthalate)/Ag grid/silver nanowires (AgNWs):zinc&#8208;chelated polyethylenimine (PEI&#8208;Zn) composite electrodes are reported. The solution&#8208;processed flexible transparent electrode of AgNWs:PEI&#8208;Zn shows low surface roughness and good optoelectronic and mechanical properties. PEI&#8208;Zn is conductive and optically transparent. It can adhere to and wrap the AgNWs under electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged surface (AgNWs) and positively charged protonated amine groups (in PEI&#8208;Zn). It wraps the AgNWs networks and fills the void space to achieve a smooth surface. The flexible electrode is validated in both flexible OSCs and flexible quantum&#8208;dots light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). Small&#8208;area flexible OSCs show a PCE of 16.1%, and flexible QLEDs show an external quantum efficiency of 13.3%. In the end, a flexible module is demonstrated to charge a mobile phone as a flexible power source (shown in Video S1, Supporting Information).

         <title>A Bioresorbable Dynamic Pressure Sensor for Cardiovascular Postoperative Care</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioresorbable electronics that can be absorbed and become part of the organism after their service life are a new trend to avoid secondary invasive surgery. A flexible bioresorbable triboelectric pressure sensor is demonstrated based on the triboelectric effect. It can overcome the material limitations caused by the working principle. This device is expected to be applied in postoperative care.








Abstract
Bioresorbable electronics that can be absorbed and become part of the organism after their service life are a new trend to avoid secondary invasive surgery. However, the material limitation is a significant challenge. There are fewer biodegradable materials with pressure&#8208;sensitive properties. Here, a pressure sensor based on the triboelectric effect between bioabsorbable materials is reported. This effect is available in almost all materials. The bioresorbable triboelectric sensor (BTS) can directly convert ambient pressure changes into electrical signals. This device successfully identifies abnormal vascular occlusion events in large animals (dogs). The service life of the BTS reaches 5 days with a high service efficiency (5.95%). The BTS offers excellent sensitivity (11 mV&#160;mmHg&#8722;1), linearity (R2&#160;= 0.993), and good durability (450&#160;000 cycles). The antibacterial bioresorbable materials (poly(lactic acid)&#8211;(chitosan 4%)) for the BTS can achieve 99% sterilization. Triboelectric devices are expected to be applied in postoperative care as bioresorbable electronics.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Halide Perovskite Field&#8208;Effect Transistors by Ion Transport Mitigation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Realization of solution&#8208;processed halide perovskites transistors is challenging due to the presence of mobile ions. A generic strategy is demonstrated that can be applied for regulating ions in mixed ionic&#8211;electronic semiconductors and that enables the demonstration of perovskite transistors working at room&#8208;temperature by fixation of the mobile ions through ferroelectric polarization. 








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed halide perovskites have emerged as excellent optoelectronic materials for applications in photovoltaic solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, the presence of mobile ions in the material hinders the development of perovskite field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) due to screening of the gate potential in the nearby perovskite channel, and the resulting impediment to achieving gate modulation of an electronic current at room temperature. Here, room&#8208;temperature operation is demonstrated in cesium lead tribromide (CsPbBr3) perovskite&#8208;based FETs using an auxiliary ferroelectric gate of poly(vinylidenefluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)], to electrostatically fixate the mobile ions. The large interfacial polarization of the ferroelectric gate attracts the mobile ions away from the main nonferroelectric gate interface, thereby enabling modulation of the electronic current through the channel by the main gate. This strategy allows for realization of the p&#8208;type CsPbBr3 channel and revealing the thermally activated nature of the hole charge transport. The proposed strategy is generic and can be applied for regulating ions in a variety of ionic&#8211;electronic mixed semiconductors.

         <title>A Tandem Organic Photovoltaic Cell with 19.6% Efficiency Enabled by Light Distribution Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By fine&#8208;tuning the optical field distribution and employing photovoltaic materials with low energy losses in tandem photovoltaic cell, a power conversion efficiency of 19.64% is achieved.








Abstract
Despite more potential in realizing higher photovoltaic performance, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of tandem organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells still lags behind that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art single&#8208;junction cells. In this work, highly efficient double&#8208;junction tandem OPV cells are fabricated by optimizing the photoactive layers with low voltage losses and developing an effective method to tune optical field distribution. The tandem OPV cells studied are structured as indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/bottom photoactive layer/interconnecting layer (ICL)/top photoactive layer/MoOx/Ag, where the bottom and top photoactive layers are based on blends of PBDB&#8208;TF:ITCC and PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC11, respectively, and ICL refers to interconnecting layer structured as MoOx/Ag/ZnO:PFN&#8208;Br. As these results indicate that there is not much room for optimizing the bottom photoactive layer, more effort is put into fine&#8208;tuning the top photoactive layer. By rationally modulating the composition and thickness of PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC11 blend films, the 300 nm&#8208;thick PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC11 film with 1:2 D/A ratio is found to be an ideal photoactive layer for the top sub&#8208;cell in terms of photovoltaic characteristics and light distribution control. For the optimized tandem cell, a PCE of 19.64% is realized, which is the highest result in the OPV field and certified as 19.50% by the National Institute of Metrology.

         <title>Magnetization Signature of Topological Surface States in a Non&#8208;Symmorphic Superconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly anomalous surface superconductivity is reported in a non&#8208;symmorphic superconductor, In2Bi, where the nontrivial band structure results in the existence of topologically protected surface states (TSS). The near&#8208;perfect screening of low&#8208;frequency magnetic fields well above the upper critical field is explained by proximity superconductivity of TSS. Detecting TSS via macroscopic magnetization provides a new tool for identification of topological superconductors.








Abstract
Superconductors with nontrivial band structure topology represent a class of materials with unconventional and potentially useful properties. Recent years have seen much success in creating artificial hybrid structures exhibiting the main characteristics of 2D topological superconductors. Yet, bulk materials known to combine inherent superconductivity with nontrivial topology remain scarce, largely because distinguishing their central characteristic&#8212;the topological surface states&#8212;has proved challenging due to a dominant contribution from the superconducting bulk. In this work, a highly anomalous behavior of surface superconductivity in topologically nontrivial 3D superconductor In2Bi, where the surface states result from its nontrivial band structure, itself a consequence of the non&#8208;symmorphic crystal symmetry and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, is reported. In contrast to smoothly decreasing diamagnetic susceptibility above the bulk critical field, Hc2, as seen in conventional superconductors, a near&#8208;perfect, Meissner&#8208;like screening of low&#8208;frequency magnetic fields well above Hc2 is observed. The enhanced diamagnetism disappears at a new phase transition close to the critical field of surface superconductivity, Hc3. Using theoretical modeling, the anomalous screening is shown to be consistent with modification of surface superconductivity by the topological surface states. The possibility of detecting signatures of the surface states using macroscopic magnetization provides a new tool for the discovery and identification of topological superconductors.

         <title>Homogeneous Carbon/Potassium&#8208;Incorporation Strategy for Synthesizing Red Polymeric Carbon Nitride Capable of Near&#8208;Infrared Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solid&#8208;salt&#8208;induced homogeneous incorporation strategy realizes red carbon/potassium&#8208;incorporated polymeric carbon nitride, which exhibits highly efficient H2 evolution from water and in situ hydrogen gas (drug&#8208;free) cancer therapy excited by near&#8208;infrared light.








Abstract
The efficient utilization of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light for photocatalytic hydrogen generation is vitally important to both solar hydrogen energy and hydrogen medicine, but remains a challenge at present, owing to the strict requirement of the semiconductor for high NIR responsiveness, narrow bandgap, and suitable redox potentials. Here, an NIR&#8208;active carbon/potassium&#8208;doped red polymeric carbon nitride (RPCN) is achieved for by using a similar&#8208;structure dopant as the melamine (C3H6N6) precursor with the solid KCl. The homogeneous and high incorporation of carbon and potassium remarkably narrows the bandgap of carbon nitride (1.7&#160;eV) and endows RPCN with a high NIR&#8208;photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution from water at the rate of 140 &#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 under NIR irradiation (700 nm &#8804; &#955;&#160;&#8804; 780&#160;nm), and the apparent quantum efficiency is high as 0.84% at 700 &#177; 10&#160;nm (and 13% at 500 &#177; 10&#160;nm). A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment on a tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model verifies RPCN as being capable of intratumoral NIR&#8208;photocatalytic hydrogen generation and simultaneous glutathione deprivation for safe and high&#8208;efficacy drug&#8208;free cancer therapy. The results shed light on designing efficient photocatalysts to capture the full spectrum of solar energy, and also pioneer a new pathway to develop NIR photocatalysts for hydrogen therapy of major diseases.

An endogenous tumor&#8208;associated macrophage (TAM)&#8208;targeted biomimetic nano red blood cell (nano&#8208;RBC) system is engineered via self&#8208;assembly of a hemoglobin&#8211;poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (Hb&#8211;PCL) conjugate for enhanced cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. The doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded nano&#8208;RBC (V(Hb)@DOX) can innately target to decrease the number of immunosuppressive TAMs. Moreover, the O2 released from nano&#8208;RBC relieves tumor hypoxia, which further reprograms the immunosuppressive state to stimulate antitumor responses. The synergistic chemo&#8208;immunotherapy effectively suppresses tumor growth, inhibits metastasis, and prevents autologous tumor recurrence.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has shown encouraging results in various cancers, but the response rates are relatively low due to the complex tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME). The presence of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor hypoxia correlates significantly with potent immunosuppressive activity. Here, a hemoglobin&#8211;poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (Hb&#8211;PCL) conjugate self&#8208;assembled biomimetic nano red blood cell (nano&#8208;RBC) system (V(Hb)) is engineered to deliver chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (DOX) and oxygen for reprogramming TIME. The Hb moiety of V(Hb)@DOX can bind to endogenous plasma haptoglobin (Hp) and specifically target the M2&#8208;type TAMs via the CD163 surface receptor, and effectively kill the cells. In addition, the O2 released by the Hb alleviates tumor hypoxia, which further augments the antitumor immune response by recruiting fewer M2&#8208;type macrophages. TAM&#8208;targeting depletion and hypoxia alleviation synergistically reprogram the TIME, which concurrently downregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression of tumor cells, decrease the levels of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL&#8208;10 and TGF&#8208;&#946;, elevate the immunostimulatory IFN&#8208;&#947;, enhance cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, and boost a strong memory response. The ensuing TAM&#8208;targeted chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic effects markedly inhibit tumor metastasis and recurrence. Taken together, the engineered endogenous TAM&#8208;targeted biomimetic nano&#8208;RBC system is a highly promising tool to reprogram TIME for cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Atomic Layers of Transition&#8208;Metal Carbides (MXenes)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy atomic layers of transition&#8208;metal carbide (HE&#8208;MXene) are produced via selectively etching a high&#8208;entropy MAX phase, in which five transition&#8208;metal species are homogeneously dispersed into one MX slab, giving rise to stable transition&#8208;metal carbide in the atomic layers. The resultant HE&#8208;MXene has distinct lattice distortions and strains, efficiently guiding the nucleation and uniform growth of lithium.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) have great potential for energy storage and conversion due to their diverse compositions, and unexpected physical and chemical features. However, high&#8208;entropy atomic layers with fully exposed active sites are difficult to synthesize since their phases are easily segregated. Here, it is demonstrated that high&#8208;entropy atomic layers of transition&#8208;metal carbide (HE&#8208;MXene) can be produced via the selective etching of novel high&#8208;entropy MAX (also termed Mn+1AXn (n&#160;= 1, 2, 3), where M represents an early transition&#8208;metal element, A is an element mainly from groups 13&#8211;16, and X stands for C and/or N) phase (HE&#8208;MAX) (Ti1/5V1/5Zr1/5Nb1/5Ta1/5)2AlC, in which the five transition&#8208;metal species are homogeneously dispersed into one MX slab due to their solid&#8208;solution feature, giving rise to a stable transition&#8208;metal carbide in the atomic layers owing to the high molar configurational entropy and correspondingly low Gibbs free energy. Additionally, the resultant high&#8208;entropy MXene with distinct lattice distortions leads to high mechanical strain into the atomic layers. Moreover, the mechanical strain can efficiently guide the nucleation and uniform growth of dendrite&#8208;free lithium on HE&#8208;MXene, achieving a long cycling stability of up to 1200 h and good deep stripping&#8211;plating levels of up to 20 mAh cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;Selective Softening of Hydrogel Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly selective photochemical behavior of three chromophores with distinct degradation wavelengths is exploited for the construction of selectively degradable hydrogels. Specifically, hydrogel softening can be achieved in a stepwise fashion according to the chromophores&#8217; activation wavelength, enabling fine control over the hydrogel's mechanical properties.








Abstract
Photoresponsive hydrogels hold key potential in advanced biomedical applications including tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and drug delivery, as well as intricately engineered functions such as biosensing, soft robotics, and bioelectronics. Herein, the wavelength&#8208;dependent degradation of bio&#8208;orthogonal poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels is reported, using three selective activation levels. Specifically, three chromophores are exploited, that is, ortho&#8208;nitrobenzene, dimethyl aminobenzene, and bimane, each absorbing light at different wavelengths. By examining their photochemical action plots, the wavelength&#8208;dependent reactivity of the photocleavable moieties is determined. The wavelength&#8208;selective addressability of individual photoreactive units is subsequently translated into hydrogel design, enabling wavelength&#8208;dependent cleavage of the hydrogel networks on&#8208;demand. Critically, this platform technology allows for the fabrication of various hydrogels, whose mechanical properties can be fine&#8208;tuned using different colors of light to reach a predefined value, according to the chromophore ratios used. The softening is shown to influence the spreading of pre&#8208;osteoblastic cells adhering to the gels as a demonstration of their potential utility. Furthermore, the materials and photodegradation processes are non&#8208;toxic to cells, making this platform attractive for biomaterials engineering.

Chiral Photonic Polymers
In article number 2103309, Albertus P. H. J. Schenning, Michael G. Debije, and co&#8208;workers show that using direct ink writing, unconventional chiral nematic objects can be generated, which show a bright iridescent color from normal incidence, or only from sharp angles of observation depending on the writing speed. The cover is a polarized optical microscopy image showing a detail from the free&#8208;standing Morpho&#8208;inspired print.

MXenes
In article number 2103393, Michael Naguib,  Michel W. Barsoum, and Yury Gogotsi present a brief historical overview of the first 10 years of MXene research and a perspective on their synthesis and future development. The cover shows a colored SEM image of a multilayer Ti3C2 MXene particle with an accordion&#8208;like morphology, which is produced by individual MXene layers stacked together. The variety of colors represents the diversity of MXene structures and compositions. Image Credit: The SEM image was taken by Dr. Tyler Mathis and colored by Dr. Armin VahidMohammadi.

Cancer Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy
In article number 2103497, Yubin Huang, Dongfang Zhou, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate an engineered endogenous tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs)&#8208;targeting biomimetic nano&#8208;red&#8208;blood&#8208;cell (RBC) system to deliver chemotherapeutic doxorubicin and oxygen for enhanced cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. TAMs&#8208;targeting depletion and hypoxia alleviation synergistically reprogram the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. The ensuing TAMs&#8208;targeted chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic effects markedly inhibit tumor metastasis and recurrence.

Supramolecular Electronic Crystals
The cooperative tuning of a supramolecular electronic crystal enables access to a long&#8208;lived hidden conducting phase with a broad temperature range from 2 to 360 K, through a pulsed electromagnetic field. In article number 2103000, Shenqiang Ren and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a a dynamic and cooperative phase in K&#8208;TCNQ, with the control of pulsed electromagnetic excitation. A dedicated charge&#8211;spin&#8211;lattice decoupling is required to activate and subsequently stabilize the non&#8208;equilibrium phase.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent progress of MXenes synthesis strategies, including etching, intercalation, and delamination, is summarized. The large&#8208;scale preparation methods for MXenes and their derivates, such as flexible membranes and fibers, are discussed. Moreover, the understanding of the oxidation stability of MXenes and stable storage strategies are also addressed.








Abstract
2D transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, also known as MXenes, are versatile materials due to their adjustable structure and rich surface chemistry. The physical and chemical diversity has recognized MXenes as a potential 2D material with a wide spectrum of application domains. Since the discovery of MXenes in 2011, a wide variety of synthetic routes has been proposed with advancement toward large&#8208;scale preparing methods for MXene nanosheets and derivative products. Herein, the critical synthesis aspects and the operating conditions that influence the physical and chemical characteristics of MXenes are discussed in detail. The emerging etching methods including HF etching methods, in situ HF&#8208;forming etching methods, electrochemical etching methods, alkali etching methods, and molten salt etching methods, as well as delamination strategies are discussed. Considering the future developments and practical applications, the large&#8208;scale synthesis routes and the antioxidation strategies of MXenes are also summarized. In summary, a generalized overview of MXenes synthesis protocols with an outlook for the current challenges and promising technologies for large&#8208;scale preparation and stable storage is provided.

&lt;p&gt;2D transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, also known as MXenes, are versatile materials due to their adjustable structure and rich surface chemistry. The physical and chemical diversity has recognized MXenes as a potential 2D material with a wide spectrum of application domains. Since the discovery of MXenes in 2011, a wide variety of synthetic routes has been proposed with advancement toward large-scale preparing methods for MXene nanosheets and derivative products. Herein, the critical synthesis aspects and the operating conditions that influence the physical and chemical characteristics of MXenes are discussed in detail. The emerging etching methods including HF etching methods, in situ HF-forming etching methods, electrochemical etching methods, alkali etching methods, and molten salt etching methods, as well as delamination strategies are discussed. Considering the future developments and practical applications, the large-scale synthesis routes and the antioxidation strategies of MXenes are also summarized. In summary, a generalized overview of MXenes synthesis protocols with an outlook for the current challenges and promising technologies for large-scale preparation and stable storage is provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design of Immunomodulatory Hydrogels for Chronic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 39, October 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quality and duration of the healing process can be regulated via modulation of immune responses to tissue injury. Specifically, controlling pro&#8208;inflammatory phenotype&#8211;anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype progression is a crucial step to ensure a conversion from the inflammatory to the healing stage. In this regard, immunomodulatory hydrogels with specific chemistry and surface properties can influence immune cell polarization and the chronic wound healing process.








Abstract
With all the advances in tissue engineering for construction of fully functional skin tissue, complete regeneration of chronic wounds is still challenging. Since immune reaction to the tissue damage is critical in regulating both the quality and duration of chronic wound healing cascade, strategies to modulate the immune system are of importance. Generally, in response to an injury, macrophages switch from pro&#8208;inflammatory to an anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype. Therefore, controlling macrophages&#8217; polarization has become an appealing approach in regenerative medicine. Recently, hydrogels&#8208;based constructs, incorporated with various cellular and molecular signals, have been developed and utilized to adjust immune cell functions in various stages of wound healing. Here, the current state of knowledge on immune cell functions during skin tissue regeneration is first discussed. Recent advanced technologies used to design immunomodulatory hydrogels for controlling macrophages&#8217; polarization are then summarized. Rational design of hydrogels for providing controlled immune stimulation via hydrogel chemistry and surface modification, as well as incorporation of cell and molecules, are also dicussed. In addition, the effects of hydrogels&#8217; properties on immunogenic features and the wound healing process are summarized. Finally, future directions and upcoming research strategies to control immune responses during chronic wound healing are highlighted.

         <title>Emerging Technologies in Multi&#8208;Material Bioprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of the available 3D bioprinting technologies for fabricating multi&#8208;material constructs is presented. The technologies are classified into four major categories, and their advantages and shortcomings are compared. Available multi&#8208;material commercial bioprinters are reviewed, concluding with a perspective of the future path for developing multi&#8208;material technologies.








Abstract
Bioprinting, within the emerging field of biofabrication, aims at the fabrication of functional biomimetic constructs. Different 3D bioprinting techniques have been adapted to bioprint cell&#8208;laden bioinks. However, single&#8208;material bioprinting techniques oftentimes fail to reproduce the complex compositions and diversity of native tissues. Multi&#8208;material bioprinting as an emerging approach enables the fabrication of heterogeneous multi&#8208;cellular constructs that replicate their host microenvironments better than single&#8208;material approaches. Here, bioprinting modalities are reviewed, their being adapted to multi&#8208;material bioprinting is discussed, and their advantages and challenges, encompassing both custom&#8208;designed and commercially available technologies are analyzed. A perspective of how multi&#8208;material bioprinting opens up new opportunities for tissue engineering, tissue model engineering, therapeutics development, and personalized medicine is offered.

         <title>Engineering Nano&#8208; and Microparticles as Oral Delivery Vehicles to Promote Intestinal Lymphatic Drug Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational engineering of effective vehicles for lymphatic delivery of drugs, through targeting enterocytes or M cells, prevents their first&#8208;pass metabolism by the liver, markedly increasing the bioavailability of oral drugs. By achieving increased bioavailability, high drug concentrations are attainable at the lesions of interest with beneficial therapeutic effects, making intestinal lymphatic transport a unique modality of drug delivery.








Abstract
Targeted oral delivery of a drug via the intestinal lymphatic system (ILS) has the advantages of protecting against hepatic first&#8208;pass metabolism of the drug and improving its pharmacokinetic performance. It is also a promising route for the oral delivery of vaccines and therapeutic agents to induce mucosal immune responses and treat lymphatic diseases, respectively. This article describes the anatomical structures and physiological characteristics of the ILS, with an emphasis on enterocytes and microfold (M) cells, which are the main gateways for the transport of particulate delivery vehicles across the intestinal epithelium into the lymphatics. A comprehensive overview of recent advances in the rational engineering of particulate vehicles, along with the challenges and opportunities that they present for improving ILS drug delivery, is provided, and the mechanisms by which such vehicles target and transport through enterocytes or M cells are discussed. The use of naturally sourced materials, such as yeast microcapsules and their derived polymeric &#946;&#8208;glucans, as novel ILS&#8208;targeting delivery vehicles is also reviewed. Such use is the focus of an emerging field of research. Their potential use in the oral delivery of nucleic acids, such as mRNA vaccines, is proposed.

         <title>Application of Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion in Organic Optoelectronic Devices: Advances and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive summary of advances on developing efficient triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion materials and their application in optoelectronic devices is systematically given in this review. The key challenges and perspectives of TTA upconversion systems for further improvement for optoelectronic devices and other related research directions are provided. This review hopes to provide valuable guidelines for future advancement in organic optoelectronics.








Abstract
Organic semiconductor materials have been widely used in various optoelectronic devices due to their rich optical and/or electrical properties, which are highly related to their excited states. Therefore, how to manage and utilize the excited states in organic semiconductors is essential for the realization of high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices. Triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion is a unique process of converting two non&#8208;emissive triplet excitons to one singlet exciton with higher energy. Efficient optical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical devices can be realized by harvesting sub&#8208;bandgap photons through TTA&#8208;based upconversion. In electrical&#8208;to&#8208;optical devices, triplets generated after the combination of electrons and holes also can be efficiently utilized via TTA, which resulted in a high internal conversion efficiency of 62.5%. Currently, many interesting explorations and significant advances have been demonstrated in these fields. In this review, a comprehensive summary of these intriguing advances on developing efficient TTA upconversion materials and their application in optoelectronic devices is systematically given along with some discussions. Finally, the key challenges and perspectives of TTA upconversion systems for further improvement for optoelectronic devices and other related research directions are provided. This review hopes to provide valuable guidelines for future related research and advancement in organic optoelectronics.

         <title>Effects of the Catalyst Dynamic Changes and Influence of the Reaction Environment on the Performance of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focus on understanding the origin of the dynamic changes at the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface, and uncovering the interplays between these changes and the CO2 reduction performance, the obtained insights can guide the design of catalysts and reactors for the efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction.








Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) is substantially researched due to its potential for storing intermittent renewable electricity and simultaneously helping mitigating the pressing CO2 emission concerns. The major challenge of electrochemical CO2 reduction lies on having good controls of this reaction due to its complicated reaction networks and its unusual sensitivity to the dynamic changes of the catalyst structure (chemical states, compositions, facets and morphology, etc.), and to the non&#8208;catalyst components at the electrode/electrolyte interface, in another word the reaction environments. To date, a comprehensive analysis on the interplays between the above catalyst&#8208;dynamic&#8208;changes/reaction environments and the CO2 reduction performance is rare, if not none. In this review, the catalyst dynamic changes observed during the catalysis are discussed based on the recent reports of electrochemical CO2 reduction. Then, the above dynamic changes are correlated to their effects on the catalytic performance. The influences of the reaction environments on the performance of CO2 reduction are also discussed. Finally, some perspectives on future investigations are offered with the aim of understanding the origins of the effects from the catalyst dynamic changes and the reaction environments, which will allow one to better control the CO2 reduction toward the desired products.

         <title>Nanophotonic Color Routing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale color routing is reviewed with a focus on the emerging concepts and the technology development trend in particular for the applications in high&#8208;resolution imaging. Nanophotonic methods to manipulate light in both frequency&#8208;domain and spatial&#8208;domain with high&#8208;efficiency utilization of the full spectrum are presented. The remaining challenges and the potential solutions are also discussed.








Abstract
Recent advances in low&#8208;dimensional materials and nanofabrication technologies have stimulated many breakthroughs in the field of nanophotonics such as metamaterials and plasmonics that provide efficient ways of light manipulation at a subwavelength scale. The representative structure&#8208;induced spectral engineering techniques have demonstrated superior design of freedom compared with natural materials such as pigment/dye. In particular, the emerging spectral routing scheme enables extraordinary light manipulation in both frequency&#8208;domain and spatial&#8208;domain with high&#8208;efficiency utilization of the full spectrum, which is critically important for various applications and may open up entirely new operating paradigms. In this review, a comparative introduction on the operating mechanisms of spectral routing and spectral filtering schemes is given and recent progress on various color nanorouters based on metasurfaces, plasmonics, dielectric antennas is reviewed with a focus on the potential application in high&#8208;resolution imaging. With a thorough analysis and discussion on the advanced properties and drawbacks of various techniques, this report is expected to provide an overview and vision for the future development and application of nanophotonic color (spectral) routing techniques.

         <title>Research Progress of Intramolecular &#960;&#8208;Stacked Small Molecules for Device Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike traditional covalent bond&#8208;connected conjugated molecules, &#960;&#8208;stacked small molecules have special advantages in organic semiconductors. This review mainly focuses on the research development of &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular systems and introduces the new characteristics brought by the special molecular configuration and its application in organic semiconductors.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors can be designed and constructed in &#960;&#8208;stacked structures instead of the conventional &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures. Through&#8208;space interaction (TSI) occurs in &#960;&#8208;stacked optoelectronic materials. Thus, unlike electronic coupling along the conjugated chain, the functional groups can stack closely to facilitate spatial electron communication. Using &#960;&#8208;stacked motifs, chemists and materials scientists can find new ways for constructing materials with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), as well as enhanced molecular conductance. Organic optoelectronic devices based on &#960;&#8208;stacked molecules have exhibited very promising performance, with some of them exceeding &#960;&#8208;conjugated analogues. Recently, reports on various organic &#960;&#8208;stacked structures have grown rapidly, prompting this review. Representative molecular scaffolds and newly developed &#960;&#8208;stacked systems could stimulate more attention on through&#8208;space charge transfer the well&#8208;known through&#8208;bond charge transfer. Finally, the opportunities and challenges for utilizing and improving particular materials are discussed. The previous achievements and upcoming prospects may provide new insights into the theory, materials, and devices in the field of organic semiconductors.

         <title>Redox Targeting of Energy Materials for Energy Storage and Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox&#8208;targeting process provides great operation flexibility in circumventing the constraints intrinsically posed by the conventional electrochemical systems. It involves a regenerative close&#8208;loop electrochemical&#8211;chemical cycle between an electrolyte&#8208;borne redox mediator and an energy storage/conversion material when implemented in redox&#8208;flow cells, boosting the energy density, and offering an intriguing research platform applied to a variety of chemistries for different applications.








Abstract
The redox&#8208;targeting (RT) process or redox&#8208;mediated process, which provides great operation flexibility in circumventing the constraints intrinsically posed by the conventional electrochemical systems, is intriguing for various energy storage and conversion applications. Implementation of the RT reactions in redox&#8208;flow cells, which involves a close&#8208;loop electrochemical&#8211;chemical cycle between an electrolyte&#8208;borne redox mediator and an energy storage or conversion material, not only boosts the energy density of flow battery system, but also offers a versatile research platform applied to a wide variety of chemistries for different applications. Here, the recent progress of RT&#8208;based energy storage and conversion systems is summarized and great versatility of RT processes for various energy&#8208;related applications is demonstrated, particularly for large&#8208;scale energy storage, spatially decoupled water electrolysis, electrolytic N2 reduction, thermal&#8208;to&#8208;electrical conversion, spent battery material recycling, and more. The working principle, materials aspects, and factors dictating the operation are highlighted to reveal the critical roles of RT reactions for each application. In addition, the challenges lying ahead for deployment are stated and recommendations for addressing these constraints are provided. It is anticipated that the RT concept of energy materials will provide important implications and eventually offer a credible solution for advanced large&#8208;scale energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Polymerized Hybrid Perovskites with Enhanced Stability, Flexibility, and Lattice Rigidity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that hybrid perovskite with unsaturated organoammoniums can undergo solid&#8208;state polymerization without damaging perovskite structure. The polymerized perovskite behaves like a polymer with enhanced stability and flexibility. The lattice rigidity is also enhanced due to the polymerized covalent C&#63743;C bonding. As a result, a stable and efficient polymerized perovskite LEDs with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.2% is demonstrated.








Abstract
The intrinsic soft lattice nature of organometal halide perovskites (OHPs) makes them very tolerant to defects and ideal candidates for solution&#8208;processed optoelectronic devices. However, the soft lattice results in low stability towards external stresses such as heating and humidity, high density of phonons and strong electron&#8211;phonon coupling (EPC). Here, it is demonstrated that the OHPs with unsaturated 4&#8208;vinylbenzylammonium (VBA) as organoammonium cations can be polymerized without damaging the perovskite structure and its tolerance to defects. The polymerized perovskites show enhanced stability and flexibility compared to regular three&#8208;dimensional and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites. Furthermore, the polymerized 4&#8208;vinylbenzylammonium group improves perovskite lattice rigidity substantially, resulting in a reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination rate because of suppressed electron&#8211;phonon coupling, and enhanced carrier mobility because of suppressed phonon scattering. 2D polymerized perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with strong electroluminescence at room temperature, and quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.2% and enhanced operation stability are demonstrated. The work has opened a new way of enhancing the intrinsic stability and optoelectronic properties of OHPs.

         <title>Controlled Vertically Aligned Structures in Polymer Composites: Natural Inspiration, Structural Processing, and Functional Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progresses in polymer composites with vertically oriented structures are summarized, with an emphasis on natural prototypes, processing methods, and multifunctional applications. Like the fairy tale, Magpie bridge (processing methods) should be highlighted to connect the gap between the Weaver Girl (natural prototypes of vertical structures) and the Cowherd (functional polymeric composites) for close correlations from inspirations to implementations.








Abstract
Vertically aligned structures, which are a series of characteristic conformations with thickness&#8208;direction alignment, interconnection, or assembly of filler in polymeric composite materials that can provide remarkable structural performance and advanced anisotropic functions, have attracted considerable attention in recent years. The past two decades have witnessed extensive development with regard to universal fabrication methods, subtle control of morphological features, improvement of functional properties, and superior applications of vertically aligned structures in various fields. However, a systematic review remains to be attempted. The various configurations of vertical structures inspired from biological samples in nature, such as vertically aligned structures with honeycomb, reed, annual ring, radial, and lamellar configurations are summarized here. Additionally, relevant processing methods, which include the transformation of oriented direction, external&#8208;field inducement, template method, and 3D printing method, are discussed in detail. The diverse applications in mechanical, thermal, electric, dielectric, electromagnetic, water treatment, and energy fields are also highlighted by providing representative examples. Finally, future opportunities and prospects are listed to identify current issues and potential research directions. It is expected that perspectives on the vertically aligned structures presented here will contribute to the research on advanced multifunctional composites.

         <title>High&#8208;Conductive Protonated Layered Oxides from H2O Vapor&#8208;Annealed Brownmillerites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonated 3d transition&#8208;metal oxides often display low electronic conduction, which hampers their application in electric, magnetic, thermoelectric, and catalytic fields. Here, a thermal hydration synthesis of conductive protonated oxides from 3d transition&#8208;metal oxides is introduced. By incorporating H2O into the lattice frame, the insulating brownmillerite SrCoO2.5 transforms to a novel layered&#8208;oxide SrCoO3H, which demonstrates a highly improved electric conduction.








Abstract
Protonated 3d transition&#8208;metal oxides often display low electronic conduction, which hampers their application in electric, magnetic, thermoelectric, and catalytic fields. Electronic conduction can be enhanced by co&#8208;inserting oxygen acceptors simultaneously. However, the currently used redox approaches hinder protons and oxygen ions co&#8208;insertion due to the selective switching issues. Here, a thermal hydration strategy for systematically exploring the synthesis of conductive protonated oxides from 3d transition&#8208;metal oxides is introduced. This strategy is illustrated by synthesizing a novel layered&#8208;oxide SrCoO3H from the brownmillerite SrCoO2.5. Compared to the insulating SrCoO2.5, SrCoO3H exhibits an unprecedented high electronic conductivity above room temperature, water uptake at 250&#160;&#176;C, and a thermoelectric power factor of up to 1.2&#160;mW K&#8722;2 m&#8722;1 at 300 K. These findings open up opportunities for creating high&#8208;conductive protonated layered oxides by protons and oxygen ions co&#8208;doping.

         <title>Engineered Bifunctional Proteins for Targeted Cancer Therapy: Prospects and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of various forms of bifunctional proteins (BFPs) for cancer treatment is becoming increasingly popular and important. BFPs can simultaneously act on different components in the tumor microenvironment, which are expected to play a diverse role in combating tumor heterogeneity and improving treatment outcomes. A variety of preclinical and early&#8208;stage clinical studies have reported their great potential in cancer treatment.








Abstract
Bifunctional proteins (BFPs) are a class of therapeutic agents produced through genetic engineering and protein engineering, and are increasingly used to treat various human diseases, including cancer. These proteins usually have two or more biological functions&#8212;specifically recognizing different molecular targets to regulate the related signaling pathways, or mediating effector molecules/cells to kill tumor cells. Unlike conventional small&#8208;molecule or single&#8208;target drugs, BFPs possess stronger biological activity but lower systemic toxicity. Hence, BFPs are considered to offer many benefits for the treatment of heterogeneous tumors. In this review, the authors briefly describe the unique structural feature of BFP molecules and innovatively divide them into bispecific antibodies, cytokine&#8208;based BFPs (immunocytokines), and protein toxin&#8208;based BFPs (immunotoxins) according to their mode of action. In addition, the latest advances in the development of BFPs are discussed and the potential limitations or problems in clinical applications are outlined. Taken together, future studies need to be centered on understanding the characteristics of BFPs for optimizing and designing more effective such drugs.

         <title>3D Printing of Superhydrophobic Objects with Bulk Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The principle of polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation is exploited to 3D print superhydrophobic objects with bulk nanostructure and unlimited geometrical freedom. The bulk nanoporous structure of the 3D&#8208;printed superhydrophobic objects not only makes them tolerant to abrasion damage, but also opens new possibilities in applications including gas&#8208;permeable and water&#8208;repellent microfluidics, as well as hierarchically structured super oil absorbents.








Abstract
The rapid development of 3D printing (or additive manufacturing) technologies demands new materials with novel properties and functionalities. Superhydrophobic materials, owing to their ultralow water adhesion, self&#8208;cleaning, anti&#8208;biofouling, or superoleophilic properties are useful for myriad applications involving liquids. However, the majority of the methods for making superhydrophobic surfaces have been based on surface functionalization and coatings, which are challenging to apply to 3D objects. Additionally, these coatings are vulnerable to abrasion due to low mechanical stability and limited thickness. Here, a new materials concept and methodology for 3D printing of superhydrophobic macroscopic objects with bulk nanostructure and almost unlimited geometrical freedom is presented. The method is based on a specific ink composed of hydrophobic (meth)acrylate monomers and porogen solvents, which undergoes phase separation upon photopolymerization to generate inherently nanoporous and superhydrophobic structures. Using a desktop Digital Light Processing printer, superhydrophobic 3D objects with complex shapes are demonstrated, with ultralow and uniform water adhesion measured with scanning droplet adhesion microscopy. It is shown that the 3D&#8208;printed objects, owing to their nanoporous structure throughout the entire volume, preserve their superhydrophobicity upon wear damage. Finally, a superhydrophobic 3D&#8208;printed gas&#8208;permeable and water&#8208;repellent microfluidic device and a hierarchically structured 3D&#8208;printed super&#8208;oil&#8208;absorbent are demonstrated.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid development of 3D printing (or additive manufacturing) technologies demands new materials with novel properties and functionalities. Superhydrophobic materials, owing to their ultralow water adhesion, self-cleaning, anti-biofouling, or superoleophilic properties are useful for myriad applications involving liquids. However, the majority of the methods for making superhydrophobic surfaces have been based on surface functionalization and coatings, which are challenging to apply to 3D objects. Additionally, these coatings are vulnerable to abrasion due to low mechanical stability and limited thickness. Here, a new materials concept and methodology for 3D printing of superhydrophobic macroscopic objects with bulk nanostructure and almost unlimited geometrical freedom is presented. The method is based on a specific ink composed of hydrophobic (meth)acrylate monomers and porogen solvents, which undergoes phase separation upon photopolymerization to generate inherently nanoporous and superhydrophobic structures. Using a desktop Digital Light Processing printer, superhydrophobic 3D objects with complex shapes are demonstrated, with ultralow and uniform water adhesion measured with scanning droplet adhesion microscopy. It is shown that the 3D-printed objects, owing to their nanoporous structure throughout the entire volume, preserve their superhydrophobicity upon wear damage. Finally, a superhydrophobic 3D-printed gas-permeable and water-repellent microfluidic device and a hierarchically structured 3D-printed super-oil-absorbent are demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conquering the Hypoxia Limitation for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficacy of photodynamic therapy is often restricted by the hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, the strategies are reviewed that are developed to alleviate tumor hypoxia in the past decades, include delivering exogenous O2, in situ O2 generation, reducing cellular O2 consumption by inhibiting respiration, regulating the TME, and inhibiting hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor 1 (HIF&#8208;1) signaling pathway.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has aroused great research interest in recent years owing to its high spatiotemporal selectivity, minimal invasiveness, and low systemic toxicity. However, due to the hypoxic nature characteristic of many solid tumors, PDT is frequently limited in therapeutic effect. Moreover, the consumption of O2 during PDT may further aggravate the tumor hypoxic condition, which promotes tumor proliferation, metastasis, and invasion resulting in poor prognosis of treatment. Therefore, numerous efforts have been made to increase the O2 content in tumor with the goal of enhancing PDT efficacy. Herein, these strategies developed in past decade are comprehensively reviewed to alleviate tumor hypoxia, including 1) delivering exogenous O2 to tumor directly, 2) generating O2 in situ, 3) reducing tumor cellular O2 consumption by inhibiting respiration, 4) regulating the TME, (e.g., normalizing tumor vasculature or disrupting tumor extracellular matrix), and 5) inhibiting the hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor 1 (HIF&#8208;1) signaling pathway to relieve tumor hypoxia. Additionally, the O2&#8208;independent Type&#8208;I PDT is also discussed as an alternative strategy. By reviewing recent progress, it is hoped that this review will provide innovative perspectives in new nanomaterials designed to combat hypoxia and avoid the associated limitation of PDT.

         <title>Fluorescent Nanozeolite Receptors for the Highly Selective and Sensitive Detection of Neurotransmitters in Water and Biofluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent artificial receptors are introduced that bind neurotransmitters with unprecedented affinity and selectivity in biofluids. They are based on nanozeolite hybrid materials and can be used for emission&#8208; and absorbance&#8208;based detection of serotonin and dopamine in urine at physiological relevant concentration, for (two&#8208;photon) imaging, and for label&#8208;free enzymatic reaction monitoring in real time.








Abstract
The design and preparation of synthetic binders (SBs) applicable for small biomolecule sensing in aqueous media remains very challenging. SBs designed by the lock&#8208;and&#8208;key principle can be selective for their target analyte but usually show an insufficient binding strength in water. In contrast, SBs based on symmetric macrocycles with a hydrophobic cavity can display high binding affinities but generally suffer from indiscriminate binding of many analytes. Herein, a completely new and modular receptor design strategy based on microporous hybrid materials is presented yielding zeolite&#8208;based artificial receptors (ZARs) which reversibly bind the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine with unprecedented affinity and selectivity even in saline biofluids. ZARs are thought to uniquely exploit both the non&#8208;classical hydrophobic effect and direct non&#8208;covalent recognition motifs, which is supported by in&#8208;depth photophysical, and calorimetric experiments combined with full atomistic modeling. ZARs are thermally and chemically robust and can be readily prepared at gram scales. Their applicability for the label&#8208;free monitoring of important enzymatic reactions, for (two&#8208;photon) fluorescence imaging, and for high&#8208;throughput diagnostics in biofluids is demonstrated. This study showcases that artificial receptor based on microporous hybrid materials can overcome standing limitations of synthetic chemosensors, paving the way towards personalized diagnostics and metabolomics.

         <title>Advances in Microwave Synthesis of Nanoporous Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microwave ovens can be used as powerful devices in the synthesis of various porous materials including silicas, carbons, metal&#8208;organic frameworks, and metal oxides. The microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis offers simple, fast, efficient, and economic way to obtaon nanoporous materials. This review covers the recent achievements in the microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis of these diverse nanoporous materials and their potential applications.








Abstract
Usually, porous materials are synthesized by using conventional electric heating, which can be energy&#8208; and time&#8208;consuming. Microwave heating is commonly used in many households to quickly heat food. Microwave ovens can also be used as powerful devices in the synthesis of various porous materials. The microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis offers a simple, fast, efficient, and economic way to obtain many of the advanced nanomaterials. This review summarizes the recent achievements in the microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis of diverse groups of nanoporous materials including silicas, carbons, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, and metal oxides. Microwave&#8208;assisted methods afford highly porous materials with high specific surface areas (SSAs), e.g., activated carbons with SSA &#8776;3100 m2 g&#8722;1, metal&#8211;organic frameworks with SSA &#8776;4200&#160;m2 g&#8722;1, covalent organic frameworks with SSA &#8776;2900 m2 g&#8722;1, and metal oxides with relatively small SSA &#8776;300 m2 g&#8722;1. These methods are also successfully implemented for the preparation of ordered mesoporous silicas and carbons as well as spherically shaped nanomaterials. Most of the nanoporous materials obtained under microwave irradiation show potential applications in gas adsorption, water treatment, catalysis, energy storage, and drug delivery, among others.

         <title>Manipulating Intratumoral Fenton Chemistry for Enhanced Chemodynamic and Chemodynamic&#8208;Synergized Multimodal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review first discusses the advances in reinforcement strategies to increase the efficiency of intratumoral Fenton reaction. Then, the multimodal anticancer therapies involving enhanced chemodynamic therapy and mechanisms of synergy are highlighted. Finally, the major challenges and further improvements of this evolving field are elaborated.








Abstract
Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) uses the tumor microenvironment&#8208;assisted intratumoral Fenton reaction for generating highly toxic hydroxyl free radicals (&#8226;OH) to achieve selective tumor treatment. However, the limited intratumoral Fenton reaction efficiency restricts the therapeutic efficacy of CDT. Recent years have witnessed the impressive development of various strategies to increase the efficiency of intratumoral Fenton reaction. The introduction of these reinforcement strategies can dramatically improve the treatment efficiency of CDT and further promote the development of enhanced CDT (ECDT)&#8208;based multimodal anticancer treatments. In this review, the authors systematically introduce these reinforcement strategies, from their basic working principles, reinforcement mechanisms to their representative clinical applications. Then, ECDT&#8208;based multimodal anticancer therapy is discussed, including how to integrate these emerging Fenton reinforcement strategies for accelerating the development of multimodal anticancer therapy, as well as the synergistic mechanisms of ECDT and other treatment methods. Eventually, future direction and challenges of ECDT and ECDT&#8208;based multimodal synergistic therapies are elaborated, highlighting the key scientific problems and unsolved technical bottlenecks to facilitate clinical translation.

         <title>Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic&#8211;Organic Isoporous Membranes with Tunable Pore Sizes and Functionalities for Molecular Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic&#8211;organic isoporous membranes are fabricated via sequential infiltration synthesis and atomic layer deposition within block copolymer membranes followed by addition of functional organic molecules. The membrane pore sizes are controlled by metal oxide growth in a predictive manner. The hybrid membranes exhibit superior selectivity and permeability in separating 1&#8211;2 nm organic molecules and similar&#8208;sized proteins.








Abstract
Accomplishing on&#8208;demand molecular separation with a high selectivity and good permeability is very desirable for pollutant removal and chemical and pharmaceutical processing. The major challenge for sub&#8208;10&#160;nm filtration of particles and molecules is the fabrication of high&#8208;performance membranes with tunable pore size and designed functionality. Here, a versatile top&#8208;down approach is demonstrated to produce such a membrane using isoporous block copolymer membranes with well&#8208;defined pore sizes combined with growth of metal oxide using sequential infiltration synthesis and atomic layer deposition (SIS and ALD). The pore size of the membranes is tuned by controlled metal oxide growth within and onto the polymer channels, enabling up to twofold pore diameter reduction. Following the growth, the distinct functionalities are readily incorporated along the membrane nanochannels with either hydrophobic, cationic, or anionic groups via straightforward and scalable gas/liquid&#8211;solid interface reactions. The hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the membrane nanochannel is significantly changed by the introduction of hydrophilic metal oxide and hydrophobic fluorinated groups. The functionalized membranes exhibit a superior selectivity and permeability in separating 1&#8211;2&#160;nm organic molecules and fractionating similar&#8208;sized proteins based on size, charge, and hydrophobicity. This demonstrates the great potential of organic&#8211;inorganic&#8211;organic isoporous membranes for high&#8208;performance molecular separation in numerous applications.

&lt;p&gt;Novel hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic&#8211;organic isoporous membranes are fabricated via sequential infiltration synthesis and atomic layer deposition within block copolymer membranes followed by addition of functional organic molecules. The membrane pore sizes are controlled by metal oxide growth in a predictive manner. The hybrid membranes exhibit superior selectivity and permeability in separating 1&#8211;2 nm organic molecules and similar-sized proteins.

         <title>Engineering d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization in Single&#8208;Atom Metal&#8208;Embedded Three&#8208;Dimensional Electrodes for Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A descriptor, the d&#8208;p hybridization state between single&#8208;atom metal catalysts (SACs) and sulfur species, is proposed to guide the design of SACs for Li&#8211;S batteries. The large&#8208;sized and flexible three&#8208;dimensional electrodes with optimized SACs achieve high specific energy with low catalyst loading and high sulfur loading. The good mechanical stability for bending also shows potential for fabricating bendable/foldable Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom metal catalysts (SACs) are used as sulfur cathode additives to promote battery performance, although the material selection and mechanism that govern the catalytic activity remain unclear. It is shown that d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between the single&#8208;atom metal and the sulfur species can be used as a descriptor for understanding the catalytic activity of SACs in Li&#8211;S batteries. Transition metals with a lower atomic number are found, like Ti, to have fewer filled anti&#8208;bonding states, which effectively bind lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and catalyze their electrochemical reaction. A series of single&#8208;atom metal catalysts (Me = Mn, Cu, Cr, Ti) embedded in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) electrodes are prepared by a controllable nitrogen coordination approach. Among them, the single&#8208;atom Ti&#8208;embedded electrode has the lowest electrochemical barrier to LiPSs reduction/Li2S oxidation and the highest catalytic activity, matching well with the theoretical calculations. By virtue of the highly active catalytic center of single&#8208;atom Ti on the conductive transport network, high sulfur utilization is achieved with a low catalyst loading (1&#160;wt.%) and a high area&#8208;sulfur loading (8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). With good mechanical stability for bending, these 3D electrodes are suitable for fabricating bendable/foldable Li&#8211;S batteries for wearable electronics.

         <title>Synergistic Integration of Chemo&#8208;Resistive and SERS Sensing for Label&#8208;Free Multiplex Gas Detection</title>

Synergistic electrical and optical multimodal sensing by 3D nanoarchitectures for label&#8208;free gas detection.








Abstract
Practical sensing applications such as real&#8208;time safety alerts and clinical diagnoses require sensor devices to differentiate between various target molecules with high sensitivity and selectivity, yet conventional devices such as oxide&#8208;based chemo&#8208;resistive sensors and metal&#8208;based surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) sensors usually do not satisfy such requirements. Here, a label&#8208;free, chemo&#8208;resistive/SERS multimodal sensor based on a systematically assembled 3D cross&#8208;point multifunctional nanoarchitecture (3D&#8208;CMA), which has unusually strong enhancements in both &#8220;chemo&#8208;resistive&#8221; and &#8220;SERS&#8221; sensing characteristics is introduced. 3D&#8208;CMA combines several sensing mechanisms and sensing elements via 3D integration of semiconducting SnO2 nanowire frameworks and dual&#8208;functioning Au metallic nanoparticles. It is shown that the multimodal sensor can successfully estimate mixed&#8208;gas compositions selectively and quantitatively at the sub&#8208;100 ppm level, even for mixtures of gaseous aromatic compounds (nitrobenzene and toluene) with very similar molecular structures. This is enabled by combined chemo&#8208;resistive and SERS multimodal sensing providing complementary information.

         <title>Electrical Generation and Deletion of Magnetic Skyrmion&#8208;Bubbles via Vertical Current Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new route to generate and delete magnetic skyrmion&#8208;bubbles electrically is presented using a vertical current path. The vertical current path concept is easy to integrate with a widely used spin&#8211;orbit torque device. Using the vertical current path with a spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque device, core operations for a skyrmion racetrack memory device in a three&#8208;terminal device are demonstrated.








Abstract
The magnetic skyrmion is a topologically protected spin texture that has attracted much attention as a promising information carrier because of its distinct features of suitability for high&#8208;density storage, low power consumption, and stability. One of the skyrmion devices proposed so far is the skyrmion racetrack memory, which is the skyrmion version of the domain&#8208;wall racetrack memory. For application in devices, skyrmion racetrack memory requires electrical generation, deletion, and displacement of isolated skyrmions. Despite the progress in experimental demonstrations of skyrmion generation, deletion, and displacement, these three operations have yet to be realized in one device. Here, a route for generating and deleting isolated skyrmion&#8208;bubbles through vertical current injection with an explanation of its microscopic origin is presented. By combining the proposed skyrmion&#8208;bubble generation/deletion method with the spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque&#8208;driven skyrmion shift, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experimental demonstration of the skyrmion racetrack memory operation in a three&#8208;terminal device structure is provided.

         <title>Construction of Six&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Coordinated Single Ni Sites on g&#8208;C3N4 with Boron&#8208;Oxo Species for Photocatalytic Water&#8208;Activation&#8208;Induced CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated single Ni (II) sites are successfully anchored by highly dispersed boron&#8208;oxo species on g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets. The as&#8208;fabricated single&#8208;atom Ni photocatalyst can realize efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction, where single Ni atoms can effectively capture photoelectrons and preferentially reduce absorbed water to produce H atoms as active species eventually inducing the reduction of CO2.








Abstract
The configuration regulation of single&#8208;atom photocatalysts (SAPCs) can significantly influence the interfacial charge transfer and subsequent catalytic process. The construction of conventional SAPCs for aqueous CO2 reduction is mainly devoted toward favorable activation and photoreduction of CO2, however, the role of water is frequently neglected. In this work, single Ni atoms are successfully anchored by boron&#8208;oxo species on g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets through a facile ion&#8208;exchange method. The dative interaction between the B atom and the sp2 N atom of g&#8208;C3N4 guarantees the high dispersion of boron&#8208;oxo species, where O atoms coordinate with single Ni (II) sites to obtain a unique six&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated configuration. The optimized single&#8208;atom Ni photocatalyst, rivaling Pt&#8208;modified g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets, provides excellent CO2 reduction rate with CO and CH4 as products. Quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra, transient absorption spectra, isotopic labeling, and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectra reveal that as&#8208;fabricated six&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated single Ni (II) sites can effectively capture the photoelectrons of CN along the B&#63743;O bridges and preferentially activate adsorbed water to produce H atoms to eventually induce a hydrogen&#8208;assisted CO2 reduction. This work diversifies the synthetic strategies for single&#8208;atom catalysts and provides insight on correlation between the single&#8208;atom configuration and reaction pathway.

The optimized single-atom Ni photocatalyst, rivaling Pt-modified g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets, provides excellent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction rate with CO and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as products. Quasi-in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectra, transient absorption spectra, isotopic labeling, and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectra reveal that as-fabricated six-oxygen-coordinated single Ni (II) sites can effectively capture the photoelectrons of CN along the B&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O bridges and preferentially activate adsorbed water to produce H atoms to eventually induce a hydrogen-assisted CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. This work diversifies the synthetic strategies for single-atom catalysts and provides insight on correlation between the single-atom configuration and reaction pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controllable Doping in 2D Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable doping by modulating the thickness is realized in 2D layered materials. The decreasing thickness&#8208;induced lattice deformation makes defects in PtSSe transit from Pt vacancies in thicker PtSSe to anion vacancies in thinner PtSSe, which leads to controllable doping. Thickness&#8208;modulated doping shows great potential in novel electronics and optoelectronics, especially including diodes and photodetectors.








Abstract
For each generation of semiconductors, the issue of doping techniques is always placed at the top of the priority list since it determines whether a material can be used in the electronic and optoelectronic industry or not. When it comes to 2D materials, significant challenges have been found in controllably doping 2D semiconductors into p&#8208; or n&#8208;type, let alone developing a continuous control of this process. Here, a unique self&#8208;modulated doping characteristic in 2D layered materials such as PtSSe, PtS0.8Se1.2, PdSe2, and WSe2 is reported. The varying number of vertically stacked&#8208;monolayers is the critical factor for controllably tuning the same material from p&#8208;type to intrinsic, and to n&#8208;type doping. Importantly, it is found that the thickness&#8208;induced lattice deformation makes defects in PtSSe transit from Pt vacancies to anion vacancies based on dynamic and thermodynamic analyses, which leads to p&#8208; and n&#8208;type conductance, respectively. By thickness&#8208;modulated doping, WSe2 diode exhibits a high rectification ratio of 4400 and a large open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.38&#160;V. Meanwhile, the PtSSe detector overcomes the shortcoming of large dark&#8208;current in narrow&#8208;bandgap optoelectronic devices. All these findings provide a brand&#8208;new perspective for fundamental scientific studies and applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Piezo&#8208;Electrocatalytic Sensing of Ascorbic Acid with Nanostructured Wurtzite Zinc Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cost&#8208;efficient, high&#8208;performance piezo&#8208;electrocatalytic sensor is designed for detecting l&#8208;ascorbic acid (AA), a critical chemical for many organisms, metabolic processes, and medical treatments. The electrocatalytic efficacy of AA is significantly boosted by the piezoelectric polarization induced in the nanostructured semiconducting zinc oxide catalysts.








Abstract
Nanostructured piezoelectric semiconductors offer unprecedented opportunities for high&#8208;performance sensing in numerous catalytic processes of biomedical, pharmaceutical, and agricultural interests, leveraging piezocatalysis that enhances the catalytic efficiency with the strain&#8208;induced piezoelectric field. Here, a cost&#8208;efficient, high&#8208;performance piezo&#8208;electrocatalytic sensor for detecting l&#8208;ascorbic acid (AA), a critical chemical for many organisms, metabolic processes, and medical treatments, is designed and demonstrated. Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods and nanosheets are prepared to characterize and compare their efficacy for the piezo&#8208;electrocatalysis of AA. The electrocatalytic efficacy of AA is significantly boosted by the piezoelectric polarization induced in the nanostructured semiconducting ZnO catalysts. The charge transfer between the strained ZnO nanostructures and AA is elucidated to reveal the mechanism for the related piezo&#8208;electrocatalytic process. The low&#8208;temperature synthesis of high&#8208;quality ZnO nanostructures allows low&#8208;cost, scalable production, and integration directly into wearable electrocatalytic sensors whose performance can be boosted by otherwise wasted mechanical energy from the working environment, for example, human&#8208;generated mechanical signals.

         <title>An Amorphous Peri&#8208;Implant Ligament with Combined Osteointegration and Energy&#8208;Dissipation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired peri&#8208;implant ligament (PIL) is realized using polymer&#8208;infiltrated amorphous titania nanotubes based on a periodontium&#8208;mimetic architecture. The PIL not only provides exceptional osteoinductivity by more than 18% bone&#8211;implant contact, but also remarkably reduces stress transfer to the peri&#8208;implant bone by &#8776;30% as compared to titanium. The PIL will open new possibilities for developing high&#8208;performance implant materials with increased lifespans.








Abstract
Progress toward developing metal implants as permanent hard&#8208;tissue substitutes requires both osteointegration to achieve load&#8208;bearing support, and energy&#8208;dissipation to prevent overload&#8208;induced bone resorption. However, in existing implants these two properties can only be achieved separately. Optimized by natural evolution, tooth&#8208;periodontal&#8208;ligaments with fiber&#8208;bundle structures can efficiently orchestrate load&#8208;bearing and energy dissipation, which make tooth&#8211;bone complexes survive extremely high occlusion loads (&gt;300 N) for prolonged lifetimes. Here, a bioinspired peri&#8208;implant ligament with simultaneously enhanced osteointegration and energy&#8208;dissipation is presented, which is based on the periodontium&#8208;mimetic architecture of a polymer&#8208;infiltrated, amorphous, titania nanotube array. The artificial ligament not only provides exceptional osteoinductivity owing to its nanotopography and beneficial ingredients, but also produces periodontium&#8208;similar energy dissipation due to the complexity of the force transmission modes and interface sliding. The ligament increases bone&#8211;implant contact by more than 18% and simultaneously reduces the effective stress transfer from implant to peri&#8208;implant bone by &#8776;30% as compared to titanium implants, which as far as is known has not previously been achieved. It is anticipated that the concept of an artificial ligament will open new possibilities for developing high&#8208;performance implanted materials with increased lifespans.

         <title>Design Principles of Sodium/Potassium Protection Layer for High&#8208;Power High&#8208;Energy Sodium/Potassium&#8208;Metal Batteries in Carbonate Electrolytes: a Case Study of Na2Te/K2Te</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Na2Te (K2Te) protection layer with high ionic conductivity, low electronic conductivity, and high mechanical stability on Na (K) metal anode is designed and prepared. Therefore, the Na@Na2Te (K@K2Te) realizes excellent electrochemical performance for sodium (potassium) metal batteries of both symmetrical cells and full batteries in widely used carbonate electrolytes.








Abstract
The sodium (potassium)&#8208;metal anodes combine low&#8208;cost, high theoretical capacity, and high energy density, demonstrating promising application in sodium (potassium)&#8208;metal batteries. However, the dendrites&#8217; growth on the surface of Na (K) has impeded their practical application. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) results predict Na2Te/K2Te is beneficial for Na+/K+ transport and can effectively suppress the formation of the dendrites because of low Na+/K+ migration energy barrier and ultrahigh Na+/K+ diffusion coefficient of 3.7 &#215; 10&#8722;10 cm2 s&#8722;1/1.6 &#215; 10&#8722;10 cm2 s&#8722;1 (300 K), respectively. Then a Na2Te protection layer is prepared by directly painting the nanosized Te powder onto the sodium&#8208;metal surface. The Na@Na2Te anode can last for 700 h in low&#8208;cost carbonate electrolytes (1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 1 mAh cm&#8722;2), and the corresponding Na3V2 (PO4)3//Na@Na2Te full cell exhibits high energy density of 223&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at an unprecedented power density of 29687 W kg&#8722;1 as well as an ultrahigh capacity retention of 93% after 3000 cycles at 20 C. Besides, the K@K2Te&#8208;based potassium&#8208;metal full battery also demonstrates high power density of 20 577 W kg&#8722;1 with energy density of 154&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. This work opens up a new and promising avenue to stabilize sodium (potassium)&#8208;metal anodes with simple and low&#8208;cost interfacial layers.

The Na@Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te anode can last for 700 h in low-cost carbonate electrolytes (1&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 1 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and the corresponding Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;//Na@Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te full cell exhibits high energy density of 223&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at an unprecedented power density of 29687 W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; as well as an ultrahigh capacity retention of 93% after 3000 cycles at 20 C. Besides, the K@K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te-based potassium-metal full battery also demonstrates high power density of 20 577 W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with energy density of 154&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work opens up a new and promising avenue to stabilize sodium (potassium)-metal anodes with simple and low-cost interfacial layers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Conductive Network and Dipole Field for Harnessing Photogenerated Charge Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TiO2 network exhibits two orders of magnitude enhancement in electric conductivity, which will greatly suppress electron&#8211;hole (e&#8211;h) recombination by reducing the charge&#8208;transfer resistance. In addition, 2D MXene induces a dipole at the interface. The dipole field pushes charge extraction and suppresses charge recombination by inducing band bending.








Abstract
Photogenerated charge separation and directional transfer to active sites are pivotal steps in photocatalysis, which limit the efficiency of redox reactions. Here, a conductive network and dipole field are employed to harness photogenerated charge kinetics by using a Ti3C2/TiO2 network (TTN). The TTN exhibits a prolonged charge&#8208;carrier lifetime (1.026&#160;ns) and an 11.76&#8208;fold increase in hexavalent chromium photoreduction reaction kinetics compared to TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs). This super photocatalytic performance is derived from the efficient photogenerated charge kinetics, which is steered by the conductive network and dipole field. The conductivity enhancement of the TiO2 network is achieved by continuous chemical bonds, which promotes electron&#8211;hole (e&#8211;h) separation. In addition, at the interface of Ti3C2 and TiO2, band bending induced by the dipole field promotes photogenerated electron spatially directed transfer to the catalytic sites on Ti3C2. This study demonstrates that a conductive network and dipole field offer a new concept to harness charge kinetics for photocatalysis.

         <title>Evolution of Graphene Patterning: From Dimension Regulation to Molecular Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene patterning has attracted widespread attention owing to its ability to tailor the structures and properties of graphene, targeting high&#8208;tech applications. The established strategies have been evolved from the initial dimension regulation to the emerging molecular engineering of graphene sheet. In general, these methods can be divided into top&#8208;down/bottom&#8208;up and chemical patterning routes as comprehensively disused in this review.








Abstract
The realization that nanostructured graphene featuring nanoscale width can confine electrons to open its bandgap has aroused scientists&#8217; attention to the regulation of graphene structures, where the concept of graphene patterns emerged. Exploring various effective methods for creating graphene patterns has led to the birth of a new field termed graphene patterning, which has evolved into the most vigorous and intriguing branch of graphene research during the past decade. The efforts in this field have resulted in the development of numerous strategies to structure graphene, affording a variety of graphene patterns with tailored shapes and sizes. The established patterning approaches combined with graphene chemistry yields a novel chemical patterning route via molecular engineering, which opens up a new era in graphene research. In this review, the currently developed graphene patterning strategies is systematically outlined, with emphasis on the chemical patterning. In addition to introducing the basic concepts and the important progress of traditional methods, which are generally categorized into top&#8208;down, bottom&#8208;up technologies, an exhaustive review of established protocols for emerging chemical patterning is presented. At the end, an outlook for future development and challenges is proposed.

         <title>Volatilizable Solid Additive&#8208;Assisted Treatment Enables Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency over 18.8% and Fill Factor Exceeding 80%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new morphology control approach is developed to fabricate high&#8208;performance organic solar cells by utilizing the synergistic effect of 1&#8208;chloronaphthalene (CN) and dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene (DTT) additives. This approach exhibits general application in various active layer systems to achieve well&#8208;developed morphology, enabled outstanding power&#8208;conversion efficiency over 18.8% and fill factor exceeding 80% for the device based on PTQ10:m&#8208;BTP&#8208;PhC6:PC71BM.








Abstract
Controlling the self&#8208;assembling of organic semiconductors to form well&#8208;developed nanoscale phase separation in the bulk&#8208;heterojunction active layer is critical yet challenging for building high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). Particularly, the similar anisotropic conjugated structures between nonfullerene acceptors and p&#8208;type organic semiconductor donors raise more complexity on manipulating their aggregation toward appropriate phase separation. Herein, a new approach to tune the morphology of photoactive layer is developed by utilizing the synergistic effect of dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene (DTT) and 1&#8208;chloronaphthalene (CN). The volatilizable solid additive DTT with high crystallinity can restrict the over self&#8208;assembling of nonfullerene acceptors during the film casting process, and then allowing the refining of phase separation and molecular packing with the simultaneous volatilization of DTT under thermal annealing. Consequently, the PTQ10:m&#8208;BTP&#8208;PhC6:PC71BM&#8208;based ternary OSCs processed by the dual additives of CN and DTT record a notable power&#8208;conversion efficiency of 18.89%, with a remarkable FF of 80.6%.

         <title>Molecule&#8208;Upgraded van der Waals Contacts for Schottky&#8208;Barrier&#8208;Free Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upgraded van der Waals metal&#8211;semiconductor contacts with near&#8208;zero Schottky barrier are realized by the stable, efficient, and non&#8208;residue molecule treatment of reducing the Schottky barrier width, to enable record&#8208;setting performance metrics of atomically thin transistors.








Abstract
The applications of any ultrathin semiconductor device are inseparable from high&#8208;quality metal&#8211;semiconductor contacts with designed Schottky barriers. Building van der Waals (vdWs) contacts of 2D semiconductors represents an advanced strategy of lowering the Schottky barrier height by reducing interface states, but will finally fail at the theoretical minimum barrier due to the inevitable energy difference between the semiconductor electron affinity and the metal work function. Here, an effective molecule optimization strategy is reported to upgrade the general vdWs contacts, achieving near&#8208;zero Schottky barriers and creating high&#8208;performance electronic devices. The molecule treatment can induce the defect healing effect in p&#8208;type semiconductors and further enhance the hole density, leading to an effectively thinned Schottky barrier width and improved carrier interface transmission efficiency. With an ultrathin Schottky barrier width of &#8776;2.17&#160;nm and outstanding contact resistance of &#8776;9 k&#937;&#160;&#181;m in the optimized Au/WSe2 contacts, an ultrahigh field&#8208;effect mobility of &#8776;148&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in chemical vapor deposition grown WSe2 flakes is achieved. Unlike conventional chemical treatments, this molecule upgradation strategy leaves no residue and displays a high&#8208;temperature stability at &gt;200 &#176;C. Furthermore, the Schottky barrier optimization is generalized to other metal&#8211;semiconductor contacts, including 1T&#8208;PtSe2/WSe2, 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe2/WSe2, 2H&#8208;NbS2/WSe2, and Au/PdSe2, defining a simple, universal, and scalable method to minimize contact resistance.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Capacitive Pressure Sensors over a Wide Pressure Range Enabled by the Hybrid Responses of a Highly Porous Nanocomposite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low sensitivity at large pressure is a long&#8208;standing obstacle of capacitive pressure sensors. A novel soft capacitive pressure sensor that employs an electrically conductive porous nanocomposite is a promising solution for resolving this chronic challenge. This hybrid&#8208;response pressure sensor exhibits unprecedented sensitivity up to 50 kPa. An analytical model explains its mechanism and enables selection of optimal manufacturing parameters.








Abstract
Past research aimed at increasing the sensitivity of capacitive pressure sensors has mostly focused on developing dielectric layers with surface/porous structures or higher dielectric constants. However, such strategies have only been effective in improving sensitivities at low pressure ranges (e.g., up to 3&#160;kPa). To overcome this well&#8208;known obstacle, herein, a flexible hybrid&#8208;response pressure sensor (HRPS) composed of an electrically conductive porous nanocomposite (PNC) laminated with an ultrathin dielectric layer is devised. Using a nickel foam template, the PNC is fabricated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs)&#8208;doped Ecoflex to be 86% porous and electrically conductive. The PNC exhibits hybrid piezoresistive and piezocapacitive responses, resulting in significantly enhanced sensitivities (i.e., more than 400%) over wide pressure ranges, from 3.13 kPa&#8722;1 within 0&#8211;1 kPa to 0.43 kPa&#8722;1 within 30&#8211;50 kPa. The effect of the hybrid responses is differentiated from the effect of porosity or high dielectric constants by comparing the HRPS with its purely piezocapacitive counterparts. Fundamental understanding of the HRPS and the prediction of optimal CNT doping are achieved through simplified analytical models. The HRPS is able to measure pressures from as subtle as the temporal arterial pulse to as large as footsteps.

         <title>Direct Atomic&#8208;Scale Structure and Electric Field Imaging of Triazine&#8208;Based Crystalline Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy technique reveals the local atomic configuration and also directly determines the atomic electric field of poly(triazine imide) crystal, the triazine&#8208;based crystalline carbon nitride. These findings offer a fundamental insight on the electronic structure for photoabsorption and the migration of charge carriers in photocatalysis with this material.








Abstract
Crystalline carbon nitrides (CNs) have recently attracted considerable attention owing to their superior photocatalytic activity. However, the electron&#8208;beam&#8208;sensitive nature of crystalline CNs hinders atomic&#8208;resolution imaging of their local structures by conventional (scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM) techniques. Here, the atomic structure of a triazine&#8208;based crystalline CN, poly(triazine imide) (PTI) incorporated with lithium and chloride ions, is unambiguously revealed using the emerging imaging technique of differential phase contrast STEM under a low dose. The lightest&#8208;element Li/H configuration is resolved within framework cavities of PTI and significantly affects the electronic structure for photoabsorption. The atomic electric field of PTI crystal directly determined in real space provides a fundamental evidence for the chemical bonding of Li ions and adjacent atoms for the migration of photogenerated carriers. These results facilitate the comprehension on local atomic configuration and chemical bonding state of crystalline CNs and can lead to a deeper understanding of the photocatalytic mechanism.

Abstract
With the increasing demand for wearable electronics (such as smartwatch equipment, wearable health monitoring systems, and human&#8211;robot interface units), flexible energy storage systems with eco&#8208;friendly, low&#8208;cost, multifunctional characteristics, and high electrochemical performances are imperative to be constructed. Nanocellulose with sustainable natural abundance, superb properties, and unique structures has emerged as a promising nanomaterial, which shows significant potential for fabricating functional energy storage systems. This review is intended to provide novel perspectives on the combination of nanocellulose with other electrochemical materials to design and fabricate nanocellulose&#8208;based flexible composites for advanced energy storage devices. First, the unique structural characteristics and properties of nanocellulose are briefly introduced. Second, the structure&#8211;property&#8211;application relationships of these composites are addressed to optimize their performances from the perspective of processing technologies and micro/nano&#8208;interface structure. Next, the recent specific applications of nanocellulose&#8208;based composites, ranging from flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries and electrochemical supercapacitors to emerging electrochemical energy storage devices, such as lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, sodium&#8208;ion batteries, and zinc&#8208;ion batteries, are comprehensively discussed. Finally, the current challenges and future developments in nanocellulose&#8208;based composites for the next generation of flexible energy storage systems are proposed.

         <title>Coupling Glucose&#8208;Assisted Cu(I)/Cu(II) Redox with Electrochemical Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a new approach is proposed to achieve low voltage and continuous hydrogen production using glucose&#8208;assisted Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox as anode reaction. Glucose in electrolyte can reduce the Cu(II) into Cu(I) spontaneously, thus completing the cycle of Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox. The assembled electrolyzer only requires a voltage input of 0.92&#160;V to achieve a current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Water electrolysis is a sustainable technology for hydrogen production since this process can utilize the intermittent electricity generated by renewable energy such as solar, wind, and hydro. However, the large&#8208;scale application of this process is restricted by the high electricity consumption due to the large potential gap (&gt;1.23&#160;V) between the anodic oxygen evolution reaction and the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a novel and efficient hydrogen production system is developed for coupling glucose&#8208;assisted Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox with HER. The onset potential of the electrooxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II) is as low as 0.7 VRHE (vs reversible hydrogen electrode). In situ Raman spectroscopy, ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculation demonstrates that glucose in the electrolyte can reduce the Cu(II) into Cu(I) instantaneously via a thermocatalysis process, thus completing the cycle of Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox. The assembled electrolyzer only requires a voltage input of 0.92&#160;V to achieve a current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Consequently, the electricity consumption for per cubic H2 produced in the system is 2.2&#160;kWh, only half of the value for conventional water electrolysis (4.5&#160;kWh). This work provides a promising strategy for the low&#8208;cost, efficient production of high&#8208;purity H2.

         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively introduces the latest advances in carbon&#8208;based hybrid catalysts toward hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. In particular, the design of functional groups and the dependence of electrolyte pH play important roles to further improve the selectivity of H2O2 production via the oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an environment&#8208;friendly and efficient oxidant with a wide range of applications in different industries. Recently, the production of hydrogen peroxide through direct electrosynthesis has attracted widespread research attention, and has emerged as the most promising method to replace the traditional energy&#8208;intensive multi&#8208;step anthraquinone process. In ongoing efforts to achieve highly efficient large&#8208;scale electrosynthesis of H2O2, carbon&#8208;based materials have been developed as 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction catalysts, with the benefits of low cost, abundant availability, and optimal performance. This review comprehensively introduces the strategies for optimizing carbon&#8208;based materials toward H2O2 production, and the latest advances in carbon&#8208;based hybrid catalysts. The active sites of the carbon&#8208;based materials and the influence of coordination heteroatom doping on the selectivity of H2O2 are extensively analyzed. In particular, the appropriate design of functional groups and understanding the effect of the electrolyte pH are expected to further improve the selective efficiency of producing H2O2 via the oxygen reduction reaction. Methods for improving catalytic activity by interface engineering and reaction kinetics are summarized. Finally, the challenges carbon&#8208;based catalysts face before they can be employed for commercial&#8208;scale H2O2 production are identified, and prospects for designing novel electrochemical reactors are proposed.

         <title>Reborn Three&#8208;Dimensional Graphene with Ultrahigh Volumetric Desalination Capacity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3DG is repeatedly crushed and reshaped to upgrade its overall performance like &#8220;Phoenix Nirvana.&#8221; 3DG is reborn to a higher self as NvG, making it emerge with unprecedented advantages in areas such as capacitive deionization and becoming a new engine to initiate the development of innovative 3D structures for carbon materials.








Abstract
The constructing of 3D materials with optimal performance is urgently needed to meet the growing demand of advanced materials in the high&#8208;tech sector. A distinctive 3D graphene (3DG) is designed based on a repeated rebirth strategy to obtain a better body and performance after each round of rebirth, as if it is Phoenix Nirvana. The properties of reborn graphene, namely 3DG after Nirvana (NvG), has been dramatically upgraded compared to 3DG, including high density (3.36 times) together with high porosity, as well as better electrical conductivity (1.41 times), mechanical strength (32.4 times), and ultrafast infiltration behavior. These advantages of NvG make it a strong intrinsic motivation for application in capacitive deionization (CDI). Using NvG directly as the CDI electrode, it has an extremely high volumetric capacity of 220&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3 at 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;3 and a maximum salt absorption capacity of 8.02~9.2&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;3 (8.9&#8211;10.2 times), while the power consumption for adsorption of the same mass of salt is less than a quarter of 3DG. The &#8220;Phoenix Nirvana&#8221;&#8208;like strategy of manufacturing 3D structures will undoubtedly become the new engine to kick&#8208;start the development of innovative carbon materials through an overall performance upgrade.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Black Phosphorus Heterostructures with Improved Ambient Stability and Enhanced Charge Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular engineering strategy is demonstrated to prepare ambient stable black phosphorus (BP)/hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) hybrid heterostructures. This strategy not only modifies the band structure of BP sheets but also improves their charge mobility, paving the way toward ambient processing and fabrication of high&#8208;performance BP&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Overcoming the intrinsic instability and preserving unique electronic properties are key challenges for the practical applications of black phosphorus (BP) under ambient conditions. Here, it is demonstrated that molecular heterostructures of BP and hexaazatriphenylene derivatives (BP/HATs) enable improved environmental stability and charge transport properties. The strong interfacial coupling and charge transfer between the HATs and the BP lattice decrease the surface electron density and protect BP sheets from oxidation, resulting in an excellent ambient lifetime of up to 21 d. Importantly, HATs increase the charge scattering time of BP, contributing to an improved carrier mobility of 97 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1, almost three times of the pristine BP films, based on noninvasive THz spectroscopic studies. The film mobility is an order of magnitude larger than previously reported values in exfoliated 2D materials. The strategy opens up new avenues for versatile applications of BP sheets and provides an effective method for tuning the physicochemical properties of other air&#8208;sensitive 2D semiconductors.

         <title>Updated Insights into 3D Architecture Electrodes for Micropower Sources</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D architecture electrode design enhances energy storage capability within a limited footprint area. This review comprehensively elucidates the superiority of 3D architecture electrodes for performance improvement of microbatteries and microsupercapacitors. The most recent research advances, current challenges, and future perspectives are outlined and discussed.








Abstract
Microbatteries (MBs) and microsupercapacitors (MSCs) are primary on&#8208;chip micropower sources that drive autonomous and stand&#8208;alone microelectronic devices for implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the performance of conventional MBs and MSCs is restricted by their 2D thin&#8208;film electrode design, and these devices struggle to satisfy the increasing IoT energy demands for high energy density, high power density, and long lifespan. The energy densities of MBs and MSCs can be improved significantly through adoption of a 2D thick&#8208;film electrode design; however, their power densities and lifespans deteriorate with increased electrode thickness. In contrast, 3D architecture electrodes offer remarkable opportunities to simultaneously improve MB and MSC energy density, power density, and lifespan. To date, various 3D architecture electrodes have been designed, fabricated, and investigated for MBs and MSCs. This review provides an update on the principal superiorities of 3D architecture electrodes over 2D thick&#8208;film electrodes in the context of improved MB and MSC energy density, power density, and lifespan. In addition, the most recent and representative progress in 3D architecture electrode development for MBs and MSCs is highlighted. Finally, present challenges are discussed and key perspectives for future research in this field are outlined.

         <title>Understanding the Synergistic Oxidation in Dichalcogenides through Electrochemiluminescence Blinking at Millisecond Resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic oxidation in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is revealed through electrochemiluminescence blinking. The formation of sulfur vacancies at MoS2, by the edge activation of hydrogen peroxide and the oxygen migration to the basal plane, is more conducive to oxygen doping, which favors the formation of Mo&#8208;O&#8208;Mo, as active sites. This mechanism is universal to transition metal dichalcogenides containing sulfur atoms.








Abstract
The oxidation of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) has been extensively studied and applied in electronics, optics, and energy sources because of its tunable structure and performance. However, due to the lack of appropriate technology, dynamically observe the oxidation process remains an arduous task. Herein, the synergistic oxidation between edge and basal plane in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is observed through electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) blinking with a millisecond resolution. In addition, the ECL method provides a simple, convenient, and quick way to judge structural changes. The transient elevation of the ECL intensity proved the intermittent doping of oxygen at MoS2, which generates O&#8208;atom active sites. High ECL intensity enhanced from the produced hydroperoxide intermediates eases the monitoring of MoS2 particles. Further study shows that the formation of sulfur vacancies at MoS2, by the edge activation of hydrogen peroxide and the migration of oxygen to the basal plane, is more conducive to oxygen doping that favors the formation of Mo&#63743;O&#63743;Mo as new active sites to induce bursts. The revealing of sulfur vacancy&#8208;governed blinking from MoS2 indicates a complex interaction between oxygen and MoS2. The same phenomenon is observed on tungsten disulfide (WS2), which provides new information about the oxidation feature of 2D dichalcogenides.

         <title>Elastic Lattice and Excess Charge Carrier Manipulation in 1D&#8211;3D Perovskite Solar Cells for Exceptionally Long&#8208;Term Operational Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electro&#8208;strictive strain in 3D polycrystalline perovskite is first observed, which can lead to an accelerated ion migration under operational conditions. And the 1D&#8211;3D perovskite, that is, 1D BnPbI3 perovskite spatially distributed in the 3D perovskite film and compensates the dangling bonds in the grain boundaries, can effectively inhibit electro&#8208;strictive responses and unbalanced charge carrier extraction, realizing the ultra&#8208;long operational stability.








Abstract
3D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid halide perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) inherently face severe instability issue due to ion migration under operational conditions. This ion migration inevitably results from the decomposition of ionic bonds under lattice strain and is accelerated by the existence of excess charge carriers. In this study, a 1D&#8211;3D mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite material is explored by adding an organic salt with a bulk benzimidazole cation (Bn+). The Bn+ can induce 3D perovskite crystalline growth with the preferred orientation and form a 1D BnPbI3 perovskite spatially distributed in the 3D perovskite film. For the first time, the electro&#8208;strictive response, which has a significant influence on the lattice strain under an electric field, is observed in polycrystalline perovskite. The 1D&#8211;3D perovskite can effectively suppress electro&#8208;strictive responses and unbalanced charge carrier extraction, providing an intrinsically stable lattice with enhanced ionic bonds and fewer excess charge carriers. As a result, the ion migration behavior of the p&#8208;i&#8208;n 1D&#8211;3D based pero&#8208;SC is dramatically suppressed under operational conditions, showing ultra&#8208;long&#8208;term stability that retains 95.3% of its initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) under operation for 3072 h, and simultaneously achieving an excellent PCE with a hysteresis&#8208;free photovoltaic behavior.

         <title>Bioengineering Approaches for the Advanced Organoid Research</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of organoid technologies, in terms of development of 3D miniature organs in vitro, has provided revolutionized approaches for understanding developmental processes and disease modeling. Comprehensive insights into the materials and genome engineering techniques applied to organoid culture are demonstrated. Based on the recent achievements, prospects and key challenges for the next&#8208;generation organoid technologies are also discussed.








Abstract
Recent advances in 3D cell culture technology have enabled scientists to generate stem cell derived organoids that recapitulate the structural and functional characteristics of native organs. Current organoid technologies have been striding toward identifying the essential factors for controlling the processes involved in organoid development, including physical cues and biochemical signaling. There is a growing demand for engineering dynamic niches characterized by conditions that resemble in vivo organogenesis to generate reproducible and reliable organoids for various applications. Innovative biomaterial&#8208;based and advanced engineering&#8208;based approaches have been incorporated into conventional organoid culture methods to facilitate the development of organoid research. The recent advances in organoid engineering, including extracellular matrices and genetic modulation, are comprehensively summarized to pinpoint the parameters critical for organ&#8208;specific patterning. Moreover, perspective trends in developing tunable organoids in response to exogenous and endogenous cues are discussed for next&#8208;generation developmental studies, disease modeling, and therapeutics.

         <title>Engineering Photoresponsive Ligand Tethers for Mechanical Regulation of Stem Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is developed to regulate the behaviors and functions of stem cells by switching the states of light switchable tethers. This method offers the chance to study the mechanotransduction via cellular tethers and realize the spatiotemporal regulation of differential cell fates.








Abstract
Regulating stem cell functions by precisely controlling the nanoscale presentation of bioactive ligands has a substantial impact on tissue engineering and regenerative medicine but remains a major challenge. Here it is shown that bioactive ligands can become mechanically &#8220;invisible&#8221; by increasing their tether lengths to the substrate beyond a critical length, providing a way to regulate mechanotransduction without changing the biochemical conditions. Building on this finding, light switchable tethers are rationally designed, whose lengths can be modulated reversibly by switching a light&#8208;responsive protein, pdDronpa, in between monomer and dimer states. This allows the regulation of the adhesion, spreading, and differentiation of stem cells by light on substrates of well&#8208;defined biochemical and physical properties. Spatiotemporal regulation of differential cell fates on the same substrate is further demonstrated, which may represent an important step toward constructing complex organoids or mini tissues by spatially defining the mechanical cues of the cellular microenvironment with light.

         <title>Controllable Synthesis of COFs&#8208;Based Multicomponent Nanocomposites from Core&#8208;Shell to Yolk&#8208;Shell and Hollow&#8208;Sphere Structure for Artificial Photosynthesis</title>

         <dc:description>
A MOF&#8208;sacrificed in situ acid&#8208;etching strategy to bring about the controllable synthesis of a series of COFs&#8208;based multicomponent nanocomposites from core&#8208;shell, yolk&#8208;shell, and hollow&#8208;sphere structures is presented. Combining unique yolk&#8208;shell structure with synergistic effect of the three components, the MTCN&#8208;H (ys) demonstrates remarkable catalytic performance in photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O.








Abstract
The precise tuning and multi&#8208;dimensional processing of covalent organic frameworks (COFs)&#8208;based materials into multicomponent superstructures with appropriate diversity are essential to maximize their advantages in catalytic reactions. However, up to now, it remains an ongoing challenge for the precise design of COFs&#8208;based multicomponent nanocomposites with diverse architectures. Herein, a metal organic framework (MOF)&#8208;sacrificed in situ acid&#8208;etching (MSISAE) strategy that enables continuous synthesis of core&#8208;shell, yolk&#8208;shell, and hollow&#8208;sphere COFs&#8208;based nanocomposites through tuning of core decomposition (NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 into TiO2) rate is developed. More importantly, due to the multiple active sites, fast transfer of carriers, increased light utilization ability, et al, one of the obtained samples, NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125/TiO2@COF&#8208;366&#8208;Ni&#8208;OH&#8208;HAc (yolk&#8208;shell) with special three components, exhibits high photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion efficiency in the gas&#8208;solid mode. The MSISAE strategy developed in this work achieves the precise morphology design and control of multicomponent hybrid composites based on COFs, which may pave a new way in devealoping porous crystalline materials with powerful superstructures for multifunctional catalytic reactions.
