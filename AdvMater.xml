         <title>Engineering Fe&#8211;N Coordination Structures for Fast Redox Conversion in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated catalyst comprising single&#8208;atom Fe and Fe2N composite sites, with dual&#8208;tailed Fe&#8211;N coordination structures, co&#8208;decorated on N&#8208;doped graphene is successfully constructed and demonstrated. The catalyst optimizes the polysulfide absorption&#8211;catalysis behavior, thereby facilitating fast redox conversion and suppressing the shuttle effect. Consequently, the Li&#8211;S batteries exhibit high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;cycling stability.








Abstract
Critical drawbacks, including sluggish redox kinetics and undesirable shuttling of polysulfides (Li2Sn, n&#160;= 4&#8211;8), seriously deteriorate the electrochemical performance of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Herein, these challenges are addressed by constructing an integrated catalyst with dual active sites, where single&#8208;atom (SA)&#8208;Fe and polar Fe2N are co&#8208;embedded in nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (SA&#8208;Fe/Fe2N@NG). The SA&#8208;Fe, with plane&#8208;symmetric Fe&#8208;4N coordination, and Fe2N, with triangular pyramidal Fe&#8208;3N coordination, in this well&#8208;designed configuration exhibit synergistic adsorption of polysulfides and catalytic selectivity for Li2Sn lithiation and Li2S delithiation, respectively. These characteristics endow the SA&#8208;Fe/Fe2N@NG&#8208;modified separator with an optimal polysulfides confinement&#8211;catalysis ability, thus accelerating the bidirectional liquid&#8211;solid conversion (Li2Sn&#8596;Li2S) and suppressing the shuttle effect. Consequently, a Li&#8211;S battery based on the SA&#8208;Fe/Fe2N@NG separator achieves a high capacity retention of 84.1% over 500 cycles at 1 C (pure S cathode, S content: 70&#160;wt%) and a high areal capacity of 5.02 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 0.1 C (SA&#8208;Fe/Fe2N@NG&#8208;supported S cathode, S loading = 5 mg&#160;cm&#8722;2). It is expected that the outcomes of the present study will facilitate the design of high&#8208;efficiency catalysts for long&#8208;lasting Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Modulation of Spin&#8211;Orbit Torque from SrRuO3 by Epitaxial&#8208;Strain&#8208;Induced Octahedral Rotation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal oxide perovskite oxides can have pronounced Berry phase curvatures and moderate electric conductivity, making them good sources of spin&#8211;orbit torque. The spin&#8211;orbit torque efficiency of SrRuO3 of three different crystal phases is investigated. Both experimental and theoretical results suggest that the spin&#8211;orbit torque efficiency is strongly correlated to the in&#8208;plane octahedral rotation in SrRuO3.








Abstract
Spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT), which arises from the spin&#8211;orbit coupling of conduction electrons, is believed to be the key route for developing low&#8208;power, high&#8208;speed, and nonvolatile memory devices. Despite the theoretical prediction of pronounced Berry phase curvatures in certain transition&#8208;metal perovskite oxides, which lead to considerable intrinsic spin Hall conductivity, SOT from this class of materials has rarely been reported until recently. Here, the SOT generated by epitaxial SrRuO3 of three different crystal structures is systematically studied. The results of both spin&#8208;torque ferromagnetic resonance and in&#8208;plane harmonic Hall voltage measurements concurrently reveal that the intrinsic SOT efficiency of SrRuO3 decreases when the epitaxial strain changes from tensile to compressive. The X&#8208;ray diffraction data demonstrate a strong correlation between the magnitude of SOT and octahedral rotation around the in&#8208;plane axes of SrRuO3, consistent with the theoretical prediction. This work offers new possibilities of tuning SOT with crystal structures and novel opportunities of integrating the unique properties of perovskite oxides with spintronic functionalities.

         <title>Multimodal Tuning of Synaptic Plasticity Using Persistent Luminescent Memitters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of memristive materials based on persistent luminescent memitters emulates synaptic plasticity and memory without requiring sophisticated devices. Experimental and theoretical data suggest that electron&#8208;coupled trap nucleation and propagation through clustering in persistent luminescent memitters can explain experience&#8208;dependent plasticity. Multichannel image memorization involving persistent luminescent memitters allows direct visualization of short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term memory.








Abstract
Mimicking memory processes, including encoding, storing, and retrieving information, is critical for neuromorphic computing and artificial intelligence. Synaptic behavior simulations through electronic, magnetic, or photonic devices based on metal oxides, 2D materials, molecular complex and phase change materials, represent important strategies for performing computational tasks with enhanced power efficiency. Here, a special class of memristive materials based on persistent luminescent memitters (termed as a portmanteau of &#8220;memory&#8221; and &#8220;emitter&#8221;) with optical characteristics closely resembling those of biological synapses is reported. The memory process and synaptic plasticity can be successfully emulated using such memitters under precisely controlled excitation frequency, wavelength, pulse number, and power density. The experimental and theoretical data suggest that electron&#8208;coupled trap nucleation and propagation through clustering in persistent luminescent memitters can explain experience&#8208;dependent plasticity. The use of persistent luminescent memitters for multichannel image memorization that allows direct visualization of subtle changes in luminescence intensity and realization of short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term memory is also demonstrated. These findings may promote the discovery of new functional materials as artificial synapses and enhance the understanding of memory mechanisms.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Acrylate Liquid Single Crystal Elastomers Reinforced by Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new chemical approach to fabricating monodomain LCE based on aza&#8208;Michael addition is developed, compatible with both liquid and gel alignment techniques, to manufacture actuators with versatile shapes. The facile process involving simply mixing two components is enabled by the two&#8208;stage differentiated kinetics of primary amines toward acrylates, generating hydrogen bonding, enhancing the mechanical properties of the elastomer.








Abstract
Liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) have been considered one of the most promising material concepts for artificial muscles. However, accomplishing actuation of LCEs requires macroscopic alignment of the liquid&#8208;crystalline orientation in the rubbery network, which imposes challenges in the materials chemistry and processing. A two&#8208;stage curing strategy has been the dominating approach during last three decades. Despite its many successes, the method is difficult in practice and requires delicate experiential skills, dealing with intrinsic fragility of intermediate gels after the first crosslinking stage. Here, a robust fabrication method for monodomain LCE based on the amine&#8208;acrylate aza&#8208;Michael addition is developed, involving two readily commercially available components with no catalyst. The method is based on the large kinetic difference of hydrogen addition in primary amines to acrylates, which offers a sufficient gap separating two stages of curing and enabling versatile mechanical alignment techniques for manufacturing monodomain LCE in both liquid and gel states. Importantly, the mechanically robust network, helping processability at a partial&#8208;crosslinking stage, is facilitated by the chemically generated hydrogen bonding all through the process, as a by&#8208;product of hydrogen addition. Such a facile two&#8208;component kit&#8208;like fabrication should aid researchers from various fields in the search for a practical and reliable process of making soft actuators.

         <title>Multifunctional and Ultrathin Electronic Tattoo for On&#8208;Skin Diagnostic and Therapeutic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional electronic skin tattoo system is achieved through the functionalization of carbon nanotubes to electrospun silk nanofiber mats. The tattoo system offers ultrathin, ultralight, biocompatible, deformable, and skin adhesion. Heat&#8208;stimulated drug delivery with controlled temperature and electrophysiological signal monitoring are possible using this electronic tattoo system in a noninvasive manner.








Abstract
Epidermal electronic systems for detecting electrophysiological signals, sensing, therapy, and drug delivery are at the frontier in man&#8211;machine interfacing for healthcare. However, it is still a challenge to develop multifunctional bioapplications with minimal invasiveness, biocompatibility, and stable electrical performance under various mechanical deformations of biological tissues. In this study, a natural silk protein with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is utilized to realize an epidermal electronic tattoo (E&#8208;tattoo) system for multifunctional applications that address these challenging issues through dispersing highly conductive CNTs onto the biocompatible silk nanofibrous networks with porous nature to construct skin&#8208;adhesive ultrathin electronic patches. Individual components that incorporate electrically and optically active heaters, a temperature sensor (temperature coefficient of resistance of 5.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#160;&#176;C&#8722;1), a stimulator for drug delivery (&gt;500&#160;&#181;m penetration depth in skin), and real&#8208;time electrophysiological signal detectors are described. This strategy of E&#8208;tattoos integrated onto human skin can open a new route to a next&#8208;generation electronic platform for wearable and epidermal bioapplications.

         <title>Lotus&#8208;Root&#8208;Like Carbon Fibers Embedded with Ni&#8211;Co Nanoparticles for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lotus&#8208;root&#8208;like carbon fibers embedded with Ni&#8211;Co nanoparticles (NCH@CFs) are designed as a lithium (Li) host via facile electrospinning and the subsequent thermal annealing. Benefitting from the 3D conductive framework and the internal hollow structure with highly dispersed lithiophilic sites, the NCH@CF host can spatially regulate the electric field to effectively suppress the Li&#8208;dendrite growth and withstand severe volume expansion for long&#8208;term cycling performance in both symmetric and full cells.








Abstract
The growth of lithium (Li) dendrites and the huge volume change are the critical issues for the practical applications of Li&#8208;metal anodes. In this work, a spatial control strategy is proposed to address the above challenges using lotus&#8208;root&#8208;like Ni&#8211;Co hollow prisms@carbon fibers (NCH@CFs) as the host. The homogeneously distributed bimetallic Ni&#8211;Co particles on the N&#8208;doped carbon fibers serve as nucleation sites to effectively reduce the overpotential for Li nucleation. Furthermore, the 3D conductive network can alter the electric field. More importantly, the hierarchical lotus&#8208;root&#8208;like hollow fibers provide sufficient void space to withstand the volume expansion during Li deposition. These structural features guide the uniform Li nucleation and non&#8208;dendritic growth. As a result, the NCH@CFs host enables a very stable Li metal anode with a low voltage hysteresis during repeated Li plating/stripping for 1200 h at a current density of 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.

         <title>A Safe and Sustainable Lithium&#8208;Ion&#8211;Oxygen Battery based on a Low&#8208;Cost Dual&#8208;Carbon Electrodes Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Li&#8208;ion&#8211;O2 battery system with a dual&#8208;carbon electrodes architecture is constructed to address the concerns of safety and costs. Li&#8208;ions undergo a (de)intercalation process into the graphite anode and an O2/Li2O2 redox conversion on the carbon nanotube cathode. Benefitting from superior electrode compatibilities, a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density pouch cell (302.52 W h kg&#8722;1) with cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly carbon components is fabricated.








Abstract
People anticipate high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery technology with better security, stability, and sustainability. By tuning the advantage of specific capacity, the lithium&#8208;metal anode is replaced with a graphite intercalation compound and a conceptual prototype lithium&#8208;ion&#8211;oxygen battery based on a low&#8208;cost dual&#8208;carbon electrodes architecture is proposed. The lithium&#8208;ion involves a (de)intercalation process into the graphite anode and an O2/Li2O2 redox conversion on the carbon&#8208;nanotube cathode. After a thorough examination as to the electrode compatibility with current electrolytes, a nonflammable fluorinated ether electrolyte is proposed to render a highly coordinated solvation sheath and low lithium salt concentration (1&#160;mol). Herein, the compatibility with graphite anode is investigated, which maintains high capacity retention (88.1%) after long&#8208;term lifespan (over 1 year). In view of the ultrahigh reversibility (average Coulombic efficiency over 99.93%) of the graphite anode, a lithium&#8208;ion&#8211;oxygen coin cell with high depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge of 80% and 60% deliver a satisfactory life over 150 and 300 cycles, respectively. Moreover, systematic spectroscopy characterizations demonstrate a reversible and efficient 2e&#8211; O2/Li2O2 redox reaction without relying on noble&#8208;metal catalysts. Lastly, in the engineering aspect, a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density pouch cell (302.52 W h kg&#8722;1 based on the weight of the entire pouch) with cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly carbon&#8208;composed cell components is successfully fabricated.

         <title>Novel Spin&#8211;Orbit Torque Generation at Room Temperature in an All&#8208;Oxide Epitaxial La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/SrIrO3 System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;oxide, SrTiO3//La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO)/SrIrO3 (SIO) heterostructure with lattice&#8208;matched crystal structure is synthesized, exhibiting an epitaxial and atomically sharp interface between the ferromagnetic LSMO and the high spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupled metal SIO. Remarkably, epitaxial LSMO/SIO exhibits a large spin&#8211;orbit torque efficiency, &#958;||&#160;=&#160;1, while retaining a reasonably low shunting factor and increasing the effective magnetization of LSMO by &#8776;50%.








Abstract
Spin&#8211;orbit torques (SOTs) that arise from materials with large spin&#8211;orbit coupling offer a new pathway for energy&#8208;efficient and fast magnetic information storage. SOTs in conventional heavy metals and topological insulators are explored extensively, while 5d transition metal oxides, which also host ions with strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, are a relatively new territory in the field of spintronics. An all&#8208;oxide, SrTiO3 (STO)//La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO)/SrIrO3 (SIO) heterostructure with lattice&#8208;matched crystal structure is synthesized, exhibiting an epitaxial and atomically sharp interface between the ferromagnetic LSMO and the high spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupled metal SIO. Spin&#8208;torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST&#8208;FMR) is used to probe the effective magnetization and the SOT efficiency in LSMO/SIO heterostructures grown on STO substrates. Remarkably, epitaxial LSMO/SIO exhibits a large SOT efficiency, &#958;||&#160;=&#160;1, while retaining a reasonably low shunting factor and increasing the effective magnetization of LSMO by &#8776;50%. The findings highlight the significance of epitaxy as a powerful tool to achieve a high SOT efficiency, explore the rich physics at the epitaxial interface, and open up a new pathway for designing next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;efficient spintronic devices.

Remarkably, epitaxial LSMO/SIO exhibits a large spin&#8211;orbit torque efficiency, &#958;&lt;sub&gt;||&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;1, while retaining a reasonably low shunting factor and increasing the effective magnetization of LSMO by &#8776;50%.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spin&#8211;orbit torques (SOTs) that arise from materials with large spin&#8211;orbit coupling offer a new pathway for energy-efficient and fast magnetic information storage. SOTs in conventional heavy metals and topological insulators are explored extensively, while 5d transition metal oxides, which also host ions with strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, are a relatively new territory in the field of spintronics. An all-oxide, SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (STO)//La&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (LSMO)/SrIrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (SIO) heterostructure with lattice-matched crystal structure is synthesized, exhibiting an epitaxial and atomically sharp interface between the ferromagnetic LSMO and the high spin&#8211;orbit-coupled metal SIO. Spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) is used to probe the effective magnetization and the SOT efficiency in LSMO/SIO heterostructures grown on STO substrates. Remarkably, epitaxial LSMO/SIO exhibits a large SOT efficiency, &#958;&lt;sub&gt;||&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;1, while retaining a reasonably low shunting factor and increasing the effective magnetization of LSMO by &#8776;50%. The findings highlight the significance of epitaxy as a powerful tool to achieve a high SOT efficiency, explore the rich physics at the epitaxial interface, and open up a new pathway for designing next-generation energy-efficient spintronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Unravelling Magnetic Nanochain Formation in Dispersion for In Vivo Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocompatible iron oxide nanoparticles in dispersion can be controlled to form flexible and reversible chains in the presence of a magnetic field, which is useful for biomedical applications. The role of control parameters is determined and these novel assemblies formed in dispersions are visualized using advanced scattering methods and reverse Monte Carlo simulations.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) into 1D chains is appealing, because of their biocompatibility and higher mobility compared to 2D/3D assemblies while traversing the circulatory passages and blood vessels for in vivo biomedical applications. In this work, parameters such as size, concentration, composition, and magnetic field, responsible for chain formation of IONPs in a dispersion as opposed to spatially confining substrates, are examined. In particular, the monodisperse 27&#160;nm IONPs synthesized by an extended LaMer mechanism are shown to form chains at 4 mT, which are lengthened with applied field reaching 270&#160;nm at 2.2 T. The chain lengths are completely reversible in field. Using a combination of scattering methods and reverse Monte Carlo simulations the formation of chains is directly visualized. The visualization of real&#8208;space IONPs assemblies formed in dispersions presents a novel tool for biomedical researchers. This allows for rapid exploration of the behavior of IONPs in solution in a broad parameter space and unambiguous extraction of &#8203;the parameters of the equilibrium structures. Additionally, it can be extended to study novel assemblies formed by more complex geometries of IONPs.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Scanning&#8208;Guided Assembly of Quasi&#8208;3D Patterned Arrays of Plasmonic Dimers for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile laser writing strategy is developed to fabricate plasmonic dimer arrays with arbitrary patterns. This approach allows for precisely controlling the z&#8208;axis orientation, interparticle spacing, and nanoparticle size and shape of plasmonic dimers. The plasmonic color of the patterned dimers can be reversibly displayed and erased, enabling their use in information encryption and beyond.








Abstract
The application of plasmonic dimeric nanostructures in color displays, data storage, and especially metamaterials necessitates the patterning of dimers into ordered arrays, but controllable assembly of plasmonic nanoparticles into patterned dimer arrays on substrates still remains a challenge. Here, a facile laser&#8208;scanning&#8208;based strategy to fabricate quasi&#8208;3D patterned arrays of plasmonic nanoparticle dimers with controlled orientation for plasmonic information encryption is reported. Laser scanning of polymer&#8208;covered plasmonic nanoparticle (e.g., gold) arrays selectively exposes the surface of irradiated nanoparticle via localized photothermal heating, guiding the assembly of another type of nanoparticles onto the exposure nanoparticle surface to form dimers on substrates. This combined top&#8208;down/bottom&#8208;up approach is highly flexible in forming high&#8208;resolution patterns of plasmonic dimers from nanoparticles of different sizes and shapes. The z&#8208;axis orientation, interparticle spacing, and nanoparticle size and shape of plasmonic dimers can be precisely tuned, enabling the modulation of the coupled resonances of the dimer arrays. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the patterned dimer arrays can be used in information encryption where their plasmonic color can be repeatedly displayed and erased. This work provides an important addition to tools for the fabrication of patterned complex plasmonic nanostructures from as&#8208;synthesized nanoparticles with broad applications.

         <title>Stimulation of Local Cytosolic Calcium Release by Photothermal Heating for Studying Intra&#8208; and Intercellular Calcium Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methodology is reported to trigger intra&#8208; and intercellular calcium waves by photoexcitation. Polymeric capsules with integrated plasmonic nanoparticles inside lysosomes are individually excited by near&#8208;infrared light to transiently release small amounts of Ca2+, which can evoke abundant Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to further propagating intra&#8208; and intercellular calcium waves.








Abstract
A methodology is described that allows for localized Ca2+ release by photoexcitation. For this, cells are loaded with polymer capsules with integrated plasmonic nanoparticles, which reside in endo&#8208;lysosomes. The micrometer&#8208;sized capsules can be individually excited by near&#8208;infrared light from a light pointer, causing photothermal heating, upon which there is a rise in the free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). The [Ca2+]i can be analyzed with a Ca2+ indicator fluorophore. In this way, it is possible to excite local lysosomal Ca2+ release in a desired target cell.

         <title>Localized Delivery of Theranostic Nanoparticles and High&#8208;Energy Photons using Microneedles&#8208;on&#8208;Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microneedle&#8208;based local delivery of light&#8208;responsive theranostic nanoparticles (NPs) and high&#8208;energy photons to treat brain tumors is proposed. The multifunctional theranostic NPs are delivered locally using bioresorbable microneedles. Then, high&#8208;energy photons generated from integrated bioelectronics are delivered by the light&#8208;guiding/spreading microneedles to the NPs to activate photodynamic therapy/chemotherapy. The efficacy of the proposed treatment is demonstrated with two types of brain tumor model in vivo.








Abstract
The low delivery efficiency of light&#8208;responsive theranostic nanoparticles (NPs) to target tumor sites, particularly to brain tumors due to the blood&#8211;brain barrier, has been a critical issue in NP&#8208;based cancer treatments. Furthermore, high&#8208;energy photons that can effectively activate theranostic NPs are hardly delivered to the target region due to the strong scattering of such photons while penetrating surrounding tissues. Here, a localized delivery method of theranostic NPs and high&#8208;energy photons to the target tumor using microneedles&#8208;on&#8208;bioelectronics is presented. Two types of microneedles and flexible bioelectronics are integrated and mounted on the edge of surgical forceps. Bioresorbable microneedles containing theranostic NPs deliver the NPs into target tumors (e.g., glioblastoma, pituitary adenoma). Magnetic resonance imaging can locate the NPs. Then, light&#8208;guiding/spreading microneedles deliver high&#8208;energy photons from bioelectronics to the NPs. The high&#8208;energy photons activate the NPs to treat tumor tissues by photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy. The controlled thermal actuation by the bioelectronics accelerates the diffusion of chemo&#8208;drugs. The proposed method is demonstrated with mouse tumor models in vivo.

         <title>Electrically Induced Mixed Valence Increases the Conductivity of Copper Helical Metallopolymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulation in the conductivity of 1D materials is of importance for nanoscale control of electrical currents. Self&#8208;assembled molecular wires containing Cu ions in the +1 oxidation state are shown to increase their conductivity by 4 orders of magnitude upon applying an electrical stimulus. The mechanism of this resistance change is attributed to the system adopting a mixed&#8208;valence CuI/CuII state.








Abstract
Controlling the flow of electrical current at the nanoscale typically requires complex top&#8208;down approaches. Here, a bottom&#8208;up approach is employed to demonstrate resistive switching within molecular wires that consist of double&#8208;helical metallopolymers and are constructed by self&#8208;assembly. When the material is exposed to an electric field, it is determined that &#8776;25% of the copper atoms oxidize from CuI to CuII, without rupture of the polymer chain. The ability to sustain such a high level of oxidation is unprecedented in a copper&#8208;based molecule: it is made possible here by the double helix compressing in order to satisfy the new coordination geometry required by CuII. This mixed&#8208;valence structure exhibits a 104&#8208;fold increase in conductivity, which is projected to last on the order of years. The increase in conductivity is explained as being promoted by the creation, upon oxidation, of partly filled dz2 orbitals aligned along the mixed&#8208;valence copper array; the long&#8208;lasting nature of the change in conductivity is due to the structural rearrangement of the double&#8208;helix, which poses an energetic barrier to re&#8208;reduction. This work establishes helical metallopolymers as a new platform for controlling currents at the nanoscale.

         <title>Surfactant&#8208;Free, One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Hollow Nanospheres for Trace CO Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly pure lead&#8208;free halide perovskite Cs2PdBr6 hollow nanospheres are synthesized in large quantities using a surfactant&#8208;free one&#8208;step method. These ultrapure nanospheres exhibit superiority in detection of CO with a lower limit of 50 ppb, which is the lowest among all reported CO chemresistive materials.








Abstract
Owing to their special photoelectric properties, halide perovskites have always attracted research attention. Hollow&#8208;structured halide perovskites have many practical applications but are challenging to prepare as most template methods violate their poor chemical and thermal stability. In this study, novel halide perovskite Cs2PdBr6 hollow nanospheres are prepared using a template&#8208;free method; specifically, large quantities of highly pure lead&#8208;free halide perovskite Cs2PdBr6 hollow nanospheres are produced at 30&#160;&#176;C without a surfactant. These ultrapure nanospheres exhibit superiority in chemresistive detection of CO with a detection limit of 50 ppb, which is the lowest among all the reported CO sensing materials. Moreover, in situ sum&#8208;frequency&#8208;generation spectra and density functional theory calculations reveal that the high sensitivity is attributable to the large specific surface area and surfactant&#8208;free surface of rich Br&#8722; vacancies that favor CO binding. Overall, this work provides insight on regulation of the halide perovskite structure and the use of hollow spheres in gas&#8208;sensing applications.

         <title>Bioinspired Dual&#8208;Mode Temporal Communication via Digitally Programmable Phase&#8208;Change Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A digitally programmable phase&#8208;change material is reported, for which the crystallization kinetics can be controlled in a pixelated manner. It enables secured temporal communications in both optical and infrared modes, and the stored information can self&#8208;evolve with time, standing in sharp contrast to stimuli&#8208;responsive color/infrared change of other systems.








Abstract
Switchable optical properties are essential for numerous technologies including communication, anticounterfeiting, camouflage, and imaging/sensing. Typically, the switching is enabled by applying external stimulation such as UV light for fluorescence detection. In contrast, ground squirrels utilize spontaneous live infrared emission for fencing off predators as a unique way of communication. Inspired by this, live evolution of both optical and thermal images for temporal communication in which time is the encoded information is demonstrated. This system is based on a digitally light&#8208;cured polymeric phase&#8208;change material for which the crystallization kinetics can be controlled in a pixelated manner. Consequently, live evolution in optical transparency during the crystallization process enables temporal optical communication. Additionally, by harnessing the dynamic evolution of the thermal enthalpy, multiple sets of time&#8208;specific information can be reversibly retrieved as self&#8208;evolving infrared thermal images. The versatility of this dual&#8208;mode temporal system expands the scope for secured communication, with potential implications for various other areas including optics, thermal regulation, and 3D/4D printing.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Bridged Graphene&#8211;Protein Supraparticles for Analog and Digital Nitric Oxide Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) can assemble into self&#8208;limited supraparticles when van der Waals forces are supplemented by coordination bonds with Tb3+ ions. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is incorporated into supraparticles, which enables a selective assay for nitric oxide (NO) with ultrahigh sensitivity. Practical for NO detection in exhaled breath, a rapid non&#8208;invasive test is approached for pulmonary inflammation, such as coronavirus pneumonia.








Abstract
Self&#8208;limited nanoassemblies, such as supraparticles (SPs), can be made from virtually any nanoscale components, but SPs from nanocarbons including graphene quantum dots (GQDs), are hardly known because of the weak van der Waals attraction between them. Here it is shown that highly uniform SPs from GQDs can be successfully assembled when the components are bridged by Tb3+ ions supplementing van der Waals interactions. Furthermore, they can be coassembled with superoxide dismutase, which also has weak attraction to GQDs. Tight structural integration of multilevel components into SPs enables efficient transfer of excitonic energy from GQDs and protein to Tb3+. This mechanism is activated when Cu2+ is reduced to Cu1+ by nitric oxide (NO)&#8212;an important biomarker for viral pulmonary infections and Alzheimer's disease. Due to multipronged fluorescence enhancement, the limit of NO detection improves 200 times reaching 10 &#215; 10&#8211;12 m. Furthermore, the uniform size of SPs enables digitization of the NO detection using the single particle detection format resulting in confident registration of as few as 600 molecules mL&#8722;1. The practicality of the SP&#8208;based assay is demonstrated by the successful monitoring of NO in human breath. The biocompatible SPs combining proteins, carbonaceous nanostructures, and ionic components provide a general path for engineering uniquely sensitive assays for noninvasive tracking of infections and other diseases.

         <title>Underwater Communication and Optical Camouflage Ionogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transparent, underwater adhesive, underwater self&#8208;healable, stretchable, and 3D&#8208;printable ionogel with high ionic conductivity is developed to create a submersible soft sensor. Optical camouflage, human&#8208;body&#8208;motion detection, and barrier&#8208;free communication can be achieved by the ionogel sensor in the aquatic environment. A novel contactless sensing mechanism, which can avoid fatigue and physical damage, is also proposed.








Abstract
Marine animals, such as leptocephalus and jellyfish, can sense external stimuli and achieve optical camouflage in the aquatic environment. Fabricating an intelligent soft sensor that can mimic the capabilities of transparent marine animals and function underwater can enable transformative applications in various novel fields.

&lt;p&gt;A transparent, underwater adhesive, underwater self-healable, stretchable, and 3D-printable ionogel with high ionic conductivity is developed to create a submersible soft sensor. Optical camouflage, human-body-motion detection, and barrier-free communication can be achieved by the ionogel sensor in the aquatic environment. A novel contactless sensing mechanism, which can avoid fatigue and physical damage, is also proposed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marine animals, such as leptocephalus and jellyfish, can sense external stimuli and achieve optical camouflage in the aquatic environment. Fabricating an intelligent soft sensor that can mimic the capabilities of transparent marine animals and function underwater can enable transformative applications in various novel fields. However, previously reported soft sensors struggle to meet the requirements of adhesion, self-healing ability, optical transparency, and stable conductivity in the aquatic environment. Herein, high-performance ionogels by virtue of ion&#8211;dipole and ion&#8211;ion interactions between fluorine-rich poly(ionic liquid) and ionic liquid are designed. The hydrophobic dynamic viscoelastic networks provide excellent properties for ionogels, including optical transparency, adjustable mechanical properties, underwater self-healing ability, underwater adhesiveness, conductivity, and 3D printability.

         <title>Multifunctional Graphdiyne&#8211;Cerium Oxide Nanozymes Facilitate MicroRNA Delivery and Attenuate Tumor Hypoxia for Highly Efficient Radiotherapy of Esophageal Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radiotherapy sensitization system that integrates graphdiyne&#8211;CeO2&#8208;based nanozymes and miR181a&#8208;2&#8208;3p (miR181a) delivery with excellent catalase&#8208;mimic activity and radiosensitization is developed for the efficient radiotherapy of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Since miR181a is secreted and predicts response to preoperative radiotherapy in human locally advanced ESCC, this strategy may offer opportunities for the clinical translation of therapies and facilitate patient&#8208;personalized treatment.








Abstract
Radioresistance is an important challenge for clinical treatments. The main causes of radioresistance include hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment, the antioxidant system within cancer cells, and the upregulation of DNA repair proteins. Here, a multiple radiosensitization strategy of high&#8208;Z&#8208;element&#8208;based radiation enhancement is designed, attenuating hypoxia and microRNA therapy. The novel 2D graphdiyne (GDY) can firmly anchor and disperse CeO2 nanoparticles to form GDY&#8211;CeO2 nanocomposites, which exhibit superior catalase&#8208;mimic activity in decomposing H2O2 to O2 to significantly alleviate tumor hypoxia, promote radiation&#8208;induced DNA damage, and ultimately inhibit tumor growth in vivo. The miR181a&#8208;2&#8208;3p (miR181a) serum levels in patients are predictive of the response to preoperative radiotherapy in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and facilitate personalized treatment. Moreover, miR181a can act as a radiosensitizer by directly targeting RAD17 and regulating the Chk2 pathway. Subsequently, the GDY&#8211;CeO2 nanocomposites with miR181a are conjugated with the iRGD&#8208;grafted polyoxyethylene glycol (short for nano&#8208;miR181a), which can increase the stability, efficiently deliver miR181a to tumor, and exhibit low toxicity. Notably, nano&#8208;miR181a can overcome radioresistance and enhance therapeutic efficacy both in a subcutaneous tumor model and human&#8208;patient&#8208;derived xenograft models. Overall, this GDY&#8211;CeO2 nanozyme and miR181a&#8208;based multisensitized radiotherapy strategy provides a promising therapeutic approach for ESCC.

         <title>K&#8208;Ion Battery Cathode Design Utilizing Trigonal Prismatic Ligand Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemistry of a trigonal&#8208;prismatic (TP) TMO6 unit is revealed in a K&#8208;ion battery cathode. The activity, reversibility, and stability of TP FeO6 based on comprehensive synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analyses demonstrate it is a feasible structural gene for electrode design and exploration. Further materials lattice and electronic structure manipulation are expected.








Abstract
The intrinsic physical and chemical properties of materials are largely governed by the bonding and electronic structures of their fundamental building units. The majority of cathode materials contain octahedral TMO6 (TM = transition metal), which dominates the redox chemistry during electrochemical operation. As a less symmetric form of TMO6, the trigonal prismatic geometry is not a traditionally favored coordination configuration as it tends to lose the crystal&#8208;field stabilization energy and thus generate large ligand repulsion. Herein, a K&#8208;ion battery cathode design, K2Fe(C2O4)2, is shown&#8203;, where the TMO6 trigonal prism (TP) is not only electrochemically active but stable enough to allow for excellent cycling stability. Detailed synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy measurements reveal the evolution of localized fine structure, evidencing the electrochemical activity, reversibility, and stability of the TP motif. The findings are expected to expand the toolbox for the rational design of electrode materials by taking advantage of TP as a structural gene.

         <title>Exceptional Cocatalyst&#8208;Free Photo&#8208;Enhanced Piezocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution of Carbon Nitride Nanosheets from Strong In&#8208;Plane Polarization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exceptional photo&#8208;enhanced piezocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 12.16 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 without any cocatalysts is realized by g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets, outperforming most previously reported piezocatalysts and g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts, which originates from the large anomalous piezoelectricity induced by in&#8208;plane polarization, coupled with the photo&#8208;improved surface charge transfer and strain&#8208;enriched surface reactive sites.








Abstract
Utilizing mechanical energy to produce hydrogen is emerging as a promising way to generate renewable energy, but is challenged by low efficiency and scanty cognition. In this work, graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) with an atomically thin sheet&#8208;like structure is applied for prominent piezocatalytic and photo&#8208;enhanced piezocatalytic H2 production. It is revealed that the anomalous piezoelectricity in g&#8208;C3N4 originates from the strong in&#8208;plane polarization along the a&#8208;axis, contributed by the superimposed polar tri&#8208;s&#8208;triazine units and flexoelectric effect derived from the structured triangular cavities, which provides powerful electrochemical driving force for the water reduction reaction. Furthermore, the photo&#8208;enhanced charge transfer enables g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets to reserve more energized polarization charges to fully participate in the reaction at the surface reactive sites enriched by strain&#8208;induced carbon vacancies. Without any cocatalysts, an exceptional photo&#8208;piezocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 12.16 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 is delivered by the g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets, far exceeding that of previously reported piezocatalysts and g&#8208;C3N4 photocatalysts. Further, high pure&#8208;water&#8208;splitting performance with production of the value&#8208;added oxidation product H2O2 via photo&#8208;piezocatalysis is also disclosed. This work not only exposes the potential of g&#8208;C3N4 as a piezo&#8208;semiconductor for catalytic H2 evolution, but also breaks a new ground for the conversion of solar and mechanical energy by photomediated piezocatalytic reaction.

         <title>Characterization and Quantification of Depletion and Accumulation Layers in Solid&#8208;State Li+&#8208;Conducting Electrolytes Using In Situ Spectroscopic Ellipsometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes are one of the few battery technologies for next&#8208;generation batteries. However, the high interface resistance in contact with electrode materials is still largely unexplained. Spectroscopic ellipsometry combined with in situ electrochemistry reveals highly asymmetric space charge layer occurrence. It opens a new study field to investigate and quantify the charge layer formation in solid&#8208;state electrolytes by optical means.

The future of mobility depends on the development of next&#8208;generation battery technologies, such as all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. As the ionic conductivity of solid Li+&#8208;conductors can, in some cases, approach that of liquid electrolytes, a significant remaining barrier faced by solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) is the interface formed at the anode and cathode materials, with chemical instability and physical resistances arising. The physical properties of space charge layers (SCLs), a widely discussed phenomenon in SSEs, are still unclear. In this work, spectroscopic ellipsometry is used to characterize the accumulation and depletion layers. An optical model is developed to quantify their thicknesses and corresponding concentration changes. It is shown that the Li+&#8208;depleted layer (&#8776;190&#160;nm at 1&#160;V) is thinner than the accumulation layer (&#8776;320&#160;nm at 1&#160;V) in a glassy lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;conducting glass ceramic electrolyte (a trademark of Ohara Corporation). The in situ approach combining electrochemistry and optics resolves the ambiguities around SCL formation. It opens up a wide field of optical measurements on SSEs, allowing various experimental studies in the future.

&lt;p&gt;Solid-state electrolytes are one of the few battery technologies for next-generation batteries. However, the high interface resistance in contact with electrode materials is still largely unexplained. Spectroscopic ellipsometry combined with in situ electrochemistry reveals highly asymmetric space charge layer occurrence. It opens a new study field to investigate and quantify the charge layer formation in solid-state electrolytes by optical means.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystalline Silicon Frameworks: A New Platform for Transparent Flexible Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;supported, flexible, and highly transparent single&#8208;crystalline silicon frameworks (sc&#8208;SiFs) are fabricated from commonly used Si wafers by combining wet&#8208;etching and microfabrication technologies. They provide a new platform for transparent flexible optoelectronics, enabling the construction of high&#8208;performance transparent flexible Si&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystalline silicon (sc&#8208;Si) is the dominant semiconductor material for the modern electronics industry. Despite their excellent photoelectric and electronic properties, the rigidity, brittleness, and nontransparency of commonly used silicon wafers limit their application in transparent flexible optoelectronics. In this study, a new type of Si microstructure, named single&#8208;crystalline Si frameworks (sc&#8208;SiFs), is developed, through a combination of wet&#8208;etching and microfabrication technologies. The sc&#8208;SiFs are self&#8208;supported, flexible, lightweight, tailorable, and highly transparent. They can withstand a small bending radius of less than 0.5&#160;mm and have a transparency of up to 96% in all wavelength ranges, owing to the hollowed&#8208;out framework structures. Thus, the sc&#8208;SiFs provide a new platform for high&#8208;performance transparent flexible optoelectronics. Taking transparent flexible photodetectors (TFPDs) as an example, substrate&#8208;free and self&#8208;driven TFPDs are achieved based on the sc&#8208;SiFs. The devices exhibit superior performance compared to other reported TFPDs and reveal the great potential for integrated optoelectronic applications. The development of sc&#8208;SiFs paves the way toward the fabrication of high&#8208;performance transparent flexible devices for a host of applications, including e&#8208;skins, the Internet of Things, transparent flexible displays, and artificial&#160;visual&#160;cortexes.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Gradient Hydrogels Enable Direct Zero Liquid Discharge for Hypersaline Wastewater Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zero liquid discharge (ZLD), as the ultimate goal of wastewater treatment, is hampered by the lack of robust membrane&#8208;based desalination technologies. A hydrophilic nonporous charge&#8208;gradient hydrogel (CGH) membrane shows high water flux and excellent fouling/scaling&#8208;free properties in membrane distillation, enabling direct and ultrastable desalination of hypersaline wastewater (130&#160;g&#160;L&#8722;1) containing broad&#8208;spectrum foulants (500&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1) for 200&#160;h.








Abstract
Zero liquid discharge (ZLD), which maximizes water recovery and eliminates environmental impact, is an urgent wastewater management strategy for alleviating freshwater shortage. However, because of the high concentration of salts and broad&#8208;spectrum foulants in wastewater, a huge challenge for ZLD is lack of a robust membrane&#8208;based desalination technology that enables direct wastewater recovery without costly pretreatment processes. Here, a paradigm&#8208;shift membrane distillation (MD) strategy is presented, wherein the traditional hydrophobic porous membrane is replaced with a hydrophilic nonporous charge&#8208;gradient hydrogel (CGH) membrane that possesses hypersaline tolerance, fouling/scaling&#8208;free properties, and negligible vapor transfer resistance inside the membrane, simultaneously. Therefore, the CGH&#8208;based MD with high water flux enables direct desalination of hypersaline wastewater (130&#160;g&#160;L&#8208;1) containing broad&#8208;spectrum foulants (500&#160;mg&#160;L&#8208;1) during continuous long&#8208;term operation (200 h), and this technology paves a promising way to direct ZLD for wastewater management.

         <title>A Floating Mold Technique for the Programmed Assembly of Protocells into Protocellular Materials Capable of Non&#8208;Equilibrium Biochemical Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protocellular materials are constructed using a bottom&#8208;up strategy enabled by simple floating molds. The technique allows the fabrication of free&#8208;standing, macroscopic, and robust materials from protocell building blocks that are stable in water media, are capable of communicating both internally and with the external environment, and display rudimentary forms of emergent behaviors that are generated from the synergistic interaction of their constituent parts.








Abstract
Despite important breakthroughs in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology, a major challenge still remains the construction of free&#8208;standing, macroscopic, and robust materials from protocell building blocks that are stable in water and capable of emergent behaviors. Herein, a new floating mold technique for the fabrication of millimeter&#8208; to centimeter&#8208;sized protocellular materials (PCMs) of any shape that overcomes most of the current challenges in prototissue engineering is reported. Significantly, this technique also allows for the generation of 2D periodic arrays of PCMs that display an emergent non&#8208;equilibrium spatiotemporal sensing behavior. These arrays are capable of collectively translating the information provided by the external environment and are encoded in the form of propagating reaction&#8211;diffusion fronts into a readable dynamic signal output. Overall, the methodology opens up a route to the fabrication of macroscopic and robust tissue&#8208;like materials with emergent behaviors, providing a new paradigm of bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology and biomimetic materials science.

         <title>Biomimetic Hairy Whiskers for Robotic Skin Tactility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;powered biomimetic whisker mechanoreceptor based on the bionics design of animal whiskers and a robotic tactile sensing system is constructed for robots to realize environmental exploration, robotic navigation, prey&#8208;tracking, and danger avoidance with effectively improved device lifetime, sensitivity, stability, and anti&#8208;interference performance compared to traditional electronic skin.








Abstract
Touch sensing is among the most important sensing capabilities of a human, and the same is true for smart robotics. Current research on tactile sensors is mainly concentrated on electronic skin (e&#8208;skin), but e&#8208;skin is prone to be easily dirtied, damaged, and disturbed after repeated usage, which greatly limits its practical applications in robotics. Here, by mimicking the way that animals explore the environment using hair&#8208;based sensors, a bendable biomimetic whisker mechanoreceptor (BWMR) is designed for robotic tactile sensing. Owing to the advantages of triboelectric nanogenerator technology, the BWMR can convert external mechanical stimuli into electrical signals without a power supply, which is conducive to its widespread applications in robots. Because of the leverage effect of the whisker, the BWMR can distinguish an exciting force of 1.129&#160;&#956;N by amplifying external weak signals, which can be further improved by increasing the whisker length. Real&#8208;time sensing is demonstrated using a BWMR, exhibiting its potential for robotic tactile systems.

         <title>Graphene Energy Transfer for Single&#8208;Molecule Biophysics, Biosensing, and Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene is a broadband and unbleachable energy&#8208;transfer acceptor with no need for labeling. To demonstrate the capabilities of graphene&#8208;on&#8208;glass coverslips, a variety of demonstration assays are placed on graphene using DNA origami nanopositioners. The results highlight the potential for single&#8208;molecule biophysics, biosensing, and super&#8208;resolution microscopy.








Abstract
Graphene is considered a game&#8208;changing material, especially for its mechanical and electrical properties. This work exploits that graphene is almost transparent but quenches fluorescence in a range up to &#8776;40 nm. Graphene as a broadband and unbleachable energy&#8208;transfer acceptor without labeling, is used to precisely determine the height of molecules with respect to graphene, to visualize the dynamics of DNA nanostructures, and to determine the orientation of F&#246;rster&#8208;type resonance energy transfer (FRET) pairs. Using DNA origami nanopositioners, biosensing, single&#8208;molecule tracking, and DNA PAINT super&#8208;resolution with &lt;3 nm z&#8208;resolution are demonstrated. The range of examples shows the potential of graphene&#8208;on&#8208;glass coverslips as a versatile platform for single&#8208;molecule biophysics, biosensing, and super&#8208;resolution microscopy.

         <title>Observing and Modeling the Sequential Pairwise Reactions that Drive Solid&#8208;State Ceramic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicomponent ceramics are often synthesized in a &#8220;black&#8208;box&#8221; reactor, with little understanding of how multiple precursors evolve into a target material. Ab initio modeling and in situ observations are used to interrogate the phase evolution of YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO), highlighting the critical role of precursor selection in designing kinetically favorable synthesis pathways.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state synthesis from powder precursors is the primary processing route to advanced multicomponent ceramic materials. Designing reaction conditions and precursors for ceramic synthesis can be a laborious, trial&#8208;and&#8208;error process, as heterogeneous mixtures of precursors often evolve through a complicated series of reaction intermediates. Here, ab initio thermodynamics is used to model which pair of precursors has the most reactive interface, enabling the understanding and anticipation of which non&#8208;equilibrium intermediates form in the early stages of a solid&#8208;state reaction. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and in situ electron microscopy are then used to observe how these initial intermediates influence phase evolution in the synthesis of the classic high&#8208;temperature superconductor YBa2Cu3O6+x&#160;(YBCO). The model developed herein rationalizes how the replacement of the traditional BaCO3 precursor with BaO2 redirects phase evolution through a low&#8208;temperature eutectic melt, facilitating the formation of YBCO in 30 min instead of 12+ h. Precursor selection plays an important role in tuning the thermodynamics of interfacial reactions and emerges as an important design parameter in planning kinetically favorable synthesis pathways to complex ceramic materials.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared light excitation of individual polymeric capsules with integrated plasmonic nanoparticles enables release of Ca2+. The small amount of released Ca2+ from lysosomes rapidly triggers robust Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to a propagating intra&#8208; and intercellular calcium waves, as described by Wolfgang J. Parak and co&#8208;workers in article number 2008261.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spherical iron oxide nanoparticles in dispersion are controlled by external magnetic fields to form flexible and reversible chains for biomedical applications. In article number 2008683, Mikhail Feygenson and co&#8208;workers combine the advanced scattering methods and reverse Monte Carlo simulations to directly visualize the chain formation in real space. This methodology paves the way for exploring novel assemblies of particles with a complex morphology in various liquid carriers.

         <dc:description>
The fabrication of tissue&#8208;like materials capable of emergent bioinspired behaviors represents an emerging challenge of bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology and biomimetic materials science. In article number 2100340, Pierangelo Gobbo and co&#8208;workers report a new technique for the assembly of tissue&#8208;like materials from protocell building blocks. The resulting &#8220;protocellular materials&#8221; are free&#8208;standing, robust, and can be chemically programmed to display an emergent non&#8208;equilibrium spatiotemporal sensing behavior.

         <title>Polarons and Charge Localization in Metal&#8208;Halide Semiconductors for Photovoltaic and Light&#8208;Emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of charge&#8211;lattice interactions in metal&#8208;halide semiconductors of different crystal structures and chemical compositions is examined. Large polaron formation in metal&#8208;halide perovskites enables excellent optoelectronic properties, underpinning applications in solar cells. In other metal&#8208;halide materials, including double perovskites, nanostructured and corner&#8208;sharing materials, the strength of polaronic effects is less certain, with further scope for investigations being identified.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;halide semiconductors have shown excellent performance in optoelectronic applications such as solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and detectors. In this review the role of charge&#8211;lattice interactions and polaron formation in a wide range of these promising materials, including perovskites, double perovskites, Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper layered perovskites, nanocrystals, vacancy&#8208;ordered, and other novel structures, is summarized. The formation of Fr&#246;hlich&#8208;type &#8220;large&#8221; polarons in archetypal bulk metal&#8208;halide ABX3 perovskites and its dependence on A&#8208;cation, B&#8208;metal, and X&#8208;halide composition, which is now relatively well understood, are discussed. It is found that, for nanostructured and novel metal&#8208;halide materials, a larger variation in the strengths of polaronic effects is reported across the literature, potentially deriving from variations in potential barriers and the presence of interfaces at which lattice relaxation may be enhanced. Such findings are further discussed in the context of different experimental approaches used to explore polaronic effects, cautioning that firm conclusions are often hampered by the presence of alternate processes and interactions giving rise to similar experimental signatures. Overall, a complete understanding of polaronic effects will prove essential given their direct influence on optoelectronic properties such as charge&#8208;carrier mobilities and emission spectra, which are critical to the performance of energy and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Crossover Molecules on Surfaces: From Isolated Molecules to Ultrathin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;crossover molecules (SCMs) are one of the most promising candidates for molecular spintronics applications due to their ability to exist in two spin states that can be reversibly switched by light and voltage, among others. Investigations of SCMs on surfaces are summarized, highlighting the achievements and challenges, as well as laying out the future prospects.








Abstract
Molecular spintronics seeks to use single or few molecules as functional building blocks for spintronic applications, directly relying on molecular properties or properties of interfaces between molecules and inorganic electrodes. Spin&#8208;crossover molecules (SCMs) are one of the most promising classes of candidates for molecular spintronics due to their bistability deriving from the existence of two spin states that can be reversibly switched by temperature, light, electric fields, etc. Building devices based on single or few molecules would entail connecting the molecule(s) with solid surfaces and understanding the fundamental behavior of the resulting assemblies. Herein, the investigations of SCMs on solid surfaces, ranging from isolated single molecules (submonolayers) to ultrathin films (mainly in the sub&#8208;10 nm range) are summarized. The achievements, challenges and prospects in this field are highlighted.

         <title>Multifaceted Design and Emerging Applications of Tissue Adhesives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transformative advances are made in the field of tissue adhesives, fueled by the synergy between disciplines ranging from mechanics and chemistry to biology. A multifaceted design of tissue adhesives is presented with examples in emerging applications. Immediate opportunities and future directions are highlighted for next&#8208;generation tissue adhesives, which would make broad impact in engineering and medicine.








Abstract
Tissue adhesives can form appreciable adhesion with tissues and have found clinical use in a variety of medical settings such as wound closure, surgical sealants, regenerative medicine, and device attachment. The advantages of tissue adhesives include ease of implementation, rapid application, mitigation of tissue damage, and compatibility with minimally invasive procedures. The field of tissue adhesives is rapidly evolving, leading to tissue adhesives with superior mechanical properties and advanced functionality. Such adhesives enable new applications ranging from mobile health to cancer treatment. To provide guidelines for the rational design of tissue adhesives, here, existing strategies for tissue adhesives are synthesized into a multifaceted design, which comprises three design elements: the tissue, the adhesive surface, and the adhesive matrix. The mechanical, chemical, and biological considerations associated with each design element are reviewed. Throughout the report, the limitations of existing tissue adhesives and immediate opportunities for improvement are discussed. The recent progress of tissue adhesives in topical and implantable applications is highlighted, and then future directions toward next&#8208;generation tissue adhesives are outlined. The development of tissue adhesives will fuse disciplines and make broad impacts in engineering and medicine.

         <title>Molecular Imprinting: Green Perspectives and Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to increasing concerns about the detrimental impacts of unsustainable molecular imprinting technology (MIT), MIT has veered toward greener pathways. Fourteen green principles specifically for MIT are codified using a nomenclature of &#8220;GREENIFICATION.&#8221; All aspects of greenificated MITs, including fundamentals, strategies, and future perspectives, are comprehensively reviewed. Moreover, a roadmap of greenificated MIT from 2012 to 2030 is proposed.








Abstract
Advances in revolutionary technologies pose new challenges for human life; in response to them, global responsibility is pushing modern technologies toward greener pathways. Molecular imprinting technology (MIT) is a multidisciplinary mimic technology simulating the specific binding principle of enzymes to substrates or antigens to antibodies; along with its rapid progress and wide applications, MIT faces the challenge of complying with green sustainable development requirements. With the identification of environmental risks associated with unsustainable MIT, a new aspect of MIT, termed green MIT, has emerged and developed. However, so far, no clear definition has been provided to appraise green MIT. Herein, the implementation process of green chemistry in MIT is demonstrated and a mnemonic device in the form of an acronym, GREENIFICATION, is proposed to present the green MIT principles. The entire greenificated imprinting process is surveyed, including element choice, polymerization implementation, energy input, imprinting strategies, waste treatment, and recovery, as well as the impacts of these processes on operator health and the environment. Moreover, assistance of upgraded instrumentation in deploying greener goals is considered. Finally, future perspectives are presented to provide a more complete picture of the greenificated MIT road map and to pave the way for further development.

         <title>Innovations in Disease State Responsive Soft Materials for Targeting Extracellular Stimuli Associated with Cancer, Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over the past decade, the field of programmable soft materials for biomedical applications has rapidly expanded. Herein, recent advances that show promising results in preclinical animal models are described for the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Efforts have focused on materials capable of sensing disease&#8208;associated endogenous stimuli and responding via a range of dynamic processes.








Abstract
Recent advances in polymer chemistry, materials sciences, and biotechnology have allowed the preclinical development of sophisticated programmable nanomedicines and materials that are able to precisely respond to specific disease&#8208;associated triggers and microenvironments. These stimuli, endogenous to the targeted diseases, include pH, redox&#8208;state, small molecules, and protein upregulation. Herein, recent advances and innovative approaches in programmable soft materials capable of sensing the aforementioned disease&#8208;associated stimuli and responding via a range of dynamic processes including morphological and size transitions, changes in mobility and retention, as well as disassembly are described. In this field generally, the majority of ongoing and past research effort has focused on oncology. Given this interest, examples of the latest innovative approaches to chemo&#8208; and immunotherapy treatment strategies for cancer are presented. Moreover, as the field broadens its attention, applications of programmable materials in other diseases are highlighted, with a special focus on cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus, where limited attention is paid by the field, but where many promising avenues exist with high potential impact.

         <title>Multimodal Digital X&#8208;ray Scanners with Synchronous Mapping of Tactile Pressure Distributions using Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the multimodal integration of perovskite&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detectors and pressure&#8208;sensitive air&#8208;dielectric transistors, synchronous mapping of internal structures and morphologies of the object is realized. This work provides the simultaneous imaging of anatomical structures and the pressure distribution using the multiplexed platform, thereby indicating the substantial potential of the system for next&#8208;generation, non&#8208;destructive inspection and medical diagnosis.








Abstract
Visual and tactile information are the key intuitive perceptions in sensory systems, and the synchronized detection of these two sensory modalities can enhance accuracy of object recognition by providing complementary information between them. Herein, multimodal integration of flexible, high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray detectors with a synchronous mapping of tactile pressure distributions for visualizing internal structures and morphologies of an object simultaneously is reported. As a visual&#8208;inspection method, perovskite materials that convert X&#8208;rays into charge carriers directly are synthesized. By incorporating pressure&#8208;sensitive air&#8208;dielectric transistors in the perovskite components, X&#8208;ray detectors with dual modalities (i.e., vision and touch) are attained as an active&#8208;matrix platform for digital visuotactile examinations. Also, in vivo X&#8208;ray imaging and pressure sensing are demonstrated using a live rat. This multiplexed platform has high spatial resolution and good flexibility, thereby providing highly accurate inspection and diagnoses even for the distorted images of nonplanar objects.

         <title>Recent Progress on Perovskite Surfaces and Interfaces in Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports recent progress on perovskite surface and interface science of perovskite optoelectronic devices. The impact of various surface and interface defects on heterojunction energy barriers and carrier dynamics in devices is reviewed and discussed. Practical engineering methods to mitigate these defects at various interfaces in devices are summarized as well.








Abstract
Surfaces and heterojunction interfaces, where defects and energy levels dictate charge&#8208;carrier dynamics in optoelectronic devices, are critical for unlocking the full potential of perovskite semiconductors. In this progress report, chemical structures of perovskite surfaces are discussed and basic physical rules for the band alignment are summarized at various perovskite interfaces. Common perovskite surfaces are typically decorated by various compositional and structural defects such as residual surface reactants, discrete nanoclusters, reactions by products, vacancies, interstitials, antisites, etc. Some of these surface species induce deep&#8208;level defect states in the forbidden band forming very harmful charge&#8208;carrier traps and affect negatively the interface band alignments for achieving optimal device performance. Herein, an overview of research progresses on surface and interface engineering is provided to minimize deep&#8208;level defect states. The reviewed subjects include selection of interface and substrate buffer layers for growing better crystals, materials and processing methods for surface passivation, the surface catalyst for microstructure transformations, organic semiconductors for charge extraction or injection, heterojunctions with wide bandgap perovskites or nanocrystals for mitigating defects, and electrode interlayer for preventing interdiffusion and reactions. These surface and interface engineering strategies are shown to be critical in boosting device performance for both solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>A Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Nanocomposite for Hydrogen Sulfide Gas and Trimodal&#8208;Enhanced Enzyme Dynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designed nanocomposite based on tetra&#8208;sulfide&#8208;bond&#8208;incorporated dendritic mesoporous organosilica as an effective cornerstone to load with chloroperoxidase (CPO) and sodium hyaluronate modified calcium peroxide nanoparticles (CaO2&#8208;HA NPs) can release Ca2+, hydrogen peroxide, and CPO rapidly in tumor microenvironment and generate hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Therefore, H2S gas, tri&#8208;enhanced enzyme dynamic therapy, and Ca2+&#8208;interference combined tumor therapy strategy has been established.








Abstract
Recently, enzyme dynamic therapy (EDT) has drawn much attention as a new type of dynamic therapy. However, the selection of suitable nanocarriers to deliver chloroperoxidase (CPO) and enhancement of the level of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are critical factors for improving the efficiency of EDT. In this study, a rapidly decomposing nanocomposite is designed using tetra&#8208;sulfide&#8208;bond&#8208;incorporating dendritic mesoporous organosilica (DMOS) as a nanocarrier, followed by loading CPO and sodium&#8208;hyaluronate&#8208;modified calcium peroxide nanoparticles (CaO2&#8208;HA NPs). The nanocomposite can effectively generate singlet oxygen (1O2) for tumor therapy without any exogenous stimulus via trimodal&#8208;enhanced EDT, including DMOS&#8208;induced depletion of glutathione (GSH), H2O2 compensation from CaO2&#8208;HA NPs in mildly acidic TME, and oxidative stress caused by overloading of Ca2+. As tetra&#8208;sulfide bonds are sensitive to GSH, DMOS can generate hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas as a new kind of H2S gas nanoreactor. Additionally, the overloading of Ca2+ can cause tumor calcification to accelerate in vivo tumor necrosis and promote computed tomography imaging efficacy. Therefore, a novel H2S gas, EDT, and Ca2+&#8208;interference combined therapy strategy is developed.

         <title>Organic Non&#8208;Wettable Superhydrophobic Fullerite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solubility and wettability of solids signify their interaction with liquids. The findings on fullerites&#8212;the only soluble form of pure carbon&#8212;are presented. It is demonstrated that solution&#8208;cast fullerite films developed from colloidal gels generate a non&#8208;wettable superhydrophobic surface. They can be used directly in a plethora of practical applications requiring ultra&#8208;hydrophobicity and underwater photochemical applications.








Abstract
A long&#8208;standing quest in material science has been the development of non&#8208;wettable superhydrophobic films based on a single organic material, without the requirement of fluorination or silane treatment. Here, such films and coatings, which are developed using colloidal gels of fullerite C60 and C70 nanocrystals, are described. It is illustrated that despite the high surface energy of these van der Waals molecular crystals their gelation can create films having self&#8208;affine fractal surfaces with multiscale roughness. Water droplets on resulting surfaces of fullerite films bead like a pearl resting in a Fakir state with contact angle exceeding 150&#176;. The films are extremely water repellent and non&#8208;wettable; when submerged in water they stay dry up to 3 h even at a water depth of two feet and exhibit the plastron effect. A series of experiments are presented to provide comprehensive inspection of water droplet dynamics on these films. These include rolling, bouncing, squeezing, freezing, melting, evaporating; along with acidic and alkaline tests. Non&#8208;wettable films of such materials are unique as fullerites get photosensitized instantaneously generating extremely high yields (&#8776;100%) of singlet oxygen (1O2) that can destroy viruses and bacteria; thereby enabling their use in rheology, water purification, and medicinal devices.

         <title>3D Heterogeneous Device Arrays for Multiplexed Sensing Platforms Using Transfer of Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using a removable polymer film, transfer of perovskite arrays to planar or nonplanar surfaces is realized. The total thickness of the fabricated perovskite device is thin enough to form conformal contact on various surfaces with 3D geometries. This work provides the integration of perovskites on contact lenses and pressure sensors, achieving multiplexed sensing platforms for future electronics.








Abstract
Despite recent substantial advances in perovskite materials, their 3D integration capability for next&#8208;generation electronic devices is limited owing to their inherent vulnerability to heat and moisture with degradation of their remarkable optoelectronic properties during fabrication processing. Herein, a facile method to transfer the patterns of perovskites to planar or nonplanar surfaces using a removable polymer is reported. After fabricating perovskite devices on this removable polymer film, the conformal attachment of this film on target surfaces can place the entire devices on various substrates by removing this sacrificial film. This transfer method enables the formation of a perovskite image sensor array on a soft contact lens, and in vivo tests using rabbits demonstrate its wearability. Furthermore, 3D heterogeneous integration of a perovskite photodetector array with an active&#8208;matrix array of pressure&#8208;sensitive silicon transistors using this transfer method demonstrates the formation of a multiplexed sensing platform detecting distributions of light and tactile pressure simultaneously.

         <title>Band Engineering of Dirac Semimetals Using Charge Density Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge density wave (CDW) is proposed as a tool to engineer an idealized Dirac semimetal. The CDW gaps all bands at the Fermi level except the Dirac cone, which is protected by non&#8208;symmorphic symmetry. Antiferromagnetic compounds of GdSbxTe2&#8722;x&#8722;&#948; are designed and synthesized to test this proposed mechanism. Unusual transport behavior is discovered and points to a new regime.








Abstract
New developments in the field of topological matter are often driven by materials discovery, including novel topological insulators, Dirac semimetals, and Weyl semimetals. In the last few years, large efforts have been made to classify all known inorganic materials with respect to their topology. Unfortunately, a large number of topological materials suffer from non&#8208;ideal band structures. For example, topological bands are frequently convoluted with trivial ones, and band structure features of interest can appear far below the Fermi level. This leaves just a handful of materials that are intensively studied. Finding strategies to design new topological materials is a solution. Here, a new mechanism is introduced, which is based on charge density waves and non&#8208;symmorphic symmetry, to design an idealized Dirac semimetal. It is&#160;then shown experimentally that the antiferromagnetic compound GdSb0.46Te1.48 is a nearly ideal Dirac semimetal based on the proposed mechanism, meaning that most interfering bands at the Fermi level are suppressed. Its highly unusual transport behavior points to a thus far unknown regime, in which Dirac carriers with Fermi energy very close to the node seem to gradually localize in the presence of lattice and magnetic&#160;disorder.

         <title>Design and Mechanism of a Self&#8208;Powered and Disintegration&#8211;Reorganization&#8211;Regeneration Power Supply with Cold Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imitating the regeneration of the planarian, a self&#8208;powered and disintegration&#8211;reorganization&#8211;regeneration power supply with relatively stable discharge for 8.3 h is realized. Additionally, the mechanism is investigated systematically by molecular dynamics simulation, and this power supply with a variety of self&#8208;powered and disintegration&#8211;reorganization&#8211;regeneration units can discharge continuously at freezing temperature and variable temperature (0&#8211;25 &#176;C).








Abstract
Up to now, power supplies designed based on the electrochemical reaction principle have had&#160;unavoidable defects, in that a complete redox reaction must be formed inside the power supply to operate normally, which makes it unable to be reconstructed and regenerated. Hence, the design and interpretation of this self&#8208;powered and disintegration&#8211;reorganization&#8211;regeneration power supply are generally considered to be almost insurmountable obstacles to haunt both experimenters and theorists. Herein, a self&#8208;powered and disintegration&#8211;reorganization&#8211;regeneration power supply with relatively stable discharge for 8.3 h is realized by the principle of ion&#8208;selective diffusion, which regenerates by radical polymerization. Additionally, the mechanism is investigated systematically by molecular dynamics simulation, and this power supply with a variety of self&#8208;powered and disintegration&#8211;reorganization&#8211;regeneration units can discharge continuously at freezing temperatures and variable temperature (0&#8211;25 &#176;C). As a hypothetical model, a self&#8208;powered and deformable arch bridge with disintegration and reorganization is fabricated. In the future, this power supply is expected to be applied in prosthetic limbs, bionic skins, implantable power supplies, mobile phones, portable computers, wearable devices, etc. Moreover, with the improvement of the stability and discharge life, it could promote major revolutionary breakthroughs in the fields of intelligent industrial automation, smart buildings, intelligent transportation systems, intelligent power systems, etc.

         <title>Functional Micro&#8208;/Nanomaterials for Multiplexed Biodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiplexed detection has gradually occupied the main development trend in the field of biodetection due to its rich information, accurate results, and high efficiency. The challenges of multiplexed detection in three aspects of coding library, detection performance, and workflow are analyzed, and the strategies are provided from the perspective of functional micro&#8208;/nanomaterials.








Abstract
When analyzing biological phenomena and processes, multiplexed biodetection has many advantages over single&#8208;factor biodetection and is highly relevant to both human health issues and advancements in the life sciences. However, many key problems with current multiplexed biodetection strategies remain unresolved. Herein, the main issues are analyzed and summarized: 1)&#160;generating sufficient signal to label targets, 2) improving the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio to ensure total detection sensitivity, and 3) simplifying the detection process to reduce the time and labor costs of multiple target detection. Then, available solutions made possible by designing and controlling the properties of micro&#8208; and nanomaterials are introduced. The aim is to emphasize the role that micro&#8208;/nanomaterials can play in the improvement of multiplexed biodetection strategies. Through analyzing existing problems, introducing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments regarding relevant materials, and discussing future directions of the field, it is hopeful to help promote necessary developments in multiplexed biodetection and associated scientific research.

         <title>All&#8208;In&#8208;One Dendrimer&#8208;Based Lipid Nanoparticles Enable Precise HDR&#8208;Mediated Gene Editing In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;viral, lipid nanoparticle (dLNP) delivery platform capable of co&#8208;encapsulating and delivering Cas9 mRNA, sgRNA, and an ssDNA template is developed for homology&#8208;directed repair (HDR)&#8208;mediated gene correction of DNA mutations in vivo. Relative ratios of lipids and nucleic acids are systematically optimized to induce high HDR efficiency, thereby guiding potential treatment opportunities for correction of mutations that cause disease.








Abstract
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR&#8208;associated (Cas) protein gene editing is poised to transform the treatment of genetic diseases. However, limited progress has been made toward precise editing of DNA via homology&#8208;directed repair (HDR) that requires careful orchestration of complex steps. Herein, dendrimer&#8208;based lipid nanoparticles (dLNPs) are engineered to co&#8208;encapsulate and deliver multiple components for in vivo HDR correction. BFP/GFP switchable HEK293 cells with a single Y66H amino acid mutation are employed to assess HDR&#8208;mediated gene editing following simultaneous, one&#8208;pot delivery of Cas9 mRNA, single&#8208;guide RNA, and donor DNA. Molar ratios of individual LNP components and weight ratios of the three nucleic acids are systematically optimized to increase HDR efficiency. Using flow cytometry, fluorescence imaging, and DNA sequencing to quantify editing, optimized 4A3&#8208;SC8 dLNPs edit &gt;91%&#160;of all cells with 56% HDR efficiency in vitro and &gt;20%&#160;HDR efficiency in xenograft tumors in vivo. Due to the all&#8208;in&#8208;one simplicity and high efficacy, the developed dLNPs offer a promising route toward the gene correction of disease&#8208;causing mutations.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive AIEgens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AIE luminogens are one of the optimal choices for smart luminescent materials to be applied in real life and they have sparked much of the current interest in the smart materials area. Therefore, a myriad of AIE materials with diverse stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have been developed in recent years, and they exhibit broad application prospects.








Abstract
The unique advantages and the exciting application prospects of AIEgens have triggered booming developments in this area in recent years. Among them, stimuli&#8208;responsive AIEgens have received particular attention and impressive progress, and they have been demonstrated to show tremendous potential in many fields from physical chemistry to materials science and to biology and medicine. Here, the recent achievements of stimuli&#8208;responsive AIEgens in terms of seven most representative types of stimuli including force, light, polarity, temperature, electricity, ion, and pH, are summarized. Based on typical examples, it is illustrated how each type of systems realize the desired stimuli&#8208;responsive performance for various applications. The key work principles behind them are ultimately deciphered and figured out to offer new insights and guidelines for the design and engineering of the next&#8208;generation stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent materials for more broad applications.

         <title>Customized Photothermal Therapy of Subcutaneous Orthotopic Cancer by Multichannel Luminescent Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to establish customized therapeutic prescriptions for photothermal ablation to orthotopic breast tumors. By utilizing a multichannel lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoprobe, the parameters indicating individual intratumoral differences are analyzed through fluorescence imaging for constructing a 2D diagram of model prescriptions as the reference of actual treatments.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a potentially advanced strategy for highly precise cancer treatment. Tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;activatable agents provide useful tools for PTT, but their photothermal conversion capacities vary and cannot be evaluated in vivo; thus, a general PTT prescription does not work with individual activatable agents. Here, glutathione (GSH)&#8208;activatable nanocomposites, silicomolybdate&#8208;functionalized NaLuF4:Yb,Er@NaLuF4@NaLuF4:Nd are prepared, for customized PTT of subcutaneous orthotopic cancer. By simultaneously determining intratumoral GSH concentration and the amount of accumulated agent using multiple orthogonal luminescent emissions of nanocomposites, near&#8208;infrared absorbance of photothermal conversion agents is evaluated in vivo, based on the optimized irradiating prescriptions (irradiating power density and time) established. This allows customized PTT of each individual case with high efficacy and viability. This work also includes a method for investigating individual intratumoral variation, and the development of the next generation of customized nanomedicine for efficacious PTT of subcutaneous orthotopic cancer.

         <title>Curvature Induced by Deflection in Thick Meta&#8208;Plates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of advanced functional devices often requires intrinsically curved geometries that belong to the realm of non&#8208;Euclidean geometry. Here, thick meta&#8208;plates based on hexagonal cellular mesostructures are used to achieve a wide range of intrinsic (i.e., Gaussian) curvatures. A scaling relationship is presented to predict the deformation&#8208;induced curvature of thick plates and their micro&#8208;architectural design variables.








Abstract
The design of advanced functional devices often requires the use of intrinsically curved geometries that belong to the realm of non&#8208;Euclidean geometry and remain a challenge for traditional engineering approaches. Here, it is shown how the simple deflection of thick meta&#8208;plates based on hexagonal cellular mesostructures can be used to achieve a wide range of intrinsic (i.e., Gaussian) curvatures, including dome&#8208;like and saddle&#8208;like shapes. Depending on the unit cell structure, non&#8208;auxetic (i.e., positive Poisson ratio) or auxetic (i.e., negative Poisson ratio) plates can be obtained, leading to a negative or positive value of the Gaussian curvature upon bending, respectively. It is found that bending such meta&#8208;plates along their longitudinal direction induces a curvature along their transverse direction. Experimentally and numerically, it is shown how the amplitude of this induced curvature is related to the longitudinal bending and the geometry of the meta&#8208;plate. The approach proposed here constitutes a general route for the rational design of advanced functional devices with intrinsically curved geometries. To demonstrate the merits of this approach, a scaling relationship is presented, and its validity is demonstrated by applying it to 3D&#8208;printed microscale meta&#8208;plates. Several applications for adaptive optical devices with adjustable focal length and soft wearable robotics are presented.

         <title>Cell/Bacteria&#8208;Based Bioactive Materials for Cancer Immune Modulation and Precision Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell/bacteria&#8208;based bioactive materials are summarized in terms of their structural components, engineered strategies, bioproperties, and functions. An overview of the biomedical applications of bioactive materials in tumor targeting delivery, immune modulation, and precise therapy is given, along with a series of successful case studies on tiny robots derived from cell/bacteria materials.








Abstract
Numerous clinical trials for cancer precision medicine research are limited due to the drug resistance, side effects, and low efficacy. Unsatisfactory outcomes are often caused by complex physiologic barriers and abnormal immune events in tumors, such as tumor target alterations and immunosuppression. Cell/bacteria&#8208;derived materials with unique bioactive properties have emerged as attractive tools for personalized therapy in cancer. Naturally derived bioactive materials, such as cell and bacterial therapeutic agents with native tropism or good biocompatibility, can precisely target tumors and effectively modulate immune microenvironments to inhibit tumors. Here, the recent advances in the development of cell/bacteria&#8208;based bioactive materials for immune modulation and&#160;precision therapy in cancer are summarized. Cell/bacterial constituents, including cell membranes, bacterial vesicles, and other active substances have inherited their unique targeting properties and antitumor capabilities. Strategies for engineering living cell/bacteria to overcome complex biological barriers and immunosuppression to promote antitumor efficacy are also summarized. Moreover, past and ongoing trials involving personalized bioactive materials and promising agents such as cell/bacteria&#8208;based micro/nano&#8208;biorobotics are further discussed, which may become another powerful tool for treatment in the near future.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag2S quantum dots (QDs) are an emerging class of near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIR) QDs with excellent NIR fluorescence properties and biocompatibility. This review presents the various methods to synthesize NIR Ag2S QDs and focuses on their bioapplications in biosensing, bioimaging, and theranostics. Major challenges and future perspectives with respect to the synthesis and bioapplications of NIR Ag2S QDs are discussed.








Abstract
Quantum dots (QDs) with near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIR) are an emerging class of QDs with unique capabilities owing to the deeper tissue penetrability of NIR light compared with visible light. NIR light also effectively overcomes organism autofluorescence, making NIR QDs particularly attractive in biological imaging applications for disease diagnosis. Considering latest developments, Ag2S QDs are a rising star among NIR QDs due to their excellent NIR fluorescence properties and biocompatibility. This review presents the various methods to synthesize NIR Ag2S QDs, and systematically discusses their applications in biosensing, bioimaging, and theranostics. Major challenges and future perspectives concerning the synthesis and bioapplications of NIR Ag2S QDs are discussed.

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Water&#8208;Splitting Using CuO&#8208;Based Electrodes for Hydrogen Production: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoelectrochemical water&#8208;splitting method using CuO&#8208;based materials as high&#8208;efficiency photoelectrodes has potential to solve the global energy and environmental problems simultaneously. The usage of appropriate synthesis methods, modifying the CuO crystal structure and creating suitable conditions to increase the specific surface area can dramatically separate the electron&#8211;hole pairs and improve the photocurrent density of photoelectrodes.








Abstract
The cost&#8208;effective, robust, and efficient electrocatalysts for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water&#8208;splitting has been extensively studied over the past decade to address a solution for the energy crisis. The interesting physicochemical properties of CuO have introduced this promising photocathodic material among the few photocatalysts with a narrow bandgap. This photocatalyst has a high activity for the PEC hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under simulated sunlight irradiation. Here, the recent advancements of CuO&#8208;based photoelectrodes, including undoped CuO, doped CuO, and CuO composites, in the PEC water&#8208;splitting field, are comprehensively studied. Moreover, the synthesis methods, characterization, and fundamental factors of each classification are discussed in detail. Apart from the exclusive characteristics of CuO&#8208;based photoelectrodes, the PEC properties of CuO/2D materials, as groups of the growing nanocomposites in photocurrent&#8208;generating devices, are discussed in separate sections. Regarding the particular attention paid to the CuO heterostructure photocathodes, the PEC water splitting application is reviewed and the properties of each group such as electronic structures, defects, bandgap, and hierarchical structures are critically assessed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in metal&#8208;sulfide&#8208;based photocatalytic valorization of lignocellulose are reviewed. Structures, roles, and functioning mechanisms of metal sulfides in biomass conversions are carefully analyzed. The unique properties of metal sulfides in catalyzing C&#63743;O&#8208;bond cleavage, selective oxidation, C&#63743;C coupling, and C&#63743;H activation under light irradiation are highlighted and discussed to inspire future breakthroughs.








Abstract
Transition metal sulfides are an extraordinarily vital class of semiconductors with a wide range of applications in the photocatalytic field. A great number of recent advances in photocatalytic transformations of lignocellulosic biomass, the largest renewable carbon resource, into high&#8208;quality fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals has been achieved over metal sulfide semiconductors. Herein, the progress and breakthroughs in metal&#8208;sulfide&#8208;based photocatalytic systems for lignocellulose valorization with an emphasis on selective depolymerization of lignin and oxidative coupling of some important bioplatforms are highligted. The key issues that control reaction pathways and mechanisms are carefully examined. The functions of metal sulfides in the elementary reactions, including C&#63743;O&#8208;bond cleavage, selective oxidations, C&#63743;C coupling, and C&#63743;H activation, are discussed to offer insights to guide the rational design of active and selective photocatalysts for sustainable chemistry. The prospects of sulfide photocatalysts in biomass valorization are also analyzed and briefly discussed.

         <title>Electroactive Biomaterials and Systems for Cell Fate Determination and Tissue Regeneration: Design and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive understanding of the endogenous bioelectricity and piezoelectricity, as well as recent progress in the study of electroactive biomaterials and systems, and their mediated electrostimulation in tissue regeneration.








Abstract
During natural tissue regeneration, tissue microenvironment and stem cell niche including cell&#8211;cell interaction, soluble factors, and extracellular matrix (ECM) provide a train of biochemical and biophysical cues for modulation of cell behaviors and tissue functions. Design of functional biomaterials to mimic the tissue/cell microenvironment have great potentials for tissue regeneration applications. Recently, electroactive biomaterials have drawn increasing attentions not only as scaffolds for cell adhesion and structural support, but also as modulators to regulate cell/tissue behaviors and function, especially for electrically excitable cells and tissues. More importantly, electrostimulation can further modulate a myriad of biological processes, from cell cycle, migration, proliferation and differentiation to neural conduction, muscle contraction, embryogenesis, and tissue regeneration. In this review, endogenous bioelectricity and piezoelectricity are introduced. Then, design rationale of electroactive biomaterials is discussed for imitating dynamic cell microenvironment, as well as their mediated electrostimulation and the applying pathways. Recent advances in electroactive biomaterials are systematically overviewed for modulation of stem cell fate and tissue regeneration, mainly including nerve regeneration, bone tissue engineering, and cardiac tissue engineering. Finally, the significance for simulating the native tissue microenvironment is emphasized and the open challenges and future perspectives of electroactive biomaterials are concluded.

         <title>In Situ Tumor Vaccination with Nanoparticle Co&#8208;Delivering CpG and STAT3 siRNA to Effectively Induce Whole&#8208;Body Antitumor Immune Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Augmenting immune response and inhibiting suppressive environment of tumors (AIRISE&#8208;02) is a nano&#8208;immunotherapeutic candidate that co&#8208;delivers CpG and STAT3 siRNA to a local tumor, generating anti&#8208;tumor immune response against cancer everywhere in the body (both treated and untreated tumors). Combination of AIRISE&#8208;02 and standard immune checkpoint inhibitors cures 63% of mice with melanoma tumors, while the inhibitors alone cure none.








Abstract
The success of immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in a subset of individuals has been very exciting. However, in many cancers, responses to current ICIs are modest and are seen only in a small subsets of patients. Herein, a widely applicable approach that increases the benefit of ICIs is reported. Intratumoral administration of augmenting immune response and inhibiting suppressive environment of tumors&#8212;AIRISE&#8208;02 nanotherapeutic that co&#8208;delivers CpG and STAT3 siRNA&#8212;results in not only regression of the injected tumor, but also tumors at distant sites in multiple tumor model systems. In particular, three doses of AIRISE&#8208;02 in combination with systemic ICIs completely cure both treated and untreated aggressive melanoma tumors in 63% of mice, while ICIs alone do not cure any mice. A long&#8208;term memory immune effect is also reported. AIRISE&#8208;02 is effective in breast and colon tumor models as well. Lastly, AIRISE&#8208;02 is well tolerated in mice and nonhuman primates. This approach combines multiple therapeutic agents into a single nanoconstruct to create whole&#8208;body immune responses across multiple cancer types. Being a local therapeutic, AIRISE&#8208;02 circumvents regulatory challenges of systemic nanoparticle delivery, facilitating rapid translation to the clinic. AIRISE&#8208;02 is under investigational new drug (IND)&#8208;enabling studies, and clinical trials will soon follow.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrogen economy has emerged as a very promising alternative to the current hydrocarbon economy, which involves the process of harvesting renewable energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen and then further utilization of hydrogen fuel. Alkaline water splitting represents the most mature and economic technology for clean hydrogen production, making high potential for successful implementation of hydrogen economy.








Abstract
Hydrogen economy has emerged as a very promising alternative to the current hydrocarbon economy, which involves the process of harvesting renewable energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen and then further utilization of clean hydrogen fuel. The production of hydrogen by water electrolysis is an essential prerequisite of the hydrogen economy with zero carbon emission. Among various water electrolysis technologies, alkaline water splitting has been commercialized for more than 100 years, representing the most mature and economic technology. Here, the historic development of water electrolysis is overviewed, and several critical electrochemical parameters are discussed. After that, advanced nonprecious metal electrocatalysts that emerged recently for negotiating the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are discussed, including transition metal oxides, (oxy)hydroxides, chalcogenides, phosphides, and nitrides for the OER, as well as transition metal alloys, chalcogenides, phosphides, and carbides for the HER. In this section, particular attention is paid to the catalyst synthesis, activity and stability challenges, performance improvement, and industry&#8208;relevant developments. Some recent works about scaled&#8208;up catalyst synthesis, novel electrode designs, and alkaline seawater electrolysis are also spotlighted. Finally, an outlook on future challenges and opportunities for alkaline water splitting is offered, and potential future directions are speculated.

         <title>Phase Coexistence and Structural Dynamics of Redox Metal Catalysts Revealed by Operando TEM</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical dynamics (characterized by phase co&#8208;existence and oscillatory phase transition) of redox metal catalysts and their relevance to catalytic activity are revealed by operando transmission electron microscopy. This work underlines the importance of chemical dynamics and provides a convenient mechanism for the formation and constant regeneration of transient active sites during catalysis.








Abstract
Metal catalysts play an important role in industrial redox reactions. Although extensively studied, the state of these catalysts under operating conditions is largely unknown, and assignments of active sites remain speculative. Herein, an operando transmission electron microscopy study is presented, which interrelates the structural dynamics of redox metal catalysts to their activity. Using hydrogen oxidation on copper as an elementary redox reaction, it is revealed how the interaction between metal and the surrounding gas phase induces complex structural transformations and drives the system from a thermodynamic equilibrium toward a state controlled by the chemical dynamics. Direct imaging combined with the simultaneous detection of catalytic activity provides unparalleled structure&#8211;activity insights that identify distinct mechanisms for water formation and reveal the means by which the system self&#8208;adjusts to changes of the gas&#8208;phase chemical potential. Density functional theory calculations show that surface phase transitions are driven by chemical dynamics even when the system is far from a thermodynamic phase boundary. In a bottom&#8208;up approach, the dynamic behavior observed here for an elementary reaction is finally extended to more relevant redox reactions and other metal catalysts, which underlines the importance of chemical dynamics for the formation and constant re&#8208;generation of transient active sites during catalysis.

         <title>Nanographene&#8211;Osmapentalyne Complexes as a Cathode Interlayer in Organic Solar Cells Enhance Efficiency over 18%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Newly synthesized hexabenzocoronene (HBC)&#8211;osmapentalyne complexes that combine fragments of graphene and metalla&#8208;aromatics are emerging as cathode interlayer materials. Further extending the d&#960;&#8211;p&#960; conjugated systems of osmapentalynes, the most successful complex, in this work, HBC&#8208;S is found to boost the efficiency of non&#8208;fullerene solar cells to over 18%.








Abstract
Interface engineering is a critical method by which to efficiently enhance the photovoltaic performance of nonfullerene solar cells (NFSC). Herein, a series of metal&#8211;nanographene&#8208;containing large transition metal involving d&#960;&#8211;p&#960; conjugated systems by way of the addition reactions of osmapentalynes and p&#8208;diethynyl&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes is reported. Conjugated extensions are engineered to optimize the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of these metal&#8211;nanographene molecules, which serve as alcohol&#8208;soluble cathode interlayer (CIL) materials. Upon extension of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based NFSCs increases from 16% to over 18%, giving the highest recorded PCE. It is deduced by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, interfacial contact methods, morphology characterization, and carrier dynamics that modification of hexabenzocoronenes&#8208;styryl can effectively improve the short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor of organic solar cells (OSCs), mainly due to the strong and ordered charge transfer, more matching energy level alignments, better interfacial contacts between the active layer and the electrodes, and regulated morphology. Consequently, the carrier transport is largely facilitated, and the carrier recombination is simultaneously impeded. These new CIL materials are broadly able to enhance the photovoltaic properties of OSCs in other systems, which provides a promising potential to serve as CILs for higher&#8208;quality OSCs.

         <title>Poly(ionic liquid)s Containing Alkoxy Chains and Bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide Anions as Highly Adhesive Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel, non&#8208;catechol, and efficient poly(ionic liquid)s adhesives are obtained by appending alkoxy chains onto the cationic backbone. These poly(ionic liquid)s exhibit tough and long&#8208;term adhesion toward various substrates and can be further designed as photosensitive or electronically conductive materials when combined with carbon nanotubes or silver nanofibers. Particularly, the adhesive strength can be improved by 35% when applying an electric field.








Abstract
Adhesive materials have wide applications in diverse fields, but the development of a novel and multipurpose adhesive is a great challenge. This study demonstrates that conventional poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) can be designed as highly efficient adhesives by simply introducing alkoxy moieties into the cationic backbone of PILs containing bis(trifluoromethanesulfonimide) (TFSI&#8722;) anions. The incorporated flexible alkoxy chain not only reduces the glass transition temperature of PILs but also endows these materials with strong hydrogen bonding interactions, which, together with the unique electrostatic interaction of the PILs, simultaneously contributes to a high cohesive energy and interfacial adhesive energy. Consequently, these alkoxy PILs are highly adhesive on various substrates such as glass, ceramic, stainless steel, aluminum, and polymers, in contrast to the nonadhesive behavior of conventional PILs. Photosensitive or electronically conductive composite adhesives are fabricated by virtue of the compatibility between ionic liquids and carbon nanotubes or silver nanofibers. Interestingly, the PIL&#8208;2&#8208;TFSI adhesive possesses a unique and reversible response to electric fields and achieves up to 35% improvement in adhesive strength.

         <title>Infrared&#8208;Emitting Multimodal Nanostructures for Controlled In Vivo Magnetic Hyperthermia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron oxide and silver sulfide nanoparticles are combined in optomagnetic nanocapsules, which can act as multimodal contrast agents for several imaging modalities (fluorescence imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, optical tomography, and photoacoustic imaging). More importantly, these nanocapsules enable real&#8208;time subcutaneous thermal monitoring of magnetic hyperthermia processes, paving the way to fully controlled magnetic therapies.








Abstract
Deliberate and local increase of the temperature within solid tumors represents an effective therapeutic approach. Thermal therapies embrace this concept leveraging the capability of some species to convert the absorbed energy into heat. To that end, magnetic hyperthermia (MHT) uses magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) that can effectively dissipate the energy absorbed under alternating magnetic fields. However, MNPs fail to provide real&#8208;time thermal feedback with the risk of unwanted overheating and impeding on&#8208;the&#8208;fly adjustment of the therapeutic parameters. Localization of MNPs within a tissue in an accurate, rapid, and cost&#8208;effective way represents another challenge for increasing the efficacy of MHT. In this work, MNPs are combined with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art infrared luminescent nanothermometers (LNTh; Ag2S nanoparticles) in a nanocapsule that simultaneously overcomes these limitations. The novel optomagnetic nanocapsule acts as multimodal contrast agents for different imaging techniques (magnetic resonance, photoacoustic and near&#8208;infrared fluorescence imaging, optical and X&#8208;ray computed tomography). Most crucially, these nanocapsules provide accurate (0.2&#160;&#176;C resolution) and real&#8208;time subcutaneous thermal feedback during in vivo MHT, also enabling the attainment of thermal maps of the area of interest. These findings are a milestone on the road toward controlled magnetothermal therapies with minimal side effects.

         <title>3D Anisotropic Au@Pt&#8211;Pd Hemispherical Nanostructures as Efficient Electrocatalysts for Methanol, Ethanol, and Formic Acid Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anisotropic 3D nanocatalyst with both morphological and elemental anisotropy shows excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability due to its special uneven distribution and asymmetric nanostructure characteristics. The 3D anisotropic hemispherical nanostructures prepared in this work exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic activity and stability, which provides an inspiration for the creative synthesis of highly efficient electrocatalysts with 3D anisotropic nanostructures.








Abstract
Anisotropic 3D nanostructures exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability due to their heterogeneous elemental distribution and unsymmetrical configuration. However, it is still a huge challenge to combine anisotropically distributed elements and anisotropic morphologies within one 3D nanostructure. Herein, 3D Au@Pt&#8211;Pd hemispherical nanostructures (Au@Pt&#8211;Pd H&#8208;Ss) are fabricated as highly efficient electrocatalysts for oxidation reaction, which present heterogenous element distribution and anisotropic morphology. It is demonstrated that the non&#8208;uniform adsorption of BO2&#8722; on Au&#8208;CTA+ surface, as well as the simulated lower formation energy of Pt&#8211;Pd atoms for Au&#8208;CTA+&#8208;BO2&#8208;, basically contribute to the eventual formation of Au@Pt&#8211;Pd H&#8208;Ss. Impressively, the unique anisotropic Au@Pt&#8211;Pd H&#8208;Ss exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity and durability for methanol, ethanol, and formic acid oxidation reaction compared with commercial Pt/C and previously reported noble&#8208;metal based electrocatalysts. Especially, the mass activity of Au@Pt&#8211;Pd H&#8208;Ss for MOR is 4.38 A mgPt+Pd&#8208;1, which is about 2.0 and 4.7 times that of Au@Pt&#8211;Pd spherical nanostructures (Au@Pt&#8211;Pd Ss) and commercial Pt/C catalyst, respectively. This work provides an important reference for the design and preparation of 3D anisotropic and high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetic Field Effect on Excitonic Photoluminescence in Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature intrinsic magnetic field effect is realized in perovskite nanocrystals. The circular polarization of exciton photoluminescence in CsPbCl3 is enhanced by sp&#8211;d interactions with Mn doping, and is further stabilized by exciton orbital ordering with partial Br substitution, which induces 4.6% circular polarization ratio at room temperature in a 35 T magnetic field.








Abstract
Magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced spin&#8208;polarized electronic/optical properties in semiconductors are crucial for fabricating various spintronic devices. However, this spin polarization is governed by weak spin exchange interactions and easily randomized by thermal fluctuations; therefore, it is only produced at cryogenic temperatures, which severely limits the applications. Herein, a room&#8208;temperature intrinsic magnetic field effect (MFE) on excitonic photoluminescence is achieved in CsPbX3:Mn (X = Cl, Br) perovskite nanocrystals. Through moderate Mn doping, the MFE is enhanced by exciton&#8211;Mn interactions, and through partial Br substitution, the MFE is stabilized at room temperature by exciton orbital ordering. The orbital ordering significantly enhances the g&#8208;factor difference between electrons and holes, which is evidenced by a parallel orbit&#8211;orbit interaction among excitons generated by circular polarized laser excitation. This study provides a clear avenue for engineering spintronic materials based on orbital interactions in perovskites.

         <title>Anisotropically Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fatigue&#8208;resistant hydrogels are fabricated through synergistically engineering the preferentially aligned microstructures and nanocrystalline domains, enabling application as load&#8208;bearing components in underwater robots.








Abstract
Nature builds biological materials from limited ingredients, however, with unparalleled mechanical performances compared to artificial materials, by harnessing inherent structures across multi&#8208;length&#8208;scales. In contrast, synthetic material design overwhelmingly focuses on developing new compounds, and fails to reproduce the mechanical properties of natural counterparts, such as fatigue resistance. Here, a simple yet general strategy to engineer conventional hydrogels with a more than 100&#8208;fold increase in fatigue thresholds is reported. This strategy is proven to be universally applicable to various species of hydrogel materials, including polysaccharides (i.e., alginate, cellulose), proteins (i.e., gelatin), synthetic polymers (i.e., poly(vinyl alcohol)s), as well as corresponding polymer composites. These fatigue&#8208;resistant hydrogels exhibit a record&#8208;high fatigue threshold over most synthetic soft materials, making them low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance, and durable alternatives to soft materials used in those circumstances including robotics, artificial muscles,&#160;etc.

         <title>Direct Integration of Strained&#8208;Pt Catalysts into Proton&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Fuel Cells with Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designer electrocatalysts can be deposited via atomic layer deposition onto support structures for performance evaluation under various platforms. In this example, strained platinum catalysts are formed by dissolving cobalt oxide from the Pt/CoOx core&#8211;shell structure. Performance enhancement seen on the rotating disk electrode is validated in the membrane electrode assembly.








Abstract
The design and fabrication of lattice&#8208;strained platinum catalysts achieved by removing a soluble core from a platinum shell synthesized via atomic layer deposition, is reported. The remarkable catalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), measured in both half&#8208;cell and full&#8208;cell configurations, is attributed to the observed lattice strain. By further optimizing the nanoparticle geometry and ionomer/carbon interactions, mass activity close to 0.8&#160;A&#160;mgPt&#8722;1 @0.9&#160;V iR&#8208;free is achievable in the membrane electrode assembly. Nevertheless, active catalysts with high ORR activity do not necessarily lead to high performance in the high&#8208;current&#8208;density (HCD) region. More attention shall be directed toward HCD performance for enabling high&#8208;power&#8208;density hydrogen fuel cells.

         <title>Sphingosine 1&#8208;Phosphate Liposomes for Targeted Nitric Oxide Delivery to Mediate Anticancer Effects against Brain Glioma Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phospholipid&#8208;signaling sphingolipid hybrid and glutathione S&#8208;transferase (GST)&#8208;responsive liposome is successfully developed, which is able to specifically and safely deliver the therapeutic prodrug JS&#8208;K into glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors. Nitric oxide (NO) production in the tumor microenvironment is quantified by ultrasound imaging visualization. This study validates S1P liposomes as an effective drug delivery system for carcinomas.








Abstract
Specifically targeting glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) blood vessels and actively enhancing the permeability of the brain&#8211;blood&#8211;tumor barrier (BBTB) are two extremely difficult challenges currently hindering the development of effective therapies against GBM. Herein, a liposome drug delivery system (S1P/JS&#8208;K/Lipo) is described, which delivers the nitric oxide (NO) prodrug JS&#8208;K, O2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;dinitrophenyl) 1&#8208;[(4&#8208;ethoxycarbonyl) piperazin&#8208;1&#8208;yl] diazen&#8208;1&#8208;ium&#8208;1,2&#8208;diolate, to GBM tumors using sphingosine&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate (S1P)&#8208;signaling molecules as active targeting lipid ligands. It is revealed that S1P/JS&#8208;K/Lipo actively penetrates the BBTB, aided by caveolin&#8208;1&#8208;mediated transcytosis, and it is demonstrated that the system specifically interacts with S1P receptors (S1PRs), which are highly expressed on GBM cells. Nondestructive ultrasound imaging in GBM mouse models is also utilized to observe microsized NO bubble production from JS&#8208;K, as catalyzed by the glutathione S&#8208;transferases (GSTs) resident in GBM cells. Given that these NO bubbles strongly promote GBM cell death in vivo, the S1PR&#8208;targeted liposome delivery system&#8212;which successfully achieves BBTB penetration and tumor targeted delivery of a complex multicomponent drug regimen&#8212;represents a promising approach for targeted therapies against GBM and other carcinomas characterized by elevated S1PR expression.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically targeting glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) blood vessels and actively enhancing the permeability of the brain&#8211;blood&#8211;tumor barrier (BBTB) are two extremely difficult challenges currently hindering the development of effective therapies against GBM. Herein, a liposome drug delivery system (S1P/JS-K/Lipo) is described, which delivers the nitric oxide (NO) prodrug JS-K, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-(2,4-dinitrophenyl) 1-[(4-ethoxycarbonyl) piperazin-1-yl] diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate, to GBM tumors using sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-signaling molecules as active targeting lipid ligands. It is revealed that S1P/JS-K/Lipo actively penetrates the BBTB, aided by caveolin-1-mediated transcytosis, and it is demonstrated that the system specifically interacts with S1P receptors (S1PRs), which are highly expressed on GBM cells. Nondestructive ultrasound imaging in GBM mouse models is also utilized to observe microsized NO bubble production from JS-K, as catalyzed by the glutathione &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-transferases (GSTs) resident in GBM cells. Given that these NO bubbles strongly promote GBM cell death in vivo, the S1PR-targeted liposome delivery system&#8212;which successfully achieves BBTB penetration and tumor targeted delivery of a complex multicomponent drug regimen&#8212;represents a promising approach for targeted therapies against GBM and other carcinomas characterized by elevated S1PR expression.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Quantum Memories Based on Molecular Electron Spin Ensembles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ensembles of weakly exchange coupled organic radicals form strongly coupled systems with 3D microwave resonators. Time&#8208;domain pulsed microwave investigations reveal long, largely temperature&#8208;independent quantum coherence times. The room&#8208;temperature storage and retrieval of microwave pulses is demonstrated.








Abstract
Whilst quantum computing has recently taken great leaps ahead, the development of quantum memories has decidedly lagged behind. Quantum memories are essential devices in the quantum technology palette and are needed for intermediate storage of quantum bit states and as quantum repeaters in long&#8208;distance quantum communication. Current quantum memories operate at cryogenic, mostly sub&#8208;Kelvin temperatures and require extensive and costly peripheral hardware. It is demonstrated that ensembles of weakly coupled molecular spins show long coherence times and can be used to store microwave pulses of arbitrary phase. These studies exploit strong coupling of the spin ensemble to special 3D microwave resonators. Most importantly, these systems operate at room temperature.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Induced Cell Membrane Disruptions Enable Direct Cytosolic Delivery of Membrane&#8208;Impermeable Cargo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crosslinked cationic dextran nanogels are identified as unique polycationic nanomaterials capable of mediating direct cytosolic delivery of membrane&#8208;impermeable cargo. The efficient delivery of various macromolecules in HeLa cells and primary cells is demonstrated. Moreover, this approach outperforms state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electroporation for the delivery of neutral macromolecules and the MRI contrast agent gadobutrol in primary human T cells.








Abstract
Intracellular delivery of membrane&#8208;impermeable cargo offers unique opportunities for biological research and the development of cell&#8208;based therapies. Despite the breadth of available intracellular delivery tools, existing protocols are often suboptimal and alternative approaches that merge delivery efficiency with both biocompatibility, as well as applicability, remain highly sought after. Here, a comprehensive platform is presented that exploits the unique property of cationic hydrogel nanoparticles to transiently disrupt the plasma membrane of cells, allowing direct cytosolic delivery of uncomplexed membrane&#8208;impermeable cargo. Using this platform, which is termed Hydrogel&#8208;enabled nanoPoration or HyPore, the delivery of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)&#8211;dextran macromolecules in various cancer cell lines and primary bovine corneal epithelial cells is convincingly demonstrated. Of note, HyPore demonstrates efficient FITC&#8208;dextran delivery in primary human T cells, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electroporation&#8208;mediated delivery. Moreover, the HyPore platform enables cytosolic delivery of functional proteins, including a histone&#8208;binding nanobody as well as the enzymes granzyme A and Cre&#8208;recombinase. Finally, HyPore&#8208;mediated delivery of the MRI contrast agent gadobutrol in primary human T cells significantly improves their T1&#8208;weighted MRI signal intensities compared to electroporation. Taken together, HyPore is proposed as a straightforward, highly versatile, and cost&#8208;effective technique for high&#8208;throughput, ex vivo manipulation of primary cells and cell lines.

         <title>In Situ TEM Imaging of Solution&#8208;Phase Chemical Reactions Using 2D&#8208;Heterostructure Mixing Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 2D&#8208;heterostructure mixing cell allows sub&#8208;nanometer resolution characterization of calcium carbonate precipitation via nonclassical nucleation using scanning transmission electron microscopy. A trigger&#8208;based mixing mechanism using controlled damage to the MoS2 membrane enables visualization of the entire reaction timeline with high spatial resolution, including liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation, formation of amorphous calcium carbonate, and crystallization.








Abstract
Liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy is used to study a wide range of chemical processes, where its unique combination of spatial and temporal resolution provides countless insights into nanoscale reaction dynamics. However, achieving sub&#8208;nanometer resolution has proved difficult due to limitations in the current liquid cell designs. Here, a novel experimental platform for in situ mixing using a specially developed 2D heterostructure&#8208;based liquid cell is presented. The technique facilitates in situ atomic resolution imaging and elemental analysis, with mixing achieved within the immediate viewing area via controllable nanofracture of an atomically thin separation membrane. This novel technique is used to investigate the time evolution of calcium carbonate synthesis, from the earliest stages of nanodroplet precursors to crystalline calcite in a single experiment. The observations provide the first direct visual confirmation of the recently developed liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation theory, while the technological advancements open an avenue for many other studies of early stage solution&#8208;phase reactions of great interest for both the exploration of fundamental science and developing applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;memory computing that performs computations in situ within a nonvolatile memory unit is considered as one of the mainstream hardware implementations for future data&#8208;intensive computing applications. The recent progress from 2D memory devices to their applications for in&#8208;memory computing is summarized, and the current challenges and potential strategies in this exciting field are proposed.








Abstract
It is predicted that the conventional von Neumann computing architecture cannot meet the demands of future data&#8208;intensive computing applications due to the bottleneck between the processing and memory units. To try to solve this problem, in&#8208;memory computing technology, where calculations are carried out in situ within each nonvolatile memory unit, has been intensively studied. Among various candidate materials, 2D layered materials have recently demonstrated many new features that have been uniquely exploited to build next&#8208;generation electronics. Here, the recent progress of 2D memory devices is reviewed for in&#8208;memory computing. For each memory configuration, their operation mechanisms and memory characteristics are described, and their pros and cons are weighed. Subsequently, their versatile applications for in&#8208;memory computing technology, including logic operations, electronic synapses, and random number generation are presented. Finally, the current challenges and potential strategies for future 2D in&#8208;memory computing systems are also discussed at the material, device, circuit, and architecture levels. It is hoped that this manuscript could give a comprehensive review of 2D memory devices and their applications in in&#8208;memory computing, and be helpful for this exciting research area.

         <title>Convergence of Machine Vision and Melt Electrowriting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Taylor cone volume is discovered to be a readily measurable and important signature process for melt electrowriting. Machine vision of the Taylor cone during processing gives essential information on process stability, including fiber pulsing, and correlates to the fiber diameter. When adopted to tubular melt electrowriting, exceptionally large volume prints can be manufactured that demonstrate elastic snap&#8208;through behavior.








Abstract
Melt electrowriting (MEW) is a high&#8208;resolution additive manufacturing technology that balances multiple parametric variables to arrive at a stable fabrication process. The better understanding of this balance is underscored here using high&#8208;resolution camera vision of jet stability profiles in different electrical fields. Complementing this visual information are fiber&#8208;diameter measurements obtained at precise points, allowing the correlation to electrified jet properties. Two process signatures&#8212;the jet angle and for the first time, the Taylor cone area&#8212;are monitored and analyzed with a machine vision system, while SEM imaging for diameter measurement correlates real&#8208;time information. This information, in turn, allows the detection and correction of fiber pulsing for accurate jet placement on the collector, and the in&#8208;process assessment of the fiber diameter. Improved process control is used to successfully fabricate collapsible MEW tubes; structures that require exceptional accuracy and printing stability. Using a precise winding angle of 60&#176; and 300 layers, the resulting 12 mm&#8208;thick tubular structures have elastic snap&#8208;through instabilities associated with mechanical metamaterials. This study provides a detailed analysis of the fiber pulsing occurrence in MEW and highlights the importance of real&#8208;time monitoring of the Taylor cone volume to better understand, control, and predict printing instabilities.

This study provides a detailed analysis of the fiber pulsing occurrence in MEW and highlights the importance of real-time monitoring of the Taylor cone volume to better understand, control, and predict printing instabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescence from an Exciplex&#8208;Based Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In an ordinal exciplex&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED), injected holes and electrons immediately recombine to emit light. Meanwhile, an organic long&#8208;persistent luminescent (OLPL) system can store holes and electrons for a long time and exhibit luminescence by recombination. By optimizing the light&#8208;emitting layer of the exciplex&#8208;based OLED, OLPL from an OLED is achieved.








Abstract
Organic long&#8208;persistent luminescent systems (OLPLs) exhibiting long&#8208;lasting emission after photoexcitation consist of organic electron donors and acceptors, that are widely used in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Although OLPLs and OLEDs include very similar excitonic processes, long&#8208;lasting emission has never been observed in OLEDs. This study confirms the presence of long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) under electrical excitation.

         <title>Heterochromatic Nonlinear Optical Responses in Upconversion Nanoparticles for Super&#8208;Resolution Nanoscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diverse photoresponses from different energy levels in lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles are proposed to simultaneously generate multiple point spread functions for improving the super&#8208;resolution imaging quality. The method requires only one doughnut&#8208;shaped scanning excitation beam that extends the capabilities of the engineered point spread functions to cover both low&#8208; and high&#8208;frequency information for optimizing the averaged resolution.








Abstract
Point spread function (PSF) engineering by an emitter's response can code higher&#8208;spatial&#8208;frequency information of an image for microscopy to achieve super&#8208;resolution. However, complexed excitation optics or repetitive scans are needed, which explains the issues of low speed, poor stability, and operational complexity associated with the current laser scanning microscopy approaches. Here, the diverse emission responses of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are reported for super&#8208;resolution nanoscopy to improve the imaging quality and speed. The method only needs a doughnut&#8208;shaped scanning excitation beam at an appropriate power density. By collecting the four&#8208;photon emission of single UCNPs, the high&#8208;frequency information of a super&#8208;resolution image can be resolved through the doughnut&#8208;emission PSF. Meanwhile, the two&#8208;photon state of the same nanoparticle is oversaturated, so that the complementary lower&#8208;frequency information of the super&#8208;resolution image can be simultaneously collected by the Gaussian&#8208;like emission PSF. This leads to a method of Fourier&#8208;domain heterochromatic fusion, which allows the extended capability of the engineered PSFs to cover both low&#8208; and high&#8208;frequency information to yield optimized image quality. This approach achieves a spatial resolution of 40&#160;nm, 1/24th of the excitation wavelength. This work suggests a new scope for developing nonlinear multi&#8208;color emitting probes in super&#8208;resolution nanoscopy.

         <title>Design of Chemically Stable Organic Perovskite Quantum Dots for Micropatterned Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes through Kinetic Control of a Cross&#8208;Linkable Ligand System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fast degradation of perovskite quantum dots (QDs) prevents the development of multicolor patterning technologies using these materials. Therefore, novel ligand systems for microsized EL device fabrication, which protect perovskite QDs from degradation through the binding kinetic control of surface ligands, are developed. The present system remains stable in various chemical environments, without critical deterioration of optical and electrical properties.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dot (QD) light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are ideal for next&#8208;generation display applications because of their excellent color purity, high efficiency, and cost&#8208;effective fabrication. However, developing a technology for high&#8208;resolution multicolor patterning of perovskite QDs remains challenging, owing to the chemical instability of these materials. To overcome these issues, in this work, the generation of surface defects is prevented by controlling the ligand&#8208;binding kinetics using a stable ligand system (Stable LS). The crystalline reconstruction of perovskite QDs after addition of the Stable LS results in an &#8776;18% increase in their photoluminescence quantum yield in solution and it also improves the ambient stability of the perovskite QD solution. Moreover, the perovskite QDs with Stable LS can undergo cross&#8208;linking under UV irradiation. The tightly bridged perovskite QDs effectively prevent moisture&#8208;assisted ligand dissociation in film state due to the increased hydrophobicity and restricted movement of the cross&#8208;linked surface ligands. Thus, the cross&#8208;linked perovskite QD film shows improved chemical/environmental stability without substantial deterioration in optoelectrical properties. As a result, a white electroluminescent device with high resolution (&#8776;1 &#956;m) is successfully fabricated by inkjet printing using green and red perovskite QDs.

         <title>Simultaneously Toughening and Stiffening Elastomers with Octuple Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired multifunctional elastomer with both high fracture toughness and high Young's modulus is designed, breaking through the current trade&#8208;off present in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. The octuple hydrogen bonding promotes the formation of ultrastrong nanodomains, which, together with a soft poly(dimethylsiloxane)&#8208;rich phase, form a bicontinuous network structure. Such hierarchical networks with ultrastrong nanodomains enhance the mechanical properties.








Abstract
Current synthetic elastomers suffer from the well&#8208;known trade&#8208;off between toughness and stiffness. By a combination of multiscale experiments and atomistic simulations, a transparent unfilled elastomer with simultaneously enhanced toughness and stiffness is demonstrated. The designed elastomer comprises homogeneous networks with ultrastrong, reversible, and sacrificial octuple hydrogen bonding (HB), which evenly distribute the stress to each polymer chain during loading, thus enhancing stretchability and delaying fracture. Strong HBs and corresponding nanodomains enhance the stiffness by restricting the network mobility, and at the same time improve the toughness by dissipating energy during the transformation between different configurations. In addition, the stiffness mismatch between the hard HB domain and the soft poly(dimethylsiloxane)&#8208;rich phase promotes crack deflection and branching, which can further dissipate energy and alleviate local stress. These cooperative mechanisms endow the elastomer with both high fracture toughness (17016 J m&#8722;2) and high Young's modulus (14.7&#160;MPa), circumventing the trade&#8208;off between toughness and stiffness. This work is expected to impact many fields of engineering requiring elastomers with unprecedented mechanical performance.

         <title>Microchannel and Nanofiber Array Morphology Enhanced Rapid Superspreading on Animals&#8217; Corneas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The respective roles of nanoscale and microscale structures in the rapid superspreading effect are explicitly clarified: the superspreading is induced by in&#8208;/out&#8208;of&#8208;plane nanocapillary forces among the nanofiber array; the microchannel is responsible for tremendously speeding up the superspreading process.








Abstract
The dynamic spreading phenomenon of liquids is vital for both understanding wetting mechanisms and visual reaction time&#8208;related applications. However, how to control and accelerate the spreading process is still an enormous challenge. Here, a unique microchannel and nanofiber array morphology enhanced rapid superspreading (RSS) effect on animals&#8217; corneas with a superspreading time (ST) of 830 ms is found, and the respective roles of the nanofiber array and the microchannel in the RSS effect are explicitly demonstrated. Specifically, the superspreading is induced by in&#8208;/out&#8208;of&#8208;plane nanocapillary forces among the nanofiber array; the microchannel is responsible for tremendously speeding up the superspreading process. Inspired by the RSS strategy, not only is an RSS surface fabricated with an ST of only 450 ms, which is, respectively, more than 26 and 1.8 times faster than conventional superamphiphilic surfaces and animal's corneas and can be applied as RSS surfaces on video monitors to record clear videos, but also it is demonstrated that the RSS effect has tremendous potential as advanced ophthalmic material surfaces to enhance its biocompatibility for clear vision.

     alt="Microchannel and Nanofiber Array Morphology Enhanced Rapid Superspreading on Animals&#8217; Corneas"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The respective roles of nanoscale and microscale structures in the rapid superspreading effect are explicitly clarified: the superspreading is induced by in-/out-of-plane nanocapillary forces among the nanofiber array; the microchannel is responsible for tremendously speeding up the superspreading process.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamic spreading phenomenon of liquids is vital for both understanding wetting mechanisms and visual reaction time-related applications. However, how to control and accelerate the spreading process is still an enormous challenge. Here, a unique microchannel and nanofiber array morphology enhanced rapid superspreading (RSS) effect on animals&#8217; corneas with a superspreading time (ST) of 830 ms is found, and the respective roles of the nanofiber array and the microchannel in the RSS effect are explicitly demonstrated. Specifically, the superspreading is induced by in-/out-of-plane nanocapillary forces among the nanofiber array; the microchannel is responsible for tremendously speeding up the superspreading process. Inspired by the RSS strategy, not only is an RSS surface fabricated with an ST of only 450 ms, which is, respectively, more than 26 and 1.8 times faster than conventional superamphiphilic surfaces and animal's corneas and can be applied as RSS surfaces on video monitors to record clear videos, but also it is demonstrated that the RSS effect has tremendous potential as advanced ophthalmic material surfaces to enhance its biocompatibility for clear vision.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Amorphous Domains in Black Titanium Dioxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the diffusion of oxygen vacancies from the surface to inside, the regional dual structure with anisotropic oxygen vacancies at both the surface and in the interior of TiO2 is obtained by constructing amorphous domains. The as&#8208;prepared sample exhibits superior catalytic activity, which can immediately degrade rhodamine B solution to colorless with a shake.








Abstract
Although oxygen vacancies (Ovs) play a critical role for many applications of metal oxides, a controllable synthetic strategy for anisotropic Ovs remains a great challenge. Here, a novel strategy is proposed to achieve the regional dual structure with anisotropic Ovs at both the surface and in the interior of TiO2 by constructing amorphous domains. The as&#8208;prepared black TiO2 with amorphous domains exhibits superior activity in degrading rhodamine B (RhB) solutions, which can instantly decompose RhB with just a shake. First&#8208;principle simulations reveal that subsurface Ovs in TiO2 are energetically favored, resulting in the formation of amorphous domains in the interior region via diffusion of surface&#8208;formed Ovs into the subsurface. The stable Ov&#8208;induced amorphous domains in TiO2 with enhanced catalytic performances provide a scalable strategy to practical Ov engineering in functional metal oxides.

         <title>General Synthesis of Ultrafine Monodispersed Hybrid Nanoparticles from Highly Stable Monomicelles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of ultrasmall hybrid nanoparticles with great uniformity, monodispersity, and tunable shell thickness is successfully synthesized by a facile thermo&#8208;kinetics&#8208;mediated copolymer monomicelle approach. This monomicelle with a solidified polystyrene core has ultrahigh thermodynamic stability. Combined with a unique core&#8211;shell&#8211;corona structure, this monomicelle is a very general template to synthesize various ultrasmall, monodispersed hybrid nanoparticles with excellent uniformity.








Abstract
Ultrafine nanoparticles with organic&#8211;inorganic hybridization have essential roles in myriad applications. Over the past three decades, although various efforts on the formation of organic or inorganic ultrasmall nanoparticles have been made, ultrafine organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanoparticles have scarcely been achieved. Herein, a family of ultrasmall hybrid nanoparticles with a monodisperse, uniform size is synthesized by a facile thermo&#8208;kinetics&#8208;mediated copolymer monomicelle approach. These thermo&#8208;kinetics&#8208;mediated monomicelles with amphiphilic ABC triblock copolymers are structurally robust due to their solidified polystyrene core, endowing them with ultrahigh thermodynamic stability, which is difficult to achieve using Pluronic surfactant&#8208;based micelles (e.g., F127). This great stability combined with a core&#8211;shell&#8211;corona structure makes the monodispersed monomicelles a robust template for the precise synthesis of ultrasmall hybrid nanoparticles with a highly uniform size. As a demonstration, the obtained micelles/SiO2 hybrid nanoparticles display ultrafine sizes, excellent uniformity, monodispersity, and tunable structural parameters (diameters: 24&#8211;47 nm and thin shell thickness: 2.0&#8211;4.0 nm). Notably, this approach is universal for creating a variety of multifunctional ultrasmall hybrid nanostructures, involving organic/organic micelle/polymers (polydopamine) nanoparticles, organic/inorganic micelle/metal oxides (ZnO, TiO2, Fe2O3), micelle/hydroxides (Co(OH)2), micelle/noble metals (Ag), and micelle/TiO2/SiO2 hybrid composites. As a proof of concept, the ultrasmall micelle/SiO2 hybrid nanoparticles demonstrate superior toughness as biomimetic materials.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered In Situ Gelation of Hydrogels using 2D Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS2) Nanoassemblies as Crosslink Epicenter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;triggered in situ gelation of nanoengineered hydrogels using 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoassemblies is demonstrated. The in situ gelation of nanoengineered hydrogels has strong potential for a range of biomedical applications, including phototherapy, 3D printing, and therapeutic delivery.








Abstract
Light&#8208;responsive biomaterials are an emerging class of materials used for developing noninvasive, noncontact, precise, and controllable biomedical devices. Long&#8208;wavelength near&#8208;infrared (NIR) radiation is an attractive light source for in situ gelation due to its higher penetration depth and minimum side effects. The conventional approach to obtain crosslinked biomaterials relies heavily on the use of a photoinitiator by generating reactive species when exposed to short&#8208;wavelength radiation, which is detrimental to surrounding cells and tissue. Here, a new class of NIR&#8208;triggered in situ gelation system based on defect&#8208;rich 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoassemblies and thiol&#8208;functionalized thermoresponsive polymer in the absence of a photoinitiator is introduced. Exposure to NIR radiation activates the dynamic polymer&#8211;nanomaterials interactions by leveraging the photothermal characteristics of MoS2 and intrinsic phase transition ability of the thermoresponsive polymer. Specifically, upon NIR exposure, MoS2 acts as a crosslink epicenter by connecting with multiple polymeric chains via defect&#8208;driven click chemistry. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the utility of NIR&#8208;triggered in situ gelation is demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, the crosslinked gel exhibits the potential for NIR light&#8208;responsive release of encapsulated therapeutics. These light&#8208;responsive biomaterials have strong potential for a range of biomedical applications, including artificial muscle, smart actuators, 3D/4D printing, regenerative medicine, and therapeutic delivery.

         <title>Stereoisomerization during Molecular Packing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new isomerization phenomenon occurring during molecular packing is reported. Such a new type of isomerization tends to offer tight molecular packing with fewer voids in stacking, resulting in unique packing with abundant CH&#8230;&#960; interactions. The unique packing in the solid state favors the restriction of intramolecular motion, resulting in highly efficient organic solids with quantum yields approaching unity.








Abstract
Isomerization is an essential chemical process that often evokes dramatic change of chemical, physical, or biological properties. For a long time, isomerization has been known as a transformation that is induced by certain external energy such as light, heat, or mechanical force. Herein, a new isomerization phenomenon is described, which does not require external energy but simply occurs during molecular packing. The proposed isomerization is demonstrated by a series of symmetric donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) molecules, the donor of which may adopt two different stereoisomeric forms. Based on the evidence of the asymmetric isomers in crystals, the occurrence of isomerization during molecular packing is proved. Moreover, the unique asymmetric geometry in the solid state favors the restriction of intramolecular motion, resulting in highly efficient organic solids with quantum yields approaching unity.

         <title>Mechanism and Timescales of Reversible p&#8208;Doping of Methylammonium Lead Triiodide by Oxygen</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylammonium lead triiodide thin films exhibit intrinsic semiconductor electronic properties in the absence of oxygen. Exposure to oxygen or air leads to pronounced p&#8208;doping throughout the films, predominantly due to molecular oxygen substitution of iodine vacancies. This mechanism is reversible, and oxygen&#8208;doped films return to intrinsic upon storage in ultrahigh vacuum.








Abstract
Understanding and controlling the energy level alignment at interfaces with metal halide perovskites (MHPs) is essential for realizing the full potential of these materials for use in optoelectronic devices. To date, however, the basic electronic properties of MHPs are still under debate. Particularly, reported Fermi level positions in the energy gap vary from indicating strong n&#8208; to strong p&#8208;type character for nominally identical materials, raising serious questions about intrinsic and extrinsic defects as dopants. &#8203;In this work, photoemission experiments demonstrate that thin films of the prototypical methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) behave like an intrinsic semiconductor in the absence of oxygen. Oxygen is then shown to be able to reversibly diffuse into and out of the MAPbI3 bulk, requiring rather long saturation timescales of &#8776;1 h (in: ambient air) and over 10 h (out: ultrahigh vacuum), for few 100&#160;nm thick films. Oxygen in the bulk leads to pronounced p&#8208;doping, positioning the Fermi level universally &#8776;0.55&#160;eV above the valence band maximum. The key doping mechanism is suggested to be molecular oxygen substitution of iodine vacancies, supported by density functional theory calculations. This insight rationalizes previous and future electronic property studies of MHPs and calls for meticulous oxygen exposure protocols.

         <title>A Quinoxaline&#8208;Based D&#8211;A Copolymer Donor Achieving 17.62% Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two D&#8211;A copolymers, PBQ5 and PBQ6, are designed and synthesized based on difluoroquinoxaline (DFQ) units with different side chains. The organic solar cell (OSC) based on PBQ6 as donor and Y6 as acceptor achieves a high power conversion efficiency of 17.62%, which is one of the highest efficiencies for binary OSCs with a polymer donor and Y6 acceptor.








Abstract
Side&#8208;chain engineering has been an effective strategy in tuning electronic energy levels, intermolecular interaction, and aggregation morphology of organic photovoltaic materials, which is very important for improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, two D&#8211;A copolymers, PBQ5 and PBQ6, are designed and synthesized based on bithienyl&#8208;benzodithiophene (BDTT) as the donor (D) unit, difluoroquinoxaline (DFQ) with different side chains as the acceptor (A) unit, and thiophene as the &#960;&#8208;bridges. PBQ6 with two alkyl&#8208;substituted fluorothiophene side chains on the DFQ units possesses redshifted absorption, stronger intermolecular interaction, and higher hole mobility than PBQ5 with two alkyl side chains on the DFQ units. The blend film of the PBQ6 donor with the Y6 acceptor shows higher and balanced hole/electron mobilities, less charge carrier recombination, and more favorable aggregation morphology. Therefore, the OSC based on PBQ6:Y6 achieves a PCE as high as 17.62% with a high fill factor of 77.91%, which is significantly higher than the PCE (15.55%) of the PBQ5:Y6&#8208;based OSC. The PCE of 17.62% is by far one of the highest efficiencies for the binary OSCs with polymer donor and Y6 acceptor.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanometer Nanobelts Based on Titanium Dioxide/Zirconium Dioxide&#8211;Polyoxometalate Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZrO2&#8211;PMoO (PMZ) sub&#8208;nanobelts (SNBs) and TiO2&#8211;PMoO (PMT) SNBs are constructed through a nanoclusters gathering&#8211;transforming process, composed of ZrO2/TiO2 and polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters, showing high catalytic activity and stability in the oxidative desulfurization reaction at room temperature. The POM nanoclusters not only facilitate the formation of SNBs, but also perform as catalytic centers.








Abstract
In addition to offering conformational flexibility, sub&#8208;nanometer nanobelts (SNBs) also outperform many larger nanobelts with large size owing to their ultrathin morphologies. However, to date, only a few monocomponent SNBs have been synthesized. This study presents a facile method for synthesizing ZrO2&#8211;PMoO (PMZ) SNBs and TiO2&#8211;PMoO (PMT) SNBs with heterostructures. The SNBs comprise ZrO2/TiO2 and polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters, which are formed via the aggregation and subsequent transformation of nanoclusters. Significantly, these SNBs demonstrate high catalytic activity and stability in oxidative desulfurization reactions at room temperature. The impressive catalytic performance of the SNBs is aided by the POM nanoclusters, which not only coassemble with ZrO2/TiO2 nuclei to form building blocks of PMZ SNBs/PMT SNBs but also serve as catalytic centers. The catalytic performance is further enhanced by the ZrO2/TiO2 in the SNBs. Moreover, the proposed synthesis method can be utilized to produce other SNBs. Thus, this method provides valuable insights into the strong performance properties of SNBs created by combining metal oxides and POM nanoclusters into SNBs, which have great potential as redox catalysts.

         <title>Switching of a Magnet by Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque from a Topological Dirac Semimetal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature switching of magnetization in a CoFeB thin film by a spin&#8208;orbit torque from a neighboring topological Dirac semimetal &#945;&#8208;Sn thin film is reported. The &#945;&#8208;Sn film is grown by sputtering on a silicon substrate. The switching is driven mainly by the topological surface states in the &#945;&#8208;Sn. The switching efficiency is comparable to that in topological&#8208;insulator&#8208;based structures.








Abstract
Recent experiments show that topological surface states (TSS) in topological insulators (TI) can be exploited to manipulate magnetic ordering in ferromagnets. In principle, TSS should also exist for other topological materials, but it remains unexplored as to whether such states can also be utilized to manipulate ferromagnets. Herein, current&#8208;induced magnetization switching enabled by TSS in a non&#8208;TI topological material, namely, a topological Dirac semimetal &#945;&#8208;Sn, is reported. The experiments use an &#945;&#8208;Sn/Ag/CoFeB trilayer structure. The magnetization in the CoFeB layer can be switched by a charge current at room temperature, without an external magnetic field. The data show that the switching is driven by the TSS of the &#945;&#8208;Sn layer, rather than spin&#8208;orbit coupling in the bulk of the &#945;&#8208;Sn layer or current&#8208;produced heating. The switching efficiency is as high as in TI systems. This shows that the topological Dirac semimetal &#945;&#8208;Sn is as promising as TI materials in terms of spintronic applications.

         <dc:description>
Magnetic miniature robots (MMRs) are small, untethered actuators that can be controlled by magnetic fields. This work introduces optimal MMRs that can display unprecedented dexterity, manipulation capabilities, and soft&#8208;bodied mechanical functionalities. It is envisioned that this work can inspire future MMRs to be significantly more competent across a vast range of applications in robotics, materials science, and biomedicine.








Abstract

         <title>Enhancing Light&#8211;Matter Interactions in MoS2 by Copper Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intercalation of uniformly distributed copper into the van der Waals gap of vertically aligned MoS2 grown by chemical vapor deposition improves photodiode device performance. The intercalated MoS2 remains semiconducting and possesses a unique plasmon resonance at an energy of &#8776;1&#160;eV. Remarkably enhanced photoresponse from the ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared regime is presented.








Abstract
The intercalation of layered compounds opens up a vast space of new host&#8211;guest hybrids, providing new routes for tuning the properties of materials. Here, it is shown that uniform and continuous layers of copper can be intercalated within the van der Waals gap of bulk MoS2 resulting in a unique Cu&#8211;MoS2 hybrid. The new Cu&#8211;MoS2 hybrid, which remains semiconducting, possesses a unique plasmon resonance at an energy of &#8776;1eV, giving rise to enhanced optoelectronic activity. Compared with high&#8208;performance MoS2 photodetectors, copper&#8208;enhanced devices are superior in their spectral response, which extends into the infrared, and also in their total responsivity, which exceeds 104 A W&#8722;1. The Cu&#8211;MoS2 hybrids hold promise for supplanting current night&#8208;vision technology with compact, advanced multicolor night vision.

         <title>Thickness&#8208;Dependent Elastic Softening of Few&#8208;Layer Free&#8208;Standing MoSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8208;plane elastic constants of a few&#8208;layer suspended 2H&#8208;MoSe2 soften about 30% while decreasing the thickness from bulk to three&#8208;layers. The results obtained employing the contactless technique indicate the so&#8208;called negative elastic size&#8208;effect.








Abstract
Few&#8208;layer van der Waals (vdW) materials have been extensively investigated in terms of their exceptional electronic, optoelectronic, optical, and thermal properties. Simultaneously, a complete evaluation of their mechanical properties remains an undeniable challenge due to the small lateral sizes of samples and the limitations of experimental tools. In particular, there is no systematic experimental study providing unambiguous evidence on whether the reduction of vdW thickness down to few layers results in elastic softening or stiffening with respect to the bulk. In this work, micro&#8208;Brillouin light scattering is employed to investigate the anisotropic elastic properties of single&#8208;crystal free&#8208;standing 2H&#8208;MoSe2 as a function of thickness, down to three molecular layers. The so&#8208;called elastic size effect, that is, significant and systematic elastic softening of the material with decreasing numbers of layers is reported. In addition, this approach allows for a complete mechanical examination of few&#8208;layer membranes, that is, their elasticity, residual stress, and thickness, which can be easily extended to other vdW materials. The presented results shed new light on the ongoing debate on the elastic size&#8208;effect and are relevant for performance and durability of implementation of vdW materials as resonators, optoelectronic, and thermoelectric&#160;devices.

         <title>Electronic and Magnetic Characterization of Epitaxial CrBr3 Monolayers on a Superconducting Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic and magnetic properties of a 2D monolayer ferromagnet on a layered superconducting substrate are studied using different experimental techniques and theoretical calculations. It is confirmed that the chromium tribromide monolayer retains its ferromagnetic order and induces proximitized magnetism on the underlying superconductor niobium diselenide. The results contribute to the broader framework of exploiting proximity effects to realize novel phenomena in 2D heterostructures.








Abstract
The ability to imprint a given material property to another through a proximity effect in layered 2D materials has opened the way to the creation of designer materials. Here, molecular&#8208;beam epitaxy is used for direct synthesis of a superconductor&#8211;ferromagnet heterostructure by combining superconducting niobium diselenide (NbSe2) with the monolayer ferromagnetic chromium tribromide (CrBr3). Using different characterization techniques and density&#8208;functional theory calculations, it is confirmed that the CrBr3 monolayer retains its ferromagnetic ordering with a magnetocrystalline anisotropy favoring an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin orientation. Low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy measurements show a slight reduction of the superconducting gap of NbSe2 and the formation of a vortex lattice on the CrBr3 layer in experiments under an external magnetic field. The results contribute to the broader framework of exploiting proximity effects to realize novel phenomena in 2D&#160;heterostructures.

         <title>mRNA Delivery of a Bispecific Single&#8208;Domain Antibody to Polarize Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages and Synergize Immunotherapy against Liver Malignancies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative single&#8208;domain antibody that bispecifically binds and neutralizes CCL2 and CCL5 (BisCCL2/5i) is evolved using yeast surface display. mRNAs encoding BisCCL2/5i or a PD&#8208;1 ligand inhibitor (PD&#8208;Li) are encapsulated and delivered via clinically amenable lipid nanoparticles. Combination of BisCCL2/5i with PD&#8208;Li achieves long&#8208;term survival in mouse models of primary liver cancer and liver metastasis of colorectal and pancreatic cancers.








Abstract
Liver malignancies are among the tumor types that are resistant to immune checkpoint inhibition therapy. Tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) are highly enriched and play a major role in inducing immunosuppression in liver malignancies. Herein, CCL2 and CCL5 are screened as two major chemokines responsible for attracting TAM infiltration and inducing their polarization toward cancer&#8208;promoting M2&#8208;phenotype. To reverse this immunosuppressive process, an innovative single&#8208;domain antibody that bispecifically binds and neutralizes CCL2 and CCL5 (BisCCL2/5i) with high potency and specificity is directly evolved. mRNA encoding BisCCL2/5i is encapsulated in a clinically approved lipid nanoparticle platform, resulting in a liver&#8208;homing biomaterial that allows transient yet efficient expression of BisCCL2/5i in the diseased organ in a multiple dosage manner. This BisCCL2/5i mRNA nanoplatform significantly induces the polarization of TAMs toward the antitumoral M1 phenotype and reduces immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. The combination of BisCCL2/5i with PD&#8208;1 ligand inhibitor (PD&#8208;Li) achieves long&#8208;term survival in mouse models of primary liver cancer and liver metastasis of colorectal and pancreatic cancers. The work provides an effective bispecific targeting strategy that could broaden the PD&#8208;Li therapy to multiple types of malignancies in the human liver.

         <title>Disorder&#8208;Induced Material&#8208;Insensitive Optical Response in Plasmonic Nanostructures: Vibrant Structural Colors from Noble Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optical response of materials, either at the macroscale or the nanoscale, is determined by their unique dielectric functions. Assisted by intrinsic disorder in fabrication, material&#8208;insensitive reflection is achieved from plasmonic nanostructures composed of different noble metals. The disorder&#8208;induced disentanglement between the optical response and the material properties may inspire novel applications ranging from photocatalysis to Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Materials show various responses to incident light, owing to their unique dielectric functions. A well&#8208;known example is the distinct colors displayed by metals, providing probably the simplest method to identify gold, silver, and bronze since ancient times. With the advancement of nanotechnology, optical structures with feature sizes smaller than the optical wavelength have been routinely achieved. In this regime, the optical response is also determined by the geometry of the nanostructures, inspiring flourishing progress in plasmonics, photonic crystals, and metamaterials. Nevertheless, the nature of the materials still plays a decisive role in light&#8211;matter interactions, and this material&#8208;dependent optical response is widely accepted as a norm in nanophotonics. Here, a counterintuitive system&#8212;plasmonic nanostructures composed of different materials but exhibiting almost identical reflection&#8212;is proposed and realized. The geometric disorder embedded in the system overwhelms the contribution of the material properties to the electrodynamics. Both numerical simulations and experimental results provide concrete evidence of the insensitivity of the optical response to different plasmonic materials. The same optical response is preserved with various materials, providing great flexibility of freedom in material selection. As a result, the proposed configuration may shed light on novel applications ranging from Raman spectroscopy, photocatalysis, to nonlinear&#160;optics.

         <title>Atomically Thin Sheets of Lead&#8208;Free 1D Hybrid Perovskites Feature Tunable White&#8208;Light Emission from Self&#8208;Trapped Excitons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin crystals of the 1D organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite [C7H10N]3[BiCl5]Cl featuring covalent bonds only in one direction are exfoliated down to single layers. The unique 1D&#8211;2D structure enables self&#8208;trapped excitons with white&#8208;light emission and an extremely strong shift of the emission energy as a result of the thickness dependence of the exciton self&#8208;trapping.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites synergize the virtues of two unique classes of materials featuring intriguing possibilities for next&#8208;generation optoelectronics: they offer tailorable building blocks for atomically thin, layered materials while providing the enhanced light&#8208;harvesting and emitting capabilities of hybrid perovskites. This work goes beyond the paradigm that atomically thin materials require in&#8208;plane covalent bonding and reports single layers of the 1D organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite [C7H10N]3[BiCl5]Cl. Its unique 1D&#8211;2D structure enables single layers and the formation of self&#8208;trapped excitons, which show white&#8208;light emission. The thickness dependence of the exciton self&#8208;trapping causes an extremely strong shift of the emission energy. Thus, such 2D perovskites demonstrate that already 1D covalent interactions suffice to realize atomically thin materials and provide access to unique exciton physics. These findings enable a much more general construction principle for tailoring and identifying 2D materials that are no longer limited to covalently bonded 2D sheets.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of a Durable and Liquid&#8208;Repellent Poly(dimethylsiloxane) Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;stick coating with autophobicity is fabricated by a one&#8208;step grafting&#8208;from approach for poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) brushes on surfaces. Independent of surface tension, liquid droplets can easily slide on such surfaces.








Abstract
Coatings with low sliding angles for liquid drops have a broad range of applications. However, it remains a challenge to have a fast, easy, and universal preparation method for coatings that are long&#8208;term stable, robust, and environmentally friendly. Here, a one&#8208;step grafting&#8208;from approach is reported for poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) brushes on surfaces through spontaneous polymerization of dichlorodimethylsilane fulfilling all these requirements. Drops of a variety of liquids slide off at tilt angles below 5&#176;. This non&#8208;stick coating with autophobicity can reduce the waste of water and solvents in cleaning. The strong covalent attachment of the PDMS brush to the substrate makes them mechanically robust and UV&#8208;tolerant. Their resistance to high temperatures and to droplet sliding erosion, combined with the low film thickness (&#8776;8 nm) makes them ideal candidates to solve the long&#8208;term degradation issues of coatings for heat&#8208;transfer surfaces.

         <title>Liquid Wells as Self&#8208;Healing, Functional Analogues to Solid Vessels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water can act as a solid&#8208;like wall to contain organic liquids. The resulting liquid wells possess a range of unique and interesting properties, such as being dynamic, self&#8208;healing, and functional. Because the liquid&#8208;water wall can be removed and re&#8208;formed at will, these liquid wells can serve as sacrificial templates for polymer synthesis.








Abstract
Liquids are traditionally handled and stored in solid vessels. Solid walls are not functional, adaptive, or self&#8208;repairing, and are difficult to remove and re&#8208;form. Liquid walls can overcome these limitations, but cannot form free&#8208;standing 3D walls. Herein, a liquid analogue of a well, termed a &#8220;liquid well&#8221; is introduced. Water tethered to a surface with hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophilic core&#8211;shell patterns forms stable liquid walls capable of containing another immiscible fluid, similar to fluid confinement by solid walls. Liquid wells with different liquids, volumes, and shapes are prepared and investigated by confocal and Raman microscopy. The confinement of various low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids (LSTLs) on surfaces by liquid wells can compete with or be complementary to existing confinement strategies using perfluorinated surfaces, for example, in terms of the shape and height of the confined LSTLs. Liquid wells show unique properties arising from their liquid aggregate state: they are self&#8208;healing, dynamic, and functional, that is, not restricted to a passive confining role. Water walls can be easily removed and re&#8208;formed, making them interesting as sacrificial templates. This is demonstrated in a process termed water&#8208;templated polymerization (WTP). Numerical phase&#8208;field model simulations are performed to scrutinize the conditions required for the formation of stable liquid wells.

         <title>MIL&#8208;101&#8208;Derived Mesoporous Carbon Supporting Highly Exposed Fe Single&#8208;Atom Sites as Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe SAC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;T) are successfully synthesized using NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Al)&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped carbon as supports. The abundant mesopores in the supports promote mass transport during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and ensure a high proportion of FeNx sites are accessible. Fe SAC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;1000 demonstrates outstanding activity for ORR and excellent performance in both aqueous and solid&#8208;state zinc&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe SACs) with atomic FeNx active sites are very promising alternatives to platinum&#8208;based catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The pyrolysis of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is a common approach for preparing Fe SACs, though most MOF&#8208;derived catalysts reported to date are microporous and thus suffer from poor mass transfer and a high proportion of catalytically inaccessible FeNx active sites. Herein, NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Al), a MOF possessing a mesoporous cage architecture, is used as the precursor to prepare a series of N&#8208;doped carbon supports (denoted herein as NC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;T) with a well&#8208;defined mesoporous structure at different pyrolysis temperatures. The NC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;T supports are then impregnated with a Fe(II)&#8208;phenanthroline complex, and heated again to yield Fe SAC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;T catalysts rich in accessible FeNx single atom sites. The best performing Fe SAC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;1000 catalyst offers outstanding ORR activity in alkaline media, evidenced by an ORR half&#8208;wave potential of 0.94&#160;V (vs RHE) in 0.1 m KOH, as well as excellent performance in both aqueous primary zinc&#8211;air batteries (a near maximum theoretical energy density of 984.2&#160;Wh kgZn&#8722;1) and solid&#8208;state zinc&#8211;air batteries (a peak power density of 50.6&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and a specific capacity of 724.0 mAh kgZn&#8722;1).

&lt;p&gt;Mesoporous Fe single-atom catalysts (Fe SAC-MIL101-T) are successfully synthesized using NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL-101(Al)-derived N-doped carbon as supports. The abundant mesopores in the supports promote mass transport during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and ensure a high proportion of FeN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; sites are accessible. Fe SAC-MIL101-1000 demonstrates outstanding activity for ORR and excellent performance in both aqueous and solid-state zinc&#8211;air batteries.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Stretchable Ag2S Semiconductor Thin Films for Wearable Self&#8208;Powered Nonvolatile Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;processed synthesis of intrinsically stretchable Ag2S thin films for fabrication of self&#8208;powered stretchable resistive memory devices is presented. The device exhibits excellent switching characteristics and mechanical stretchability (52%), and extremely high thermal and environmental durability (168 h in 85 &#176;C/85% relative humidity). A self&#8208;powered memory combined with motion sensors for use as a wearable healthcare monitoring system is demonstrated.








Abstract
Compared with the large plastic deformation observed in ductile metals and organic materials, inorganic semiconductors have limited plasticity (&lt;0.2%) due to their intrinsic bonding characters, restricting their widespread applications in stretchable electronics. Herein, the solution&#8208;processed synthesis of ductile &#945;&#8208;Ag2S thin films and fabrication of all&#8208;inorganic, self&#8208;powered, and stretchable memory devices, is reported. Molecular Ag2S complex solution is synthesized by chemical reduction of Ag2S powder, fabricating wafer&#8208;scale highly crystalline Ag2S thin films. The thin films show stretchability due to the intrinsic ductility, sustaining the structural integrity at a tensile strain of 14.9%. Moreover, the fabricated Ag2S&#8208;based resistive random access memory presents outstanding bipolar switching characteristics (Ion/Ioff ratio of &#8776;105, operational endurance of 100 cycles, and retention time &gt;106 s) as well as excellent mechanical stretchability (no degradation of properties up to stretchability of 52%). Meanwhile, the device is highly durable under diverse chemical environments and temperatures from &#8722;196 to 300 &#176;C, especially maintaining the properties for 168 h in 85% relative humidity and 85 &#176;C. A self&#8208;powered memory combined with motion sensors for use as a wearable healthcare monitoring system is demonstrated, offering the potential for designing high&#8208;performance wearable electronics that are usable in daily life in a real&#8208;world setting.

         <title>2D Materials: Thickness&#8208;Dependent Elastic Softening of Few&#8208;Layer Free&#8208;Standing MoSe2 (Adv. Mater. 23/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolayer graphene is stronger than bulk graphite: the elastic properties of graphene are such that it could hypothetically withstand an elephant balancing on a pencil. A contactless optical technique, reported by Bartlomiej Graczykowski and co&#8208;workers in article number 2008614 now shows that this is not the case for MoSe2, an attractive semiconducting 2D material. This material becomes significantly softer by reducing its thickness from bulk to a few layers.

In article number 2100518, Johanna Heine and co&#8208;workers report tunable white&#8208;light emission from atomically thin sheets of the 1D hybrid perovskite [C7H10N]3[BiCl5]Cl. The unique structure enables self&#8208;trapped&#8208;exciton formation with white&#8208;light emission, and reveals the thickness dependence of the exciton self&#8208;trapping. This enables facile control of the emission color in next&#8208;generation lighting and display technologies.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current panorama of hydrogel&#8208;based photonics and advances in fabrication techniques toward functional optical architectures are reviewed, evaluating their capabilities in the biomedical field. Further, the future potential for hydrogel photonic constructs to integrate into live tissues, advanced biosensing platforms, microrobotics, photomedicine, and lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip technologies are discussed.








Abstract
Light guiding and manipulation in photonics have become ubiquitous in events ranging from everyday communications to complex robotics and nanomedicine. The speed and sensitivity of light&#8211;matter interactions offer unprecedented advantages in biomedical optics, data transmission, photomedicine, and detection of multi&#8208;scale phenomena. Recently, hydrogels have emerged as a promising candidate for interfacing photonics and bioengineering by combining their light&#8208;guiding properties with live tissue compatibility in optical, chemical, physiological, and mechanical dimensions. Herein, the latest progress over hydrogel photonics and its applications in guidance and manipulation of light is reviewed. Physics of guiding light through hydrogels and living tissues, and existing technical challenges in translating these tools into biomedical settings are discussed. A&#160;comprehensive and thorough overview of materials, fabrication protocols, and design architectures used in hydrogel photonics is provided. Finally, recent examples of applying structures such as hydrogel optical fibers, living photonic constructs, and their use as light&#8208;driven hydrogel robots, photomedicine tools, and organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip models are described. By providing a critical and selective evaluation of the field's status, this work sets a foundation for the next generation of hydrogel photonic research.

         <title>Halide Perovskites: A New Era of Solution&#8208;Processed Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites show high promise for electronic devices owing to exceptional electrical, optical, and structural properties. The latest breakthroughs in structural, interface, defect engineering, and pattering techniques as applied to halide perovskite transistors, memories and to improve stability issues in perovskites are reviewed. Lastly, the existing challenges and outline for future research directions are provided.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic mixed halide perovskites have emerged as an excellent class of materials with a unique combination of optoelectronic properties, suitable for a plethora of applications ranging from solar cells to light&#8208;emitting diodes and photoelectrochemical devices. Recent works have showcased hybrid perovskites for electronic applications through improvements in materials design, processing, and device stability. Herein, a comprehensive up&#8208;to&#8208;date review is presented on hybrid perovskite electronics with a focus on transistors and memories. These applications are supported by the fundamental material properties of hybrid perovskite semiconductors such as tunable bandgap, ambipolar charge transport, reasonable mobility, defect characteristics, and solution processability, which are highlighted first. Then, recent progresses on perovskite&#8208;based transistors are reviewed, covering aspects of fabrication process, patterning techniques, contact engineering, 2D versus 3D material selection, and device performance. Furthermore, applications of perovskites in nonvolatile memories and artificial synaptic devices are presented. The ambient instability of hybrid perovskites and the strategies to tackle this bottleneck are also discussed. Finally, an outlook and opportunities to develop perovskite&#8208;based electronics as a competitive and feasible technology are highlighted.

         <title>Engineering Biomolecular Self&#8208;Assembly at Solid&#8211;Liquid Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent achievements in the self&#8208;assembly of diverse 2D biomolecular architectures at solid&#8211;liquid interfaces achieved by programming interactions acting over multiple scales are summarized. Recent advances in the physical understanding of the assembly dynamics obtained via in situ atomic force microscopy are also discussed. Finally, potential applications and critical unresolved obstacles in achieving them are highlighted.








Abstract
Biomolecular self&#8208;assembly is a key process used by life to build functional materials from the &#8220;bottom up.&#8221; In the last few decades, bioengineering and bionanotechnology have borrowed this strategy to design and synthesize numerous biomolecular and hybrid materials with diverse architectures and properties. However, engineering biomolecular self&#8208;assembly at solid&#8211;liquid interfaces into predesigned architectures lags the progress made in bulk solution both in practice and theory. Here, recent achievements in programming self&#8208;assembly of peptides, proteins, and peptoids at solid&#8211;liquid interfaces are summarized and corresponding applications are described. Recent advances in the physical understandings of self&#8208;assembly pathways obtained using in situ atomic force microscopy are also discussed. These advances will lead to novel strategies for designing biomaterials organized at and interfaced with inorganic surfaces.

         <title>Nonequilibrium Dynamics of Magnetic Nanoparticles with Applications in Biomedicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of the magnetism dynamics of magnetic nanoparticles and its relevance to optimizing and further developing biomedical applications is presented, with a specific focus on the applications of magnetic particle imaging and magnetic fluid hyperthermia. A summary of historical and current theoretical and computational models of nanoparticle dynamics is given.








Abstract
Magnetic nanoparticles are currently the focus of investigation for a wide range of biomedical applications that fall into the categories of imaging, sensing, and therapeutics. A deep understanding of nanoparticle magnetization dynamics is fundamental to optimization and further development of these applications. Here, a summary of theoretical models of nanoparticle dynamics is presented, and computational nonequilibrium models are outlined, which currently represent the most sophisticated methods for modeling nanoparticle dynamics. Nanoparticle magnetization response is explored in depth; the effect of applied field amplitude, as well as nanoparticle size, on the resulting rotation mechanism and timescale is investigated. Two applications in biomedicine, magnetic particle imaging and magnetic fluid hyperthermia, are highlighted.

         <title>Iron Oxide Nanoparticles as T1 Contrast Agents for Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Fundamentals, Challenges, Applications, and Prospectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamentals of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) as T1 contrast agents, the past advances, and current challenges in developing IONPs are reviewed. The key material properties and environmental variables influencing T1 and T2 contrast, and their relationships are discussed. Strategies for improving T1 contrast enhancement and directions for future research are provided.








Abstract
Gadolinium&#8208;based chelates are a mainstay of contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the clinic. However, their toxicity elicits severe side effects and the Food and Drug Administration has issued many warnings about their potential retention in patients&#8217; bodies, which causes safety concerns. Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) are a potentially attractive alternative, because of their nontoxic and biodegradable nature. Studies in developing IONPs as T1 contrast agents have generated promising results, but the complex, interrelated parameters influencing contrast enhancement make the development difficult, and IONPs suitable for T1 contrast enhancement have yet to make their way to clinical use. Here, the fundamental principles of MRI contrast agents are discussed, and the current status of MRI contrast agents is reviewed with a focus on the advantages and limitations of current T1 contrast agents and the potential of IONPs to serve as safe and improved alternative to gadolinium&#8208;based chelates. The past advances and current challenges in developing IONPs as a T1 contrast agent from a materials science perspective are presented, and how each of the key material properties and environment variables affects the performance of IONPs is assessed. Finally, some potential approaches to develop high&#8208;performance and clinically relevant T1 contrast agents are discussed.

         <title>Quantum Point Defects for Solid&#8208;State Laser Refrigeration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of point defects in realizing solid&#8208;state laser refrigeration is discussed with an emphasis on the fundamental physical phenomena and quantized electronic transitions. Lanthanide&#8208;doping&#8208;based point defects, which have advanced solid&#8208;state laser refrigeration, along with potential color centers based on fluoride vacancies and color centers in diamonds, are also addressed.








Abstract
Herein, the role that point defects have played over the last two decades in realizing solid&#8208;state laser refrigeration is discussed. A brief introduction to the field of solid&#8208;state laser refrigeration is given with an emphasis on the fundamental physical phenomena and quantized electronic transitions that have made solid&#8208;state laser&#8208;cooling possible. Lanthanide&#8208;based point defects, such as trivalent ytterbium ions (Yb3+), have played a central role in the first demonstrations and subsequent development of advanced materials for solid&#8208;state laser refrigeration. Significant discussion is devoted to the quantum mechanical description of optical transitions in lanthanide ions, and their influence on laser cooling. Transition&#8208;metal point defects have been shown to generate substantial background absorption in ceramic materials, decreasing the overall efficiency of a particular laser refrigeration material. Other potential color centers based on fluoride vacancies with multiple potential charge states are also considered. In conclusion, novel materials for solid&#8208;state laser refrigeration, including color centers in diamond that have recently been proposed to realize the solid&#8208;state laser refrigeration of semiconducting materials, are discussed.

         <title>Facile Transformation of Murine and Human Primary Dendritic Cells into Robust and Modular Artificial Antigen&#8208;Presenting Systems by Intracellular Hydrogelation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial antigen cell is prepared by directly transforming live dendritic cells into a cell&#8211;gel hybrid construct by photoactivated intracellular radical polymerization, enabling the preparation of a highly robust and modular cell&#8208;mimicking biomaterial for immunoengineering. The gelated dendritic cells can be stored by lyophilization and effectively expand antigen&#8208;specific T cells for anticancer adoptive cell therapy.








Abstract
The growing enthusiasm for cancer immunotherapies and adoptive cell therapies has prompted increasing interest in biomaterials development mimicking natural antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) for T&#8208;cell expansion. In contrast to conventional bottom&#8208;up approaches aimed at layering synthetic substrates with T&#8208;cell activation cues, transformation of live dendritic cells (DCs) into artificial APCs (aAPCs) is demonstrated herein using a facile and minimally disruptive hydrogelation technique. Through direct intracellular permeation of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEG&#8208;DA) hydrogel monomer and UV&#8208;activated radical polymerization, intracellular hydrogelation is rapidly accomplished on DCs with minimal influence on cellular morphology and surface antigen display, yielding highly robust and modular cell&#8211;gel hybrid constructs amenable to peptide antigen exchange, storable by freezing and lyophilization, and functionalizable with cytokine&#8208;releasing carriers for T&#8208;cell modulation. The DC&#8208;derived aAPCs are shown to induce prolonged T&#8208;cell expansion and improve anticancer efficacy of adoptive T&#8208;cell therapy in mice compared to nonexpanded control T cells, and the gelation technique is further demonstrated to stabilize primary DCs derived from human donors. The work presents a versatile approach for generating a new class of cell&#8208;mimicking biomaterials and opens new venues for immunological interrogation and immunoengineering.

         <title>Design and Use of a Thermogelling Methylcellulose Nanoemulsion to Formulate Nanocrystalline Oral Dosage Forms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new thermogelling nanoemulsion is developed to formulate composite drug products with well&#8208;controlled active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) nanocrystals embedded in a methylcellulose matrix. The thermally gelled nanoemulsion is directly dried with the precise formation of stable API nanocrystals templated by the nanodroplets in situ. The thermogelling nanoemulsion is formulated into various dosage forms (particle, nanoparticle suspension, drug tablet, and oral thin film).








Abstract
Oral drug products have become indispensable in modern medicine because of their exceptional patient compliance. However, poor bioavailability of ubiquitous low&#8208;water&#8208;soluble active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and lack of efficient oral drug formulations remain as significant challenges. Nanocrystalline formulations are an attractive route to increase API solubility, but typically require abrasive mechanical milling and several processing steps to create an oral dosage form. Using the dual amphiphilic and thermoresponsive properties of methylcellulose (MC), a new thermogelling nanoemulsion and a facile thermal dripping method are developed for efficient formulation of composite particles with the MC matrix embedded with precisely controlled API nanocrystals. Moreover, a fast and tunable release performance is achieved with the combination of a fast&#8208;eroding MC matrix and fast&#8208;dissolving API nanocrystals. Using the versatile thermal processing approach, the thermogelling nanoemulsion is easily formulated into a wide variety of dosage forms (nanoparticle suspension, drug tablet, and oral thin film) in a manner that avoids nanomilling. Overall, the proposed thermogelling nanoemulsion platform not only broadens the applications of thermoresponsive nanoemulsions but also shows great promise for more efficient formulation of oral drug products with high quality and tunable fast release.

         <title>Advances in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: From Academic Research to Commercial Viability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The major developments and advancements of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries over the past 60 years are presented. The prospects and an outlook on the future development of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries for large&#8208;scale practical applications are also discussed.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which have revolutionized portable electronics over the past three decades, were eventually recognized with the 2019 Nobel Prize in chemistry. As the energy density of current lithium&#8208;ion batteries is approaching its limit, developing new battery technologies beyond lithium&#8208;ion chemistry is significant for next&#8208;generation high energy storage. Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, which rely on the reversible redox reactions between lithium and sulfur, appears to be a promising energy storage system to take over from the conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries for next&#8208;generation energy storage owing to their overwhelming energy density compared to the existing lithium&#8208;ion batteries today. Over the past 60 years, especially the past decade, significant academic and commercial progress has been made on Li&#8211;S batteries. From the concept of the sulfur cathode first proposed in the 1960s to the current commercial Li&#8211;S batteries used in unmanned aircraft, the story of Li&#8211;S batteries is full of breakthroughs and back tracing steps. Herein, the development and advancement of Li&#8211;S batteries in terms of sulfur&#8208;based composite cathode design, separator modification, binder improvement, electrolyte optimization, and lithium metal protection is summarized. An outlook on the future directions and prospects for Li&#8211;S batteries is also offered.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Coordinated Biocatalysts for Chem&#8208;/Sono&#8208;/Photo&#8208;Trimodal Tumor Therapies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precisely designed Pd single&#8208;atom coordinated biocatalyst (Pd&#8208;Pta/Por) is synthesized for achieving chem&#8208;/sono&#8208;/photo&#8208;trimodal dynamic tumor therapies. Experimental results and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the Pd&#8208;Pta/Por biocatalyst consists of atomic Pd&#8208;N coordination active sites and owns efficient catalytic yield of reactive oxygen species (ROS) for highly synergistic antitumor therapies, which takes an essential step toward developing ROS&#8208;related therapeutic and biological applications.








Abstract
The diversity, complexity, and heterogeneity of malignant tumor seriously undermine the efficiency of mono&#8208;modal treatment. Recently, multi&#8208;modal therapeutics with enhanced antitumor efficiencies have attracted increasing attention. However, designing a nanotherapeutic platform with uniform morphology in nanoscale that integrates with efficient chem&#8208;/sono&#8208;/photo&#8208;trimodal tumor therapies is still a great challenge. Here, new and facile Pd&#8208;single&#8208;atom coordinated porphyrin&#8208;based polymeric networks as biocatalysts, namely, Pd&#8208;Pta/Por, for chem&#8208;/sono&#8208;/photo&#8208;trimodal tumor therapies are designed. The atomic morphology and chemical structure analysis prove that the biocatalyst consists of atomic Pd&#8208;N coordination networks with a Pd&#8208;N2&#8208;Cl2 catalytic center. The characterization of peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic activities displays that the Pd&#8208;Pta/Por can generate abundant &#8226;OH radicals for chemodynamic therapies. The ultrasound irradiation or laser excitation can significantly boost the catalytic production of 1O2 by the porphyrin&#8208;based sono&#8208;/photosensitizers to achieve combined sono&#8208;/photodynamic therapies. The superior catalytic production of &#8226;OH is further verified by density functional theory calculation. Finally, the corresponding in vitro and in vivo experiments have demonstrated their synergistic chem&#8208;/sono&#8208;/photo&#8208;trimodal antitumor efficacies. It is believed that this study provides new promising single&#8208;atom&#8208;coordinated polymeric networks with highly efficient biocatalytic sites and synergistic trimodal therapeutic effects, which may inspire many new findings in reactive oxygen species&#8208;related biological applications across broad therapeutics and biomedical fields.

         <title>2D NbOI2: A Chiral Semiconductor with Highly In&#8208;Plane Anisotropic Electrical and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NbOI2 has a strong in&#8208;plane structural anisotropy, where the [NbO2I4] octahedra are connected through I&#8211;I edges along the c&#8208;axis and cornered O atoms along the b&#8208;axis. The I anions with weaker electronegativity contribute to the electrons near the Fermi surface, leading to the highly anisotropic dispersion of band structures along the c&#8208;axis. Hence, NbOI2 exhibits large anisotropic factor of 1.75 and 1.7 for optical absorbance and photoresponsivity, which makes it a promising platform for novel polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection applications.








Abstract
Exploring in&#8208;plane anisotropic 2D materials is of great significance to the fundamental studies and further development of polarizationsensitive optoelectronics. Herein, chiral niobium oxide diiodide (NbOI2) is introduced into the intriguing anisotropic 2D family with the experimental demonstration of anisotropic optical and electrical properties. 2D NbOI2 crystals exhibit highly anisotropic dispersed band structures around the Fermi surface and strong in&#8208;plane anisotropy of phonon vibrations owing to the different bonding modes of Nb atoms along the b&#8208; and c&#8208;axes. Consequently, the anisotropic factors of optical absorbance and photoresponsivity in 2D NbOI2 crystals reach up to 1.75 and 1.7, respectively. These anisotropic properties make 2D NbOI2 an interesting platform for novel polarization&#8208;sensitive optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Tailoring of White Luminescence in a NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ Phosphor Containing Broad&#8208;Band Defect&#8208;Induced Charge&#8208;Transfer Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;component white emitter is developed by introducing defect&#8208;associated charge&#8208;transfer emission in a NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ phosphor via a facile composition modification strategy. An extra broadband yellow peak (585&#160;nm) appears in addition to the narrow&#8208;band blue emission (472&#160;nm). A single&#8208;component white light&#8208;emitting diode with color&#8208;rendering index of 82.9 is fabricated using the white phosphor.








Abstract
Single&#8208;component materials with white&#8208;light emission are ideal for lighting applications. However, it is very challenging to achieve white luminescence in single&#8208;dopant activated solid phosphors. Herein, white NaLi3Si1&#8722;xO4:Eu2+ materials are designed via defect engineering and synthesized by reducing the Si content (0.15 &#8804; x&#160;&#8804; 0.25). Stochiometric NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ exhibits a narrow&#8208;band blue emission at 469&#160;nm, ascribed to the 5d &#8594; 4f transition of Eu2+ at highly symmetric cuboid Na sites, while samples with Si content reduced by 15&#8211;25% display white emission with two peaks at 472&#160;nm and 585&#160;nm. The newly appeared broadband yellow peak arises from charge&#8208;transfer transitions involving Eu2+ and nearby defects, as verified by an unusual bandwidth, a large Stokes shift, and a long decay time. A single&#8208;component white light&#8208;emitting diode device is fabricated by employing a white phosphor to demonstrate a color&#8208;rendering index of 82.9.

     alt="Tailoring of White Luminescence in a NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ Phosphor Containing Broad-Band Defect-Induced Charge-Transfer Emission"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single-component white emitter is developed by introducing defect-associated charge-transfer emission in a NaLi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; phosphor via a facile composition modification strategy. An extra broadband yellow peak (585&#160;nm) appears in addition to the narrow-band blue emission (472&#160;nm). A single-component white light-emitting diode with color-rendering index of 82.9 is fabricated using the white phosphor.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-component materials with white-light emission are ideal for lighting applications. However, it is very challenging to achieve white luminescence in single-dopant activated solid phosphors. Herein, white NaLi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; materials are designed via defect engineering and synthesized by reducing the Si content (0.15 &#8804; &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8804; 0.25). Stochiometric NaLi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; exhibits a narrow-band blue emission at 469&#160;nm, ascribed to the 5d &#8594; 4f transition of Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; at highly symmetric cuboid Na sites, while samples with Si content reduced by 15&#8211;25% display white emission with two peaks at 472&#160;nm and 585&#160;nm. The newly appeared broadband yellow peak arises from charge-transfer transitions involving Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and nearby defects, as verified by an unusual bandwidth, a large Stokes shift, and a long decay time. A single-component white light-emitting diode device is fabricated by employing a white phosphor to demonstrate a color-rendering index of 82.9. This result provides a new design strategy for single-component white-light materials with broad-band defect-induced charge-transfer emission.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Pattern&#8208;Potential&#8208;Guided Growth of Textured Macromolecular Films on Graphene/High&#8208;Index Copper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A patterned potential is constructed on graphene/Cu(122) and employed to guide the highly ordered growth of ferroelectric polymer films over a large area (&#8776;5 cm &#215; 5 cm), resulting in an enhancement of ferroelectric and mechanical property. In situ SEM and MD simulations reveal that an electrostatic interaction is crucial for the formation of oriented film. Such a strategy is also demonstrated to be applicable to other polar macromolecules.








Abstract
Macromolecular films are crucial functional materials widely used in the fields of mechanics, electronics, optoelectronics, and biology, due to their superior properties of chemical stability, small density, high flexibility, and solution&#8208;processing ability. Their electronic and mechanical properties, however, are typically much lower than those of crystalline materials, as the macromolecular films have no long&#8208;range structural ordering. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art for producing highly ordered macromolecular films is still facing a great challenge due to the complex interactions between adjacent macromolecules. Here, the growth of textured macromolecular films on a designed graphene/high&#8208;index copper (Cu) surface is demonstrated. This successful growth is driven by a patterned potential that originates from the different amounts of charge transfer between the graphene and Cu surfaces with, alternately, terraces and step edges. The textured films exhibit a remarkable improvement in remnant ferroelectric polarization and fracture strength. It is also demonstrated that this growth mechanism is universal for different macromolecules. As meter&#8208;scale graphene/high&#8208;index Cu substrates have recently become available, the results open a new regime for the production and applications of highly ordered macromolecular films with obvious merits of high production and low cost.

         <title>A High&#8208;Efficiency Wavelength&#8208;Tunable Monolayer LED with Hybrid Continuous&#8208;Pulsed Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolayer WS2 light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) operate in a hybrid mode of continuous&#8208;pulsed injection, which has a high emission efficiency and tunable emission wavelength. The negatively charged defect electroluminescence emission has a large quantum efficiency and can be visualized and distinguished in real space. This work is aimed at inspiring further high&#8208;performance and wavelength&#8208;tunable LED devices for future advanced optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency and wavelength&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) devices will play an important role in future advanced optoelectronic systems. Traditional semiconductor LED devices typically have a fixed emission wavelength that is determined by the energy of the emission states. Here, a novel high&#8208;efficiency and wavelength&#8208;tunable monolayer WS2 LED device, which operates in the hybrid mode of continuous&#8208;pulsed injection, is developed. This hybrid injection enables highly enhanced emission efficiency (&gt;20 times) and effective size of emission area (&gt;5 times) at room temperature. The emission wavelength of the WS2 monolayer LED device can be tuned over more than 40&#160;nm by driving AC voltages, from exciton emission to trion emission, and further to defect emission. The quantum efficiency of defect electroluminescence (EL) emission is measured to be more than 24.5 times larger than that from free exciton and trion EL emission. The separate carrier injection in the LED also demonstrates advantages in allowing defect species to be visualized and distinguished in real space. Those defects are assigned to be negatively charged defects. The results open a new route to develop high&#8208;performance and wavelength&#8208;tunable LED devices for future advanced optoelectronic applications.

         <title>DNA Origami Penetration in Cell Spheroid Tissue Models is Enhanced by Wireframe Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To probe the potential for DNA&#8208;origami&#8208;based delivery devices, the authors study the effect of the folding arrangement of the DNA, on passive uptake and penetration. Despite almost identical composition and shape of the structures, wireframe&#8208;style origami penetrates deeper in tumor models than classical origami and this is likely an effect due to differences in scavenger receptor mediated uptake.








Abstract
As DNA origami applications in biomedicine are expanding, more knowledge is needed to assess these structures&#8217; interaction with biological systems. Here, uptake and penetration in cell and cell spheroid tissue models (CSTMs) are studied to elucidate whether differences in internal structure can be a factor in the efficacy of DNA&#8208;origami&#8208;based delivery. Two structures bearing largely similar features in terms of both geometry and molecular weight, but with different internal designs&#8212;being either compact, lattice&#8208;based origami or following an open, wireframe design&#8212;are designed. In CSTMs, wireframe rods are able to penetrate deeper than close&#8208;packed rods. Moreover, doxorubicin&#8208;loaded wireframe rods show a higher cytotoxicity in CSTMs. These results can be explained by differences in structural mechanics, local deformability, local material density, and accessibility to cell receptors between these two DNA origami design paradigms. In particular, it is suggested that the main reason for the difference in penetration dynamic arises from differences in interaction with scavenger receptors where lattice&#8208;based structures appear to be internalized to a higher degree than polygonal structures of the same size and shape. It is thus argued that the choice of structural design method constitutes a crucial parameter for the application of DNA origami in drug delivery.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide perovskite nanocrystal (PNC)/polymer nanocomposites that combine unique optoelectronic properties of PNCs and outstanding stability, flexibility, and processability enabled by polymers are an appealing class of material with many promising applications. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic strategies and intriguing properties of PNC/polymer nanocomposites, as well as their wide&#8208;ranging applications in light emision, sensing, and energy conversion areas are summarized.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) have recently garnered tremendous research interest due to their unique optoelectronic properties and promising applications in photovoltaics and optoelectronics. Metal halide PNCs can be combined with polymers to create nanocomposites that carry an array of advantageous characteristics. The polymer matrix can bestow stability, stretchability, and solution&#8208;processability while the PNCs maintain their size&#8208;, shape&#8208; and composition&#8208;dependent optoelectronic properties. As such, these nanocomposites possess great promise for next&#8208;generation displays, lighting, sensing, biomedical technologies, and energy conversion. The recent advances in metal halide PNC/polymer nanocomposites are summarized here. First, a variety of synthetic strategies for crafting PNC/polymer nanocomposites are discussed. Second, their array of intriguing properties is examined. Third, the broad range of applications of PNC/polymer nanocomposites is highlighted, including light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, and scintillators. Finally, an outlook on future research directions and challenges in this rapidly evolving field are presented.

Fabrication of phase&#8208;pure films of 2D perovskites using a novel, simple and scalable method, referred to as the phase&#8208;selective method, is demonstrated. Phase&#8208;purity is enabled by the presence of sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;sized seeds in the precursor&#8208;solution that preserves the memory of the dissolved single&#8208;crystals. A photovoltaic efficiency of 17.1% with a VOC of 1.20 V and stability T97.5 = 800 h at MPP is reported.








Abstract
2D perovskites are a class of halide perovskites offering a pathway for realizing efficient and durable optoelectronic devices. However, the broad chemical phase space and lack of understanding of film formation have led to quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films with polydispersity in perovskite layer thicknesses, which have hindered device performance and stability. Here, a simple and scalable approach is reported, termed as the &#8220;phase&#8208;selective method&#8221;, to fabricate 2D perovskite thin films with homogenous layer thickness (phase purity). The phase&#8208;selective method involves the dissolution of single&#8208;crystalline powders with a homogeneous perovskite layer thickness in desired solvents to fabricate thin films. In situ characterizations reveal the presence of sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;sized seeds in solution that preserve the memory of the dissolved single crystals and dictate the nucleation and growth of grains with an identical thickness of the perovskite layers in thin films. Photovoltaic devices with a p&#8211;i&#8211;n architecture are fabricated with such films, which yield an efficiency of 17.1% enabled by an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.20 V,&#160;while preserving 97.5% of their peak performance after 800 h under illumination without any external thermal management.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Molecular Detection by Imaging of Centimeter&#8208;Scale Metasurfaces with a Deterministic Gradient Geometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive sensor that can detect an angstrom&#8208;thick layer of adsorbed molecules by imaging of centimeter&#8208;scale plasmonic metasurface is demonstrated. This novel sensing scheme is expected to be a promising platform for point&#8208;of&#8208;care and lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip applications, which can be realized using off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf monochromatic light sources and commercial image sensors.








Abstract
Highly sensitive detection of trace amounts of substances is crucial for broad applications in healthcare, environmental monitoring, antiterrorism, etc., where cost effectiveness and portability are often demanded. Here, an ultrasensitive sensor is reported that can detect an angstrom&#8208;thick layer of adsorbed molecules through image acquisition and processing. The sensor features a centimeter&#8208;scale plasmonic metasurface with spatially varying geometry, where the light scattering is dependent on both the adsorbed substances and spatial locations. When illuminated with narrowband light (such as from a light emitting diode), the intensity pattern recorded on the metasurface changes with the surface&#8208;adsorbed molecules, enabling label&#8208;free, sensitive, and spectrometer&#8208;free molecular detection. The centimeter&#8208;scale size of the sensing area interfaces well with consumer&#8208;level imaging sensors on mobile devices without the need for microscopic optics and offers a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio by leveraging the multimillion pixels for noise reduction. It is experimentally demonstrated that a single layer of Al2O3 molecules deposited on the sensor, with a thickness of approximately one angstrom, can be detected by analyzing the images taken of the sensing chip. Furthermore, by integrating the sensor into a microfluidic setup, quantitative detection of BSA/anti&#8208;BSA immune complex formation events is demonstrated, which agrees well with the Langmuir isotherm model.

         <title>Programmable Assembly of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated polymer properties depend intrinsically on polymer order, including crystallinity, orientation, morphology, domain size, and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Order can be programmed through covalent bonding, i.e., molecular design, or through processing techniques in solution or solid&#8208;state. This perspective serves as a guide to directing &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer assembly, control polymer order, and thereby control its optical, electronic, and mechanical properties.








Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated polymers have numerous applications due to their advantageous optoelectronic and mechanical properties. These properties depend intrinsically on polymer ordering, including crystallinity, orientation, morphology, domain size, and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Programming, or deliberately controlling the composition and ordering of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers by well&#8208;defined inputs, is a key facet in the development of organic electronics. Here, &#960;&#8208;conjugated programming is described at each stage of material development, stressing the links between each programming mode. Covalent programming is performed during polymer synthesis such that complex architectures can be constructed, which direct polymer assembly by governing polymer orientation, &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, and morphological length&#8208;scales. Solution programming is performed in a solvated state as polymers dissolve, aggregate, crystallize, or react in solution. Solid&#8208;state programming occurs in the solid state and is governed by polymer crystallization, domain segregation, or gelation. Recent progress in programming across these stages is examined, highlighting order&#8208;dependent features and assembly techniques that are unique to &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers. This should serve as a guide for delineating the many ways of directing &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer assembly to control ordering, structure, and function, enabling the further development of organic electronics.

         <title>Complex Metal Nanostructures with Programmable Shapes from Simple DNA Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile construction kit for the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of complex metal nanostructures with programmable shapes is presented. It uses different DNA elements that can be docked together to produce hollow mold superstructures for metal filling. Electrical and optical characterizations of the obtained metallic nanostructures explore their potential for the self&#8208;assembly of nanoelectronic and nanooptic devices.








Abstract
Advances in DNA nanotechnology allow the design and fabrication of highly complex DNA structures, uisng specific programmable interactions between smaller nucleic acid building blocks. To convey this concept to the fabrication of metallic nanoparticles, an assembly platform is developed based on a few basic DNA structures that can serve as molds. Programming specific interactions between these elements allows the assembly of mold superstructures with a range of different geometries. Subsequent seeded growth of gold within the mold cavities enables the synthesis of complex metal structures including tightly DNA&#8208;caged particles, rolling&#8208;pin&#8208; and dumbbell&#8208;shaped particles, as well as T&#8208;shaped and loop particles with high continuity. The method further supports the formation of higher&#8208;order assemblies of the obtained metal geometries. Based on electrical and optical characterizations, it is expected that the developed platform is a valuable tool for a self&#8208;assembly&#8208;based fabrication of nanoelectronic and nanooptic devices.

         <title>Design Principles and Applications of Next&#8208;Generation High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Batteries Based on Liquid Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of applications on low&#8208;melting&#8208;temperature liquid metals in next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries is presented in this review. Starting from the theoretical basis of materials properties and electrochemical features with liquid metals and alloys, reported applications are summarized by working mechanisms, critically evaluated with strengths and issues, and proposed with future development directions in the field.








Abstract
Increasing need for the renewable energy supply accelerated the thriving studies of Li&#8208;ion batteries, whereas if the high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li as well as alkali metals should be adopted as battery electrodes is still under fierce debate for safety concerns. Recently, a group of low&#8208;melting temperature metals and alloys that are in liquid phase at or near room&#8208;temperature are being reported for battery applications, by which the battery energy could be improved without significant dendrite issue. Besides the dendrite&#8208;free feature, liquid metals can also promise various high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery designs on the basis of unique materials properties. In this review, the design principles for liquid metals&#8208;based batteries from mechanical, electrochemical, and thermodynamical aspects are provided. With the understanding of the theoretical basis, currently reported relevant designs are summarized and analyzed focusing on the working mechanism, effectiveness evaluation, and novel application. An overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art liquid metal battery developments and future prospects is also provided in the end as a reference for further research explorations.

         <title>Nanostructure Engineering and Modulation of (Oxy)Nitrides for Application in Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of bulk structure, size, morphology, and surface/interface properties on the basic processes, particularly for the charge separation of (oxy)nitride&#8208;based nanophotocatalysts, are systematically described, with the aim of understanding the development of methodologies and strategies for modulating the bulk and composite nanostructures to improve the solar energy conversion efficiencies of the (oxy)nitrides.








Abstract
(Oxy)nitride&#8208;based nanophotocatalysts have been extensively investigated for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion, and not only allow wide spectral utilization to achieve high theoretical energy conversion efficiency but also exhibit suitable conduction and valence band positions for robust reduction and oxidation of water. During the past decades, a few reviews on the research progress in designing and synthesizing new visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive semiconductors for various applications in solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion have been published. However, those on the effects of their bulk and composite (surface/interface) nanostructures on basic processes as well as solar water splitting performances to produce hydrogen are still limited. In this review, a brief introduction on the relationship between the nanostructure photocatalytic properties is included. Three main processes of solar water splitting are involved, allowing the elucidation of the correlation with the nanostructural properties of the photocatalyst such as surface/interface, size, morphology, and bulk structure. Subsequently, the development of methodologies and strategies for modulating the bulk and composite structures to improve the efficiencies of the basic processes, particularly charge separation, is summarized in detail. Finally, the prospects of (oxy)nitride&#8208;based photocatalysts such as controlled synthesis, modulation of 1D/2D morphology, exposed facet regulation, heterostructure formation, theoretical simulation, and time&#8208; and space&#8208;resolved spectroscopy are discussed.

         <title>Nanoarchitectured Porous Conducting Polymers: From Controlled Synthesis to Advanced Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductive polymers (CPs) exhibit the characteristics of conventional polymers and the electrical properties of metals. This review covers the recent advances in the development and utilization of CPs for energy, sensing, and bioapplications. Particular emphasis is given on the tuning of their structural parameters to optimize their performance. Finally, the current challenges and future outlook in this field are summarized.








Abstract
Conductive polymers (CPs) integrate the inherent characteristics of conventional polymers and the unique electrical properties of metals. They have aroused tremendous interest over the last decade owing to their high conductivity, robust and flexible properties, facile fabrication, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Compared to bulk CPs, porous CPs with well&#8208;defined nano&#8208; or microstructures possess open porous architectures, high specific surface areas, more exposed reactive sites, and remarkably enhanced activities. These attractive features have led to their applications in sensors, energy storage and conversion devices, biomedical devices, and so on. In this review article, the different strategies for synthesizing porous CPs, including template&#8208;free and template&#8208;based methods, are summarized, and the importance of tuning the morphology and pore structure of porous CPs to optimize their functional performance is highlighted. Moreover, their representative applications (energy storage devices, sensors, biomedical devices, etc.) are also discussed. The review is concluded by discussing the current challenges and future development&#160;trend&#160;in&#160;this&#160;field.

         <title>Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Loss in Lead Chalcogenide Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current high&#8208;efficiency lead chalcogenide colloidal quantum dot solar cells still have high Voc loss, which places great restrictions on the performance enhancement. The origin of Voc loss from solar absorber and interface is discussed in detail and various strategies for reducing the loss are summarized. Moreover, promising research directions are provided to further improve the solar cell performance.








Abstract
Lead chalcogenide colloidal quantum dot solar cells (CQDSCs) have received considerable attention due to their broad and tunable absorption and high stability. Presently, lead chalcogenide CQDSC has achieved a power conversion efficiency of &#8776;14%. However, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lead chalcogenide CQDSC still has an open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) loss of &#8776;0.45&#160;V, which is significantly higher than those of c&#8208;Si and perovskite solar cells. Such high Voc loss severely limits the performance improvement and commercialization of lead chalcogenide CQDSCs. In this review, the Voc loss is first analyzed via detailed balance theory and the origin of Voc loss from both solar absorber and interface is summarized. Subsequently, various strategies for improving the Voc from the solar absorber, including the passivation strategies during the synthesis and ligand exchange are overviewed. The great impact of the ligand exchange process on CQD passivation is highlighted and the corresponding strategies to further reduce the Voc loss are summarized. Finally, various strategies are discussed to reduce interface Voc loss from charge transport layers. More importantly, the great potential of achieving performance breakthroughs via various organic hole transport layers is highlighted and the existing challenges toward commercialization are discussed.

         <title>Multifunctional Crosslinking&#8208;Enabled Strain&#8208;Regulating Crystallization for Stable, Efficient &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universality strain&#8208;regulation approach&#8212;crosslinking&#8208;enabled strain&#8208;regulating crystallization (CSRC)&#8212;is introduced to eliminate intrinsic tensile strain in perovskite film, which significantly boosts the perovskite solar cells&#8217; (PSCs) stability and performance. The CSRC approach precisely modulates the perovskite film strain through synchronous cooperation of perovskite crystallization manipulation and in situ chemical crosslinking process, as showcased with several types of crosslinking agents.







&#8203;

Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Formamidinium lead triiodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) but experiences intrinsic thermally induced tensile strain due to a higher phase&#8208;converting temperature, which is a critical instability factor. An in situ crosslinking&#8208;enabled strain&#8208;regulating crystallization (CSRC) method with trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMTA) is introduced to precisely regulate the top section of perovskite film where the largest lattice distortion occurs. In CSRC, crosslinking provides in situ perovskite thermal&#8208;expansion confinement and strain regulation during the annealing crystallization process, which is proven to be much more effective than the conventional strain&#8208;compensation (post&#8208;treatment) method. Moreover, CSRC with TMTA successfully achieves multifunctionality simultaneously: the regulation of tensile strain, perovskite defects passivation with an enhanced open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC&#160;= 50&#160;mV), and enlarged perovskite grain size. The CSRC approach gives significantly enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.39% in &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3&#8208;based PSC versus 20.29% in the control case. More importantly, the control PSCs&#8217; instability factor&#8212;residual tensile strain&#8212;is regulated into compression strain in the CSRC perovskite film through TMTA crosslinking, resulting in not only the best PCE but also outstanding device stability in both long&#8208;term storage (over 4000 h with 95% of initial PCE) and light soaking (1248 h with 80% of initial PCE) conditions.

How to achieve simulated microgravity conditions on Earth? The art of growing and processing 2D porous crystalline molecular frameworks in simulated microgravity is presented.








Abstract
To date, crystallization studies conducted in space laboratories, which are prohibitively costly and unsuitable to most research laboratories, have shown the valuable effects of microgravity during crystal growth and morphogenesis. Herein, an easy and highly efficient method is shown to achieve space&#8208;like experimentation conditions on Earth employing custom&#8208;made microfluidic devices to fabricate 2D porous crystalline molecular frameworks. It is confirmed that experimentation under these simulated microgravity conditions has unprecedented effects on the orientation, compactness and crack&#8208;free generation of 2D porous crystalline molecular frameworks as well as in their integration and crystal morphogenesis. It is believed that this work will provide a new &#8220;playground&#8221; to chemists, physicists, and materials scientists that desire to process unprecedented 2D functional materials and devices.

         <title>Cells in Slow Motion: Apparent Undercooling Increases Glassy Behavior at Physiological Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heavy water (D2O) reversibly slows down cells, retards cell invasion, and drastically impacts cell mechanics possibly prolonging storage times for biological materials. Cellular dynamics transform into slow motion, which can be captured via the time&#8211;temperature superposition principle, where temperature is replaced by D2O. Induced changes are fully reversible and effects are independent of signaling/expression.








Abstract
Solvent conditions are unexpectedly sufficient to drastically and reversibly slow down cells. In vitro on the molecular level, protein&#8211;solvent interactions drastically change in the presence of heavy water (D2O) and its stronger hydrogen bonds. Adding D2O to the cell medium of living cells increases the molecular intracellular viscosity. While cell morphology and phenotype remain unchanged, cellular dynamics transform into slow motion in a changeable manner. This is exemplified in the slowdown of cell proliferation and migration, which is caused by a reversible gelation of the cytoplasm. In analogy to the time&#8211;temperature superposition principle, where temperature is replaced by D2O, an increase in viscosity slows down the effective time. Actin networks, crucial structures in the cytoplasm, switch from a power&#8208;law&#8208;like viscoelastic to a more rubber&#8208;like elastic behavior. The resulting intracellular resistance and dissipation impair cell movement. Since cells are highly adaptive non&#8208;equilibrium systems, they usually respond irreversibly from a thermodynamic perspective. D2O induced changes, however, are fully reversible and their effects are independent of signaling as well as expression. The stronger hydrogen bonds lead to glass&#8208;like, drawn&#8208;out intramolecular dynamics, which may facilitate longer storage times of biological matter, for instance, during transport of organ transplants.

         <title>Upregulating Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Nanoparticles with Blood&#8211;Tumor&#8208;Barrier Permeability for Precise Photothermal Eradication of Brain Tumors and Induction of Local Immune Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional biocompatible nanoplatform based on bradykinin (BK) aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission nanoparticles (BK@AIE NPs) can specifically target brain tumors, penetrate through the blood&#8211;tumor barrier, perform photothermal therapy (PTT), and simultaneously activate the local immune system for very effective synergetic brain cancer therapy. Moreover, BK@AIE NPs&#8208;mediated PTT can eliminate cancer stem cells&#8217; recurrence associated with conventional therapy, for cancer treatment with highly improved efficacy.








Abstract
Compared to other tumors, glioblastoma (GBM) is extremely difficult to treat. Recently, photothermal therapy (PTT) has demonstrated advanced therapeutic efficacy; however, because of the relatively low tissue&#8208;penetration efficiency of laser light, its application in deep&#8208;seated tumors remains challenging. Herein, bradykinin (BK) aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission nanoparticles (BK@AIE NPs) are synthesized; these offer selective penetration through the blood&#8211;tumor barrier (BTB) and strong absorbance in the near&#8208;infrared region (NIR). The BK ligand can prompt BTB adenosine receptor activation, which enhances transportation and accumulation inside tumors, as confirmed by T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance and fluorescence imaging. The BK@AIE NPs exhibit high photothermal conversion efficiency under 980&#160;nm NIR laser irradiation, facilitating the treatment of deep&#8208;seated tumors. Tumor progression can be effectively inhibited to extend the survival span of mice after spatiotemporal PTT. NIR irradiation can eradicate tumor tissues and release tumor&#8208;associated antigens. It is observed that the PTT treatment of GBM&#8208;bearing mice activates natural killer cells, CD3+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and M1 macrophages in the GBM area, increasing the therapeutic efficacy. This study demonstrates that NIR&#8208;assisted BK@AIE NPs represent a promising strategy for the improved systematic elimination of GBMs and the activation of local brain immune privilege.

         <title>A Bottom&#8208;Up Approach to Red&#8208;Emitting Molecular&#8208;Based Nanoparticles with Natural Stealth Properties and their Use for Single&#8208;Particle Tracking Deep in Brain Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent organic nanoparticles displaying intrinsic stealth properties toward biological membranes are prepared by nanoprecipitation of a hydrophobic, conjugated, red&#8208;emitting quadrupolar dye. The excellent brightness, stability, and size control down to &#8776;10&#160;nm of these nanoparticles allow for single&#8208;particle tracking deep in brain tissue. These findings point to a novel route for the bottom&#8208;up molecular design of the nano&#8211;bio interface.








Abstract
Fluorescent nanoparticles dedicated to bioimaging applications should possess specific properties that have to be maintained in the aqueous, reactive, and crowded biological environment. These include chemical and photostability, small size (on the scale of subcellular structures), biocompatibility, high brightness, and good solubility. The latter is a major challenge for inorganic nanoparticles, which require surface coating to be made water soluble. Molecular&#8208;based fluorescent organic nanoparticles (FONs) may prove a promising, spontaneously water&#8208;soluble alternative, whose bottom&#8208;up design allows for the fine&#8208;tuning of individual properties. Here, the critical challenge of controlling the interaction of nanoparticles with cellular membranes is addressed. This is a report on bright, size&#8208;tunable, red&#8208;emitting, naturally stealthy FONs that do not require the use of antifouling agents to impede interactions with cellular membranes. As a proof of concept, single FONs diffusing up to 150&#160;&#181;m deep in brain tissue are imaged and tracked.

Abstract
Epitaxial growth gives the highest&#8208;quality crystalline semiconductor thin films for optoelectronic devices. Here, a universal solution&#8208;processed bottom&#8208;up quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth of highly oriented &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead triiodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) perovskite film via a two&#8208;step method is reported, in which the crystal orientation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 film is precisely controlled through the synergetic effect of methylammonium chloride and the large&#8208;organic cation butylammonium bromide. In situ GIWAXS visualizes the BA&#8208;related intermediate phase formation at the bottom of film, which serves as a guiding template for the bottom&#8208;up quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth in the subsequent annealing process. The template&#8208;guided epitaxially grown BAFAMA perovskite film exhibits increased crystallinity, preferred crystallographic orientation, and reduced defects. Moreover, the BAFAMA perovskite solar cells demonstrate decent stability, maintaining 95% of their initial power conversion efficiency after 2600&#160;h ambient storage, and 4&#8208;time operation condition lifetime enhancement.

A cross&#8208;substitution process is used to design 2D ultrawide&#8208;bandgap semiconductor GaPS4 by employing GeS2 as a similar structural model. Monolayer GaPS4 exhibits an ultrawide optical bandgap of 4.50&#160;eV. The polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors based on the GaPS4 material display high selectivity and linear dichroic ratio in the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet region.








Abstract
Exploring 2D ultrawide bandgap semiconductors (UWBSs) will be conductive to the development of next&#8208;generation nanodevices, such as deep&#8208;ultraviolet photodetectors, single&#8208;photon emitters, and high&#8208;power flexible electronic devices. However, a gap still remains between the theoretical prediction of novel 2D UWBSs and the experimental realization of the corresponding materials. The cross&#8208;substitution process is an effective way to construct novel semiconductors with the favorable parent characteristics (e.g., structure) and the better physicochemical properties (e.g., bandgap). Herein, a simple case is offered for rational design and syntheses of 2D UWBS GaPS4 by employing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art GeS2 as a similar structural model. Benefiting from the cosubstitution of Ge with lighter Ga and P, the GaPS4 crystals exhibit sharply enlarged optical bandgaps (few&#8208;layer: 3.94&#160;eV and monolayer: 4.50&#160;eV) and superior detection performances with high responsivity (4.89 A W&#8722;1), high detectivity (1.98&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones), and high quantum efficiency (2.39&#160;&#215;&#160;103%) in the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet region. Moreover, the GaPS4&#8208;based photodetector exhibits polarization&#8208;sensitive photoresponse with a linear dichroic ratio of 1.85 at 254&#160;nm, benefitting from its in&#8208;plane structural anisotropy. These results provide a pathway for the discovery and fabrication of 2D UWBS anisotropic materials, which become promising candidates for future solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet and polarization&#8208;sensitive sensors.

         <title>Engineering a Hydrogen&#8208;Sulfide&#8208;Based Nanomodulator to Normalize Hyperactive Photothermal Immunogenicity for Combination Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photothermal therapy (PTT), one of the most&#8208;potent cancer therapeutic strategies known, suffers from hyperactive immunity&#8208;related permanent tissue injury and high&#8208;profile tumor regeneration. In this scenario, a hydrogen sulfide donor to PTT via an amphiphilic conjugated polymer (CP) (2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl tetrasulfide@CP&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol)) is integrated, for advanced NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;guided inflammatory modulation. The regulated inflammation preserves photothermal immunogenicity and promotes hyperthermia&#8208;induced wound healing concurrently.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT), one of the most&#8208;potent cancer therapeutic strategies known, is highlighted with excessive inflammatory response, while ablating cancer with immunogenic death. This hyperactive immune response may override PTT&#8208;triggered immunogenicity, exacerbate skin empyrosis, and incur permanent tissue injury and high&#8208;profile tumor regeneration. Therefore, an anticancer balance between pathological and protective immune response is urgently needed for an advanced photothermal therapeutic tactic. Herein, a gas&#8208;modulated photothermal immunogenicity strategy is proposed by integrating an amphiphilic&#8208;conjugated polymer with a polysulfide&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor (2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl tetrasulfide@CP&#8208;PEG) (where CP = conjugated polymer and PEG = poly(ethylene glycol)). The CP is endowed with NIR&#8208;II fluorescence capacity and favorable photothermal effect, tracing the tumor for precise therapeutics. The polysulfide donor can release H2S triggered by intracellular glutathione, which elicits mitochondrial dysfunction and robust anti&#8208;inflammation effect. Ultimately, this gas&#8208;modulated PTT strategy inhibits tumor growth remarkably and limits the magnitude of PTT&#8208;induced proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor&#8208;alpha (TNF&#8208;&#945;), interleukin&#8208;6 (IL&#8208;6), and interleukin&#8208;1beta (IL&#8208;1&#946;) cytokines. Moreover, the regulated inflammation accelerates PTT&#8208;induced wound healing. A H2S&#8208;modulated PTT with adaptive immune response is thus recommended as an advanced strategy to cancer therapeutics.

A top&#8208;level design strategy assisted by density functional theory is reported to guide and design advanced high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts and their enhanced catalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance is successfully predicted. A new low&#8208;temperature electrochemical reconstruction method is developed to fabricate the as&#8208;predicted high&#8208;entropy catalysts. The as&#8208;prepared high&#8208;entropy Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalyst exhibits exceptional electrocatalytic OER performance, consistent with theory calculations.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials are new&#8208;generation electrocatalysts for water splitting due to their excellent reactivity and highly tailorable electrochemical properties. Herein, a powerful top&#8208;level design strategy is reported to guide and design advanced high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts by establishing reaction models (e.g., reaction energy barrier, conductivity, adsorption geometries for intermediates, and rate&#8208;determining step) to predict performance with the help of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Accordingly, novel high&#8208;entropy Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalysts are fabricated by a new low&#8208;temperature electrochemical reconstruction method and their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties are thoroughly characterized. These as&#8208;prepared quaternary metallic (oxy)hydroxides present much better OER performance than ternary Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide, Co&#8211;Fe&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide, and other counterparts, and are demonstrated with a low overpotential of 199&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a 48.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 Tafel slope in 1 m KOH and excellent stability without decay over 72 h. The performance enhancement mechanism is also unraveled by synchrotron radiation. The work verifies the usefulness of high&#8208;entropy design and the great synergistic effect on OER performance by the incorporation of four elements, and also provides a new method for the construction of advanced high&#8208;entropy materials for energy conversion and storage.

         <title>Polymeric Microparticles Generated via Confinement&#8208;Free Fluid Instability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexplored facile and scalable polymeric microparticle fabrication strategy via confinement&#8208;free fluid instability induced by an ultralow&#8208;surface&#8208;energy layer is reported. This method can be applied to a variety of polymers with a wide range of sizes. This research introduces an intriguing phenomenon in fluid dynamics on superamphiphobic surfaces, which should lead to more exciting discoveries in the future.








Abstract
In&#8208;fiber fluid instability can be harnessed to realize scalable microparticles fabrication with tunable sizes and multifunctional characteristics making it competitive in comparison to conventional microparticles fabrication methods. However, since in&#8208;fiber fluid instability has to be induced via thermal annealing and the resulting microparticles can only be collected after dissolving the fiber cladding, obtaining contamination&#8208;free particles for high&#8208;temperature incompatible materials remains great challenge. Herein, confinement&#8208;free fluid instability is demonstrated to fabricate polymeric microparticles in a facile manner induced by the ultralow surface energy of the superamphiphobic surface. The polymer solution columns break up into uniform droplets then form spherical particles spontaneously in seconds at ambient temperature. This method can be applied to a variety of polymers spanning an exceptionally wide range of sizes: from 1&#160;mm down to 1&#160;&#181;m. With the aid of microfluidic spinning instrument, a large quantity of microparticles can be obtained, making this method promising for scaling up production. Notably, through simple modification of the feed solution configuration, composite/structured micromaterials can also be produced, including quantum&#8208;dots&#8208;labeled fluorescent particles, magnetic particles, core&#8211;shell particles, microcapsules, and necklace&#8208;like microfibers. This method, with general applicability and facile control, is envisioned to have great prospects in the field of polymer microprocessing.

An MXene/BP&#8208;based self&#8208;powered smart sensor system can be created by integrating a flexible pressure sensor with direct&#8208;laser&#8208;writing micro&#8208;supercapacitors and solar cells. The smart sensor system exhibits a detection capability for the state of the human heart under physiological conditions. The MXene materials design and system integration developed in this work offers a general platform for next&#8208;generation self&#8208;powered electronics.








Abstract
Accurate and continuous detection of physiological signals without the need for an external power supply is a key technology for realizing wearable electronics as next&#8208;generation biomedical devices. Herein, it is shown that a MXene/black phosphorus (BP)&#8208;based self&#8208;powered smart sensor system can be designed by integrating a flexible pressure sensor with direct&#8208;laser&#8208;writing micro&#8208;supercapacitors and solar cells. Using a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) self&#8208;assembly process to form a periodic interleaving MXene/BP lamellar structure results in a high energy&#8208;storage capacity in a direct&#8208;laser&#8208;writing micro&#8208;supercapacitor to drive the operation of sensors and compensate the intermittency of light illumination. Meanwhile, with MXene/BP as the sensitive layer in a flexible pressure sensor, the pressure sensitivity of the device can be improved to 77.61 kPa&#8211;1 at an optimized elastic modulus of 0.45&#160;MPa. Furthermore, the smart sensor system with fast response time (10.9&#160;ms) shows a real&#8208;time detection capability for the state of the human heart under physiological conditions. It is believed that the proposed study based on the design and integration of MXene materials will provide a general platform for next&#8208;generation self&#8208;powered electronics.

         <title>Capillary&#8208;Force&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly of 4D&#8208;Printed Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible and bidirectional self&#8208;assembly of microstructures is realized by two&#8208;photon&#8208;lithography&#8208;based 4D microprinting for reversible pattern/encapsulation, switchable wetting, and the dynamic actuation of microrobots/micromachines. In different evaporating solvents, the 4D&#8208;printed microstructures can exhibit three reversible geometries: (I) curved state, (II) distance&#8208;dependent coalesced clusters via traditional self&#8208;assembly, and (III) distance&#8208;independent arbitrary self&#8208;assemblies (4D self&#8208;assemblies) toward the curving directions.








Abstract
Capillary&#8208;force&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly is emerging as a significant approach for the massive manufacture of advanced materials with novel wetting, adhesion, optical, mechanical, or electrical properties. However, academic value and practical applications of the self&#8208;assembly are greatly restricted because traditional micropillar self&#8208;assembly is always unidirectional. In this work, two&#8208;photon&#8208;lithography&#8208;based 4D microprinting is introduced to realize the reversible and bidirectional self&#8208;assembly of microstructures. With asymmetric crosslinking densities, the printed vertical microstructures can switch to a curved state with controlled thickness, curvature, and smooth morphology that are impossible to replicate by traditional 3D&#8208;printing technology. In different evaporating solvents, the 4D&#8208;printed microstructures can experience three states: (I) coalesce into clusters from original vertical states via traditional self&#8208;assembly, (II) remain curved, or (III) arbitrarily self&#8208;assemble (4D self&#8208;assembly) toward the curving directions. Compared to conventional approaches, this 4D self&#8208;assembly is distance&#8208;independent, which can generate varieties of assemblies with a yield as high as 100%. More importantly, the three states can be reversibly switched, allowing the development of many promising applications such as reversible micropatterns, switchable wetting, and dynamic actuation of microrobots, origami, and encapsulation.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Like Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Melamine&#8211;Cyanuric Acid Supramolecular Nanosheets as Pseudo&#8208;Porous Catalyst Support</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular network consisting of melamine and cyanuric acid is fabricated as ultrathin nanosheets with extraordinary stability at pH = 0, serving as a pseudo&#8208;porous catalyst support to simultaneously give remarkable enhancement in the catalytic stability and activity of metal phosphides for the hydrogen evolution reaction in strong acidic conditions.








Abstract
Behaving as structural protectors and electronic modulators, catalyst supports such as graphene derivatives are generally constructed by covalent bonds. Here, hydrogen&#8208;bonded ultrathin nanosheets are reported as a new type of catalyst support. Melamine (M) and cyanuric acid (CA) molecules self&#8208;assemble to form the graphite&#8208;like hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystal M&#8208;CA, which can be easily exfoliated by ultrasonic treatment to yield ultrathin nanosheets with thickness of &#8776;1.6 nm and high stability at pH = 0. The dynamic nanosheets form adaptive defects/pores in the synthetic process of CoP nanoparticles, giving embedded composite with high hydrogen evolution activity (overpotential of 66 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2) and stability. Computational calculations, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy unveil the electron modulation effects of the nanosheets. This pseudo&#8208;porous catalyst support also can be applied to other metal phosphides.

         <title>Polymer Dielectrics with Simultaneous Ultrahigh Energy Density and Low Loss</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zwitterion&#8208;functionalized polymers are synthsized with a record&#8208;high breakdown strength of 1300 MV&#160;m&#8722;1, energy density above 35 J&#160;cm&#8722;3, and charge&#8211;discharge efficiency of &gt;90%, taking advantage of the covalent&#8208;bonding&#8208;restricted ion polarization and the charge trapping of the ion cluster phase.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics are highly desirable in capacitor applications due to their low cost, high breakdown strength, and unique self&#8208;healing capability. However, existing polymer dielectrics suffer from either a low energy density or a high dielectric loss, thereby hindering the development of compact, efficient, and reliable power electronics. Here, a novel type of polymer dielectrics simultaneously exhibiting an extraordinarily high recoverable energy density of 35 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and a low dielectric loss is reported. It is synthesized by grafting zwitterions onto the short side chains of a poly(4&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;pentene) (PMP)&#8208;based copolymer, which increases its dielectric constant from &#8776;2.2 to &#8776;5.2 and significantly enhances its breakdown strength from &#8776;700 MV&#160;m&#8722;1 to &#8776;1300 MV&#160;m&#8722;1 while maintaining its low dielectric loss of &lt;0.002 and high charge&#8211;discharge efficiency of &gt;90%. Based on a combination of the phase&#8208;field method description of mesoscale structures, Maxwell equations, and theoretical analysis, it is demonstrated that the outstanding combination of high energy density and low dielectric loss of zwitterions&#8208;grafted copolymers is attributed to the covalent&#8208;bonding restricted ion polarization and the strong charge trapping by the zwitterions. This work represents a new strategy in polymer dielectrics for achieving simultaneous high energy density and low dielectric loss.

         <title>An Inorganic/Organic S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction H2&#8208;Production Photocatalyst and its Charge Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of a CdS/PT inorganic/organic S&#8208;scheme heterojunction not only leads to efficient charge separation and transfer, but also increased redox ability and enhanced stability for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Inspired by natural photosynthesis, constructing inorganic/organic heterojunctions is regarded as an effective strategy to design high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;The construction of a CdS/PT inorganic/organic S-scheme heterojunction not only leads to efficient charge separation and transfer, but also increased redox ability and enhanced stability for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by natural photosynthesis, constructing inorganic/organic heterojunctions is regarded as an effective strategy to design high-efficiency photocatalysts. Herein, a step (S)-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst is prepared by in situ growth of an inorganic semiconductor firmly on an organic semiconductor. A new pyrene-based conjugated polymer, pyrene-&lt;i&gt;alt&lt;/i&gt;-triphenylamine (PT), is synthesized via the typical Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reactions, and then employed as a substrate to anchor CdS nanocrystals. The optimized CdS/PT composite, coupling 2 wt% PT with CdS, exhibits a robust H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rate of 9.28 mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with continuous release of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bubbles, as well as a high apparent quantum efficiency of 24.3%, which is &#8776;8 times that of pure CdS. The S-scheme charge transfer mechanism between PT and CdS, is systematically demonstrated by photoirradiated Kelvin probe measurement and in situ irradiated X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. This work provides a protocol for preparing specific S-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts on the basis of inorganic/organic coupling.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Observation of Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov States in Superconducting Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The realization of Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov (YSR) states in graphene, a non&#8208;superconducting 2D material, and without the participation of magnetic atoms, is shown. Graphene is made superconducting by the proximity effect with Pb islands. These scanning tunneling microscopy experiments reveal the very special nature of these YSR states and constitute an unequivocal demonstration of carbon magnetism at graphene grain boundaries.








Abstract
When magnetic atoms are inserted inside a superconductor, the superconducting order is locally depleted as a result of the antagonistic nature of magnetism and superconductivity. Thereby, distinctive spectral features, known as Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states, appear inside the superconducting gap. The search for Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states in different materials is intense, as they can be used as building blocks to promote Majorana modes suitable for topological quantum computing. Here, the first observation of Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states in graphene, a non&#8208;superconducting 2D material, and without the participation of magnetic atoms, is reported. Superconductivity in graphene is induced by proximity effect brought by adsorbing nanometer&#8208;scale superconducting Pb islands. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy the superconducting proximity gap is measured in graphene, and Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states are visualized in graphene grain boundaries. The results reveal the very special nature of those Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states, which extends more than 20&#160;nm away from the grain boundaries. These observations provide the long&#8208;sought experimental confirmation that graphene grain boundaries host local magnetic moments and constitute the first observation of Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states in a chemically pure system.

         <title>Single&#8208;Cell Immunoblotting based on a Photoclick Hydrogel Enables High&#8208;Throughput Screening and Accurate Profiling of Exogenous Gene Expression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;cell transfection analysis chip (scTAC) is developed for expression screening, precise positioning of transfected cells, and immunoblotting analysis of multi&#8208;target proteins. scTAC allows for true single&#8208;cell up&#8208;sampling and enables the acquisition of continuous single&#8208;cell protein expression even in low co&#8208;expression scenarios. scTAC provides a powerful tool for the analysis of biological pathways after transfection of rare cells.








Abstract
Fast and accurate profiling of exogenous gene expression in host cells is crucial for studying gene function in cellular and molecular biology, but still faces the challenge of incomplete co&#8208;expression of reporter genes and target genes. Here, a single&#8208;cell transfection analysis chip (scTAC) is presented, which is based on the in situ microchip immunoblotting method, for rapid and accurate analysis of exogenous gene expression in thousands of individual host cells. scTAC not only can assign information of exogenous gene activity to specific transfected cells, but enables the acquisition of continuous protein expression even in low co&#8208;expression scenarios. It is demonstrated that scTAC can reveal the relationship of expression level between reporter genes and target genes, which is helpful for evaluating transient transfection strategy efficiency. The advantages of this method for the study of fusion protein expression and downstream protein expression in signaling pathway in rare cells are shown. Empirically, an EGFP&#8208;TSPAN8 fusion plasmid is transfected into MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells and the expressions of two cancer stemness biomarkers (ALDHA1 and SOX2) are analyzed. The scTAC method clearly reveals an interesting phenomenon that transfected adherent MCF&#8208;7 cells exhibit some stem cell characteristics, but they do not have stem cell appearance.

         <title>Multivalent Nanosheet Antibody Mimics for Selective Microbial Recognition and Inactivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent nanosheet artificial antibodies with high selectivity and strong binding affinity to pathogenic bacteria are created by spontaneous assembly of various tripeptide recognition phases on transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets. The luminescent antibody mimics can detect pathogenic bacteria at a single&#8208;cell level from human serum and urine and effectively inactivate them on wounds of infected mice for healing.








Abstract
Antibodies are widely used as recognition elements in sensing and therapy, but they suffer from poor stability, long discovery time, and high cost. Herein, a facile approach to create antibody mimics with flexible recognition phases and luminescent rigid scaffolds for the selective recognition, detection, and inactivation of pathogenic bacteria is reported. Tripeptides with a nitriloacetate&#8208;Cu group are spontaneously assembled on transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanosheets via coordination bonding, providing a diversity of TMD&#8208;tripeptide assembly (TPA) antibody mimics. TMD&#8208;TPA antibody mimics can selectively recognize various pathogenic bacteria with nanomolar affinities. The bacterial binding sites for TMD&#8208;TPA are identified by experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, revealing that the dynamic and multivalent interactions of artificial antibodies play a crucial role for their recognition selectivity and affinity. The artificial antibodies allow the rapid and selective detection of pathogenic bacteria at single copy in human serum and urine, and their effective inactivation for therapy of infected mice. This work demonstrates the potential of TMD&#8208;TPA antibody mimics as an alternative to natural antibodies for sensing and therapy.

         <title>Improving Image&#8208;Guided Surgical and Immunological Tumor Treatment Efficacy by Photothermal and Photodynamic Therapies Based on a Multifunctional NIR AIEgen</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrated surgery and phototheranostics employing nanoparticles based on a near&#8208;infrared aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) for image&#8208;guided synergistic tumor therapy are explored to overcome respective limitations and realize maximized therapeutic outcomes and minimized recurrences. Moreover, the combined treatment of AIEgen&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;mediated phototheranostics and programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 antibody significantly induces tumor elimination by enhancing the effect of immunotherapy.








Abstract
Multimodal therapy is attracting increasing attention to improve tumor treatment efficacy, but generally requires various complicated ingredients combined within one theranostic system to achieve multiple functions. Herein, a multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform based on a single aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogen (AIEgen), DDTB, is designed to integrate near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence, photothermal, photodynamic, and immunological effects. Intravenously injected AIEgen&#8208;based nanoparticles can efficiently accumulate in tumors with NIR fluorescence to provide preoperative diagnosis. Most of the tumors are excised under intraoperative fluorescence navigation, whereafter, some microscopic residual tumors are completely ablated by photodynamic and photothermal therapies for maximally killing the tumor cells and tissues. Up to 90% of the survival rate can be achieved by this synergistic image&#8208;guided surgery and photodynamic and photothermal therapies. Importantly, the nanoparticles&#8208;mediated photothermal/photodynamic therapy plus programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 antibody significantly induce tumor elimination by enhancing the effect of immunotherapy. This theranostic strategy on the basis of a single AIEgen significantly improves the survival of cancer mice with maximized therapeutic outcomes, and holds great promise for clinical cancer treatment.

A new wide&#8208;bandgap conjugated polymer, PBQx&#8208;TCl, exhibits 18% efficiency for outdoor application and 28.5% efficiency for indoor application. Simultaneously, the PBQx&#8208;TCl&#8208;based device also shows light&#8208;emitting function with broad emission ranges from 630 to 1000 nm and moderate external quantum efficiency approaching 0.2%.








Abstract
Exploring the intriguing bifunctional nature of organic semiconductors and investigating the feasibility of fabricating bifunctional devices are of great significance in realizing various applications with one device. Here, the design of a new wide&#8208;bandgap polymer named PBQx&#8208;TCl (optical bandgap of 2.05&#160;eV) is reported, and its applications in photovoltaic and light&#8208;emitting devices are studied. By fabricating devices with nonfullerene acceptors BTA3 and BTP&#8208;eC9, it is shown that the devices exhibit a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.0% under air mass 1.5G illumination conditions and an outstanding PCE of 28.5% for a 1 cm2 device and 26.0% for a 10 cm2 device under illumination from a 1000 lux light&#8208;emitting diode. In addition, the PBQx&#8208;TCl:BTA3&#8208;based device also demonstrates a moderate organic light&#8208;emitting diode performance with an electroluminescence external quantum efficiency approaching 0.2% and a broad emission range of 630&#8211;1000&#160;nm. These results suggest that the polymer PBQx&#8208;TCl&#8208;based devices exhibit outstanding photovoltaic performance and potential light&#8208;emitting functions.

         <title>Resonant Spin Transmission Mediated by Magnons in a Magnetic Insulator Multilayer Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By developing an epitaxial magnetic insulator heterotructure, the magnon&#8208;mediated resonant spin transmission enhancement effect is achieved, where transmission of magnon spin current can be increased by more than 1000% at selected frequencies. This novel effect can provide useful mechanisms for building future magnonic devices similar to their photonic counterparts such as antireflection coatings and Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavities.








Abstract
While being electrically insulating, magnetic insulators can behave as good spin conductors by carrying spin current with excited spin waves. So far, magnetic insulators are utilized in multilayer heterostructures for optimizing spin transport or to form magnon spin valves for reaching controls over the spin flow. In these studies, it remains an intensively visited topic as to what the corresponding roles of coherent and incoherent magnons are in the spin transmission. Meanwhile, understanding the underlying mechanism associated with spin transmission in insulators can help to identify new mechanisms that can further improve the spin transport efficiency. Here, by studying spin transport in a magnetic&#8208;metal/magnetic&#8208;insulator/platinum multilayer, it is demonstrated that coherent magnons can transfer spins efficiently above the magnon bandgap of magnetic insulators. Particularly the standing spin&#8208;wave mode can greatly enhance the spin flow by inducing a resonant magnon transmission. Furthermore, within the magnon bandgap, a shutdown of spin transmission due to the blocking of coherent magnons is observed. The demonstrated magnon transmission enhancement and filtering effect provides an efficient method for modulating spin current in magnonic devices.

         <title>From Chaos to Control: Programmable Crack Patterning with Molecular Order in Polymer Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cracks are normally classified as material failures to be prevented. A crack patterning strategy is described that allows freely programmable patterns of cracks guided by the alignment of liquid crystal polymer networks. This programmable cracking enables high&#8208;resolution patterning in a high&#8208;throughput manner without the use of expensive lithography procedures and may serve as an alternative fabrication strategy for various applications.








Abstract
Cracks are typically associated with the failure of materials. However, cracks can also be used to create periodic patterns on the surfaces of materials, as observed in the skin of crocodiles and elephants. In synthetic materials, surface patterns are critical to micro&#8208; and nanoscale fabrication processes. Here, a strategy is presented that enables freely programmable patterns of cracks on the surface of a polymer and then uses these cracks to pattern other materials. Cracks form during deposition of a thin film metal on a liquid crystal polymer network (LCN) and follow the spatially patterned molecular order of the polymer. These patterned sub&#8208;micrometer scale cracks have an order parameter of 0.98&#160;&#177; 0.02 and form readily over centimeter&#8208;scale areas on the flexible substrates. The patterning of the LCN enables cracks that turn corners, spiral azimuthally, or radiate from a point. Conductive inks can be filled into these oriented cracks, resulting in flexible, anisotropic, and transparent conductors. This materials&#8208;based processing approach to patterning cracks enables unprecedented control of the orientation, length, width, and depth of the cracks without costly lithography methods. This approach promises new architectures of electronics, sensors, fluidics, optics, and other devices with micro&#8208; and nanoscale features.

         <title>Spontaneous Pillaring of Pentasil Zeolites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spontaneous formation of self&#8208;pillared pentasil zeolites in the absence of any template is demonstrated via heterogeneous nucleation of sequentially branched nanosheets from amorphous precursors. These hierarchical zeolites have a large external surface area and high percentages of external acid sites, which markedly improves their catalytic performance. These findings highlight a facile method to reduce mass&#8208;transport limitations in nanoporous zeolites.








Abstract
Conventional methods to prepare hierarchical zeolites depend upon the use of organic structure&#8208;directing agents and often require multiple synthesis steps with limited product yield and Br&#248;nsted acid concentration. Here, it is shown that the use of MEL&#8208; or MFI&#8208;type zeolites as crystalline seeds induces the spontaneous formation of self&#8208;pillared pentasil zeolites, thus avoiding the use of any organic or branching template for the crystallization of these hierarchical structures. The mechanism of formation is evaluated by time&#8208;resolved electron microscopy to provide evidence for the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of sequentially branched nanosheets from amorphous precursors. The resulting hierarchical zeolites have large external surface area and high percentages of external acid sites, which markedly improves their catalytic performance in the Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation and methanol to hydrocarbons reactions. These findings highlight a facile, commercially viable synthesis method to reduce mass&#8208;transport limitations and improve the performance of zeolite catalysts.

         <title>Poor Stability of Li2CO3 in the Solid Electrolyte Interphase of a Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode Revealed by Cryo&#8208;Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>

Sulfur&#8208;containing additives cause the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in lithium&#8208;metal batteries to preferentially generate Li2SO4 and overlithiated lithium sulfate and lithium oxide, which encapsulates lithium carbonate in the middle, limiting SEI thickening and enhancing battery life by a factor of ten.








Abstract
The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) dictates the cycling stability of lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Here, direct atomic imaging of the SEI's phase components and their spatial arrangement is achieved, using ultralow&#8208;dosage cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. The results show that, surprisingly, a lot of the deposited Li metal has amorphous atomic structure, likely due to carbon and oxygen impurities, and that crystalline lithium carbonate is not stable and readily decomposes when contacting the lithium metal. Lithium carbonate distributed in the outer SEI also continuously reacts with the electrolyte to produce gas, resulting in a dynamically evolving and porous SEI. Sulfur&#8208;containing additives cause the SEI to preferentially generate Li2SO4 and overlithiated lithium sulfate and lithium oxide, which encapsulate lithium carbonate in the middle, limiting SEI thickening and enhancing battery life by a factor of ten. The spatial mapping of the SEI gradient amorphous (polymeric &#8594; inorganic &#8594; metallic) and crystalline phase components provides guidance for designing electrolyte additives.

&lt;p&gt;The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) dictates the cycling stability of lithium-metal batteries. Here, direct atomic imaging of the SEI's phase components and their spatial arrangement is achieved, using ultralow-dosage cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. The results show that, surprisingly, a lot of the deposited Li metal has amorphous atomic structure, likely due to carbon and oxygen impurities, and that crystalline lithium carbonate is not stable and readily decomposes when contacting the lithium metal. Lithium carbonate distributed in the outer SEI also continuously reacts with the electrolyte to produce gas, resulting in a dynamically evolving and porous SEI. Sulfur-containing additives cause the SEI to preferentially generate Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and overlithiated lithium sulfate and lithium oxide, which encapsulate lithium carbonate in the middle, limiting SEI thickening and enhancing battery life by a factor of ten. The spatial mapping of the SEI gradient amorphous (polymeric &#8594; inorganic &#8594; metallic) and crystalline phase components provides guidance for designing electrolyte additives.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Crack Programming: From Chaos to Control: Programmable Crack Patterning with Molecular Order in Polymer Substrates (Adv. Mater. 22/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cracking is typically an uncontrolled material failure process. In article number 2008434, Hyun Kim, Taylor H. Ware, and co&#8208;workers describe a process that enables unprecedented control of crack formation. By depositing thin&#8208;film chromium on photoaligned liquid&#8208;crystal polymer networks, patterns of cracks on the surface of a polymer can be freely programmed in a high&#8208;resolution and high&#8208;throughput manner. This crack programming process provides new opportunities for unconventional microfabrication. The image depicts light transmitted through a polymer film coated with chromium with azimuthally patterned cracks.

In article number 2008761, Congxin Xia, Zhongming Wei, and co&#8208;workers describe substitution with lighter elements significantly increasing the bandgap of GaPS4, and simultaneously inheriting its in&#8208;plain anisotropy. GaPS4 thus becomes a promising candidate material for solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet and polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors. The balance demonstrates the main idea of the cross&#8208;substitution, with edge&#8208;sharing [GeS4]&#8211;[GeS4] atomic packing in the left pan and the tetrahedra centered by lighter elements (Ga and P) forming the [GaS4]&#8211;[PS4] motif in the right pan.

         <title>Superconductivity in Graphene: Observation of Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov States in Superconducting Graphene (Adv. Mater. 22/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene is made superconducting with Pb islands by Iv&#225;n Brihuega and co&#8208;workers, as detailed in article number 2008113. At the same time, magnetic moments are introduced using naturally existing graphene grain boundaries. They show that both superconductivity and magnetism can coexist in graphene, generating exotic Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states. Those states provide a starting point to ultimately create graphene topological qubits, putting forward graphene as a potential platform for topological quantum computing.

         <title>Polyphenol&#8208;Containing Nanoparticles: Synthesis, Properties, and Therapeutic Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>

The synthesis, properties, and biomedical applications of polyphenol&#8208;containing nanomaterials are comprehensively reviewed. The problems in the current polyphenol&#8208;based nanosystems and the future research directions in this field are also discussed.








Abstract
Polyphenols, the phenolic hydroxyl group&#8208;containing organic molecules, are widely found in natural plants and have shown beneficial effects on human health. Recently, polyphenol&#8208;containing nanoparticles have attracted extensive research attention due to their antioxidation property, anticancer activity, and universal adherent affinity, and thus have shown great promise in the preparation, stabilization, and modification of multifunctional nanoassemblies for bioimaging, therapeutic delivery, and other biomedical applications. Additionally, the metal&#8722;polyphenol networks, formed by the coordination interactions between polyphenols and metal ions, have been used to prepare an important class of polyphenol&#8208;containing nanoparticles for surface modification, bioimaging, drug delivery, and disease treatments. By focusing on the interactions between polyphenols and different materials (e.g., metal ions, inorganic materials, polymers, proteins, and nucleic acids), a comprehensive review on the synthesis and properties of the polyphenol&#8208;containing nanoparticles is provided. Moreover, the remarkable versatility of polyphenol&#8208;containing nanoparticles in different biomedical applications, including biodetection, multimodal bioimaging, protein and gene delivery, bone repair, antibiosis, and cancer theranostics is also demonstrated. Finally, the challenges faced by future research regarding the polyphenol&#8208;containing nanoparticles are discussed.

         <title>Atomically Thin Quantum Spin Hall Insulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically thin quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators&#8212;a class of 2D topological insulators&#8212;promises to radically transform classical and quantum electronic device concepts. Advances in materials science and engineering are surveyed, alongside a theoretical description, and the future perspectives for electronic applications are discussed, including the quest to realizing Majorana&#8208;based topological quantum computing&#8212;the next frontier in QSH materials research.








Abstract
Atomically thin topological materials are attracting growing attention for their potential to radically transform classical and quantum electronic device concepts. Among them is the quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator&#8212;a 2D state of matter that arises from interplay of topological band inversion and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, with large tunable bulk bandgaps up to 800 meV and gapless, 1D edge states. Reviewing recent advances in materials science and engineering alongside theoretical description, the QSH materials library is surveyed with focus on the prospects for QSH&#8208;based device applications. In particular, theoretical predictions of nontrivial superconducting pairing in the QSH state toward Majorana&#8208;based topological quantum computing are discussed, which are the next frontier in QSH materials research.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Enhance Biomimetic Cascade Catalysis for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research progress on the design and construction of biomimetic cascade reaction systems that incorporate metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF), for signal amplification in biosensing, is summarized. Notably, the mechanisms for the improvement of catalytic activity and selectivity of the MOF&#8208;involving cascade systems are discussed in detail. In addition, the challenges and opportunities in the way of the further design and applications of cascade systems with MOFs are briefly put forward.








Abstract
Multiple enzymes&#8208;induced biological cascade catalysis guides efficient and selective substrate transformations in vivo. The biomimetic cascade systems, as ingenious strategies for signal transduction and amplification, have a wide range of applications in biosensing. However, the fragile nature of enzymes greatly limits their wide applications. In this regard, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with porous structures, unique nano/microenvironments, and good biocompatibility have been skillfully used as carriers to immobilize enzymes for shielding them against hash surroundings and improving the catalytic efficiency. For another, nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like properties and brilliant stabilities (nanozymes), have been widely applied to ameliorate the low stability of the enzymes. Inheriting the abovementioned merits of MOFs, the performances of MOFs&#8208;immboilized nanozymes could be significantly enhanced. Furthermore, in addition to carriers, some MOFs can also serve as nanozymes, expanding their applications in cascade systems. Herein, recent advances in the fabrication of efficient MOFs&#8208;involving enzymes/nanozymes cascade systems and biosensing applications are highlighted. Integrating diversified signal output modes, including colorimetry, electrochemistry, fluorescence, chemiluminescence, and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering, sensitive detection of various targets (including biological molecules, environmental pollutants, enzyme activities, and so on) are realized. Finally, challenges and opportunities about further constructions and applications of MOFs&#8208;involving cascade reaction systems are briefly put forward.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Bio&#8208;Chemo&#8208;Mechanical&#8208;Systems: Micromotors, Microfluidics, and Nanozymes for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micromotors, microfluidics, and nanozymes originated as independent disciplines&#8212;today, their convergence can help solve each discipline's challenges and lead to essential advantages in bioapplications. Nanozymes significantly expand the scope of chemical reactions and fuels of catalytic micromotors with integrated dynamic responses. Microfluidics is used to mass&#8208;produce micromotors with optimal size, compositions, and core&#8211;shell properties for biomedical imaging and theranostics.








Abstract
Wireless nano&#8208;/micromotors powered by chemical reactions and/or external fields generate motive forces, perform tasks, and significantly extend short&#8208;range dynamic responses of passive biomedical microcarriers. However, before micromotors can be translated into clinical use, several major problems, including the biocompatibility of materials, the toxicity of chemical fuels, and deep tissue imaging methods, must be solved. Nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like characteristics (e.g., catalase, oxidase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase), that is, nanozymes, can significantly expand the scope of micromotors&#8217; chemical fuels. A convergence of nanozymes, micromotors, and microfluidics can lead to a paradigm shift in the fabrication of multifunctional micromotors in reasonable quantities, encapsulation of desired subsystems, and engineering of FDA&#8208;approved core&#8211;shell structures with tuneable biological, physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. Microfluidic methods are used to prepare stable bubbles/microbubbles and capsules integrating ultrasound, optoacoustic, fluorescent, and magnetic resonance imaging modalities. The aim here is to discuss an interdisciplinary approach of three independent emerging topics: micromotors, nanozymes, and microfluidics to creatively: 1) embrace new ideas, 2) think across boundaries, and 3) solve problems whose solutions are beyond the scope of a single discipline toward the development of micro&#8208;bio&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical&#8208;systems for diverse bioapplications.

     alt="Micro-Bio-Chemo-Mechanical-Systems: Micromotors, Microfluidics, and Nanozymes for Biomedical Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Micromotors, microfluidics, and nanozymes originated as independent disciplines&#8212;today, their convergence can help solve each discipline's challenges and lead to essential advantages in bioapplications. Nanozymes significantly expand the scope of chemical reactions and fuels of catalytic micromotors with integrated dynamic responses. Microfluidics is used to mass-produce micromotors with optimal size, compositions, and core&#8211;shell properties for biomedical imaging and theranostics.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wireless nano-/micromotors powered by chemical reactions and/or external fields generate motive forces, perform tasks, and significantly extend short-range dynamic responses of passive biomedical microcarriers. However, before micromotors can be translated into clinical use, several major problems, including the biocompatibility of materials, the toxicity of chemical fuels, and deep tissue imaging methods, must be solved. Nanomaterials with enzyme-like characteristics (e.g., catalase, oxidase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase), that is, nanozymes, can significantly expand the scope of micromotors&#8217; chemical fuels. A convergence of nanozymes, micromotors, and microfluidics can lead to a paradigm shift in the fabrication of multifunctional micromotors in reasonable quantities, encapsulation of desired subsystems, and engineering of FDA-approved core&#8211;shell structures with tuneable biological, physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. Microfluidic methods are used to prepare stable bubbles/microbubbles and capsules integrating ultrasound, optoacoustic, fluorescent, and magnetic resonance imaging modalities. The aim here is to discuss an interdisciplinary approach of three independent emerging topics: micromotors, nanozymes, and microfluidics to creatively: 1) embrace new ideas, 2) think across boundaries, and 3) solve problems whose solutions are beyond the scope of a single discipline toward the development of micro-bio-chemo-mechanical-systems for diverse bioapplications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>
Recent advancements in the development of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) in the field of nanomedicine are reviewed. Following an overview of the properties of GQDs, progress in top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up synthesis methods is presented. Application of GQDs in various modes of bioimaging, biosensing, and therapy are also discussed, with a subsequent discussion of future directions.








Abstract
Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are carbon&#8208;based, nanoscale particles that exhibit excellent chemical, physical, and biological properties that allow them to excel in a wide range of applications in nanomedicine. The unique electronic structure of GQDs confers functional attributes onto these nanomaterials such as strong and tunable photoluminescence for use in fluorescence bioimaging and biosensing, a high loading capacity of aromatic compounds for small&#8208;molecule drug delivery, and the ability to absorb incident radiation for use in the cancer&#8208;killing techniques of photothermal and photodynamic therapy. Recent advances in the development of GQDs as novel, multifunctional biomaterials are presented with a focus on their physicochemical, electronic, magnetic, and biological properties, along with a discussion of technical progress in the synthesis of GQDs. Progress toward the application of GQDs in bioimaging, biosensing, and therapy is reviewed, along with a discussion of the current limitations and future directions of this exciting material.

         <title>Interphases, Interfaces, and Surfaces of Active Materials in Rechargeable Batteries and Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfaces provide reactive zones and interphases stabilize electronic device operation. Understanding and designing interfaces and interphases represents an effective and efficient way for developing high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries and perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;increasing demand for clean sustainable energy has driven tremendous worldwide investment in the design and exploration of new active materials for energy conversion and energy&#8208;storage devices. Tailoring the surfaces of and interfaces between different materials is one of the surest and best studied paths to enable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries and high&#8208;efficiency solar cells. Metal&#8208;halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are one of the most promising photovoltaic materials due to their unprecedented development, with their record power conversion efficiency (PCE) rocketing beyond 25% in less than 10 years. Such progress is achieved largely through the control of crystallinity and surface/interface defects. Rechargeable batteries (RBs) reversibly convert electrical and chemical potential energy through redox reactions at the interfaces between the electrodes and electrolyte. The (electro)chemical and optoelectronic compatibility between active components are essential design considerations to optimize power conversion and energy storage performance. A focused discussion and critical analysis on the formation and functions of the interfaces and interphases of the active materials in these devices is provided, and prospective strategies used to overcome current challenges are described. These strategies revolve around manipulating the chemical compositions, defects, stability, and passivation of the various interfaces of RBs and PSCs.

         <title>Theory and Ab Initio Calculation of Optically Excited States&#8212;Recent Advances in 2D Materials</title>

Abstract
Recent studies of the optical properties of 2D materials have reported unique phenomena and features that are absent in conventional bulk semiconductors. Many of these interesting properties, such as enhanced light&#8208;matter coupling, gate&#8208;tunable photoluminescence, and unusual excitonic optical selection rules arise from the nature of the two&#8208; and multi&#8208;particle excited states such as strongly bound Wannier excitons and charged excitons. The theory, modeling, and ab initio calculations of these optically excited states in 2D materials are reviewed. Several analytical and ab initio approaches are introduced. These methods are compared with each other, revealing their relative strength and limitations. Recent works that apply these methods to a variety of 2D materials and material&#8208;defect systems are then highlighted. Understanding of the optically excited states in these systems is relevant not only for fundamental scientific research of electronic excitations and correlations, but also plays an important role in the future development of quantum information science and nano&#8208;photonics.
