         <title>Constructing Oxygen&#8208;related Defects in Carbon Nanodots with Janus Optical Properties: Noninvasive NIR Fluorescent Imaging and Effective Photocatalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Noninvasive fluorescence (FL) imaging and high&#8208;performance photocatalytic therapy (PCT) are opposing optical properties that are difficult to combine in a single material system. Herein, we report a facile approach to introducing oxygen&#8208;related defects in carbon dots (CDs) via post&#8208;oxidation with 2&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid (IBX), in which some nitrogen atoms were substituted by oxygen atoms. Unpaired electrons in these oxygen&#8208;related defects rearranged the electronic structure of the oxidized carbon dots (ox&#8208;CDs), resulting in an emerging near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption band. These defects not only contributed to enhanced NIR bandgap emission but also acted as trappers for photoexcited electrons to promote efficient charge separation on the surface, leading to abundant photo&#8208;generated holes on the ox&#8208;CDs surface under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Under white LED torch irradiation, the photo&#8208;generated holes oxidized hydroxide to hydroxyl radicals in the acidification of the aqueous solution. In contrast, no hydroxyl radicals were detected in the ox&#8208;CDs aqueous solution under 730&#160;nm laser irradiation, indicating noninvasive NIR FL imaging potential. Utilizing the Janus optical properties of the ox&#8208;CDs, the in vivo NIR FL imaging of sentinel lymph nodes around tumors and efficient photothermal enhanced tumor PCT were demonstrated.

         <title>A Sodium Alginate&#8208;Based Multifunctional Nanoplatform for Synergistic Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Efficient hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment remains a significant challenge due to the inherent limitations of traditional strategies. The exploration of polysaccharides&#8217; natural immunity for immunotherapy of HCC has been rarely explored. For this purpose, we reported in this study facile construction of a multifunctional nanoplatform, biotinylated aldehyde alginate&#8208;doxorubicin nano micelle (BEA&#8208;C = N&#8208;DOX&#8208;M) for synergistic chemo&#8208;immunotherapy by the use of constant &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;mannuronic acid (M) units and modulated &#945;&#8208;L&#8208;guluronic acid (G) units in the alginate (ALG) structure. The constant M units show natural immunity and specific binding ability with mannose receptor (MR) via strong receptor&#8208;ligand interactions, and the modulated G units serve as highly reactive conjugation sites for biotin (Bio) and DOX. This formulation not only integrates natural immunity of ALG and ICD triggering function of DOX, but also shows dual targeting properties to HCC cells via MR and Bio receptor (BR)&#8208;mediated endocytosis pathways. Notably, BEA&#8208;C = N&#8208;DOX&#8208;M at an equivalent dose of 3&#160;mg/kg of DOX mediated tumor inhibitory efficiency 12.10% and 4.70% higher than free DOX and aldehyde alginate&#8208;doxorubicin nano micelle (ASA&#8208;C = N&#8208;DOX&#8208;M), respectively, in Hepa1&#8208;6 tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This study reported the first example of integrating natural immunity of ALG and ICD effect of anticancer drugs for enhanced chemo&#8208;immunotherapy of HCC.

         <title>Tunable organic active neural probe enabling near&#8208;sensor signal processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Neural recording systems have significantly progressed to provide an advanced understanding and treatment for neurological diseases. Flexible transistor&#8208;based active neural probes exhibit great potential in electrophysiology applications due to their intrinsic amplification capability and tissue&#8208;compliant nature. However, most current active neural probes exhibit bulky back&#8208;end connectivity since the output is current, and the development of an integrated circuit for voltage output is crucial for near&#8208;sensor signal processing at the abiotic/biotic interface. Here, we&#160;present inkjet&#8208;printed organic voltage amplifiers by monolithically integrating organic electrochemical transistors and thin&#8208;film polymer resistors on a single, highly flexible substrate for in vivo brain activity recording. Additive inkjet printing enables the seamless integration of multiple active and passive components on the somatosensory cortex, leading to significant noise reduction over the externally connected typical configuration. It also facilitates fine&#8208;tuning of the voltage amplification and frequency properties. We&#160;validate the organic voltage amplifiers as electrocorticography devices in a rat in vivo model, showing their ability to record local field potentials in an experimental model of spontaneous and epileptiform activity. Our&#160;results bring organic active neural probes to the forefront in applications where efficient sensory data processing is performed at sensor endpoints.

         <title>Enabling Highly Efficient and Thermal&#8208;stable Polymer Solar Cells through Semi&#8208;alloy Acceptors Composed of A Hinge&#8208;like Dimer: A Versatile Doping Protocol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The simultaneous improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and thermal stability is a critical scientific challenge in advancing the commercial applications of polymer solar cells. To address this challenge, we successfully designed and synthesized a dumbbell&#8208;shaped dimeric acceptor, DT19, and incorporated it as a third component into the PM1:BTP&#8208;eC9 system. This ternary strategy demonstrated a synergistic enhancement of the PCE and thermal stability of the host binary system. In particular, the PM1:BTP&#8208;eC9:DT19 system maintained a PCE of over 90% even after heating at 120&#176;C for 200 hours. Additionally, the dimer&#8208;doping ternary strategy exhibited excellent generality for the other four Y&#8208;series systems and outperformed ternary systems containing alloy&#8208;like acceptors in terms of thermal stability. It is because DT19, with its hinge&#8208;like structure, can form a semi&#8208;alloy acceptor with the host acceptor, leading to strong interchain entanglement with the polymer donor, thus overcoming phase separation and excessive aggregation under thermal stress. This new type of dimeric material, which can synergistically enhance the device efficiency and thermal stability of active layers, presents promising application prospects.

         <title>An Isomeric Solid Additive Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Polymer Solar Cells Developed Using a Benzo&#8208;Difuran&#8208;Based Donor Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficiency of benzo&#8208;difuran&#8208;based polymer&#8208;donor&#8208;enabled solar cells is improved a lot in this work thanks to rational material combination and isomeric solid additive type morphology tuning. A series of characterizations, in situ technique, vertical distribution calculation, transient absorption spectra, and GIWAXS/SAXS + RSoXS, reveal the basic mechanism, producing fruitful insights to this work with record efficiency.








Abstract
Currently, nearly all high&#8208;efficiency organic photovoltaic devices use donor polymers based on the benzo&#8208;dithiophene (BDT) unit. To diversify the choices of building blocks for high&#8208;performance donor polymers, the use of benzo&#8208;difuran (BDF) units is explored, which can achieve reduced steric hindrance, stronger molecular packing, and tunable energy levels. In previous research, the performance of BDF&#8208;based devices lagged behind those of BDT&#8208;based devices. In this study, a high efficiency (18.4%) is achieved using a BDF&#8208;based polymer donor, which is the highest efficiency reported for BDF donor materials to date. The high efficiency is enabled by a donor polymer (D18&#8208;Fu) and the aid of a solid additive (2&#8208;chloronaphthalene), which is the isomer of the commonly used additive 1&#8208;chloronaphthalene. These results revealed the significant effect of 2&#8208;chloronaphthalene in optimizing the morphology and enhancing the device parameters. This work not only provides a new building block that can achieve an efficiency comparable to dominant BDT units but also proposes a new solid additive that can replace the widely used 1&#8208;chloronaphthalene additive.

         <title>Fluorescence&#8208;Amplified Origami Microneedle Device for Quantitatively Monitoring Blood Glucose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through collaboratively integrating a microneedle patch and DNA&#8208;origami nanotubes, a fluorescence&#8208;amplified origami microneedle (FAOM) device enables the conversion from glucose to a proton signal. The proton&#8208;driven mechanical deformation of the DNA&#8208;origami structure leads to the fluorescence signal recovery. The FAOM device combines quantitative, accurate, trivially painful, and highly sensitive characteristics for real&#8208;time monitoring of blood glucose, thus improving test tolerance and patient's compliance.








Abstract
Exploration of clinically acceptable blood glucose monitors has been engaging in the past decades, yet the ability to quantitatively detect blood glucose in a painless, accurate, and highly sensitive manner remains limited. Herein, a fluorescence&#8208;amplified origami microneedle (FAOM) device is described that integrates tubular DNA&#8208;origami nanostructures and glucose oxidase molecules into its inner network to quantitatively monitor blood glucose. The skin&#8208;attached FAOM device can collect glucose molecules in situ and transfer the input into a proton signal after the oxidase's catalysis. The proton&#8208;driven mechanical reconfiguration of DNA&#8208;origami tubes separates fluorescent molecules and their quenchers, eventually amplifying the glucose&#8208;correlated fluorescence signal. The function equation established on clinical examinees suggests that FAOM can report blood glucose in a highly sensitive and quantitative manner. In clinical blind tests, the FAOM achieves well&#8208;matched accuracy (98.70&#160;&#177;&#160;4.77%) compared with a commercial blood biochemical analyzer, fully meeting the requirements of accurate blood glucose monitoring. The FAOM device can be inserted into skin tissue in a trivially painful manner and with minimal leakage of DNA origami, substantially improving the tolerance and compliance of the blood glucose test.

         <title>Ordering&#8208;Dependent Hydrogen Evolution and Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis of High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallic Pt4FeCoCuNi</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ordering transformation of high&#8208;entropy Pt4FeCoNiCu nanoparticles from disordered solid&#8208;solution alloy to ordered intermetallic structure is demonstrated across multiple scales. The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities are revealed to be ordering&#8208;dependent, and the highly ordered Pt4FeCoNiCu outperforms most other Pt&#8208;based catalysts for HER and ORR with robust durability.








Abstract
Disordered solid&#8208;solution high&#8208;entropy alloys have attracted wide research attention as robust electrocatalysts. In comparison, ordered high&#8208;entropy intermetallics have been hardly explored and the effects of the degree of chemical ordering on catalytic activity remain unknown. In this study, a series of multicomponent intermetallic Pt4FeCoCuNi nanoparticles with tunable ordering degrees is fabricated. The transformation mechanism of the multicomponent nanoparticles from disordered structure into ordered structure is revealed at the single&#8208;particle level, and it agrees with macroscopic analysis by selected&#8208;area electron diffraction and X&#8208;ray diffraction. The electrocatalytic performance of Pt4FeCoCuNi nanoparticles correlates well with their crystal structure and electronic structure. It is found that increasing the degree of ordering promotes electrocatalytic performance. The highly ordered Pt4FeCoCuNi achieves the highest mass activities toward both acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) which are 18.9&#8208;fold and 5.6&#8208;fold higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. The experiment also shows that this catalyst demonstrates better long&#8208;term stability than both partially ordered and disordered Pt4FeCoCuNi as well as Pt/C when subject to both HER and ORR. This ordering&#8208;dependent structure&#8211;property relationship provides insight into the rational design of catalysts and stimulates the exploration of many other multicomponent intermetallic alloys.

         <title>Recent Advances in Carbon Nanotube&#8208;Based Energy Harvesting Technologies</title>

         <dc:description>
Abstract
There has been enormous interest in technologies that generate electricity from ambient energy such as solar, thermal, and mechanical energy, due to their potential for providing sustainable solutions to the energy crisis. One driving force behind the search for new energy&#8208;harvesting technologies is the desire to power sensor networks and portable devices without batteries, such as self&#8208;powered wearable electronics, human health monitoring systems, and implantable wireless sensors. Various energy harvesting technologies have been demonstrated in recent years. Among them, electrochemical, hydroelectric, triboelectric, piezoelectric, and thermoelectric nanogenerators have been extensively studied because of their special physical properties, ease of application, and sometimes high obtainable efficiency. Multifunctional carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted much interest in energy harvesting because of their exceptionally high gravimetric power outputs and recently obtained high energy conversion efficiencies. Further development of this field, however, still requires an in&#8208;depth understanding of harvesting mechanisms and boosting of the electrical outputs for wider applications. We here comprehensively review various CNT&#8208;based energy harvesting technologies, focusing on working principles, typical examples, and future improvements. The last section discusses the existing challenges and future directions of CNT&#8208;based energy harvesters.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Percolated Networks Enabled by Low Loadings of Branched Nanorods for Enhanced H2 Separations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanorods with suitable aspect ratios are ideal for constructing percolated networks in polymers with low loadings and easiness to fabricate defect&#8208;free membranes, compared with nanoparticles and nanowires. This work demonstrates mixed matrix materials containing Pd&#8208;percolated networks enabled by 3.9&#160;vol% Pd branched nanorods, achieving H2/CO2 separation properties superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membrane materials and surpassing the upper bound.








Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs) at high loadings are often used in mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) to improve gas separation properties, but they can lead to defects and poor processability that impede membrane fabrication. Herein, it is demonstrated that branched nanorods (NRs) with controlled aspect ratios can significantly reduce the required loading to achieve superior gas separation properties while maintaining excellent processability, as demonstrated by the dispersion of palladium (Pd) NRs in polybenzimidazole for H2/CO2 separation. Increasing the aspect ratio from 1 for NPs to 40 for NRs decreases the percolation threshold volume fraction by a factor of 30, from 0.35 to 0.011. An MMM with percolated networks formed by Pd NRs at a volume fraction of 0.039 exhibits H2 permeability of 110&#160;Barrer and H2/CO2 selectivity of 31 when challenged with simulated syngas at 200&#160;&#176;C, surpassing Robeson's upper bound. This work highlights the advantage of NRs over NPs and nanowires and shows that right&#8208;sizing nanofillers in MMMs is critical to construct highly sieving pathways at minimal loadings. This work paves the way for this general feature to be applied across materials systems for a variety of chemical separations.

         <title>Nanoengineered design of inside&#8208;heating hot nanoreactor surrounded by cool&#160;environment for selective hydrogenations</title>

Abstract
Catalysts with designable intelligent nanostructure may potentially drive the changes of chemical reaction techniques. Herein, we designed a multi&#8208;function integrating nanocatalyst, Pt&#8208;containing magnetic yolk&#8208;shell carbonaceous structure, having catalysis function, microenvironment heating, thermal&#160;insulation and elevated pressure into a whole, which induces selective hydrogenation within heating&#8208;constrained nanoreactors surrounded by ambient environment.&#160;As a demonstration, carbonyl of &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes/ketones are selectively hydrogenated to unsaturated alcohols with a &gt;98% selectivity at a nearly complete conversion under mild conditions of 40&#160;&#176;C and 3&#160;bar instead of harsh requirements of 120&#160;&#176;C and 30&#160;bar. We creatively demonstrate that the locally increased temperature and endogenous pressure (estimated as &#8764;120&#160;&#176;C, 9.7&#160;bar) in the nano&#8208;sized space greatly facilitates the reaction kinetics under an alternating magnetic field. The outward&#8208;diffused products to the &#8220;cool environment&#8221; retain thermodynamically stable, avoiding the over&#8208;hydrogenation often occurs under constantly heated conditions of 120&#160;&#176;C. Regulation of the electronic state of Pt by sulfur doping of carbon allows selective chemical adsorption of the &#8208;C = O group and consequently leads to selective hydrogenation. It is expected that such a multi&#8208;function integrated catalyst provides an ideal platform for precisely operating a variety of organic liquid&#8208;phase transformations under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>A 2D Soft Covalent Organic Framework Membrane Prepared via&#160;a&#160;Molecular Bridge</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The soft 2D covalent organic framework membrane with more uniform pores is rapidly formed (&#8776;5&#160;min) based on the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) molecular channel (just like a molecular highway) constructed at the water/dichloromethane (DCM) interface. The formed COF membrane exhibits superb sieving capability for small molecules, strong chemical stability, and sufficient flexibility.








Abstract
Highly flexible and robust self&#8208;standing covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with rapid preparation are important but technically challenging for achieving precise separation. Herein , a novel imine&#8208;based 2D soft covalent organic framework (SCOF) membrane with a large area of 226.9&#160;cm2, via ingeniously selecting an aldehyde flexible linker and a trigonal building block, is reported. The soft 2D covalent organic framework membrane is rapidly formed (&#8776;5&#160;min) based on the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) molecular channel constructed at the water/dichloromethane (DCM) interface, which is the record&#8208;fast SCOF membrane formation and 72 times faster than that in the reported literature. MD simulation and DFT calculation elucidate that the dynamic, self&#8208;assembled SDS molecular channel facilitates faster and more homogeneous transfer of amine monomers in the bulk, thereby forming a soft 2D self&#8208;standing COF membrane with more uniform pores. The formed SCOF membrane exhibits superb sieving capability for small molecules, robustness in strong alkaline (5&#160;mol&#160;L&#8722;1 NaOH), acid (0.1&#160;mol&#160;L&#8722;1 HCl), and various organic solutions, and sufficient flexibility with a large curvature of 2000&#160;m&#8722;1 for membrane&#8208;based separation science and technology.

         <title>Achieving Highly Proton&#8208;Resistant Zn&#8208;Pb Anode through Low Hydrogen Affinity and Strong Bonding for Long&#8208;Life Electrolytic Zn//MnO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;energy electrolytic Zn//MnO2 batteries show potential for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, but the severe hydrogen evolution corrosion (HEC) caused by acidic electrolytes results in subdued durability. Here, we report an all&#8208;around protection strategy for achieving stable metal Zn anode. Firstly, a proton&#8208;resistant Pb&#8208;containing (Pb and Pb(OH)2) interface is constructed on Zn anode (denoted as Zn@Pb), which will in&#8208;situ form PbSO4 during H2SO4 corrosion and protect the Zn substrate from HEC. Secondly, to improve the plating/stripping reversibility of Zn@Pb, Pb(CH3COO)2 additive (denoted as Zn@Pb&#8208;Ad) is introduced, which will convert to PbSO4 precipitation and release trace Pb2+ that can dynamically deposit Pb layer on Zn plating layer to suppress HEC. The superior HEC resistance stems from the low affinity of PbSO4 and Pb for H+ as well as strong bonding between Pb&#8208;Zn or Pb&#8208;Pb, which increase the hydrogen evolution reaction overpotential and the H+ corrosion energy barrier. Consequently, the Zn@Pb&#8208;Ad//MnO2 battery runs stably for 630 and 795&#160;h in 0.2 and 0.1&#160;M H2SO4 electrolytes, respectively, which are &gt;40 times than that of bare Zn. The as&#8208;prepared A h&#8208;level battery achieves the one&#8208;month calendar life, opening the door to the next generation of high&#8208;durable grid&#8208;scale Zn batteries.

         <title>Exchange&#8208;Biased Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect is characterized by a dissipationless chiral edge state with a quantized Hall resistance at zero magnetic field. Manipulating the QAH state is of great importance in both the understanding of topological quantum physics and the implementation of dissipationless electronics. Here, we realized the QAH effect in the magnetic topological insulator Cr&#8208;doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 (CBST) grown on an uncompensated antiferromagnetic insulator Al&#8208;doped Cr2O3. Through polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR), we find a strong exchange coupling between CBST and Al&#8208;Cr2O3 surface spins fixing interfacial magnetic moments perpendicular to the film plane. The interfacial coupling results in an exchange&#8208;biased QAH effect. We further demonstrate that the magnitude and sign of the exchange bias can be effectively controlled using a field training process to set the magnetization of the Al&#8208;Cr2O3 layer. Our work demonstrates the use of the exchange bias effect to effectively manipulate the QAH state, opening new possibilities in QAH&#8208;based spintronics.

         <title>As&#8208;grown Miniaturized True Zero&#8208;order Waveplates Based on Low&#8208;dimensional Ferrocene Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As basic optical elements, waveplates with anisotropic electromagnetic responses are imperative for manipulating light polarization. Conventional waveplates are manufactured from bulk crystals (e.g., quartz and calcite) through a series of precision cutting and grinding steps, which typically result in large size, low yield, and high cost. In this study, we use a bottom&#8208;up method to grow ferrocene crystals with large anisotropy to demonstrate self&#8208;assembled ultrathin true zero&#8208;order waveplates without additional machining processing, which is particularly suited for nanophotonic integration. The van der Waals ferrocene crystals exhibit high birefringence (&#916;n (experiment) = 0.149&#8197; &#177; &#8197;0.002 at 636&#160;nm), low dichroism &#916;&#954; (experiment) = &#8208;0.0007 at 636&#160;nm), and a potentially broad operating range (550&#160;nm to 20&#160;&#956;m) as suggested by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. In addition, the grown waveplate's highest and the lowest principal axes (n1 and n3, respectively) are in the a&#8208;c plane, where the fast axis is along one natural edge of the ferrocene crystal, rendering them readily usable. The as&#8208;grown, wavelength&#8208;scale&#8208;thick waveplate allows the development of further miniaturized systems via tandem integration.

         <title>Two&#8208;Tailed Dynamic Covalent Amphiphile Combats Bacterial Biofilms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Drug combination provides an efficient pathway to combat drug resistance in bacteria and bacterial biofilms. However, the facile methodology to construct the drug combinations and their applications in nanocomposites is still lacking. Here we report the two&#8208;tailed antimicrobial amphiphiles (T2A2) composed of nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;donor (diethylenetriamine NONOate, DN) and various natural aldehydes. T2A2 self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles due to their amphiphilic nature, with remarkably low critical aggregation concentration. The representative cinnamaldehyde (Cin)&#8208;derived T2A2 (Cin&#8208;T2A2) assemblies demonstrate excellent bactericidal efficacy, notably higher than free Cin and free DN. Cin&#8208;T2A2 assemblies kill multidrug&#8208;resistant staphylococci and eradicate their biofilms via multiple mechanisms, as proved by mechanism studies, molecular dynamics simulations, proteomics, and metabolomics. Furthermore, Cin&#8208;T2A2 assemblies rapidly eradicate bacteria and alleviate inflammation in the subsequent murine infection models. Together, our Cin&#8208;T2A2 assemblies may provide an efficient, non&#8208;antibiotic alternative in combating the ever&#8208;increasing threat of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and their biofilms.

         <title>Nonlinear inflatable actuators for distributed control in soft robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As soft robotic systems grow in complexity and functionality, the size and stiffness of the needed control hardware severely limits their application potential. Alternatively, functionality can be embodied within actuator characteristics, drastically reducing the amount of peripherals. Functions such as memory, computation and energy storage then result from the intrinsic mechanical behavior of precisely designed structures. Here, we introduce actuators with tunable characteristics to generate complex actuation sequences from a single input. Intricate sequences are made possible by harnessing hysteron characteristics encoded in the buckling of a cone&#8208;shaped shell incorporated in the actuator design. A large variety of such characteristics are generated by varying the actuator geometry. We map this dependency and introduce a tool to determine the actuator geometry that yields a desired characteristic. Using this tool, we create a system with six actuators that plays the final movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with a single pressure supply.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Electrochemically Promoting Lithium Atom Diffusion and Relieving Accumulative Stress for Deep&#8208;Cycling Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) can double the energy density of lithium ion batteries. However, the notorious lithium dendrite growth and large volume change are not well addressed, especially under deep&#8208;cycling. Here, w e build an in&#8208;situ mechanical&#8208;electrochemical coupling system and find that tensile stress can induce smooth lithium deposition. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation and finite element method (FEM) simulation confirm the lithium atom diffusion energy barrier can be reduced when the lithium foils are under tensile strain. W e then incorporate tensile stress into lithium metal anodes by designing an adhesive copolymer layer attached to lithium in which the copolymer thinning can yield a tensile stress to the lithium foil. W e further prepared elastic lithium metal anode (ELMA) via introducing a 3D elastic conductive polyurethane (CPU) host for the copolymer&#8208;lithium bilayer to release accumulated internal stresses and resist volume variation. The ELMA can withstand hundreds of repeated compression&#8208;release cycles under 10% strain. LMBs paired with the ELMA and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode can operate beyond 250 cycles with 80% capacity retention under practical condition of 4 mAh cm&#8722;2 cathode capacity, 2.86&#160;g Ah&#8722;1 electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio (E/C) and 1.8 negative&#8208;to&#8208;cathode capacity ratio (N/P), 5 times of the life time using lithium foils.

         <title>Ultrafast&#8208;programmable two&#8208;dimensional homojunctions based on van der Waals heterostructures on a silicon substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of electrically ultrafast&#8208;programmable semiconductor homojunctions can lead to transformative multifunctional electronic devices. However, silicon&#8208;based homojunctions are not programmable so that alternative materials need to be explored. Here we&#160;demonstrate two&#8208;dimensional (2D), multi&#8208;functional, lateral homojunctions made of van der Waals heterostructures with a semi&#8208;floating&#8208;gate configuration on a p++ Si substrate feature atomically sharp interfaces and can be electrostatically programmed in nanoseconds, more than seven orders of magnitude faster than other 2D&#8208;based homojunctions. By applying voltage pulses with different polarities, lateral p&#8208;n, n+&#8208;n and other types of homojunctions can be formed, varied, and reversed. The p&#8208;n homojunctions possess a high rectification ratio up to &#8764;105 and can be dynamically switched between four distinct conduction states with the current spanning over nine orders of magnitude, enabling them to function as logic rectifiers, memories and multi&#8208;valued logic inverters. Built on a p++ Si substrate, which acts as the control gate, the devices are compatible with Si technology.

         <title>Precise&#8208;engineering of Se/Te Nanochaperone for Reinvigorating Cancer Radio&#8208;immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Facilely synthesized nanoradiosensitizers with well&#8208;controlled structure and multi&#8208;functionality are greatly desired to address the challenges of cancer radiotherapy. Herein, we develop a universal method for synthesizing chalcogen&#8208;based TeSe nanoheterojunctions with rod&#8208;, spindle&#8208; or dumbbell&#8208;like morphologies by engineering the surfactant and added selenite. Interestingly, dumbbell&#8208;shaped TeSe nanoheterojunctions (TeSe NDs) as chaperone exhibit better radio&#8208;sensitizing activities than the other two nanostructural shapes. Meanwhile, TeSe NDs can serve as cytotoxic chemodrugs that degraded to highly toxic metabolites in acidic environment and deplete GSH within tumor to facilitate radiotherapy. More importantly, the combination of TeSe NDs with radiotherapy significantly decreases regulatory T cells and M2&#8208;phenotype tumor&#8208;associated macrophage infiltrations within tumors to reshape the immunosuppressive microenvironment and induce robust T lymphocytes&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity, resulting in great abscopal effects on combating distant tumor progression. This study provides a universal method for preparing nanoheterojunction with well&#8208;controlled structure and developing nanoradiosensitizers to overcome the clinical challenges of cancer radiotherapy.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Molecular Fingerprint Retrieval Using Strongly Detuned Overcoupled Plasmonic Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tailoring light&#8208;matter interactions via plasmonic nanoantennas (PNAs) has emerged as a breakthrough technology for spectroscopic applications. The detuning between molecular vibrations and plasmonic resonances, as a fundamental and inevitable optical phenomenon in light&#8208;matter interactions, reduces the interaction efficiency resulting in the weak molecule sensing signal at the strong detuning state. Here, we&#160;demonstrate that the low interaction efficiency from detuning can be tackled by overcoupled PNAs (OC&#8208;PNAs) with a high ratio of the radiative to intrinsic loss rates, which can be used for ultrasensitive spectroscopy at strong plasmonic&#8208;molecular detuning. In OC&#8208;PNAs, the ultrasensitive molecule signals are achieved within a wavelength detuning range of 248 cm&#8722;1, which is 173 cm&#8722;1 wider than previous works. Meanwhile, the OC&#8208;PNAs are immune to the distortion of molecular signals and maintain the lineshape consistent with the molecular signature fingerprint. Our&#160;strategy allows a single device to enhance and capture the full and complex fingerprint vibrations in the mid&#8208;infrared range (6&#8208;14&#160;&#956;m). In the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, 13 kinds of molecules with some vibration fingerprints strongly detuning by the OC&#8208;PNAs are identified with 100% accuracy with the assistance of machine&#8208;learning algorithms. Our&#160;work gains new insights into detuning&#8208;state nanophotonics for potential applications including spectroscopy and sensors.

         <title>Surface Electronic Structure Engineering of Manganese Bismuth Tellurides Guided by Micro&#8208;Focused Angle&#8208;Resolved Photoemission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Modification of the electronic structure of quantum matter by ad atom deposition allows for directed fundamental design of electronic and magnetic properties. This concept is utilized in the present work in order to tune the surface electronic structure of magnetic topological insulators based on MnBi2Te4. The topological bands of these systems are typically strongly electron&#8208;doped and hybridized with a manifold of surface states that places the salient topological states out of reach of electron transport and practical applications. In this work, micro&#8208;focused angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (microARPES) provides direct access to the termination&#8208;dependent dispersion of MnBi2Te4 and MnBi4Te7 during in situ deposition of rubidium atoms. The resulting band structure changes are found to be highly complex, encompassing coverage&#8208;dependent ambipolar doping effects, removal of surface state hybridization and the collapse of a surface state band gap. In addition, a doping&#8208;dependent band bending is found to give rise to tunable quantum well states. This wide range of observed electronic structure modifications could provide new ways to exploit the topological states and the rich surface electronic structures of manganese bismuth&#160;tellurides.

The resulting band structure changes are found to be highly complex, encompassing coverage-dependent ambipolar doping effects, removal of surface state hybridization and the collapse of a surface state band gap. In addition, a doping-dependent band bending is found to give rise to tunable quantum well states. This wide range of observed electronic structure modifications could provide new ways to exploit the topological states and the rich surface electronic structures of manganese bismuth&#160;tellurides.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Sequential&#8208;Stimuli Induced Stepwise&#8208;Response of Pyridylpyrenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive, especially multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive materials can sense external stimuli such as light, heat, and force, have shown great potentials in drug delivery, data storage, encryption, energy&#8208;harvesting, and artificial intelligence. Conventional multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive materials are sensitive to each independent stimulus, causing losses in the diversity and accuracy of the identification for practical application. Herein, we report a unique phenomenon of sequential&#8208;stimuli induced stepwise&#8208;response generated from elaborately designed single&#8208;component organic materials, which shows large bathochromic shifts up to 5800 cm&#8722;1 under sequential stimuli of force and light. In contrast to multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, the response of these materials strictly relies on the sequence of stimuli, allowing logicality, rigidity, and accuracy integrated into one single&#8208;component material. The molecular keypad lock was built based on these materials, pointing promising future of this logical response for significant practical applications. This breakthrough gives a new drive to the classical stimuli&#8208;responsibility, and provides a fundamental design strategy for new generations of high&#8208;performance stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Periodic and Aperiodic NiFe Nanomagnet/Ferrimagnet Hybrid Structures for 2D Magnon Steering and Interferometry with High Extinction Ratio</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Magnons, quanta of spin waves, are known to enable information processing with low power consumption at the nanoscale. So far, however, experimentally realized half&#8208;adders, wave&#8208;logic and binary output operations were&#160;based on few &#181;m&#8208;long spin waves and restricted to one spatial direction. Here, magnons with wavelengths &#955; down to 50 nm in ferrimagnetic Y3Fe5O12 below two&#8208;dimensional lattices of periodic and aperiodic ferromagnetic nanopillars are explored. Due to their high rotational symmetries and engineered magnetic resonances, the lattices allow short&#8208;wave magnons to propagate in arbitrarily chosen on&#8208;chip directions when excited by conventional coplanar waveguides. Performing interferometry with magnons over macroscopic distances of 350 &#215; &#955; without loss of coherency, unprecedentedly high extinction ratios of up to 26 (&#177;8) dB [31 (&#177;2) dB] for a binary 1/0 output operation at &#955; = 69~nm (&#955; = 154~nm) are achieved in this work. The reported findings and design criteria for 2D magnon interferometry are particularly important in view of the realization of complex neuronal networks recently proposed for interfering spin waves underneath&#160;nanomagnets.

         <title>Mimosa&#8208;inspired Stimuli&#8208;responsive Curling Bioadhesive Tape Promotes Peripheral Nerve Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Trauma often results in peripheral nerve injuries. These injuries are particularly challenging therapeutically because of variable nerve diameters, slow axonal regeneration, infection of severed ends, fragility of the nerve tissue, and the intricacy of surgical intervention. Surgical suturing is likely to cause additional damage to peripheral nerves. Therefore, an ideal nerve scaffold should possess good biocompatibility, diameter adaptability, and a stable biological interface for seamless biointegration with tissues. Inspired by the curl of Mimosa pudica, this study aimed to design and develop a diameter&#8208;adaptable, suture&#8208;free, stimulated curling bioadhesive tape (SCT) hydrogel for repairing peripheral nerve injury. The hydrogel is fabricated from chitosan and acrylic acid&#8208;N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide lipid via gradient crosslinking using glutaraldehyde. It closely matches the nerves of different individuals and regions, thereby providing a bionic scaffold for axonal regeneration. In addition, this hydrogel rapidly absorbs tissue fluid from the nerve surface achieving durable wet&#8208;interface adhesion. Furthermore, the chitosan&#8208;based SCT hydrogel loaded with insulin&#8208;like growth factor&#8208;I effectively promotes peripheral nerve regeneration with excellent bioactivity. This procedure for peripheral nerve injury repair using the SCT hydrogel is simple and reduces the difficulty and duration of surgery, thereby advancing adaptive biointerfaces and reliable materials for nerve repair.

         <title>All&#8208;optical Multiplexed Meta&#8208;Differentiator for Tri&#8208;mode Surface Morphology Observation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Current optical differentiators are generally limited to realizing a single differential function once fabricated. Herein, we propose a minimalist strategy in designing multiplexed differentiators (1st&#8208; and 2nd&#8208;order differentiations), implemented with a Malus metasurface consisting of single&#8208;sized nanostructures, thus improving the functionality of optical computing devices without the cost of complex design and nanofabrication. We found that the proposed meta&#8208;differentiator exhibits excellent differential&#8208;computation performance and can be used for simultaneous outline detection and edge positioning of objects, corresponding to the functions of the 1st&#8208; and 2nd&#8208;order differentiations respectively. Experiments with biological specimens showcase that we can not only identify boundaries of biological tissues, but also highlight the edge information for realizing high&#8208;precision edge positioning. Our study provides a paradigm in designing all&#8208;optical multiplexed computing meta&#8208;devices, and initiates tri&#8208;mode surface morphology observation by combining meta&#8208;differentiator with optical microscopes, which can find their applications in advanced biological imaging, large&#8208;scale defect detection, and high&#8208;speed pattern recognition, etc.

         <title>Tailor&#8208;Made White Photothermal Fabrics: A Bridge between Pragmatism and Aesthetic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A white composite fabric with an exceptional photo&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion capability that outperforms ordinary black photothermal fabric is developed. Collective characteristics of shape retention, softness, breathability, light weight, fast&#8208;drying, durability, and tailorability into diverse appearances are integrated into this novel fabric, which promises to satisfy the needs of future advanced garment manufacturing, thermoregulation, and aesthetics.








Abstract
Maintaining human thermal comfort in the cold outdoors is crucial for diverse outdoor activities, e.g., sports and recreation, healthcare, and special occupations. To date, advanced clothes are employed to collect solar energy as a heat source to stand cold climates, while their dull dark photothermal coating may hinder pragmatism in outdoor environments&#160;and visual sense considering fashion. Herein, tailor&#8208;made white webs with strong photothermal effect are proposed. With the embedding of cesium&#8211;tungsten bronze (CsxWO3) nanoparticles (NPs) as additive inside nylon nanofibers, these webs are capable of drawing both near&#8208;infrared (NIR) and ultraviolet (UV) light in sunlight for heating. Their exceptional photothermal conversion capability enables 2.5&#8211;10.5 &#176;C greater warmth than that of a commercial sweatshirt of six times greater thickness under different climates. Remarkably, this smart fabric can increase its photothermal conversion efficiency in a wet state. It is optimal for fast sweat or water evaporation at human comfort temperature (38.5 &#176;C) under sunlight, and its role in thermoregulation is equally important to avoid excess heat loss in wilderness survival. Obviously, this smart web with considerable merits of shape retention, softness, safety, breathability, washability, and on&#8208;demand coloration provides a revolutionary solution to realize energy&#8208;saving outdoor thermoregulation and simultaneously satisfy the needs of fashion and aesthetics.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Liquid Crystal Biphasic Ferroelectrics with Tunable Biferroelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ferroelectricity has been separately found in numerous solid and liquid crystal materials since its first discovery in 1920. However, a single material with biferroelectricity existing in both solid and liquid crystal phases is very rare, and the regulation of biferroelectricity has never been studied. Here, we presented solid&#8208;liquid crystal biphasic ferroelectrics, cholestanyl 4&#8208;X&#8208;benzoate (4X&#8208;CB, X = Cl, Br, and I), which exhibits biferroelectricity in both the solid and liquid crystal phases. It is noted that the ferroelectric liquid crystal phase of 4X&#8208;CB is a cholesteric one, distinct from the ordinary chiral smectic ferroelectric liquid crystal phase. Moreover, 4X&#8208;CB shows solid&#8208;solid and solid&#8208;liquid crystal phase transitions, of which the transition temperatures gradually increase from Cl to Br to I substitution. The spontaneous polarization (Ps) of 4X&#8208;CB in both solid and liquid crystal phases can also be regulated by different halogen substitutions, where the 4Br&#8208;CB has the optimal Ps because of the larger molecular dipole moment. To our knowledge, 4X&#8208;CB is the first ferroelectric with tunable biferroelectricity, which offers a feasible case for the performance optimization of solid&#8208;liquid crystal biphasic ferroelectrics.

         <title>Understanding and Suppressing Non&#8208;radiative Recombination Losses in Non&#8208;fullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic solar cells benefit from non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFA) due to their high absorption coefficients, tunable frontier energy levels and optical gaps, as well as their relatively high luminescence quantum efficiencies as compared to fullerenes. Those merits result in high yields of charge generation at a low or negligible energetic offset at the donor/NFA heterojunction, with efficiencies over 19% achieved for single&#8208;junction devices. Pushing this value significantly over 20% requires an increase in open&#8208;circuit voltage, which is currently still well below the thermodynamic limit. This can only be achieved by reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination and hereby increasing the electroluminescence quantum efficiency of the photo&#8208;active layer. Here, we summarize current understanding of the origin of non&#8208;radiative decay, as well as an accurate quantification of the associated voltage losses. Promising strategies for suppressing these losses are highlighted, with focus on new material design, optimization of donor&#8208;acceptor combination and blend morphology. This review aims at guiding researchers in their quest to find future solar harvesting donor&#8208;acceptor blends, which combine a high yield of exciton dissociation with a high yield of radiative free carrier recombination and low voltage losses, hereby closing the efficiency gap with inorganic and perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Anionic Structure Activated Co&#8722;S Bonds Promote Oxygen Electrocatalytic Activity for High&#8208;Efficiency Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

Abstract
The electronic structure of transition metal complexes can be modulated by replace partial ion of complexes to obtain tuned intrinsic ORR (Oxygen Reduction Reaction) or OER (Oxygen Evolution Reaction) electrocatalytic activity. However, the anion&#8208;modulated transition metal complexes ORR activity of is still unsatisfactory, and the construction of hetero&#8208;anionic structure remains challenging. Herein, we present an atomic doping strategy to prepare the CuCo2O4&#8208;xSx/NC&#8208;2 (CCSO/NC&#8208;2) as electrocatalysts, combined XRD, HAADF&#8208;STEM images and XAFS results favorably demonstrate the partial substitution of S atoms for O in CCSO/NC&#8208;2, which shows excellent catalytic performance and durability for OER and ORR in 0.1&#160;M KOH. For ORR, CCSO/NC&#8208;2 exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.75&#160;V and lower Tafel slope (69.3&#160;mV dec&#8722;1), while for OER, CCSO/NC&#8208;2 exhibits a low overpotential (340&#160;mV) at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope (121.3&#160;mV dec&#8722;1). In addition, the catalyst assembled zinc&#8208;air battery with an open circuit potential of 1.43&#160;V maintains performance after 300&#160;h of cyclic stability. DFT calculations and differential charges illustrate that S doping optimizes the reaction kinetics and promotes electron redistribution. The superior performance of CCSO/NC&#8208;2 catalysis is mainly due to its unique S modulation of the electronic structure of the main body. The introduction of S promotes Co&#8211;O covalency and constructs a fast electron transport channel, thus optimizing the adsorption degree of active site Co to the reaction intermediates.

         <title>Toughening CO2&#8208;Derived Copolymer Elastomers Through Ionomer Networking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Utilizing carbon dioxide (CO2) to make polycarbonates through the ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of CO2 and epoxides valorizes and recycles CO2 and reduces pollution in polymer manufacturing. Recent developments in catalysis provide access to polycarbonates with well&#8208;defined structures and allow for copolymerization with biomass&#8208;derived monomers; however, the resulting material properties are under&#8208;investigated. Here, new types of CO2&#8208;derived thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) are described together with a generally applicable method to augment tensile mechanical strength and Young's modulus without requiring material re&#8208;design. These TPEs combine high glass transition temperature (Tg) amorphous blocks comprising CO2&#8208;derived poly(carbonates) (A&#8208;block), with low Tg poly(&#949;&#8208;decalactone), from castor oil, (B&#8208;block) in ABA structures. The poly(carbonate) blocks are selectively functionalized with metal&#8208;carboxylates, where the metals are Na(I), Mg(II), Ca(II), Zn(II) and Al(III). The colorless polymers, featuring &lt;1 wt% metal, show tunable thermal (Tg), and mechanical (elongation at break, elasticity, creep&#8208;resistance) properties. The best elastomers show &gt;50&#8208;fold higher Young's modulus and 21&#8208;times greater tensile strength, without compromise to elastic recovery, compared with the starting block polymers. They have wide operating temperatures (&#8208;20 to 200 &#730;C), high creep&#8208;resistance and yet remain recyclable. In future, these materials could substitute high&#8208;volume petrochemical elastomers and be utilized in high&#8208;growth fields like medicine, robotics and electronics.

         <title>Modulating zinc metal reversibility by confined antifluctuator film for durable and dendrite&#8208;free zinc ion batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous Zn ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising systems due to their intrinsic safety, low cost and non&#8208;toxicity, and the Zn corrosion and dendrite growth will cause the poor reversibility of Zn anode. Herein, we developed the porous Zn@C solid, hollow and yolk&#8208;shell microspheres film as Zn anode antifluctuator (ZAAF). The prepared yolk&#8208;shell microspheres (ZCYSM) film with superior buffering can effectively restrict the deposition of Zn metal in its interior and inhibit the volume expansion during plating/stripping process, thus modulating the Zn2+ flux and enabling stable Zn cycling. As a proof of concept, the ZCYSM@Zn symmetric cells achieve the excellent cyclic stability over 4,000&#160;h and cumulative plated capacity of 4 Ah cm&#8722;2 at a high current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Concomitantly, the suppressed corrosion reactions and dendrite&#8208;free ZAAF significantly improve the durability of full cells (coupled to CaV6O16&#183;3H2O). Additionally, we integrate durable pouch cell and electrochemical neuromorphic inorganic device (ENIDe) to simulate neural network, providing a strategy for extreme interconnectivity comparable to the human brain.

         <title>Epoxy Adhesives with Reversible Hardeners: Controllable Thermal Debonding in Bulk and at Interfaces</title>

Abstract
On&#8208;demand adhesive dismantling has the potential to improve multi&#8208;material product recycling, but its implementation has been hampered by a critical trade&#8208;off between strong bonding and easy debonding. As a result, the temperature range in which these temporary adhesives can be used is relatively limited. Here, we&#160;report a new class of dynamic epoxy resins that significantly extends this upper temperature limit and still achieves fast debonding. Specifically, two types of dynamic polyamidoamine curing agents for epoxy hardening were&#160;developed, being polysuccinamides (PSA) and polyglutaramides (PGA). As the dynamic debonding/rebonding process of PSA and especially PGA linkages is more thermally demanding and at the same time more thermally robust than previously reported dynamic covalent systems, the resulting materials can be triggered at high temperatures, and at the same time remain bonded over a wide temperature range. The versatility of the PSA and PGA dynamic adhesive curing system was&#160;demonstrated in classical bulk adhesive formulations, as well as in dynamic covalent linking to a PSA&#8208; or PGA&#8208;functionalised surface. As a result, an attractive drop&#8208;in strategy was&#160;achieved for producing debondable and rebondable epoxy adhesives, with high complementarity to existing adhesive resin technologies and applicable in an industrially relevant temperature window.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Co2MnN8 Triatomic Sites Anchored in N&#8208;Doped Carbon Enabling Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

Abstract
Atomically dispersed transition metal&#8208;nitrogen/carbon (M&#8208;N/C) catalysts have emerged as the most promising substitutes to precious platinum counterparts toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the reported M&#8208;N/C catalysts are usually in the form of common M&#8208;N4 moieties with only one single metal active site and suffer from insufficient activity. Herein, we elaborately developed an unusual trinuclear active structure with nitrogen&#8208;coordinated one Mn atom adjacent two Co atoms (Co2MnN8) anchored in N&#8208;doped carbon as highly efficient ORR catalyst via adsorption&#8208;pyrolysis of bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate framework precursor. Atomic structural investigations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Co2MnN8 would experience a spontaneous OH binding to form Co2MnN8&#8208;2OH as the real active site, leading to a single electron&#8208;filled state in the dz2${{\rm{d}}}_{{{\rm{z}}}^{\rm{2}}}$ orbital and an optimized binding energy of intermediates. Accordingly, the as&#8208;developed Co2MnN8/C exhibited an unprecedented ORR activity with a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.912&#160;V and outstanding stability, not only surpassing the Pt/C catalyst but also representing a new record for the Co&#8208;based catalyst.

Abstract
Magnetoelectric (ME) film composites consisting of piezoelectric and magnetostrictive materials are promising candidates for application in magnetic field sensors, energy harvesters, and ME antennas. Conventionally, high&#8208;temperature annealing is required to crystallize piezoelectric films, restricting the use of heat&#8208;sensitive magnetostrictive substrates that enhance ME coupling. Herein, w e demonstrate a synergetic approach for fabricating ME film composites that combines aerosol deposition and instantaneous thermal treatment based on intense pulsed light (IPL) radiation to form piezoelectric Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) thick films on amorphous Metglas substrate. IPL rapidly anneals PZT films within a few milliseconds without damaging the underlying Metglas. To optimize the IPL irradiation conditions, the temperature distribution inside the PZT/Metglas film is determined using transient photothermal computational simulation. The PZT/Metglas films are annealed using different IPL pulse durations to determine the structure&#8211;property relationship. IPL treatment results in an enhanced crystallinity of the PZT, thus improving the dielectric, piezoelectric, and ME properties of the composite films. An ultrahigh off&#8208;resonance ME coupling (&#8764;20&#160;V cm&#8722;1 Oe&#8722;1) is obtained for the PZT/Metglas film that has been IPL annealed at pulse width of 0.75&#160;ms (an order of magnitude higher than that reported for other ME films), confirming the potential for next&#8208;generation, miniaturized, and high&#8208;performance ME devices.

         <title>All&#8208;day Multicyclic Atmospheric Water Harvesting Enabled by Polyelectrolyte Hydrogel with Hybrid Desorption Mode</title>

Abstract
Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting is a promising approach for alleviating worldwide water scarcity. However, reliable water supply driven by sustainable energy regardless of diurnal variation and weather remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. To address this issue, a polyelectrolyte hydrogel sorbent with an optimal hybrid&#8208;desorption multicyclic&#8208;operation strategy is proposed, achieving all&#8208;day atmospheric water harvesting and a significant increase in daily water production. The polyelectrolyte hydrogel sorbent possesses a large interior osmotic pressure of 659 atm, which refreshes sorption sites by continuously migrating the sorbed water within its interior, and thus enhancing sorption kinetics. The charged polymeric chains coordinate with hygroscopic salt ions, anchoring the salts and preventing agglomeration and leakage, thereby enhancing cyclic stability. The hybrid desorption mode, which couples solar energy and simulated waste heat for desorption, introduces a uniform and adjustable sorbent temperature for achieving all&#8208;day ultra&#8208;fast water release. With rapid sorption&#8208;desorption kinetics, an optimization model suggests eight moisture capture&#8208;release cycles, demonstrating high&#8208;yielding water production of 2410 mLwater&#8722;1 kgsorbent&#8722;1 day&#8722;1, up to 3.5 times that of single&#8208;cyclic non&#8208;hybrid water harvesting modes. This development of the polyelectrolyte hydrogel sorbent and coupling sustainable energy driven desorption mode pave the way for next&#8208;generation water harvesting systems, significantly bringing freshwater on a multi&#8208;kilogram scale closer.

         <title>Buckling Metamaterials for Extreme Vibration Damping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Damping mechanical resonances is a formidable challenge in an increasing number of applications. Many passive damping methods rely on using low stiffness, complex mechanical structures or electrical systems, which render them unfeasible in many of these applications. This article introduces a new method for passive vibration damping by allowing buckling of the primary load path in mechanical metamaterials and lattice structures, which sets an upper limit for vibration transmission: the transmitted acceleration saturates at a maximum value in both tension and compression, no matter what the input acceleration is. This nonlinear mechanism leads to an extreme damping coefficient tan&#8201;&#948; &#8776; 0.23 in a metal metamaterial&#8212;orders of magnitude larger than the linear damping coefficient of traditional lightweight structural materials. This article demonstrates this principle experimentally and numerically in free&#8208;standing rubber and metal mechanical metamaterials over a range of accelerations. This article also shows that damping nonlinearities even allow buckling based vibration damping to work in tension, and that bi&#8208;directional buckling can further improve its performance. Buckling metamaterials pave the way towards extreme vibration damping without mass or stiffness penalty, and as such could be applicable in a multitude of high&#8208;tech applications, including aerospace, vehicles and sensitive&#160;instruments.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Nano&#8208;Islands (SANIs): A Robust Atomic&#8211;Nano System for Versatile Heterogeneous Catalysis Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of single&#8208;atom nano&#8208;islands (SANIs) is proposed for materials science and catalysis science, and their synthetic breakthrough, scientific significances, and potential applications are systematically summarized.








Abstract
Academician Tao Zhang from China and co&#8208;workers designed the first Pt1/FeOx single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) in 2011, and they proposed the concept of &#8220;single&#8208;atom catalysis&#8221; in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Generally, it is easy for&#160;active metal single&#8208;atom sites on a carrier to migrate and aggregate, which results in poor performance; or the chemical bond between the metal atom and carrier is too strong (immovable), which results in passivation of the active site. Recently, &#8220;nano&#8208;island&#8221; type SACs&#160;were&#160;designed, in which the active metal atoms are isolated on the &#8220;islands&#8221;, and can move within the respective &#8220;island&#8221;, but the migration across the &#8220;island&#8221; is blocked, to achieve a dynamic confinement design of single atoms (that is, a &#8220;moving but not aggregating&#8221; design philosophy). Herein, a new concept of &#8220;single&#8208;atom nano&#8208;islands (SANIs)&#8221; is proposed to describe these congeneric &#8220;atomic&#8211;nano&#8221;&#160;systems in heterogeneous catalysis fields. Particularly, the SANIs are divided into three categories: &#8220;one&#8208;island&#8211;one&#8208;atom&#8221;, &#8220;one&#8208;island&#8211;multi&#8208;atoms&#8221;, and &#8220;island&#8211;sea synergism&#8221; architectures. The scientific significance and application principles of SANIs in versatile heterogeneous catalysis fields (i.e., thermocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis) are summarized. The challenges and proposals of SANIs are also provided.

&lt;p&gt;A new concept of single-atom nano-islands (SANIs) is proposed for materials science and catalysis science, and their synthetic breakthrough, scientific significances, and potential applications are systematically summarized.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academician Tao Zhang from China and co-workers designed the first Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/FeO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; single-atom catalysts (SACs) in 2011, and they proposed the concept of &#8220;single-atom catalysis&#8221; in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Generally, it is easy for&#160;active metal single-atom sites on a carrier to migrate and aggregate, which results in poor performance; or the chemical bond between the metal atom and carrier is too strong (immovable), which results in passivation of the active site. Recently, &#8220;nano-island&#8221; type SACs&#160;were&#160;designed, in which the active metal atoms are isolated on the &#8220;islands&#8221;, and can move within the respective &#8220;island&#8221;, but the migration across the &#8220;island&#8221; is blocked, to achieve a dynamic confinement design of single atoms (that is, a &#8220;moving but not aggregating&#8221; design philosophy). Herein, a new concept of &#8220;single-atom nano-islands (SANIs)&#8221; is proposed to describe these congeneric &#8220;atomic&#8211;nano&#8221;&#160;systems in heterogeneous catalysis fields. Particularly, the SANIs are divided into three categories: &#8220;one-island&#8211;one-atom&#8221;, &#8220;one-island&#8211;multi-atoms&#8221;, and &#8220;island&#8211;sea synergism&#8221; architectures. The scientific significance and application principles of SANIs in versatile heterogeneous catalysis fields (i.e., thermocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis) are summarized. The challenges and proposals of SANIs are also provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coupled Tamm Phonon and Plasmon Polaritons for Designer Planar Multiresonance Absorbers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tamm phonon and plasmon polaritons supported by distributed Bragg reflectors with phonon polariton materials and plasmonic materials are coupled to form Tamm hybrid polaritons (THPs). Here, it is demonstrated that THPs exhibit improved quality&#8208;factors and smaller angular dispersion compared to bare Tamm plasmon polaritons, which are advantageous for many applications such as free&#8208;space communications and gas sensing.








Abstract
Wavelength&#8208;selective absorbers (WS&#8208;absorbers) are of interest for various applications, including chemical sensing and light sources. Lithography&#8208;free fabrication of WS&#8208;absorbers can be realized via Tamm plasmon polaritons (TPPs) supported by distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) on plasmonic materials. While multifrequency and nearly arbitrary spectra can be realized with TPPs via inverse design algorithms, demanding and thick DBRs are required for high quality&#8208;factors (Q&#8208;factors) and/or multiband TPP&#8208;absorbers, increasing the cost and reducing fabrication error tolerance. Here, high Q&#8208;factor multiband absorption with limited DBR layers (3 layers) is experimentally demonstrated by Tamm hybrid polaritons (THPs) formed by coupling TPPs and Tamm phonon polaritons when modal frequencies are overlapped. Compared to the TPP component, the Q&#8208;factors of THPs are improved twofold, and the angular broadening is also reduced twofold, facilitating applications where narrow&#8208;band and nondispersive WS&#8208;absorbers are needed. Moreover, an open&#8208;source algorithm is developed to inversely design THP&#8208;absorbers consisting of anisotropic media and exemplify that the modal frequencies can be assigned to desirable positions. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that inversely designed THP&#8208;absorbers can realize same spectral resonances with fewer DBR layers than a TPP&#8208;absorber, thus reducing the fabrication complexity and enabling more cost&#8208;effective, lithography&#8208;free, wafer&#8208;scale WS&#8208;absorberss for applications such as free&#8208;space communications and gas sensing.

         <title>In Situ Transformable Nanoplatforms with Supramolecular Cross&#8208;Linking Triggered Complementary Function for Enhanced Cancer Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lanthanide&#8208;based nanoplatform with transformable cross&#8208;links based on supramolecular coordination between polyhydroxy photosensitizer and metal ion under tumor microenvironment trigger for enhanced cancer photodynamic therapy is reported. This strategy provides a new concept which pursues to amplify the functions of each component under internal or external stimulation and jointly realize the enhanced therapy effect.








Abstract
In vivo cross&#8208;linking of nanoparticles is widely used to increase accumulation of therapeutic agents at tumor site for enhanced therapy. However, the components in nanoplatforms usually only play for one role and are independent of each other, unable to amplify their biofunctions. Herein, a complementary functioning tumor microenvironment triggered, supramolecular coordination&#8208;induced nanoparticle cross&#8208;linking strategy is constructed for enhanced photodynamic therapy. Manganese oxide (MnOx) and polyhydroxy photosensitizer hypericin (Hyp) are coated and loaded onto lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) to form transformable UCNP@MnOx&#8208;Hyp. In CT26&#160;mouse colon cancer cells and xenograft tumors, UCNP@MnOx&#8208;Hyp is reduced by glutathione and H2O2, releasing Mn2+ and Hyp for in situ cross&#8208;linking to transform to UCNP@Mn2+&#8208;Hyp. Compared to the simple photosensitizer&#8208;loaded UCNP@PEI&#8208;Hyp, the Mn2+&#8208;Hyp coordination redshifts absorbance of Hyp and improves the energy transfer efficiency from UCNPs to Hyp (5.6&#8208;fold). In turn, the supramolecular coordination&#8208;induced UCNPs cross&#8208;linking exhibits enhanced luminescence recovery and increased intracellular accumulation of both UCNPs and Hyp, thus enhancing the photodynamic therapy efficacy both at cellular level (2.1&#8208;fold) and in vivo, realizing the function amplification of each component after responsive transformation and offering a new avenue for enhanced cancer therapy.

         <title>Phage Display Screening as a Rational Approach to Design Additives for Selective Crystallization Control in Construction Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phage display screening reveals the amino acid triplet DYH as a unique chemical entity for strong binding on gypsum surfaces. Peptides based on this motif provide strictly selective control over crystallization in reactive cementitious systems and can be translated into scalable synthetic copolymers.








Abstract
The design of additives showing strong and selective interactions with certain target surfaces is key to crystallization control in applied reactive multicomponent systems. While suitable chemical motifs can be found through semi&#8208;empirical trial&#8208;and&#8208;error procedures, bioinspired selection techniques offer a more rationally driven approach and explore a much larger space of possible combinations in a single assay. Here, phage display screening is used to characterize the surfaces of crystalline gypsum, a mineral of broad relevance for construction applications. Based on next&#8208;generation sequencing of phages enriched during the screening process, a triplet of amino acids, DYH, is identified as the main driver for adsorption on the mineral substrate. Furthermore, oligopeptides containing this motif prove to exert their influence in a strictly selective manner during the hydration of cement, where the sulfate reaction (initial setting) is strongly retarded while the silicate reaction (final hardening) remains unaffected. In the final step, these desired additive characteristics are successfully translated from the level of peptides to that of scalable synthetic copolymers. The approach described in this work demonstrates how modern biotechnological methods can be leveraged for the systematic development of efficient crystallization additives for materials science.

         <title>Regulating Inorganic and Organic Components to Build Amorphous&#8208;ZnFx Enriched Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Highly Reversible Zn Metal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile bisolvent&#8208;electrolyte engineering is developed to realize improved reversibility of zinc metal anode with an accumulated capacity remarkably reaching 5600 mAh cm&#8722;2. A highly fluorinated solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is constructed with amorphous zinc fluorides (ZnFx)&#8208;enriched and the interphasial chemistry is resolved by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy.








Abstract
The introduction of inorganic crystallites into a solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is an effective strategy for improving the reversibility of the Zn metal anode (ZMA). However, the structure&#8211;performance relationship of the SEI is not fully understood because the existing forms of its inorganic and organic components in their pristine states are not resolved. Here, a highly effective SEI is constructed for ZMA using a bisolvent electrolyte and resolved its composition/structure by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. This highly fluorinated SEI with amorphous inorganic ZnFx uniformly distributed in the organic matrix is largely different from the common mosaic and multilayer SEIs with crystalline inorganics. It features improved structural integrity, mechanical toughness, and Zn2+ ion conductivity. Consequently, the ZMA exhibits excellent reversibility with an enhanced plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency of 99.8%. The ZMA&#8208;based full cell achieves a high Zn utilization ratio of 54% at a practical areal capacity of 3.2&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and stable cycling over 1800&#160;h during which the accumulated capacity reached 5600&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. This research highlights the detailed structure and composition of amorphous SEIs for highly reversible metal anodes.

The ZMA-based full cell achieves a high Zn utilization ratio of 54% at a practical areal capacity of 3.2&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and stable cycling over 1800&#160;h during which the accumulated capacity reached 5600&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This research highlights the detailed structure and composition of amorphous SEIs for highly reversible metal anodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Printable Perovskite Diodes for Broad&#8208;Spectrum Multienergy X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both soft and hard X&#8208;ray regimes provide important spectroscopic prospects toward understanding complex heterogenous objects. Here, it is showcased that Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 perovskites within an n&#8208;i&#8208;p configuration can effectively absorb X&#8208;rays across both regimes due to their high attenuation coefficients. It is anticipated that these printable, scalable, and flexible devices can provide a step&#8208;jump for imaging applications requiring broad&#8208;spectrum multienergy X&#8208;ray detection.








Abstract
Multienergy X&#8208;ray detection is critical to effectively differentiate materials in a variety of diagnostic radiology and nondestructive testing applications. Silicon and selenium X&#8208;ray detectors are the most common for multienergy detection; however, these present poor energy discrimination across the broad X&#8208;ray spectrum and exhibit limited spatial resolution due to the high thicknesses required for radiation attenuation. Here, an X&#8208;ray detector based on solution&#8208;processed thin&#8208;film metal halide perovskite that overcomes these challenges is introduced. By harnessing an optimized n&#8208;i&#8208;p diode configuration, operation is achieved across a broad range of soft and hard X&#8208;ray energies stemming from 0.1 to 10's of keV. Through detailed experimental and simulation work, it is shown that optimized Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 perovskites effectively attenuate soft and hard X&#8208;rays, while also possessing excellent electrical properties to result in X&#8208;ray detectors with high sensitivity factors that exceed 5 &#215; 103 &#181;C&#8201;GyVac&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2$\mu {\rm{C}}\;{{\bf Gy}}_{{\rm{Vac}}}^{ - 1}\;{\rm{c}}{{\rm{m}}^{ - 2}}$ and 6 &#215; 104 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 within soft and hard X&#8208;ray regimes, respectively. Harnessing the solution&#8208;processable nature of the perovskites, roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll printable X&#8208;ray detectors on flexible substrates are also demonstrated.

         <title>Tough, Recyclable, and Degradable Elastomers for Potential Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve sustainable development, the preparation of novel elastomers that are concurrently tough, recyclable, and degradable is highly desirable. In this work, a polycaprolactone&#8208;based polyurethane elastomer is carefully designed and developed with excellent mechanical properties and biocompatibility, which shows great potential for biomedical applications.








Abstract
Elastomers have many industrial, medical and commercial applications, however, their huge demand raises an important question of how to dispose of the out&#8208;of&#8208;service elastomers. Ideal elastomers that are concurrently tough, recyclable, and degradable are in urgent need, but their preparation remains a rigorous challenge. Herein, a polycaprolactone (PCL) based polyurethane elastomer is designed and prepared to meet this demand. Owing to the presence of dynamic coordination bond and the occurrence of strain&#8208;induced crystallization, the obtained elastomer exhibits a high toughness of &#8776;372&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3 and an unprecedented fracture energy of &#8776;646&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;2, which is much higher than natural rubber (&#8776;50&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3 for toughness and &#8776;10&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;2 for fracture energy). In addition, the elastomer can be recycled at least three times using solvent without losing its mechanical properties and can be degraded by lipase in &#8776;2 months. Finally, biological experiments demonstrate that the elastomer possesses good biocompatibility and can facilitate wound healing in mice when used as sutures. It is believed that the obtained elastomer meets the requirements for next&#8208;generation elastomers and is expected to be used in emerging fields such as biomedicine, flexible electronics, robotics and beyond.

         <title>Toward High Conversion Efficiency of Thermoelectric Modules through Synergistical Optimization of Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistical optimization of layered architecture on half&#8208;Heusler alloys is demonstrated for high conversion efficiency thermoelectric power generation applications. The (Nb, Hf)FeSb alloy exhibits a superior figure of merit of 1.5 at 973 K. A comprehensive coupling of the thermoelectric parameters with temperature gradient is realized, and a remarkable conversion efficiency of &#8776;15% is achieved under &#916;T of 670 K.








Abstract
Waste&#8208;heat electricity generation using high&#8208;efficiency solid&#8208;state conversion technology can significantly decrease dependence on fossil fuels. Here, a synergistical optimization of layered half&#8208;Heusler (hH) materials and module to improve thermoelectric conversion efficiency is reported. This is realized by manufacturing multiple thermoelectric materials with major compositional variations and temperature&#8208;gradient&#8208;coupled carrier distribution by one&#8208;step spark plasma sintering. This strategy provides a solution to overcome the intrinsic concomitants of the conventional segmented architecture that only considers the matching of the figure of merit (zT) with the temperature gradient. The current design is dedicated to temperature&#8208;gradient&#8208;coupled resistivity and compatibility matching, optimum zT matching, and reducing contact resistance sources. By enhancing the quality factor of the materials by Sb&#8208;vapor&#8208;pressure&#8208;induced annealing, a superior zT of 1.47 at 973 K is achieved for (Nb, Hf)FeSb hH alloys. Along with the low&#8208;temperature high&#8208;zT hH alloys of (Nb, Ta, Ti, V)FeSb, the single stage layered hH modules are developed with efficiencies of &#8776;15.2% and &#8776;13.5% for the single&#8208;leg and unicouple thermoelectric modules, respectively, under &#916;T of 670 K. Therefore, this work has a transformative impact on the design and development of next&#8208;generation thermoelectric generators for any thermoelectric material families.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Targeted Peptide&#8208;Modified Gold Nanoclusters for Treating Solid Tumors in the Liver</title>

Apoptosis and autophagy determine the fate of cancer cells. Simultaneous activation of pro&#8208;apoptotic autophagy and apoptotic signaling pathways is a novel strategy for the treatment of solid liver tumors. Here, the amphiphilic peptide&#8208;modified glutathione&#8208;gold nanoclusters with the enrichment of solid liver tumors and the prolonged stress in the endoplasmic reticulum can achieve the mutual promotion of autophagy and apoptosis.








Abstract
Apoptosis and autophagy determine the fate of cancer cells. However, simply promoting apoptosis of tumor cells is limited in the treatment of unresectable solid liver tumors. Generally, autophagy is considered the anti&#8208;apoptotic &#8220;guardian&#8221;. But the pro&#8208;apoptotic effects of autophagy can be activated by excessive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Here, amphiphilic peptide&#8208;modified glutathione (GSH)&#8208;gold nanocluster aggregates (AP1P2&#8208;PEG NCs)&#160;were&#160;designed with the enrichment of solid liver tumors and the prolonged stress in the ER, which can achieve the mutual promotion of autophagy and apoptosis in liver tumor cells. In this study, orthotopic and subcutaneous liver tumor models show the anti&#8208;tumor effectiveness of AP1P2&#8208;PEG NCs, with a better antitumor effect than sorafenib, biosafety (Lethal Dose, 50% (LD50) of 827.3&#160;mg&#160;kg&#8722;1), wide therapeutic window (non&#8208;toxic in 20 times of therapeutic concentration) and high stability (blood half&#8208;life of 4&#160;h). These findings identify an effective strategy to develop peptide&#8208;modified gold nanocluster aggregates with low toxicity, high potency, and selectivity for solid liver tumors treatment.

In this study, orthotopic and subcutaneous liver tumor models show the anti-tumor effectiveness of AP&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-PEG NCs, with a better antitumor effect than sorafenib, biosafety (Lethal Dose, 50% (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of 827.3&#160;mg&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), wide therapeutic window (non-toxic in 20 times of therapeutic concentration) and high stability (blood half-life of 4&#160;h). These findings identify an effective strategy to develop peptide-modified gold nanocluster aggregates with low toxicity, high potency, and selectivity for solid liver tumors treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formation Mechanism of Elemental Te Produced in Tellurite Glass Systems by Femtosecond Laser Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation mechanism of Te nanocrystals and nanoparticles generated in tellurite glass by ultrafast laser processing is unveiled. The laser direct&#8208;write technology leads to controllable Te/TeO2 nanocomposite production without adding or subtracting other materials through a single&#8208;step process.








Abstract
The formation of elemental trigonal tellurium (t&#8208;Te) on tellurite glass surfaces exposed to femtosecond&#160;laser pulses is discussed. Specifically, the underlying elemental crystallization phenomenon is investigated by altering laser parameters in common tellurite glass compositions under various ambient conditions. Elemental crystallization of t&#8208;Te by a single femtosecond laser pulse is unveiled by high&#8208;resolution imaging and analysis. The thermal diffusion model reveals the absence of lattice melting upon a single laser pulse, highlighting the complexity of the phase transformation. The typical cross&#8208;section displays three different crystal configurations over its depth, in which the overall thickness increases with each subsequent pulse. The effect of various controlled atmospheres shows the suppressing nature of the elemental crystallization, whereas the substrate temperature shows no significant impact on the nucleation of t&#8208;Te nanocrystals. This research gives new insight into the elemental crystallization of glass upon femtosecond laser irradiation and shows the potential to fabricate functional transparent electronic micro/nanodevices.

         <title>Silk Fibroin and Sericin Differentially Potentiate the Paracrine and Regenerative Functions of Stem Cells Through Multiomics Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silk fibroin (SF) and sericin (SS), the two major proteins of silk, potentiate the paracrine functions of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) by differentially activating the integrin/PI3K/Akt and glycolysis signaling pathways. The SF&#8208; and SS&#8208;initiated paracrine signals of MSCs modulate the behaviors of multiple resident cells in the skin wound microenvironments and thereby improve skin regeneration with structural and functional recovery.








Abstract
Silk fibroin (SF) and sericin (SS), the two major proteins of silk, are attractive biomaterials with great potential in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, their biochemical interactions with stem cells remain unclear. In this study, multiomics are employed to obtain a global view of the cellular processes and pathways of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) triggered by SF and SS to discern cell&#8211;biomaterial interactions at an in&#8208;depth, high&#8208;throughput molecular level. Integrated RNA sequencing and proteomic analysis confirm that SF and SS initiate widespread but distinct cellular responses and potentiate the paracrine functions of MSCs that regulate extracellular matrix deposition, angiogenesis, and immunomodulation through differentially activating the integrin/PI3K/Akt and glycolysis signaling pathways. These paracrine signals of MSCs stimulated by SF and SS effectively improve skin regeneration by regulating the behavior of multiple resident cells (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages) in the skin wound microenvironment. Compared to SS, SF exhibits better immunomodulatory effects in vitro and in vivo, indicating its greater potential as a carrier material of MSCs for skin regeneration. This study provides comprehensive and reliable insights into the cellular interactions with SF and SS, enabling the future development of silk&#8208;based therapeutics for tissue engineering and stem cell therapy.

         <title>True Nonvolatile High&#8208;Speed DRAM Cells Using Tailored Ultrathin IGZO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nonvolatile dynamic random access memory (DRAM) using an optimized indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IGZO) transistor with record&#8208;high threshold voltage beyond 1.78&#160;V and on&#8208;current &gt;40&#160;&#181;A &#181;m&#8722;1 is demonstrated for the first time. The DRAM shows a record retention time exceeding 25 h with an ultra&#8208;fast write speed of 10&#160;ns under power interruption, along with a 3&#8208;bit multilevel operation with a wide margin and excellent linearity.








Abstract
Severe power consumption in the continuous scaling of Silicon&#8208;based dynamic random access memory (DRAM) technology quests for a transistor technology with a much lower off&#8208;state leakage current. Wide bandgap amorphous oxide semiconductors, especially indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IGZO)&#160;exhibit many orders of magnitude lower off&#8208;state leakage. However, they are typically heavily n&#8208;doped and require negative gate voltage to turn off, which prevents them from true nonvolatile operation. The efforts on doping density reduction typically result in mobility degradation and high Schottky barriers at contacts, causing severe degradation of on&#8208;current and operation speed of the DRAM cells. Here, high&#8208;speed true nonvolatile DRAM cells are successfully demonstrated by deep suppression of doping density in the IGZO channel using in situ oxygen ion beam treatment and ohmic contact engineering by inserting a thin In&#8208;rich indium&#8208;tin&#8208;oxide (ITO) at contact regions. A record high on&#8208;current of 40&#160;&#181;A &#181;m&#8722;1&#160;at a large positive threshold voltage of 1.78&#160;V enables the first true nonvolatile DRAM with the fastest write speed of 10&#160;ns and data retention up to 25 h under power interruption, five orders of magnitude higher than the previously projected values.

Abstract
3D topological spin textures&#8212;hopfions&#8212;are predicted in helimagnetic systems but are not experimentally confirmed thus far. By utilizing an external magnetic field and electric current in the present study, 3D topological spin textures are realized, including fractional hopfions with nonzero topological index, in a skyrmion&#8208;hosting helimagnet FeGe. Microsecond current pulses are employed to control the dynamics of the expansion and contraction of a bundle composed of a skyrmion and a fractional hopfion, as well as its current&#8208;driven Hall motion. This research approach has demonstrated the novel electromagnetic properties of fractional hopfions and their ensembles in helimagnetic systems.

         <title>Catalytic Amounts of an Antibacterial Monomer Enable the Upcycling of Poly(Ethylene Terephthalate) Waste</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optimal approach for the upcycling of plastics is reported, which permits the direct manufacture of high&#8208;value advanced materials and avoids monomer regeneration. More specifically, a novel strategy is provided for directly upcycling poly(ethylene terephthalate) waste to high&#8208;value antibacterial products.

Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is an important polymer with an annual output second only to polyethylene. The development of PET recycling technologies is therefore necessary to not only eliminate the harm associated with white pollution and microplastics, but also to reduce carbon emissions. Antibacterial PET, one of the most high&#8208;value advanced materials, has improved the ability to treat bacterial infections. However, current methods of manufacturing commercial antibacterial PET require blending with an excess of metal&#8208;based antibacterial agents, which leads to biotoxicity and a nonpersistent antibacterial activity. In addition, high&#8208;efficiency organic antibacterial agents have yet to be employed in antibacterial PET due to their poor thermal stabilities. Herein, a solid&#8208;state reaction for the upcycling of PET waste using a novel hyperthermostable antibacterial monomer is described. This reaction is catalyzed by the residual catalyst present in the PET waste. It is found that a catalytic amount of the antibacterial monomer enabled the low&#8208;cost upcycling of PET waste to produce high&#8208;value recycled PET with a strong and persistent antibacterial activity, as well as similar thermal properties to the virgin PET. This work provides a feasible and economic strategy for the large&#8208;scale upcycling of PET waste and exhibits potential for application in the polymer industry.

     alt="Catalytic Amounts of an Antibacterial Monomer Enable the Upcycling of Poly(Ethylene Terephthalate) Waste"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An optimal approach for the upcycling of plastics is reported, which permits the direct manufacture of high-value advanced materials and avoids monomer regeneration. More specifically, a novel strategy is provided for directly upcycling poly(ethylene terephthalate) waste to high-value antibacterial products. This procedure, which employs a catalytic amount of an antibacterial monomer, exhibits potential for application in the polymer industry.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetism in 2D MnGa4&#8208;H Induced by Hydrogen Insertion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition method is developed to construct the 2D room&#8208;temperature magnetic MnGa4&#8208;H crystal. Hydrogen insertion inside the MnGa4 lattice can modulate the atomic distance and charge state, thereby ferrimagnetism can be achieved without destroying the structural configuration. 2D MnGa4&#8208;H is high&#8208;quality and air&#8208;stable, demonstrating robust and stable room&#8208;temperature magnetism with a high Curie temperature above 620&#160;K.








Abstract
2D room&#8208;temperature magnetic materials are of great importance in future spintronic devices while only very few are reported. Herein, a plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition approach is exploited to construct the 2D room&#8208;temperature magnetic MnGa4&#8208;H single crystal with a thickness down to 2.2&#160;nm. The employment of H2 plasma makes hydrogen atoms can be easily inserted into the MnGa4 lattice to modulate the atomic distance and charge state, thereby ferrimagnetism can be achieved without destroying the structural configuration. The as&#8208;obtained 2D MnGa4&#8208;H crystal is high&#8208;quality, air&#8208;stable, and thermo&#8208;stable, demonstrating robust and stable room&#8208;temperature magnetism with a high Curie temperature above 620&#160;K. This work enriches the 2D room&#8208;temperature magnetic family and opens up the possibility for the development of spintronic devices based on 2D magnetic alloys.

         <title>Specific and Long&#8208;Term Luminescent Monitoring of Hydrogen Peroxide in Tumor Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The clinical transformation of luminescent monitoring is obstructed by the limited light penetration depth, toxicity of nano&#8208;probes, and lack of long&#8208;term monitoring modes of up to days or months. Combined with the specific nano&#8208;probes and implantable microdevices, a biosafe monitoring of hydrogen peroxide for up to 20 days in the rat model of ovarian cancer is established.








Abstract
Luminescent monitoring of endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in tumors is conducive to understanding metastasis and developing novel therapeutics. The clinical transformation is obstructed by the limited light penetration depth, toxicity of nano&#8208;probes, and lack of long&#8208;term monitoring modes of up to days or months. New monitoring modes are introduced via specific probes and implantable devices, which can achieve real&#8208;time monitoring with a readout frequency of 0.01 s or long&#8208;term monitoring for months to years. Near&#8208;infrared dye&#8208;sensitized upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are fabricated as the luminescent probes, and the specificity to reactive oxygen species is subtly regulated by the self&#8208;assembled monolayers on the surfaces of UCNPs. Combined with the passive implanted system, a 20&#8208;day monitoring of H2O2 in the rat model of ovarian cancer with peritoneal metastasis is achieved, in which the limited light penetration depth and toxicity of nano&#8208;probes are circumvented. The developed monitoring modes show great potential in accelerating the clinical transformation of nano&#8208;probes and biochemical detection methods.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Scale Mechanical Metamaterial with a Controllable Transition in the Poisson's Ratio and Band Gap Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel micro&#8208;scale mechanical metamaterial is proposed that can undergo a magnetically induced transition from one type of configuration to another, with one configuration being strongly auxetic and the other having a highly positive Poisson's ratio. The system allows to also concurrently control the band gap formation.








Abstract
The ability to significantly change the mechanical and wave propagation properties of a structure without rebuilding it is currently one of the main challenges in the field of mechanical metamaterials. This stems from the enormous appeal that such tunable behavior may offer from the perspective of applications ranging from biomedical to protective devices, particularly in the case of micro&#8208;scale systems. In this work, a novel micro&#8208;scale mechanical metamaterial is proposed that can undergo a transition from one type of configuration to another, with one configuration having a very negative Poisson's ratio, corresponding to strong auxeticity, and the other having a highly positive Poisson's ratio. The formation of phononic band gaps can also be controlled concurrently which can be very useful for the design of vibration dampers and sensors. Finally, it is experimentally shown that the reconfiguration process can be induced and controlled remotely through application of a magnetic field by using appropriately distributed magnetic inclusions.

         <title>Discovery of Topological Magnetic Textures near Room Temperature in Quantum Magnet TbMn6Sn6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological magnetic skyrmions are directly observed in quantum magnet TbMn6Sn6 by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy with corresponding topological Hall conductivity measured near room temperature, where the full spin reorientation transition occurs between the a&#8208; and c&#8208;axes. The mechanism of Ruderman&#8211;Kittel&#8211;Kasuya&#8211;Yosida interaction on the stabilization of skyrmion lattice is clarified by micromagnetic simulation.








Abstract
The study of topology in quantum materials has fundamentally advanced the understanding in condensed matter physics and potential applications in next&#8208;generation quantum information technology. Recently, the discovery of a topological Chern phase in the spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupled Kagome lattice TbMn6Sn6 has attracted considerable interest. Whereas these phenomena highlight the contribution of momentum space Berry curvature and Chern gap on the electronic transport properties, less is known about the intrinsic real space magnetic texture, which is crucial for understanding the electronic properties and further exploring the unique quantum behavior. Here, the stabilization of topological magnetic skyrmions in TbMn6Sn6 using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy near room temperature, where the spins experience full spin reorientation transition between the a&#8208; and c&#8208;axes, is directly observed. An effective spin Hamiltonian based on the Ginzburg&#8211;Landau theory is constructed and micromagnetic simulation is performed to clarify the critical role of Ruderman&#8211;Kittel&#8211;Kasuya&#8211;Yosida interaction on the stabilization of skyrmion lattice. These results not only uncover nontrivial spin topological texture in TbMn6Sn6, but also provide a solid basis to study its interplay with electronic topology.

         <title>Dynamic Stabilization of Metastable States in Triple&#8208;Well Ferroelectric Sn2P2S6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic hysteresis loops in nanoscale volumes reveal the signatures of a triple potential well, wherein a transient metastable state with zero polarization separates the transition between stable polarization states. The zero state is distinct from a domain wall, and it enhances mem&#8208;capacitive behavior with voltage&#8208;history dependent change of local dielectric properties.








Abstract
Polarization dynamics in ferroelectric materials is governed by the effective potential energy landscape of the order parameter. The unique aspect of ferroelectrics compared to many other transitions is the possibility of more than two potential wells, leading to complicated energy landscapes with new fundamental and functional properties. Here, direct dynamic evidence is revealed of a triple&#8208;well potential in the metal thiophosphate Sn2P2S6 compound using multivariate scanning probe microscopy combined with theoretical simulations. The key finding is that the metastable zero polarization state can be accessed through a gradual switching process and is stabilized over a broad range of electric fields. Simulations confirm that the observed zero polarization state originates from a kinetic stabilization of the nonpolar state of the triple&#8208;well, as opposed to domain walls. Dynamically, the triple&#8208;well of Sn2P2S6 becomes equivalent to antiferroelectric hysteresis loops. Therefore, this material combines the robust and well&#8208;defined domain structure of a proper ferroelectric with dynamic hysteresis loops present in antiferroelectrics. Moreover, the triple&#8208;well enhances mem&#8208;capacitive effects in Sn2P2S6, which are forbidden for ideal double&#8208;well ferroelectrics. These findings provide a path to tunable electronic elements for beyond binary high&#8208;density computing devices and neuromorphic circuits based on dynamic properties of the triple&#8208;well.

         <title>Synergetic Lithium and Hydrogen Bonds Endow Liquid&#8208;Free Photonic Ionic Elastomer with Mechanical Robustness and Electrical/Optical Dual&#8208;Output</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of lithium and hydrogen bonds is introduced into an elastomer to provide liquid&#8208;free photonic ionic elastomers (PIEs) with simultaneous mechanical robustness, satisfied ionic conductivity, and brilliant structure color. The PIEs with mechanical strength up to 4.3 MPa and toughness up to 8.6&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3 demonstrate synchronous electrical/optical dual&#8208;outputs under various harsh conditions.








Abstract
Photonic ionic elastomers (PIEs) capable of multiple signal outputs are intriguing in flexible interactive electronics. However, fabricating PIEs with simultaneous mechanical robustness, good ionic conductivity, and brilliant structure color still remains challenging. Here, the limitations are broken through introducing the synergistic effect of lithium and hydrogen bonds into an elastomer. In virtue of lithium bonding between lithium ions and carbonyl groups in the polymer matrix as well as hydrogen bonding between silanol on the surface of silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) and ether groups along polymer chains, the PIEs demonstrate mechanical strength up to 4.3&#160;MPa and toughness up to 8.6&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3. Meanwhile, the synchronous electrical and optical output under mechanical strains can be achieved in the PIEs with the presence of dissociated ions contributed by lithium bond and non&#8208;close&#8208;packed SiNPs stabilized by the hydrogen bond. Moreover, due to their liquid&#8208;free nature, the PIEs exhibit extraordinary stability and durability, which can withstand extreme conditions including both high and low temperatures as well as high humidity. This work provides a promising molecular engineering route to construct high&#8208;performance photonic ionic conductors toward advanced ionotronic applications.

         <title>Repeatedly Recyclable 3D Printing Catalyst&#8208;Free Dynamic Thermosetting Photopolymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalyst&#8208;free dynamic thermosetting photopolymers are developed by immobilized the catalyst&#8208;free reversible bonds into the photopolymers, that can enable users to realize repeatable 3D printing. The generated resins demonstrate controllable mechanical properties with elastomeric behaviors to thermadapt shape memory polymers. Furthermore, the resulting network presents an on&#8208;demand, repeatedly recyclable thermosetting photopolymer platform for sustainable 3D printing.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;curing 3D printing technology has promoted the advanced manufacturing in various fields, but has exacerbated the environmental crisis by the demand for the chemically cross&#8208;linked thermosetting photopolymers. Here, the authors report a generic strategy to develop catalyst&#8208;free dynamic thermosetting photopolymers, based on photopolymerization and transesterification, that can enable users to realize repeatable 3D printing, providing a practical solution to the environmental challenges. That the &#946;&#8208;carbonyl group adjacent to the ester group greatly accelerates the rate of transesterification is demonstrated. The generated resins from the immobilization of the catalyst&#8208;free reversible bonds into the photopolymers leads to a dynamic covalently crosslinked network structure upon UV based 3D printing, which exhibit controllable mechanical properties with elastomeric behaviors to thermadapt shape memory polymers. Furthermore, the resulting network can be reverted into an acrylate&#8208;functioned photopolymer that is suitable for 3D printing again, presenting an on&#8208;demand, repeatedly recyclable thermosetting photopolymer platform for sustainable 3D printing.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adhesive Self&#8208;Healing Thermochromic Ionogels for Smart Windows with Excellent Environmental and Mechanical Stability, Solar Modulation, and Antifogging Capabilities</title>

         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;healing poly(urethaneurea)&#8208;based self&#8208;adhesive thermochromic ionogels with mechanically and environmentally stable, reversible, healable, and tunable temperature&#8208;responsive optical performance are demonstrated. The ionogels have an antifogging ability that can guarantee good indoor lighting in cold weather. Reversible multiple hydrogen bonds between the poly(urethaneurea) allow the ionogels to spontaneously heal themselves at room temperature or be fully recycled by room&#8208;temperature pressing.








Abstract
Current thermochromic materials used in smart windows still face challenges, such as poor mechanical and environmental stability, unsatisfactory solar modulation capacity, and low transparency. Herein, the first self&#8208;adhesive self&#8208;healing thermochromic ionogels with excellent mechanical and environmental stability, antifogging capability, transparency, and solar modulation capability by loading binary ionic liquids (ILs) into rational&#8208;designed self&#8208;healing poly(urethaneurea) with acylsemicarbazide (ASCZ) moieties that have reversible and multiple hydrogen bonds are reported and their feasibility as smart windows with reliability and long service life is demonstrated. The self&#8208;healing thermochromic ionogels can switch between transparent and opaque without leakage or shrinkage, by the constrained reversible phase separation of ILs within the ionogels. The ionogels have the highest transparency and solar modulation capability among reported thermochromic materials and such excellent solar modulation capability can be well maintained after undergoing 1000 transitions, stretches, and bends, and storage at &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C, 60&#160;&#176;C, 90% RH, and vacuum environment for 2 months. The formation of high&#8208;density hydrogen bonds among the ASCZ moieties contributes to the excellent mechanical strength of the ionogels and allows the thermochromic ionogels to spontaneously heal their damages and be fully recycled at room temperature without the loss of thermochromic capabilities.

         <title>Scalable Polyimide&#8208;Organosilicate Hybrid Films for High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular engineering strategy is proposed to regulate the bulk&#8208;limited conduction in the polymer by bonding amino polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane with the chain ends of polyimide. The hybrid film exhibits superior capacitive performance, excellent charge&#8211;discharge stability, and power density even at 200&#160;&#176;C, making it a promising candidate for high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;energy&#8208;density capacitors.








Abstract
High&#8208;temperature polymer dielectrics have broad application prospects in next&#8208;generation microelectronics and electrical power systems. However, the capacitive energy densities of dielectric polymers at elevated temperatures are severely limited by carrier excitation and transport.

&lt;p&gt;A molecular engineering strategy is proposed to regulate the bulk-limited conduction in the polymer by bonding amino polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane with the chain ends of polyimide. The hybrid film exhibits superior capacitive performance, excellent charge&#8211;discharge stability, and power density even at 200&#160;&#176;C, making it a promising candidate for high-temperature high-energy-density capacitors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-temperature polymer dielectrics have broad application prospects in next-generation microelectronics and electrical power systems. However, the capacitive energy densities of dielectric polymers at elevated temperatures are severely limited by carrier excitation and transport. Herein, a molecular engineering strategy is presented to regulate the bulk-limited conduction in the polymer by bonding amino polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-POSS) with the chain ends of polyimide (PI). Experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the terminal group NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-POSS with a wide-bandgap of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; &#8776; 6.6&#160;eV increases the band energy levels of the PI and induces the formation of local deep traps in the hybrid films, which significantly restrains carrier transport. At 200&#160;&#176;C, the hybrid film exhibits concurrently an ultrahigh discharged energy density of 3.45&#160;J&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; and a high gravimetric energy density of 2.74&#160;J&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with the charge-discharge efficiency &amp;gt;90%, far exceeding those achieved in the dielectric polymers and nearly all other polymer nanocomposites. Moreover, the NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-POSS terminated PI film exhibits excellent charge-discharge cyclability (&amp;gt;50000) and power density (0.39&#160;MW&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;) at 200&#160;&#176;C, making it a promising candidate for high-temperature high-energy-density capacitors.

         <title>Gadolinium (III)&#8208;Chelated Deformable Mesoporous Organosilica Nanoparticles as Magnetic Resonance Imaging Contrast Agent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel deformable nanocarrier is synthesized that is easy to modify and load with drugs. The magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent Gd&#8208;DTPA (Magnevist) has longer blood circulation, higher relaxivity, and greater tissue specificity when loaded into the deformable nanocarrier.








Abstract
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, such as Magnevist (Gd&#8208;DTPA), are routinely used for detecting tumors at an early stage. However, the rapid clearance by the kidney of Gd&#8208;DTPA leads to short blood circulation time, which limits further improvement of the contrast between tumorous and normal tissue. Inspired by the deformability of red blood cells, which improves their blood circulation, this work fabricates a novel MRI contrast agent by incorporating Gd&#8208;DTPA into deformable mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles (D&#8208;MON). In vivo distribution shows that the novel contrast agent is able to depress rapid clearance by the liver and spleen, and the mean residence time is 20 h longer than Gd&#8208;DTPA. Tumor MRI studies demonstrated&#160;that the D&#8208;MON&#8208;based contrast agent is highly enriched in the tumor tissue and achieves prolonged high&#8208;contrast imaging. D&#8208;MON significantly improves the performance of clinical contrast agent Gd&#8208;DTPA, exhibiting good potential in clinical applications.

         <title>Localized Bound Multiexcitons in Engineered Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskites Grains at Room Temperature for Efficient Lasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature multiexcitonic amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) with threshold as low as 13.7 &#181;J cm&#8722;2, which is reduced 58.6% relative to the amorphous counterpart with larger grains, is demonstrated based on quasi&#8208;2D perovskite P2F8 with grains sized in hundreds&#8208;nm scale. In addition, the well&#8208;defined translational momentum in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite grains can restrict the Auger recombination that is detrimental to radiative emission.








Abstract
Reducing the excitation threshold to minimize the Joule heating is critical for the realization of perovskite laser diodes. Although bound excitons are promising for low threshold laser, how to generate them at room temperature for laser applications is still unclear in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite&#8208;based devices. In this work, via engineering quasi&#8208;2D perovskite PEA2(CH3NH3)n&#8208;1PbnBr3n+1 microscopic grains by the anti&#8208;solvent method, room&#8208;temperature multiexciton radiative recombination is successfully demonstrated at a remarkably low pump density of 0.97 &#181;J cm&#8722;2, which is only one&#8208;fourth of that required in 2D CdSe nanosheets. In addition, the well&#8208;defined translational momentum in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite grains can restrict the Auger recombination which is detrimental to radiative emission. Furthermore, the quasi&#8208;2D perovskite grains are favorable for increasing binding energies of excitons and biexcitons and so as the related radiative recombination. Consequently, the prepared &lt;n&#160;= 8&gt; phase quasi&#8208;2D perovskite film renders a threshold of room&#8208;temperature stimulated emission as low as 13.7 &#181;J cm&#8722;2, reduced by 58.6% relative to the amorphous counterpart with larger grains. The findings in this work are expected to facilitate the development of solution&#8208;processable perovskite multiexcitonic laser diodes.

An optoelectronic/electronic memory device with both the long&#8208;term potentiation/depression triggered by electrical pulses and short&#8208;term potentiation induced by 1550&#8208;nm laser pulses is fabricated from Te&#8208;based 2D van der Waals heterostructure, which holds great promise for fully memristive in&#8208;sensor RC at the optical communication band.








Abstract
Although 2D materials are widely explored for data storage and neuromorphic computing, the construction of 2D material&#8208;based memory devices with optoelectronic responsivity in the short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) region for in&#8208;sensor reservoir computing (RC) at the optical communication band still remains a big challenge. In this work, an electronic/optoelectronic memory device enabled by tellurium&#8208;based 2D van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure is reported, where the ferroelectric CuInP2S6 and tellurium channel endow this device with both the long&#8208;term potentiation/depression by voltage pulses and short&#8208;term potentiation by 1550&#160;nm laser pulses (a typical wavelength in the conventional fiber optical communication band). Leveraging the rich dynamics, a fully memristive in&#8208;sensor RC system that can simultaneously sense, decode, and learn messages transmitted by optical fibers is demonstrated. The reported 2D vdW heterostructure&#8208;based memory featuring both the long&#8208;term and short&#8208;term memory behaviors using electrical and optical pulses in SWIR region has not only complemented the wide spectrum of applications of 2D materials family in electronics/optoelectronics but also paves the way for future smart signal processing systems at the edge.

         <title>Dry Lithography Patterning of Monolayer Flexible Field Effect Transistors by 2D Mica Stamping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dry patterning approach together with the electrode transfer method for 2D solution&#8208;processed organic single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors via bottom&#8208;up fabrication is demonstrated. High&#8208;performance flexible monolayer OFETs and high&#8208;speed organic rectifiers are fabricated based on these strategies.








Abstract
Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) based on 2D monolayer organic semiconductors (OSC) have demonstrated promising potentials for various applications, such as light emitting diode (LED) display drivers, logic circuits, and wearable electrocardiography (ECG) sensors.

&lt;p&gt;A dry patterning approach together with the electrode transfer method for 2D solution-processed organic single-crystal field-effect transistors via bottom-up fabrication is demonstrated. High-performance flexible monolayer OFETs and high-speed organic rectifiers are fabricated based on these strategies.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) based on 2D monolayer organic semiconductors (OSC) have demonstrated promising potentials for various applications, such as light emitting diode (LED) display drivers, logic circuits, and wearable electrocardiography (ECG) sensors. To date, the fabrications of this class of highly crystallized 2D organic semiconductors (OSC) are dominated by solution shearing. As these organic active layers are only a few molecular layers thick, their compatibilities with conventional thermal evaporated top electrodes or sophisticated photolithography patterning are very limited, which also restricts their device density. Here, an electrode transfer stamp and a semiconductor patterning stamp are developed to fabricate OFETs with channel lengths down to 3 &#181;m over a large area without using any chemicals or causing any damage to the active layer. 2D 2,9-didecyldinaphtho[2,3-b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;-f]thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;-DNTT) monolayer OFETs developed by this new approach shows decent performance properties with a low threshold voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;TH&lt;/sub&gt;) less than 0.5 V, intrinsic mobility higher than 10 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a subthreshold swing (SS) less than 100 mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The proposed patterning approach is completely comparable with ultraflexible parylene substrate less than 2 &#181;m thick. By further reducing the channel length down to 2 &#181;m and using the monolayer OFET in an AC/DC rectifying circuit, the measured cutoff frequency is up to 17.3 MHz with an input voltage of 4 V.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Quenching NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;Aggregates of Benzo[c]thiophene Fluorophore for Highly Efficient Bioimaging and Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bright benzo[c]thiophene J&#8208;aggregate with anti&#8208;quenching property is developed. The J&#8208;type nanoparticles (NPs) are featured with large Stokes shift of 402 nm. After forming aggregates in aqueous milieu, the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence intensity is enhanced &#8776;26 folds due to aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect. The bright J&#8208;type AIE NPs are used to conduct whole&#8208;body blood vessel NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and cancer phototheranostics.








Abstract
Molecular fluorophores with the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emission hold great potential for deep&#8208;tissue bioimaging owing to their excellent biocompatibility and high resolution. Recently, J&#8208;aggregates are used to construct long&#8208;wavelength NIR&#8208;II emitters as their optical bands show remarkable red shifts upon forming water&#8208;dispersible nano&#8208;aggregates. However, their wide applications in the NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging are impeded by the limited varieties of J&#8208;type backbone and serious fluorescence quenching. Herein, a bright benzo[c]thiophene (BT) J&#8208;aggregate fluorophore (BT6) with anti&#8208;quenching effect is reported for highly efficient NIR&#8208;II bioimaging and phototheranostics. The BT fluorophores are manipulated to have Stokes shift over 400&#160;nm and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property for conquering the self&#8208;quenching issue of the J&#8208;type fluorophores. Upon forming BT6 assemblies in an aqueous environment, the absorption over 800&#160;nm and NIR&#8208;II emission over 1000&#160;nm are boosted for more than 41 and 26 folds, respectively. In vivo visualization of the whole&#8208;body blood vessel and imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy results verify that BT6 NPs are excellent agent for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and cancer phototheranostics. This work develops a strategy to construct bright NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates with precisely manipulated anti&#8208;quenching properties for highly efficient biomedical applications.

         <title>An n&#8208;Type All&#8208;Fused&#8208;Ring Molecule with Photoresponse to 1000&#160;nm for Highly Sensitive Near&#8208;Infrared Photodetector</title>

         <dc:description>
An n&#8208;type all&#8208;fused&#8208;ring molecule with ultrasmall bandgap and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light absorption is developed. Its fully fixed molecular conformation leads to low trap density in thin film and excellent device performance in NIR organic photodetector devices.








Abstract
Most of all&#8208;fused&#8208;ring &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules have wide or medium bandgap and show photo response in the visible range. In this work, an all&#8208;fused&#8208;ring n&#8208;type molecule, which exhibits an ultrasmall optical bandgap of 1.22&#160;eV and strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption with an onset absorption wavelength of 1013&#160;nm is reported. The molecule consists of 14 aromatic rings and has electron donor&#8211;acceptor characteristics. It exhibits excellent n&#8208;type properties with low&#8208;lying HOMO/LUMO energy levels of &#8722;5.48&#160;eV/&#8722;3.95 eV and high electron mobility of 7.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1. Most importantly, its thin film exhibits a low trap density of 5.55&#160;&#215;&#160;1016&#160;cm&#8722;3 because of the fixed molecular conformation and consequently low conformation disorder. As a result, organic photodetector (OPD) based on the compound exhibits a remarkably low dark current density (Jd) of 2.01&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;10&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#160;V. The device shows a shot&#8208;noise&#8208;limited specific detectivity (Dsh*) of exceeding 1013&#160;Jones at 400&#8211;1000&#160;nm wavelength region with a peak specific detectivity of 4.65&#160;&#215;&#160;1013&#160;Jones at 880&#160;nm. This performance is among the best reported for self&#8208;powered NIR OPDs.

         <title>Printable Thermochromic Hydrogel&#8208;Based Smart Window for All&#8208;Weather Building Temperature Regulation in Diverse Climates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermochromic smart windows based on thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogels with tunable response temperature show strong solar modulation in summer and irradiation blocking in winter to save building energy in diverse climates. The smart windows gain balanced temperature regulation and visibility through patterning with printed grids or kirigami, representing a breakthrough of smart windows for a low carbon economy.








Abstract
Thermochromic smart windows are widely developed to modulate building energy exchange to save building energy consumption. However, most smart windows have fixed working temperatures, moderate energy&#8208;saving efficiency, and are not suitable for diverse (cold and hot) climates. Here smart windows with strong temperature modulation over a broad range of hydrogels with adjustable transition temperatures for all&#8208;weather building temperature regulation in different climates are reported. Thermochromic poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;N, N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) hydrogels, with lower critical transition temperatures ranging from 32.5 to 43.5&#160;&#176;C, are developed for smart windows with solar modulation up to 88.84% and intrinsic transmittance up to 91.30% over full spectrum without energy input. Simulated indoor investigations are performed in different cities from 23 &#176;N to 39 &#176;N from winter to summer. The results indicate that smart windows have a strong solar modulation in summer to reduce indoor temperature up to 7.3&#160;&#176;C and efficient heat conservation in winter to save energy up to 4.30&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;3, in comparison to glass windows. Smart windows with grid patterns and Chinese kirigami are fabricated by using 3D printing of the hydrogels to achieve both solar modulation and light incidence. The strategy offers an innovative path for thermochromic smart windows for low carbon economy.

         <title>Liquid Metal Droplets&#8208;Based Elastomers from Electric Toothbrush&#8208;Inspired Revolving Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the working principle of electric toothbrushes, a novel revolving microfluidic technology for the generation of liquid metal (LM) droplets is presented. The resultant LM droplets exhibit controllable size and are produced in high&#8208;throughput. The droplets act as conductive fillers for the construction of flexible electronics directly. The obtained LM droplets&#8208;based elastomers show potential prospects in flexible electronics&#8208;relevant applications.








Abstract
Liquid metal (LM)&#8208;based elastomers have a demonstrated value in flexible electronics. Attempts in this area include the development of multifunctional LM&#8208;based elastomers with controllable morphology, superior mechanical performances, and great stability. Herein, inspired by the working principle of electric toothbrushes, a revolving microfluidic system is presented for the generation of LM droplets and construction of desired elastomers. The system involves revolving modules assembled by a needles array and 3D microfluidic channels. LM droplets can be generated with controllable size in a high&#8208;throughput manner due to the revolving motion&#8208;derived drag force. It is demonstrated that by employing a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) matrix as the collection phase, the generated LM droplets can act as conductive fillers for the construction of flexible electronics directly. The resultant LM droplets&#8208;based elastomers exhibit high mechanical strength, stable electrical performance, as well as superior self&#8208;healing property benefiting from the dynamic exchangeable urea bond of the polymer matrix. Notably, due to the flexible programmable feature of the LM droplets embedded within the elastomers, various patterned LM droplets&#8208;based elastomers can be easily achieved. These results indicate that the proposed microfluidic LM droplets&#8208;based elastomers have a great potential for promoting the development of flexible electronics.

         <title>Selective CO2 Electroreduction from Tuneable Naphthalene&#8208;Based Porous Polyimide Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here the developed Bristol&#8211;X'an&#8208;Jiatong (BXJ) method is utilized to tune the porosity properties of crosslinked polyimides (pPIs) to optimize CO2 capture. Once optimized, these pPIs are exploited as metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 to formate and methanol. High Faradaic efficiencies (up to 91%) and selective reduction products are achieved via tuning of the porosity properties and surface areas.








Abstract
A series of porous polyimides (pPIs) are synthesized, and their surface areas and pore sizes are optimized by the previously reported Bristol&#8211;X'an&#8208;Jiatong (BXJ) approach.&#160;How&#160;this approach can be used to tune and optimize the porous network properties to target and tune their ability to capture CO2 is demonstrated. Once optimized, these porous organic frameworks are utilized, for the first time, as electrocatalysts for the conversion of CO2. The excellent Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) for the conversion of CO2 to formate (91%) and methanol (85%) present exciting opportunities for the metal&#8208;free generation of useful fuels and feedstocks from CO2. In addition, the ability to directly address and select the conversion products through tuning of the porous materials&#8217; properties highlights the potential of this approach, and more generally for a wide range of organic frameworks as future metal&#8208;free CO2 reduction catalysts.

         <title>Thermally Enhanced and Long Lifetime Red TADF Carbon Dots via Multi&#8208;Confinement and Phosphorescence Assisted Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface engineering strategy is developed to confine carbon dots into a rigid network derived from multiple ionic bonds, which efficiently promote reverse intersystem crossing rate, suppress non&#8208;radiative transition, and stabilize triplet excited states. These results endow carbon dots with unique thermally enhanced TADF luminescence, accompanied by a long lifetime via energy transfer from RTP donor.








Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, which can harvest both singlet and triplet excitons for high&#8208;efficiency emission, have attracted widespread concern for their enormous applications. Nevertheless, luminescence thermal quenching severely limits the efficiency and operating stability in TADF materials and devices at high temperature. Herein, a surface engineering strategy is adopted to obtain unique carbon dots (CDs)&#8208;based thermally enhanced TADF materials with &#8776;250% enhancement from 273 to 343&#160;K via incorporating seed CDs into ionic crystal network. The rigid crystal network can simultaneously boost reverse intersystem crossing process via enhancing spin&#8208;orbit coupling between singlet and triplet states and suppressing non&#8208;radiative transition rate, contributing to the thermally enhanced TADF character. Benefiting from efficient energy transfer from triplet states of phosphorescence center to singlet states of CDs, TADF emission at &#8776;600&#160;nm in CDs displays a long lifetime up to 109.6&#160;ms, outperforming other red organic TADF materials. Thanks to variable decay rates of the delayed emission centers, time and temperature&#8208;dependent delayed emission color has been first realized in CDs&#8208;based delayed emission materials. The CDs with thermally enhanced and time&#8208;/temperature&#8208;dependent emission in one material system can offer new opportunities in information protection and processing.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Contained Alloy as a Robustly Adhered Interfacial Lattice Locking Layer for Planar and Stable Zinc Electrodeposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Interfacial Lattice Locking Layer is suzccessfully designed by electro&#8208;co&#8208;depositing Zn and Cu onto Zn electrodes, the as&#8208;formed CuZn5 alloy layer, which is robustly&#8208;adhered to the Zn electrodes, shows a low lattice misfit (&#948; = 0.036) to Zn (002) plane and selectively locks the lattice orientation of Zn deposits, enabling the epitaxial growth of Zn deposits layer by layer.








Abstract
Stable zinc (Zn)/electrolyte interface is critical for developing rechargeable aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries with long&#8208;term stability, which requires the dense and stable Zn electrodeposition. Herein, an interfacial lattice locking (ILL) layer is constructed via the electro&#8208;codeposition of Zn and Cu onto the Zn electrodes. The ILL layer shows a low lattice misfit (&#948;&#160;= 0.036) with Zn(002) plane and selectively locks the lattice orientation of Zn deposits, enabling the epitaxial growth of Zn deposits layer by layer. Benefiting from the unique orientation&#8208;guiding and robustly adhered properties, the ILL layer enables the symmetric Zn||Zn cells to achieve an ultralong life span of &gt;6000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2, a low overpotential (65&#160;mV) at 10 mAh cm&#8722;2, and a stable Zn plating/stripping for &gt;90&#160;h at an ultrahigh Zn depth of discharge (&#8776;85%). Even with a limited Zn supply and a high current density (8.58&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), the ILL@Zn||Ni&#8208;doped MnO2 cells can still survive for &gt;2300 cycles.

         <title>Periphery Fusion Strategy of a Carbazole&#8208;Based Macrocycle toward Coplanar N&#8208;Heterocycloarene for High&#8208;Mobility Single&#8208;Crystal Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A periphery fusion strategy from single&#8208;bond&#8208;linked macrocycle to fully fused N&#8208;heterocycloarene containing four carbazole units fine&#8208;tunes electronic structures, energy levels, photophysical properties, and molecular crystal stacking motifs. The N&#8208;heterocycloarene in single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors exhibits maximum hole mobility of 2.06 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which sets a new mobility record for (hetero)cycloarenes&#8208;based organic field&#8208;effect transistors.








Abstract
Designing (hetero)cycloarenes through the modifications of the &#960;&#8208;topology and molecular packing of organic semiconductors has recently garnered considerable attention. However, their applications as an organic active layer in field&#8208;effect transistors are very limited, and the obtained hole carrier mobilities are less than 1 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1. In this work, a novel alkyl&#8208;substituted coplanar N&#8208;heterocycloarene (FM&#8208;C4) containing four carbazole units is successfully synthesized in crystalline form. As compared to the corresponding single&#8208;bond&#8208;linked carbazole&#8208;based macrocycle M&#8208;C4, it is found that the periphery fusion strategy greatly changes the electronic structures, energy levels, photophysical properties, host&#8211;guest interactions with fullerenes, and molecular crystal stacking motifs. In particular, the fully fused N&#8208;heterocycloarene FM&#8208;C4 exhibits a herringbone packing structure with an unusual long&#8208;range &#960;&#8722;&#960; overlap distance as low as 3.19 &#197;, whereas the single crystal of M&#8208;C4 demonstrates no &#960;&#8722;&#960; interactions. As a consequence, FM&#8208;C4 in single&#8208;crystal transistors displays the highest hole mobility of 2.06 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1, significantly outperforming M&#8208;C4 and all the reported (hetero)cycloarenes and suggesting the high potential of (hetero)cycloarenes for organic electronic applications.

&lt;p&gt;A periphery fusion strategy from single-bond-linked macrocycle to fully fused N-heterocycloarene containing four carbazole units fine-tunes electronic structures, energy levels, photophysical properties, and molecular crystal stacking motifs. The N-heterocycloarene in single-crystal field-effect transistors exhibits maximum hole mobility of 2.06 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which sets a new mobility record for (hetero)cycloarenes-based organic field-effect transistors.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing (hetero)cycloarenes through the modifications of the &#960;-topology and molecular packing of organic semiconductors has recently garnered considerable attention. However, their applications as an organic active layer in field-effect transistors are very limited, and the obtained hole carrier mobilities are less than 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. In this work, a novel alkyl-substituted coplanar N-heterocycloarene (FM-C4) containing four carbazole units is successfully synthesized in crystalline form. As compared to the corresponding single-bond-linked carbazole-based macrocycle M-C4, it is found that the periphery fusion strategy greatly changes the electronic structures, energy levels, photophysical properties, host&#8211;guest interactions with fullerenes, and molecular crystal stacking motifs.

         <title>Foldable RF Energy Harvesting System Based on Vertically Layered Metal Electrodes within a Single Sheet of Paper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel foldable radio frequency energy harvesting (RFEH) system based on vertically separated metal electrodes is realized within a single sheet of paper using a combination of hydrophobic wax printing and water&#8208;based solution process. The RFEH system exhibits favorable RF/DC conversion efficiency, operating voltage, and stable foldability. This work shows great promise for remote powering of wearable and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things devices.








Abstract
Radio frequency energy harvesting (RFEH) systems have emerged as a critical component for powering devices and replacing traditional batteries, with paper being one of the most promising substrates for use in flexible RFEH systems. However, previous paper&#8208;based electronics with optimized porosity, surface roughness, and hygroscopicity still face limitations in terms of the development of integrated foldable RFEH systems within a single sheet of paper. In the present study, a&#160;novel wax&#8208;printing control and water&#8208;based solution process are&#160;used to realize an integrated foldable RFEH system within&#160;a single sheet of paper. The proposed paper&#8208;based&#160;device includes vertically layered&#160;foldable&#160;metal electrodes, a via&#8208;hole, and stable conductive patterns with a sheet resistance of less than 1&#160;&#937;&#160;sq&#8722;1. The proposed RFEH system exhibits an RF/DC conversion efficiency of 60% and an operating voltage of 2.1&#160;V in 100&#160;s at a distance of 50&#160;mm and a transmitted power of 50&#160;mW. The integrated RFEH system also demonstrates stable foldability, with RFEH performance maintained up to a folding angle of 150&#176;. The single&#8208;sheet paper&#8208;based RFEH system thus has the potential for use in practical applications associated with the remote powering of wearable and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things devices and in paper electronics.

         <title>Self&#8208;Doping Naphthalene Diimide Conjugated Polymers for Flexible Unipolar n&#8208;Type OTFTs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
New self&#8208;doping naphthalene diimide (NDI)&#8208;based conjugated polymers are successfully designed and synthesized, and the effects of self&#8208;doping on the electronic properties of flexible organic thin&#8208;film transistors (OTFTs) are investigated. The appropriate doping level results in unipolar n&#8208;type charge&#8208;carrier properties with good operational/ambient stability/bending resistance. Therefore, self&#8208;doping can be used as a powerful strategy for the rational design of advanced OTFT materials.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance organic thin&#8208;film transistor (OTFT) materials is vital for flexible electronics. Numerous OTFTs are so far reported but obtaining high&#8208;performance and reliable OTFTs simultaneously for flexible electronics is still challenging. Herein, it is reported that self&#8208;doping in conjugated polymer enables high unipolar n&#8208;type charge mobility in flexible OTFTs, as well as good operational/ambient stability and bending resistance. New naphthalene diimide (NDI)&#8208;conjugated polymers PNDI2T&#8208;NM17 and PNDI2T&#8208;NM50 with different contents of self&#8208;doping groups on their side chains are designed and synthesized. The effects of self&#8208;doping on the electronic properties of resulting flexible OTFTs are investigated. The results reveal that the flexible OTFTs based on self&#8208;doped PNDI2T&#8208;NM17 exhibit unipolar n&#8208;type charge&#8208;carrier properties and good operational/ambient stability thanks to the appropriate doping level and intermolecular interactions. The charge mobility and on/off ratio are fourfold and four orders of magnitude higher than those of undoped model polymer, respectively. Overall, the proposed self&#8208;doping strategy is useful for rationally designing OTFT materials with high semiconducting performance and reliability.

         <title>3D Printing a Low&#8208;Cost Miniature Accommodating Optical Microscope</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key optical and optomechanical components of a miniature accommodating optical microscope are 3D printed in 50 min for less than $4. Synergizing the built&#8208;in voice&#8208;coil motor and compliant optomechanics facilitates focus&#8208;stacking functionality for extending imaging depth. 3D printing enables digitized component manufacturing, part&#8208;count reduction, and passive alignment for the ease of system assembly and alignment, allowing rapid customizability toward task&#8208;specific needs.








Abstract
This decade has witnessed the tremendous progress in miniaturizing optical imaging systems. Despite the advancements in 3D printing optical lenses at increasingly smaller dimensions, challenges remain in precisely manufacturing the dimensionally compatible optomechanical components and assembling them into a functional imaging system. To tackle this issue, the use of 3D printing to enable digitalized optomechanical component manufacturing, part&#8208;count&#8208;reduction design, and the inclusion of passive alignment features is reported here, all for the ease of system assembly. The key optomechanical components of a penny&#8208;sized accommodating optical microscope are 3D printed in 50 min at a significantly reduced unit cost near $4. By actuating a built&#8208;in voice&#8208;coil motor, its accommodating capability is validated to focus on specimens located at different distances, and a focus&#8208;stacking function is further utilized to greatly extend depth of field. The microscope can be readily customized and rapidly manufactured to respond to task&#8208;specific needs in form factor and optical characteristics.

         <title>Robust Transport: An Artificial Solid Electrolyte Interphase Design for Anode&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tenacious composite artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with the integrated heterostructure of lithium fluoride (LiF) and lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) is prepared using a co&#8208;sputtering approach to achieve both high ionic conductivity and fracture toughness. It can inhibit the penetration of lithium dendrites, reducing parasitic side reactions and active lithium loss in anode&#8208;free lithium&#8208;metal batteries (AFLMBs).








Abstract
One of the most challenging issues in the practical implementation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density anode&#8208;free lithium&#8208;metal batteries (AFLMBs) is the sharp capacity attenuation caused by the mechanical degradation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). However, developing an artificial SEI to address this issue remains a challenge due to the trade&#8208;off between ionic conductivity and mechanical robustness for general ionic conducting films. In this study, a tenacious composite artificial SEI with integrated heterostructure of lithium fluoride (LiF) and lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) is prepared using a co&#8208;sputtering approach to achieve both high ionic conductivity and fracture toughness. The embedded LiF domain has an extremely high Young's modulus and surface energy compared with those of bulk LiPON film, enabling a significant increase in fracture toughness by an order of magnitude. Most importantly, the interface between LiPON and LiF in the integrated structure generates additional fast Li+&#8208;transport pathways, providing the artificial SEI with a conductivity higher than 10&#8722;6S&#160;cm&#8722;1. Consequently, the artificial SEI implementation significantly increases the cycling lifetime of the corresponding AFLMBs by &gt;250%. This study highlights the importance of fracture toughness for the structural integrity of batteries and provides suggestions for designing viable SEI materials for high&#8208;performance AFLMBs.

It can inhibit the penetration of lithium dendrites, reducing parasitic side reactions and active lithium loss in anode-free lithium-metal batteries (AFLMBs).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most challenging issues in the practical implementation of high-energy-density anode-free lithium-metal batteries (AFLMBs) is the sharp capacity attenuation caused by the mechanical degradation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). However, developing an artificial SEI to address this issue remains a challenge due to the trade-off between ionic conductivity and mechanical robustness for general ionic conducting films. In this study, a tenacious composite artificial SEI with integrated heterostructure of lithium fluoride (LiF) and lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) is prepared using a co-sputtering approach to achieve both high ionic conductivity and fracture toughness. The embedded LiF domain has an extremely high Young's modulus and surface energy compared with those of bulk LiPON film, enabling a significant increase in fracture toughness by an order of magnitude. Most importantly, the interface between LiPON and LiF in the integrated structure generates additional fast Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-transport pathways, providing the artificial SEI with a conductivity higher than 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt;S&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Consequently, the artificial SEI implementation significantly increases the cycling lifetime of the corresponding AFLMBs by &amp;gt;250%. This study highlights the importance of fracture toughness for the structural integrity of batteries and provides suggestions for designing viable SEI materials for high-performance AFLMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Pore Environments of Sulfate&#8208;Pillared Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation with Record Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering dense electronegative pore environments by the unmasked C&#63742;C moieties in SOFOUR&#8208;TEPE&#8208;Zn enables high affinity toward C2H2 than CO2 demonstrated by the benchmark C2H2/CO2 selectivity (16833). The simulated pressure swing adsorption processes reveal that 75.5 cm3 g&#8722;1 C2H2 of 99.5+% purity with a high gas recovery of 99.82% can be produced in a counter&#8208;current blowdown process.








Abstract
Engineering pore environments exhibit great potential in improving gas adsorption and separation performances but require specific means for acetylene/carbon dioxide (C2H2/CO2) separation due to their identical dynamic diameters and similar properties. Herein, a novel sulfate&#8208;pillared MOF adsorbent (SOFOUR&#8208;TEPE&#8208;Zn) using 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetra(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl) ethene (TEPE) ligand with dense electronegative pore surfaces is reported. Compared to the prototype SOFOUR&#8208;1&#8208;Zn, SOFOUR&#8208;TEPE&#8208;Zn exhibits a higher C2H2 uptake (89.1 cm3 g&#8722;1), meanwhile the CO2 uptake reduces to 14.1 cm3 g&#8722;1, only 17.4% of that on SOFOUR&#8208;1&#8208;Zn (81.0 cm3 g&#8722;1). The high affinity toward C2H2 than CO2 is demonstrated by the benchmark C2H2/CO2 selectivity (16&#8201;833). Furthermore, dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm its application feasibility and good cyclability at various flow rates. During the desorption cycle, 60.1 cm3 g&#8722;1 C2H2 of 99.5% purity or 33.2 cm3 g&#8722;1 C2H2 of 99.99% purity can be recovered by stepped purging and mild heating. The simulated pressure swing adsorption processes reveal that 75.5 cm3 g&#8722;1 C2H2 of 99.5+% purity with a high gas recovery of 99.82% can be produced in a counter&#8208;current blowdown process. Modeling studies disclose four favorable adsorption sites and dense packing for C2H2.

         <title>Ultrathin Nitride Ferroic Memory with Large ON/OFF Ratios for Analog In&#8208;Memory Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric and analog resistive switching in an ultrathin, epitaxial nitride ferroelectric heterostructure is demonstrated, showing high ON/OFF ratios, high uniformity, and good retention that enables multistate operation and linear analog computing with high accuracy. The results pave the way for constructing advanced memory/computing architectures based on emerging nitride ferroelectrics and promote homo and hybrid integrated functional edge devices beyond silicon.








Abstract
Computing in the analog regime using nonlinear ferroelectric resistive memory arrays can potentially alleviate the energy constraints and complexity/footprint challenges imposed by digital von Neumann systems. Yet the current ferroelectric resistive memories suffer from either low ON/OFF ratios/imprint or limited compatibility with mainstream semiconductors. Here, for the first time, ferroelectric and analog resistive switching in an epitaxial nitride heterojunction comprising ultrathin (&#8776;5&#160;nm) nitride ferroelectrics, i.e., ScAlN, with potentiality to bridge the gap between performance and compatibility is demonstrated. High ON/OFF ratios (up to 105), high uniformity, good retention, (&lt;20% variation after &gt;&#160;105&#160;s) and cycling endurance (&gt;104) are simultaneously demonstrated in a metal/oxide/nitride ferroelectric junction. It is further demonstrated that the memristor can provide programmability to enable multistate operation and linear analogue computing as well as image processing with high accuracy. Neural network simulations based on the weight update characteristics of the nitride memory yielded an image recognition accuracy of 92.9% (baseline 96.2%) on the images from Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology. The non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;level programmability and analog computing capability provide first&#8208;hand and landmark evidence for constructing advanced memory/computing architectures based on emerging nitride ferroelectrics, and promote homo and hybrid integrated functional edge devices beyond silicon.

         <title>An Edible Rechargeable Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By immobilizing on activated carbon, a widespread food additive, riboflavin (anode) and quercetin (cathode), common food ingredients and dietary supplements, a rechargeable edible battery is demonstrated. An acqueous electrolyte, a nori algae separator and a beeswax encapsulation complete the cell, which can operate at 0.65&#160;V.








Abstract
Edible electronics is a growing field that aims to produce digestible devices using only food ingredients and additives, thus addressing many of the shortcomings of ingestible electronic devices. Edible electronic devices will have major implications for gastrointestinal tract monitoring, therapeutics, as well as rapid food quality monitoring. Recent research has demonstrated the feasibility of edible circuits and sensors, but to realize fully edible electronic devices edible power sources are required, of which there have been very few examples. Drawing inspiration from living organisms, which use redox cofactors to power biochemical machines, a rechargeable edible battery formed from materials eaten in everyday life is developed. The battery is realized by immobilizing riboflavin and quercetin, common food ingredients and dietary supplements, on activated carbon, a widespread food additive. Riboflavin is used as the anode, while quercetin is used as the cathode. By encapsulating the electrodes in beeswax, a fully edible battery is fabricated capable of supplying power to small electronic devices. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept battery cell operated at 0.65&#160;V, sustaining a current of 48&#160;&#181;A for 12&#160;min. The presented proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept will open the doors to new edible electronic applications, enabling safer and easier medical diagnostics, treatments, and unexplored ways to monitor food quality.

         <title>Ultrabroadband Imaging Based on Wafer&#8208;Scale Tellurene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wafer&#8208;scale tellurene is synthesized under room temperature by exploiting pulsed&#8208;laser deposition. On this basis, tellurene&#8208;based photodetector arrays are constructed, manifesting outstanding photosensitivity with the optimal responsivity, external quantum efficiency, and detectivity of 2.7&#160;&#215; 107 A&#160;W&#8722;1, 8.2&#160;&#215; 109%, and 4.5 &#215; 1015&#160;Jones. Moreover, proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept ultrabroadband optical imaging is realized.








Abstract
High&#8208;resolution imaging is at the heart of the revolutionary breakthroughs of intelligent technologies, and it is established as an important approach toward high&#8208;sensitivity information extraction/storage.

&lt;p&gt;Wafer-scale tellurene is synthesized under room temperature by exploiting pulsed-laser deposition. On this basis, tellurene-based photodetector arrays are constructed, manifesting outstanding photosensitivity with the optimal responsivity, external quantum efficiency, and detectivity of 2.7&#160;&#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; A&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 8.2&#160;&#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;%, and 4.5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;Jones.

&lt;p&gt;High-resolution imaging is at the heart of the revolutionary breakthroughs of intelligent technologies, and it is established as an important approach toward high-sensitivity information extraction/storage. However, due to the incompatibility between non-silicon optoelectronic materials and traditional integrated circuits as well as the lack of competent photosensitive semiconductors in the infrared region, the development of ultrabroadband imaging is severely impeded. Herein, the monolithic integration of wafer-scale tellurene photoelectric functional units by exploiting room-temperature pulsed-laser deposition is realized.

         <title>Chemotaxis&#8208;guided Self&#8208;propelled Macrophage Motor for Targeted Treatment of Acute Pneumonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrophage motors are engineered by sequentially internalizing curcumin&#8208;loaded MnO2 nanoparticles respectively modified with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin and adamantane. Host&#8208;guest interactions drive intracellular self&#8208;assembly of nanoparticles into supramolecular aggregates, to inhibit the efflux of nanoparticles and catalytically convert H2O2 to O2 that propels macrophage motor for rapid tissue infiltration and inflammation alleviation for efficient treatment of acute pneumonia in mice.








Abstract
Immune cells exhibit great potential as carriers of nanomedicine, attributed to their high tolerance to internalized nanomaterials and targeted accumulation in inflammatory tissues. However, the premature efflux of internalized nanomedicine during systemic delivery and slow infiltration into inflammatory tissues have limited their translational applications. Herein, a motorized cell platform as a nanomedicine carrier for highly efficient accumulation and infiltration in the inflammatory lungs and effective treatment of acute pneumonia are reported. &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin and adamantane respectively modified manganese dioxide nanoparticles are intracellularly self&#8208;assembled into large aggregates mediated via host&#8208;guest interactions, to effectively inhibit the efflux of nanoparticles, catalytically consume/deplete H2O2 to alleviate inflammation, and generate O2 to propel macrophage movement for rapid tissue infiltration. With curcumin loaded into MnO2 nanoparticles, macrophages carry the intracellular nano&#8208;assemblies rapidly into the inflammatory lungs via chemotaxis&#8208;guided, self&#8208;propelled movement, for effective treatment of acute pneumonia via immunoregulation induced by curcumin and the aggregates.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Amphiphilic Pyridinium Salt and Its Application in the Visualization of Level 3 Details in Latent Fingerprints</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of both lipophilic part and hydrophilic end in molecular architecture endows CPAB with amphiphilic nature. Thanks to the sensitivity to moisture, the self&#8208;recovered mechanochromism from brown to cyan is observed by grinding in air. The visualization of level 3 details in latent fingerprints (LFPs) makes CPAB a promising indicator for individual information at crime scenes.








Abstract
Organic luminescent materials that can simultaneously achieve multimode mechanochromism and its water&#8208;vapor&#8208;induced recovery are desirable for practical applications but rarely reported. Herein, an amphiphilic compound, 4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;1&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium bromide (CPAB), is designed by integrating a lipophilic aromatic unit and hydrophilic end in the molecular architecture. Self&#8208;recovered mechanochromism from brown to cyan is observed upon mechanical grinding in air. Comprehensive research by X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal analysis reveals that the photoluminescence switch originates from the variation in intermolecular hydrogen bonds and molecular packing mode. The amphiphilic nature of CPAB allows water molecules to enter the crystalline lattice, forming two polymorphs of the crystalline phase, namely CPAB&#8208;D and CPAB&#8208;W. The hydrosoluble CPAB exhibits excellent capability in probing the level 3 details of fingerprints because its lipophilic part can target the fatty acid residues of fingerprints, leading to strong aggregation&#8208;induced fluorescence. The research may inspire the design of latent fingerprint developers and application in forensics/anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance, Highly Stretchable, Flexible Moist&#8208;Electric Generators via Molecular Engineering of Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient and stretchable moist&#8208;electric generators are developed via a molecular engineering strategy, which fully leverages the molecular structure of hydrogels, circumventing the addition of extra elastomers or conductors. It offers a record&#8208;high short&#8208;circuit current density due to enhanced moisture adsorption and ionic conductivity, holding great potential for next&#8208;generation self&#8208;powered protective wearables including spacesuits, helmets, medical suits.








Abstract
Harvesting energy from ubiquitous moisture has emerged as a promising technology, offering opportunities to power wearable electronics. However, low current density and inadequate stretching limit their integration into self&#8208;powered wearables. Herein, a high&#8208;performance, highly stretchable, and flexible moist&#8208;electric generator (MEG) is developed via molecular engineering of hydrogels. The molecular engineering involves the impregnation of lithium ions and sulfonic acid groups into the polymer molecular chains to create ion&#8208;conductive and stretchable hydrogels. This new strategy fully leverages the molecular structure of polymer chains, circumventing the addition of extra elastomers or conductors. A centimeter&#8208;sized hydrogel&#8208;based MEG can generate an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.81&#160;V and a short&#8208;circuit current density of up to 480&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2. This current density is more than ten times that of most reported MEGs. Moreover, molecular engineering improves the mechanical properties of hydrogels, resulting in a stretchability of 506%, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art level in reported MEGs. Notably, large&#8208;scale integration of the high&#8208;performance and stretchable MEGs is demonstrated to power wearables with integrated electronics, including respiration monitoring masks, smart helmets, and medical suits. This work provides fresh insights into the design of high&#8208;performance and stretchable MEGs, facilitating their application to self&#8208;powered wearables and broadening the application scenario.

Hydrogel Smart Windows
In article number 2211716, Xiancai Jiang, Jun Fu, and co&#8208;workers report a novel thermochromic hydrogel&#8208;based smart window for all&#8208;weather building&#8208;temperature regulation in diverse climates. The hydrogel smart windows spontaneously transform from transparent to opaque upon temperature changes. The outdoor solar radiation in summer and indoor thermal radiation in winter are both regulated by the smart window to modulate the building temperature and save energy.

3D Printing
In article number 2208365, Rihan Hai, Cheng Sun, and co&#8208;workers report a method for 3D printing the key optical and optomechanical components of a miniature accommodating optical microscope in 50 min for less than $4. Synergizing the built&#8208;in voice&#8208;coil&#8208;motor and compliant optomechanics facilitates focus stacking functionality for extending imaging depth. 3D printing enables digitized component manufacturing, part&#8208;count reduction, and passive alignment for the ease of system miniaturization and assembly, allowing rapid customizability toward task&#8208;specific needs.

         <title>Organic Photovoltaics Utilizing Small&#8208;Molecule Donors and Y&#8208;Series Nonfullerene Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new generation of all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs) utilizing small&#8208;molecule donors and Y&#8208;series nonfullerene acceptors has shown great progress in recent years, which provides distinctly different scenery from fullerene&#8208; and ITIC&#8208;series&#8208;based ASM&#8208;OSCs. The materials design strategy, morphology formation mechanism, and potential challenges for ASM&#8208;OSCs are systematically summarized.








Abstract
The emerging Y&#8208;series nonfullerene acceptors (Y&#8208;NFA) has prompted&#160;the rapid progress of power conversion efficiency (PCE) of all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs) from around 12% to 17%. The excellent PCE improvement benefits from not only the outstanding properties of Y&#8208;series acceptors but also the successful development of small&#8208;molecule donors. The short&#8208;circuit current density, fill factor, and nonradiative recombination are all optimized to the unprecedented values, providing a scenery that is obviously different from the ITIC&#8208;series based ASM&#8208;OSCs. In this review, OSCs utilizing small&#8208;molecule donors and Y&#8208;NFA are summarized and classified in order to provide an up&#8208;to&#8208;date development overview and give an insight on structure&#8211;property correlation. Then, the characteristics of bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) formation of ASM&#8208;OSCs are discussed and compared with that of polymer&#8208;based OSCs. Finally, the challenges and outlook on designing ground&#8208;breaking small&#8208;molecule donor and forming an ideal BHJ morphology are discussed.

         <title>Reversible Discharge Products in Li&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in discharge products, whose reversibility closely affects the performance of Li&#8211;air batteries, are reviewed. The formation/decomposition mechanisms of discharge products, including Li2O2, LiOH, LiO2, Li2O, Li2CO3, and the determining factors for reversibility are systematically summarized. Perspectives for Li&#8211;air batteries, focused on the fundamental development of discharge products and future applications, are also provided.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;air (Li&#8211;air) batteries stand out among the post&#8208;Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their high energy density, which has rapidly progressed in the past years. Regarding the fundamental mechanism of Li&#8211;air batteries that discharge products produced and decomposed during charging and recharging progress, the reversibility of products closely affects the battery performance. Along with the upsurge of the mainstream discharge products lithium peroxide, with devoted efforts to screening electrolytes, constructing high&#8208;efficiency cathodes, and optimizing anodes, much progress is made in the fundamental understanding and performance. However, the limited advancement is insufficient. In this case, the investigations of other discharge products, including lithium hydroxide, lithium superoxide, lithium oxide, and lithium carbonate, emerge and bring breakthroughs for the Li&#8211;air battery technologies. To deepen the understanding of the electrochemical reactions and conversions of discharge products in the battery, recent advances in the various discharge products, mainly focusing on the growth and decomposition mechanisms and the determining factors are systematically reviewed. The perspectives for Li&#8211;air batteries on the fundamental development of discharge products and future applications are also provided.

         <title>From Nanoscopic to Macroscopic Materials by Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Nanoparticle Aggregation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of the different length&#8208;scale materials by stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoparticle (NP) aggregation is presented. The design strategy for NP aggregation by external stimuli, the recent progress, and the applications are summarized. The main challenges for the development of functional materials at different length scales are analyzed and prospects for the potential applications in different fields are discussed.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoparticle (NP) aggregation plays an increasingly important role in regulating NP assembly into microscopic superstructures, macroscopic 2D, and 3D functional materials. Diverse external stimuli are widely used to adjust the aggregation of responsive NPs, such as light, temperature, pH, electric, and magnetic fields. Many unique structures based on responsive NPs are constructed including disordered aggregates, ordered superlattices, structural droplets, colloidosomes, and bulk solids. In this review, the strategies for NP aggregation by external stimuli, and their recent progress ranging from nanoscale aggregates, microscale superstructures to macroscale bulk materials along the length scales as well as their applications are summarized. The future opportunities and challenges for designing functional materials through NP aggregation at different length scales are also discussed.

         <title>Revisiting the Nature of Chemical Bonding in Chalcogenides to Explain and Design their Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical bonding descriptors enable a quantitative description of bonding in chalcogenides. These descriptors are employed as property predictors for optical and transport properties. Hence, they can be utilized to tailor thermoelectrics, photovoltaics, and phase&#8208;change memories. Their unusual property portfolio is attributed to a novel bonding mechanism, different from ionic, metallic, and covalent bonding, which is called &#8220;metavalent.&#8221;








Abstract
Quantum chemical bonding descriptors have recently been utilized to design materials with tailored properties. Their usage to facilitate a quantitative description of bonding in chalcogenides as well as the transition between different bonding mechanisms is reviewed. More importantly, these descriptors can also be employed as property predictors for several important material characteristics, including optical and transport properties. Hence, these quantum chemical bonding descriptors can be utilized to tailor material properties of chalcogenides relevant for thermoelectrics, photovoltaics, and phase&#8208;change memories. Relating material properties to bonding mechanisms also shows that there is a class of materials, which are characterized by unconventional properties such as a pronounced anharmonicity, a large chemical bond polarizability, and strong optical absorption. This unusual property portfolio is attributed to a novel bonding mechanism, fundamentally different from ionic, metallic, and covalent bonding, which is called &#8220;metavalent.&#8221; In the concluding section, a number of promising research directions are sketched, which explore the nature of the property changes upon changing bonding mechanism and extend the concept of quantum chemical property predictors to more complex compounds.

         <title>Extreme Water Uptake of Hygroscopic Hydrogels Through Maximized Swelling&#8208;Induced Salt Loading</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hygroscopic hydrogels are emerging as scalable and low&#8208;cost sorbents for atmospheric water harvesting, dehumidification, passive cooling, and thermal energy storage. However, devices using these materials still exhibit insufficient performance, partly due to limited water vapor uptake of the hydrogels. Here we characterize the swelling dynamics of hydrogels in aqueous lithium&#8208;chloride solutions, its implications on hydrogel salt loading, as well as the resulting vapor uptake of the synthesized hydrogel&#8208;salt composites. By tuning the salt concentration of the swelling solutions and the crosslinking properties of the gels, we synthesize hygroscopic hydrogels with extremely high salt loadings which enables unprecedented water uptakes of 1.79&#160;g/g and 3.86&#160;g/g at a relative humidity (RH) of 30% and 70%, respectively. At 30% RH, this exceeds previously reported water uptakes of metal&#8208;organic frameworks by over 100% and of hydrogels by 15%, bringing the uptake within 93% of the fundamental limit of hygroscopic salts, while avoiding leakage problems common in salt solutions. By modeling the salt&#8208;vapor equilibria, we elucidate the maximum leakage&#8208;free RH as a function of hydrogel uptake and swelling ratio. These insights guide the design of hydrogels with exceptional hygroscopicity which enable sorption&#8208;based devices to tackle water scarcity and the global energy crisis.

         <title>Ultrathin Metal Film on Graphene for Percolation&#8208;threshold&#8208;limited Thermal Emissivity Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Here, we show that translucent Au/graphene hybrid films can effectively reduce thermal emission from the underlying surfaces when the deposition thickness of Au is close to the percolation threshold. The critical Au deposition thickness for an abrupt change in emissivity is reduced from 15&#160;nm (Si substrate) to percolation&#8208;threshold&#8208;limited thickness of 8.5&#160;nm (Graphene/Si substrate) because of the chemical inertness of graphene leading the deposited Au atoms to form a thin, crystalline layer. The effect of the graphene layer on the optical properties of the hybrid film is highlighted by a drastic increase in infrared absorptivity, whereas the visible absorptivity is marginally affected by the presence of a graphene layer. The level of thermal emission from the Au/graphene hybrid films with percolation&#8208;threshold&#8208;limited Au thickness was stable even with high background temperatures up to 300&#176;C and mechanical strains of &#8764;4%. As an example of a thermal management application, we demonstrate an anti&#8208;counterfeiting device; thermal&#8208;camouflage&#8208;masked text fabricated with a Au/graphene hybrid film is discernible only using an thermographic camera. Ultrathin metal film assisted by a graphene layer will provide a facile platform for thermal management with semi&#8208;transparency, flexibility, and transferability to arbitrary surfaces.

         <title>An Amphiphilic Entangled Network Design Towards Ultratough Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydrogels find important roles in biomedicine, wearable electronics and soft robotics, but their mechanical properties are often unsatisfactory. Conventional tough hydrogel designs are based on hydrophilic networks with sacrificial bonds, while incorporation of hydrophobic polymers into hydrogels is less well understood. In this work, we demonstrate a hydrogel toughening strategy by introducing a hydrophobic polymer as reinforcement. Semicrystalline hydrophobic polymer chains are &#8220;woven&#8221; into a hydrophilic network via entropy&#8208;driven miscibility. In&#8208;situ formed sub&#8208;micrometer crystallites stiffen the network, while entanglements between hydrophobic polymer and hydrophilic network enable large deformation before failure. The hydrogels are stiff, tough and durable at high swelling ratios of 6&#8211;10, and the mechanical property are tunable. Moreover, they could effectively encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules.

         <title>Less&#8208;suture Vascular Anastomosis: Development of Alternative Protocols with Multifunctional Self&#8208;wrapping, Transparent, Adhesive, Elastic Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Blood vessel anastomosis by suture is a life&#8208;saving, yet time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive operation. While suture&#8208;less alternatives utilizing clips or related devices have been developed to address these shortcomings, suture anastomosis is still overwhelmingly used in most cases. In this study, we propose practical &#8220;less&#8208;suture&#8221; strategies, rather than ideal &#8220;suture&#8208;less&#8221; methods, to reflect real&#8208;world clinical situations. In the case of rat artery (d = 0.64 mm) anastomosis, the less&#8208;suture anastomosis involves the application of thin, adhesive, transparent, self&#8208;wrapping films to the site. This surprisingly reduced the number of stitches required from ten (without films) to four (with films), saving 27 minutes of operating time per vessel. Furthermore, the decreased number of stitches largely alleviated fibrosis&#8208;mediated wall&#8208;thickening. Thus, a less&#8208;suture strategy is particularly useful for anastomosis of multiple vessels in emergency conditions and small&#8208;diameter vessels.

         <title>Lipid Nanoparticle (LNP) Enables mRNA Delivery for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Messenger RNA (mRNA) has received great attention in the prevention and treatment of various diseases due to the success of COVID&#8208;19 mRNA vaccines (Comirnaty and Spikevax). To meet the therapeutic purpose, it is required that mRNA must enter the target cells and express sufficient proteins. Therefore, the development of effective delivery systems is necessary and crucial. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) represents a remarkable vehicle that has indeed accelerated mRNA applications in humans, as several mRNA&#8208;based therapies have already been approved or are in clinical trials. In this review, we focus on mRNA&#8208;LNP mediated anticancer therapy. We summarize the main development strategies of mRNA&#8208;LNP formulations, discuss representative therapeutic approaches in cancer, and point out current challenges and possible future directions of this research field. We hope these delivered messages could help further improve the application of mRNA&#8208;LNP technology in cancer therapy.

         <title>Tailored Lattice&#160;Compressive&#160;Strain&#160;of Pt&#8208;skins by the L12&#8208;Pt3M Intermetallic Core for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>

Abstract
The sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and unsatisfactory durability of Pt&#8208;based catalysts are severely hindering the commercialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Herein, we tailor the lattice compressive strain of Pt&#8208;skins imposed by Pt&#8208;based intermetallic cores for highly effective oxygen reduction through the confinement effect of the activated nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon (a&#8208;NPC). The strong confinement effect of modulated pores of a&#8208;NPC not only promotes Pt&#8208;based intermetallics with ultra&#8208;small size (average size &lt; 4&#160;nm), but also efficiently stabilizes intermetallic nanoparticles as well as sufficient exposure of active sites during the ORR process. The optimized catalyst (L12&#8208;Pt3Co@ML&#8208;Pt/NPC10) achieves excellent mass activity (1.72 A mgPt&#8722;1) and specific activity (3.49&#160;mA cmPt&#8722;2), which are eleven&#8208;fold and fifteen&#8208;fold that of commercial Pt/C, respectively. Besides, owing to the confinement effect of a&#8208;NPC and protection of Pt&#8208;skins, L12&#8208;Pt3Co@ML&#8208;Pt/NPC10 retains 98.1% mass activity after 30,000 cycles, and even 95% for 100,000 cycles, while Pt/C retained only 51.2% for 30,000 cycles. Rationalized by DFT calculation, compared with other metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, Zn), L12&#8208;Pt3Co closer to the top of &#8220;volcano&#8221; induces a more suitable compressive strain and electronic structure on Pt&#8208;skin, leading to an optimal oxygen adsorption energy and a remarkable ORR performance.

         <title>Polyimides Physical&#8208;Crosslinked by Aromatic Molecules Exhibit Ultrahigh Energy Density at 200&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymer dielectrics possess significant advantages in electrostatic energy storage applications such as high breakdown strength (Eb) and efficiency (&#951;), while their discharged energy density (Ud) at high temperature is limited by the decrease in Eb and &#951;. Several strategies including introducing inorganic components and crosslinking have been investigated to improve the Ud of polymer dielectrics, but new issues will be encountered, e.g., the sacrifice of flexibility, the degradation of the interfacial insulating property and the complex preparation process. Herein, we introduce three&#8208;dimensional rigid aromatic molecules into aromatic polyimides to form physical crosslinking networks through the electrostatic interaction between their oppositely charged phenyl groups. The dense physical crosslinking networks strengthen the polyimides to boost the Eb and the aromatic molecules trap the charge carriers to suppress the loss, allowing the strategy to combine the advantages of inorganic incorporation and crosslinking. We demonstrate that this strategy is well applicable in a number of representative aromatic polyimides and ultrahigh Ud of 8.02 J cm&#8722;3 (150&#160;&#176;C) and 5.12 J cm&#8722;3 (200&#160;&#176;C) is achieved. Furthermore, the all&#8208;organic composites exhibit stable performances during ultralong 105 charge&#8208;discharge cycles in harsh environments (500 MV m&#8722;1 and 200&#160;&#176;C) and prospects for large&#8208;scale preparation.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Superspreading&#8208;Boosted High&#8208;Performance Jet&#8208;Flow Boiling for Enhancement of Phase&#8208;Change Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superspreading of organic cooling agents on a designed micro&#8208;/nanostructured Cu surface highly boosts the liquid re&#8208;wetting process, causing a discontinuous solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;vapor contact line and ultralow under&#8208;liquid bubble adhesion. By promoting latent heat exchange based on ultrafast liquid re&#8208;wetting and constant vapor coalescence, a characteristic, enhanced jet&#8208;flow boiling is obtained and optimized, enabling a high&#8208;performance phase&#8208;change cooling for heat management of central processing unit chips.








Abstract
Enhanced boiling heat transfer via surface engineering is a topic of general interest for its great demand in industrial fields. However, as a dynamic interfacial phenomenon, a deep understanding of its process and mechanism, including liquid re&#8208;wetting and vapor departure, is still challenging. Herein, a micro&#8208;/nanostructured Cu surface containing a periodic microgroove/pyramid array with rich nanowrinkles is designed, where superspreading (&lt;134.1&#160;ms) of organic cooling agents highly boosts the liquid re&#8208;wetting process, causing a discontinuous solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;vapor three&#8208;phase contact line and ultralow under&#8208;liquid bubble adhesion force (&#8776;1.3&#160;&#181;N). Therefore, a characteristic, ultrafast jet&#8208;flow boiling (bubbles rapidly ejected in multiple strips) is obtained on this surface, giving a priority to nucleation (superheat &#8776; 1.5&#160;&#176;C) and simultaneously enhancing the critical heat flux and heat&#8208;transfer coefficient by up to 80% and 608%, respectively, compared with a flat surface. In situ observation and analysis of the nucleation, growth, and departure of micro&#8208;sized jet&#8208;flow bubbles reflects that microgrooves/pyramids with nanowrinkles promote the latent heat exchange process by superspreading&#8208;induced ultrafast liquid re&#8208;wetting and constant vapor film coalescing. Based on the designed structures, high&#8208;performance phase&#8208;change cooling for central processing unit heat management in supercomputer centers is accomplished with an ultralow power usage effectiveness (PUE &lt; 1.04).

         <title>Direct Integration of Perovskite Solar Cells with Carbon Fiber Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of thin&#8208;film photovoltaics with structural components represents an attractive prospect for mobile power applications. In this work, the first example of perovskite solar cells deposited directly onto rigid carbon&#8208;fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer composite substrates is demonstrated, heralding a new class of photocurrent&#8208;generating materials with both high specific strength and power.








Abstract
Integrating photovoltaic devices onto the surface of carbon&#8208;fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer substrates should create materials with high mechanical strength that are also able to generate electrical power. Such devices are anticipated to find ready applications as structural, energy&#8208;harvesting systems in both the automotive and aeronautical sectors. Here, the fabrication of triple&#8208;cation perovskite n&#8211;i&#8211;p solar cells onto the surface of planarized carbon&#8208;fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer substrates is demonstrated, with devices utilizing a transparent top ITO contact. These devices also contain a &#8220;wrinkled&#8221; SiO2 interlayer placed between the device and substrate that alleviates thermally induced cracking of the bottom ITO layer. Devices are found to have a maximum stabilized power conversion efficiency of 14.5% and a specific power (power per weight) of 21.4&#160;W&#160;g&#8722;1 (without encapsulation), making them highly suitable for mobile power applications.

         <title>Induction of Tumor Ferroptosis&#8208;Dependent Immunity via an Injectable Attractive Pickering Emulsion Gel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The combination of ferroptosis inducers and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) can enhance antitumor effects. However, the efficacy in tumors with low immunogenicity requires further investigation. Herein, we have developed a water&#8208;in&#8208;oil Pickering emulsion gel to deliver (1S, 3R)&#8208;RSL&#8208;3 (RSL&#8208;3), a ferroptosis inducer dissolved in iodized oil and programmed death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1) antibody, the most commonly used immune checkpoint inhibitor dissolved in water, with optimal characteristics (RSL&#8208;3+PD&#8208;1@gel). Tumor lipase degrades the continuous oil phase, which results in the slow release of RSL&#8208;3 and PD&#8208;1 antibody and a notable antitumor effect against low&#8208;immunogenic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and pancreatic cancer. Intriguingly, the RSL&#8208;3+PD&#8208;1@gel induces ferroptosis of tumor cells, resulting in antitumor immune response via accumulation of helper T lymphocyte cells and cytotoxic T cells. Additionally, the single cell sequence profiling analysis during tumor treatment reveals the induction of ferroptosis in tumor cells together with strong antitumor immune response in ascites.

         <title>Synergetic Enhancement of Strength&#8208;ductility and Thermoelectric Properties of Ag2Te by Domain Boundaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Simultaneously improving the mechanical and thermoelectric properties is significant for the engineering applications of inorganic thermoelectric materials. In this work, a novel nanodomain strategy was developed for Ag2Te compounds to yield 40% and 200% improved compressive strength (160&#160;MPa) and fracture strain (16%) when compared to domain&#8208;free samples (115&#160;MPa and 5.5%, respectively). The domained samples also achieved a 45% improvement in average ZT value. The domain boundaries provide extra sites for dislocation nucleation while pinning the dislocation movement, resulting in superior strength and ductility. In addition, phonon scattering induced by domain boundaries suppressed the lattice thermal conductivity of Ag2Te and also reduces the weighted mobility. These findings provided new insights into grain and domain boundary engineering for high&#8208;performance inorganic semiconductors with robust mechanical properties.

         <title>Flexible Solution Processable Black Phosphorus Based Optoelectronic Memristive Synapse for Neuromorphic Computing and Artificial Visual Perception Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Being renowned for operating with visible light pulses and electrical signals, optoelectronic memristive synaptic devices have excellent potential for neuromorphic computing systems and artificial visual information processing. Here, we&#160;present a flexible back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line compatible optoelectronic memristor based on solution&#8208;processable black phosphorus/HfOx bilayer with excellent synaptic features, towards biomimetic retinas. The device shows highly stable synaptic features such as long&#8208;term potentiation (LTP) and long&#8208;term depression (LTD) for repetitive 1000 epochs, having 400 conductance pulses, each. The device presents advanced synaptic features in terms of long&#8208;term memory (LTM)/short term memory (STM), as well as learning&#8208;forgetting&#8208;relearning when visible light was&#160;induced on it. These advanced synaptic features can improve the information processing abilities for neuromorphic applications. Interestingly, the STM can be converted into LTM by adjusting the intensity of light and illumination time. Using the light induced characteristics of the device, a 6&#215;6 synaptic array was&#160;developed to exhibit possible use in artificial visual perception. Moreover, the devices were&#160;flexed using a Silicon back&#8208;etching process. The resulting flexible devices demonstrate stable synaptic features when bent down to 1&#160;cm radius. These multifunctional features in a single memristive cell make it highly suitable for optoelectronic memory storage, neuromorphic computing, and artificial visual perception applications.

We present planar microcavities with strong light&#8208;matter coupling, monolithically processed fully from solution, consisting of two polymer&#8208;based distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) comprising alternating layers of a high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index titanium oxide hydrate/poly(vinyl alcohol) hybrid material and a low&#8208;refractive&#8208;index fluorinated polymer. The DBRs enclose a perylene diimide derivative (b&#8208;PDI&#8208;1) film positioned at the antinode of the optical mode. Strong light&#8208;matter coupling is achieved in these structures at the target excitation of the b&#8208;PDI&#8208;1. Indeed, the energy&#8208;dispersion relation (energy versus in&#8208;plane wavevector or output angle) in reflectance and the group delay of transmitted light in the microcavities show a clear anti&#8208;crossing &#8212; an energy gap between two distinct exciton&#8208;polariton dispersion branches. The agreement between classical electrodynamic simulations of the microcavity response and our experimental data demonstrates that the entire microcavity stack can be controllably produced as designed. Promisingly, the refractive index of the inorganic/organic hybrid layers used in the microcavity DBRs can be precisely manipulated between values of 1.5 to 2.1. Hence, microcavities with a wide spectral range of optical modes might be designed and produced with straight&#8208;forward coating methodologies, enabling fine&#8208;tuning of the energy and lifetime of the microcavities&#8216;s optical modes to harness strong light&#8208;matter coupling in a wide variety of solution processable active materials.

         <title>Fluoride&#8208;Catalyzed Siloxane Exchange as a Robust Dynamic Chemistry for High&#8208;Performance Vitrimers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sustainable developments of new technologies require materials having advanced physical and chemical properties while maintaining reprocessability and recyclability. Vitrimers are designed for this purpose, however their dynamic covalent chemistries often have drawbacks or are limited to specialized polymers. Here w e report fluoride&#8208;catalyzed siloxane exchange as an exceptionally robust chemistry for scalable production of high&#8208;performance vitrimers through industrial processing of commodity polymers such as poly(methyl methacrylate), polyethylene, and polypropylene. The vitrimers show improved resistance to creep, heat, oxidation, and hydrolysis, while maintaining excellent melt flow for processing and recycling. Furthermore, the siloxane exchange between different vitrimers during mechanical blending result in self&#8208;compatibilized blends without any compatibilizers. This offers a general, scalable method for producing sustainable high&#8208;performance vitrimers and a new strategy for recycling mixed plastic wastes.

         <title>Towards Sustainable All Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;metal Batteries: Perspectives on Battery Technology and Recycling Processes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#8208;based batteries are gradually evolving from the liquid to the solid state in terms of safety and energy density, where all solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries (ASSLMBs) are considered the most promising candidates. This was demonstrated by the Bluecar electric vehicle produced by the Bollor&#233; Group, which is utilized in car&#8208;sharing services in several cities worldwide. Despite impressive progress in the development of ASSLMBs, their avenues for recycling them remain underexplored, and combined with the current explosion of spent Li&#8208;ion batteries, they should attract widespread interest from academia and industry. Here, we analyze the potential challenges of recycling ASSLMBs as compared to Li&#8208;ion batteries and summarize and analyze the current progress and prospects for recycling ASSLMBs. Drawing on the lessons learned from Li&#8208;ion battery recycling, it is important to design sustainable recycling technologies before ASSLMBs gain widespread market adoption. We also highlighted a battery&#8208;recycling&#8208;oriented design for ASSLMBs to promote the recycling rate and maximize profitability. Finally, future research directions, challenges, and prospects are outlined to provide strategies for achieving sustainable development of ASSLMBs.

         <title>Programmable Tissue Folding Patterns in Structured Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissue folds such as in the upper airways have important functions in organ development and homeostasis. Engineered hydrogels provide a system to recreate tissue folding patterns in vitro but are almost exclusively limited to static platforms. In this work, the design of a dynamic and cytcompatible hydrogel folding system based on magnetoactive biocomposites for on&#8208;demand and reversible folding is described.








Abstract
Folding of mucosal tissues, such as the tissue within the epithelium of the upper respiratory airways, is critical for organ function. Studying the influence of folded tissue patterns on cellular function is challenging mainly due to the lack of suitable cell culture platforms that can recreate dynamic tissue folding in vitro. Here, a bilayer hydrogel folding system, composed of alginate/polyacrylamide double&#8208;network (DN) and hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels, to generate static folding patterns based on mechanical instabilities, is described. By encapsulating human fibroblasts into patterned HA hydrogels, human bronchial epithelial cells form a folded pseudostratified monolayer. Using magnetic microparticles, DN hydrogels reversibly fold into pre&#8208;defined patterns and enable programmable on&#8208;demand folding of cell&#8208;laden hydrogel systems upon applying a magnetic field. This hydrogel construction provides a dynamic culture system for mimicking tissue folding in vitro, which is extendable to other cell types and organ systems.

         <title>Chloride&#8208;Based Additive Engineering For Efficient and Stable Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Metal halide perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells are promising to achieve power conversion efficiency beyond the theoretical limit of their single&#8208;junction counterparts. However, overcoming the significant open&#8208;circuit voltage deficit present in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells remains a major hurdle for realising efficient and stable perovskite tandem cells. Here, we report a holistic approach to overcoming challenges in 1.8&#160;eV perovskites solar cells by engineering the perovskite crystallisation pathway by means of chloride additives. In conjunction with employing a self&#8208;assembled monolayer as the hole transport layer, we achieved an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.25&#160;V and a power conversion efficiency of 17.0%. We elucidate the key role of methylammonium chloride addition in facilitating the growth of a chloride&#8208;rich intermediate phase that directs crystallisation of the desired cubic perovskite phase, and induce more effective halide homogenisation. The as&#8208;formed 1.8&#160;eV perovskite demonstrates suppressed halide segregation and improved optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Wood&#8208;Derived Continuously Oriented Three&#8208;Phase Interfacial Channels for High&#8208;Performance Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Alkaline Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wood&#8208;derived cathode with continuously oriented three&#8208;phase interfacial channels is developed for alkaline hybrid zinc batteries without additional gas diffusion layers to achieve a wide operating voltage range, superior specific capacity with a &#8776;370% improvement over a nickel&#8211;zinc battery alone, and an excellent energy density and cycling stability.








Abstract
Although recently developed hybrid zinc (Zn) batteries integrate the benefits of both alkaline Zn and Zn&#8211;air batteries, the kinetics of the electrocatalytic oxygen reaction and mass transfer of the electrolyte, which are limited by the mismatched and disordered multiphase reaction's interfacial transfer channels, considerably inhibit the performance of hybrid Zn batteries. In this work, novel, continuously oriented three&#8208;phase interfacial channels at the cathode derived from the natural structure of pine wood are developed to address these challenges. A pine wood chip is carbonized and asymmetrically loaded with a hydrophilic active material to achieve the creation of a wood&#8208;derived cathode that integrates the active material, current collector, and continuously oriented three&#8208;phase reaction interfacial channels, which allows the reaction dynamics to be accelerated. Consequently, the assembled quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state hybrid battery performs an extra charge&#8211;discharge process beyond that performed by a typical nickel (Ni)&#8211;Zn&#160;battery, resulting in a wide operating voltage range of 0.6&#8211;2.0&#160;V and a superior specific capacity of 656.5 mAh g&#8211;1, in addition to an excellent energy density (644.7&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1) and good durability. The &#8776;370% capacity improvement relative to the Ni&#8211;Zn battery&#160;alone makes the hybrid battery one of the best&#8208;performing alkaline Zn batteries.

         <title>Metasurface&#8208;enhanced Mid&#8208;infrared Spectrochemical Imaging of Tissues</title>

Abstract
Label&#8208;free and nondestructive mid&#8208;infrared vibrational hyperspectral imaging is emerging as an important ex&#8208;vivo tissue analysis tool, providing spatially resolved biochemical information critical to understanding physiological and pathological processes. However, the chemically complex and spatially heterogeneous composition of tissue specimens and the inherently weak interaction of infrared light with biomolecules limit the analytical performance of infrared absorption spectroscopy. Here, we introduce an advanced mid&#8208;infrared spectrochemical tissue imaging modality using metasurfaces that support strong surface&#8208;localized electromagnetic fields to capture quantitative molecular maps of large&#8208;area murine brain&#8208;tissue sections. Our approach leverages polarization&#8208;multiplexed multi&#8208;resonance plasmonic metasurfaces to simultaneously detect many different functional biomolecules. The resulting surface&#8208;enhanced mid&#8208;infrared spectral imaging (SE&#8208;MIRSI) method eliminates the non&#8208;specific effects of bulk tissue morphology on the quantitative analysis of fingerprint spectra and improves the chemical selectivity. We show that the metasurface enhancement increases the retrieval of amide I and II absorption bands associated with secondary structures of proteins. Moreover, we demonstrate that plasmonic metasurfaces enhance the chemical contrast in infrared images and enable the detection of ultrathin tissue regions that are not otherwise visible to conventional mid&#8208;infrared spectral imaging. While we tested our approach on murine brain tissue sections, this chemical imaging method is well&#8208;suited for any tissue type, which significantly broadens the potential impacts of our method for both translational research and clinical histopathology.

&lt;p&gt;Label-free and nondestructive mid-infrared vibrational hyperspectral imaging is emerging as an important ex-vivo tissue analysis tool, providing spatially resolved biochemical information critical to understanding physiological and pathological processes. However, the chemically complex and spatially heterogeneous composition of tissue specimens and the inherently weak interaction of infrared light with biomolecules limit the analytical performance of infrared absorption spectroscopy. Here, we introduce an advanced mid-infrared spectrochemical tissue imaging modality using metasurfaces that support strong surface-localized electromagnetic fields to capture quantitative molecular maps of large-area murine brain-tissue sections. Our approach leverages polarization-multiplexed multi-resonance plasmonic metasurfaces to simultaneously detect many different functional biomolecules. The resulting surface-enhanced mid-infrared spectral imaging (SE-MIRSI) method eliminates the non-specific effects of bulk tissue morphology on the quantitative analysis of fingerprint spectra and improves the chemical selectivity. We show that the metasurface enhancement increases the retrieval of amide I and II absorption bands associated with secondary structures of proteins.

         <title>Plant&#8208;Like Tropisms in Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by plant tropism, artificial muscles are developed that allow adaptive actuation in response to environmental humidity and temperature variations. The use of plant&#8208;like microstructural memories enables the yarn muscles to imitate the hydrotropism and thermotropism of plant tendrils. The developed muscle has the potential to perform on&#8208;demand autonomous work in applications including disaster response, autonomous surveying, and sensitive prosthetics.








Abstract
Helical plants have the ability of tropisms to respond to natural stimuli, and biomimicry of such helical shapes into artificial muscles has been vastly popular. However, the shape&#8208;mimicked actuators only respond to artificially provided stimulus, they are not adaptive to variable natural conditions, thus being unsuitable for real&#8208;life applications where on&#8208;demand, autonomous operations are required. Novel artificial muscles made of hierarchically patterned helically wound yarns that are self&#8208;adaptive to environmental humidity and temperature changes are demonstrated here. Unlike shape&#8208;mimicked artificial muscles, a unique microstructural biomimicking approach is adopted, where the muscle yarns can effectively replicate the hydrotropism and thermotropism of helical plants to their microfibril level using plant&#8208;like microstructural memories. Large strokes, with rapid movement, are obtained when the individual microfilament of yarn is inlaid with hydrogel and further twisted into a coil&#8208;shaped hierarchical structure. The developed artificial muscle provides an average actuation speed of &#8776;5.2% s&#8722;1 at expansion and &#8776;3.1% s&#8722;1 at contraction cycles, being the fastest amongst previously demonstrated actuators of similar type. It is demonstrated that these muscle yarns can autonomously close a window in wet climates. The building block yarns are washable without any material degradation, making them suitable for smart, reusable textile and soft robotic devices.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Giant Rashba Spin&#8211;Orbit Coupling at Superconducting KTaO3(110) Heterointerfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A giant Rashba spin&#8211;orbit coupling and light&#8208;induced enhancement are observed in the 5d 2D electron system created at amorphous&#8211;Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/KTaO3(110) superconducting interfaces, which are both potentially promising for topological superconductivity and technologically competitive properties for the development of oxide spintronics.








Abstract
The 2D electron system (2DES) at the KTaO3 surface or heterointerface with 5d orbitals hosts extraordinary physical properties, including a stronger Rashba spin&#8211;orbit coupling (RSOC), higher superconducting transition temperature, and potential of topological superconductivity. Herein, a huge enhancement of RSOC under light illumination achieved at a superconducting amorphous&#8211;Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/KTaO3(110) heterointerfaces is reported. The superconducting transition is observed with Tc = 0.62 K and the temperature&#8208;dependent upper critical field reveals the interaction between spin&#8211;orbit scattering and superconductivity. A strong RSOC with Bso = 1.9 T is revealed by weak antilocalization in the normal state, which undergoes sevenfold enhancement under light illumination. Furthermore, RSOC strength develops a dome&#8208;shaped dependence of carrier density with the maximum of Bso = 12.6 T achieved near the Lifshitz transition point nc &#8776; 4.1&#160;&#215; 1013 cm&#8722;2. The highly tunable giant RSOC at KTaO3(110)&#8208;based superconducting interfaces show great potential for spintronics.

Entropy&#8208;mediated high&#8208;entropy MXenes have good photothermal conversion efficiency and strong intrinsic oxidase mimic activity, and can effectively kill methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus and quickly remove the biofilm via second&#8208; near&#8208;infrared&#8208;enhanced oxidase mimic activity nanotherapeutics. They are used in the treatment of bacterial keratitis and subcutaneous abscess by generating abundant active oxygen species and local hyperpyrexia strategy.








Abstract
Bacterial infections, such as bacterial keratitis (BK) and subcutaneous abscess, pose significant challenges to global healthcare. Innovative and new antibacterial agents and antibacterial strategies are in demand to control infections in this era of high drug resistance. Nanotechnology is gradually emerging as an economically feasible and effective anti&#8208;infection treatment. High&#8208;entropy MXenes (HE MXenes) are used to confer desirable properties with exposed active sites to high&#8208;entropy atomic layers, whose potential application in the field of biomedicine remains to be explored. Herein, monolayer HE MXenes are fabricated by implementing transition metals with high entropy and low Gibbs free energy to fill the gap in the biocatalytic performance of non&#8208;high&#8208;entropy MXenes. HE MXenes are endowed with extremely strong oxidase mimic activity (Km = 0.227&#160;mm) and photothermal conversion efficiency (65.8%) in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) biowindow as entropy increases. Subsequently, HE MXenes realize NIR&#8208;II&#8208;enhanced intrinsic oxidase mimic activity for killing methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus and rapidly removing the biofilm. Furthermore, HE MXenes can effectively treat BK and subcutaneous abscess infection induced by methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus as nanotherapeutic agents with minuscule side effects. Overall, monolayer HE MXenes demonstrate promising clinical application potential in the treatment of drug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections and promote the healing of infected tissues.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Reprogramming&#8208;Inspired Dynamically Responsive Hydrogel Boosts the Induction of Pluripotency via Phase&#8208;Separated Biomolecular Condensates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic&#8208;biology&#8208;based strategy is employed to fabricate cell&#8208;reprogramming&#8208;inspired dynamically responsive hydrogel, and it faithfully senses metabolic remodeling and extracellular acidification during cell reprogramming, responding by changing its mechanical properties accordingly. The cell&#8208;reprogramming&#8208;inspired dynamically responsive hydrogel boosts the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from mouse and human somatic cells via phase&#8208;separated yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP) biomolecular condensates.








Abstract
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have wide applications in disease modeling, personalized medicine, and tissue engineering. The generation of iPSCs from somatic cells via transcriptional&#8208;factor&#8208; or chemical molecule&#8208;based approaches are time&#8208;consuming and inefficient. Here, a cell&#8208;reprogramming&#8208;inspired dynamically responsive hydrogel is fabricated via a synthetic&#8208;biology&#8208;based strategy. Human and mouse somatic cells (including senescent cells) are efficiently reprogrammed into iPSCs that exhibit key features of embryonic stem cells. The cell&#8208;reprogramming&#8208;responsive hydrogel possesses dynamic bioresponsiveness, and it faithfully senses metabolic remodeling and extracellular acidification during cell reprogramming, responding by changing its mechanical properties accordingly. Mechanistic study demonstrates that the autonomous change of the mechanical properties of the cell&#8208;reprogramming&#8208;responsive hydrogel elicits the formation of Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP) biomolecular condensates with the appropriate timing during cell reprogramming, ensuring a faster and more efficient generation of iPSCs than conventional cell reprogramming approach.

&lt;p&gt;A synthetic-biology-based strategy is employed to fabricate cell-reprogramming-inspired dynamically responsive hydrogel, and it faithfully senses metabolic remodeling and extracellular acidification during cell reprogramming, responding by changing its mechanical properties accordingly. The cell-reprogramming-inspired dynamically responsive hydrogel boosts the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from mouse and human somatic cells via phase-separated yes-associated protein (YAP) biomolecular condensates.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have wide applications in disease modeling, personalized medicine, and tissue engineering. The generation of iPSCs from somatic cells via transcriptional-factor- or chemical molecule-based approaches are time-consuming and inefficient. Here, a cell-reprogramming-inspired dynamically responsive hydrogel is fabricated via a synthetic-biology-based strategy. Human and mouse somatic cells (including senescent cells) are efficiently reprogrammed into iPSCs that exhibit key features of embryonic stem cells. The cell-reprogramming-responsive hydrogel possesses dynamic bioresponsiveness, and it faithfully senses metabolic remodeling and extracellular acidification during cell reprogramming, responding by changing its mechanical properties accordingly. Mechanistic study demonstrates that the autonomous change of the mechanical properties of the cell-reprogramming-responsive hydrogel elicits the formation of Yes-associated protein (YAP) biomolecular condensates with the appropriate timing during cell reprogramming, ensuring a faster and more efficient generation of iPSCs than conventional cell reprogramming approach. Taken together, this study reveals the robust induction of pluripotency by coordination of cell-reprogramming-inspired dynamically responsive hydrogel and phase-separated biomolecular condensates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gradient Electrolyte Strategy Achieving Long&#8208;Life Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel gradient electrolyte strategy wherein a concentration gradient of zinc ions is constructed from the anode to the separator enables dense and dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition. The gradient electrolyte plays dual roles in keeping dense deposition on the zinc surface by the high&#8208;concentration electrolyte containing carboxymethylcellulose and avoiding the water&#8208;poor state of the GF separator by the low&#8208;concentration electrolyte.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries are plagued by a short lifespan caused by localized dendrites. High&#8208;concentration electrolytes are favorable for dense Zn deposition but have poor performance in batteries with glass&#8208;fiber separators. In contrast, low&#8208;concentration electrolytes can wet the separators well, ensuring the migration of zinc ions, but the dendrites grow rapidly. In this work, we propose an electrolyte gradient strategy wherein a zinc&#8208;ion concentration gradient is established from the anode to the separator, ensuring that the separator keeps a good wettability in low&#8208;concentration areas and the zinc anode achieves dendrite&#8208;free deposition in a high&#8208;concentration area. By using this strategy in a common electrolyte, zinc sulfate, a Zn||Zn symmetric cell achieves 14&#160;000 ultralong cycles (exceeding 8 months) at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2. When the current is further increased to 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the symmetric cell could still run for over 10&#160;000 cycles. Assembled Zn||NVO full cells also demonstrate prominent performance. At a high current of 16&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the NVO cathode with high loading (8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) still has a capacity of 58% after 1200 cycles. Overall, the gradient electrolyte strategy provides a promising approach for practical long&#8208;life Zn anodes with the advantages of simple operation and low cost.

         <title>Longitudinal Through&#8208;Hole Architecture for Efficient and Thickness&#8208;Insensitive Semitransparent Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Semi&#8208;transparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs) have great potential for application in vehicle&#8208; or building&#8208;integrated solar energy harvesting. However, ST&#8208;OSCs have a trade&#8208;off between their efficiency (PCE) and average visible transmittance (AVT). Ultrathin active layers and electrodes are typically utilized to guarantee high PCE and high AVT simultaneously; however, such ultrathin parts are unsuitable for industrial high&#8208;throughput manufacturing. In this study, we fabricated ST&#8208;OSCs using a longitudinal through&#8208;hole architecture to achieve functional region division and to eliminate the dependence on ultrathin films. A complete circuit that vertically corresponds to the silver grid is responsible for obtaining high PCE, and the longitudinal through&#8208;holes embedded in it allow most of the light to pass through, thus maximizing the AVT, where the overall transparency is associated with the through&#8208;hole specification rather than the thicknesses of the active layer and electrode. Excellent photovoltaic performance over a wide range of transparency (9.80&#8208;60.03%), with PCEs ranging from 6.04% to 15.34% is achieved for large&#8208;area ST&#8208;OSCs. More critically, this architecture allows printable 300&#8208;nm&#8208;thick devices to achieve a light utilization efficiency (LUE) of 3.25%, which is the highest recorded value thus far, and enables flexible ST&#8208;OSCs to exhibit better flexural endurance by dispersing the extrusion stress into the through&#8208;holes. This study should pave the way for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;OSCs and shows great promise for the commercialization of organic photovoltaics.

Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis enables direct solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion aimed at mitigating environmental pollution and producing solar fuels and chemicals in a green and sustainable approach, and efficient, robust and low&#8208;cost photocatalysts are the heart of artificial photosynthesis systems. As an emerging new class of cocatalytic materials, single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have received a great deal of current attention due to their maximal atom utilization and unique photocatalytic properties, whereas noble metal&#8208;free ones impart abundance, availability and cost&#8208;effectiveness allowing for scalable implementation. This review outlines the fundamental principles and synthetic methods of SACs and DACs, and summarizes the most recent advances in non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based SACs (Co, Fe, Cu, Ni, Bi, Al, Sn, Er, La, Ba, etc.) and DACs (CuNi, FeCo, InCu, KNa, CoCo, CuCu, etc.) confined on an arsenal of organic or inorganic substrates (polymeric carbon nitride, metal oxides, metal sulfides, metal&#8208;organic frameworks, carbon, etc.) acting as versatile scaffolds in solar&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic reactions, including hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, methane conversion, organic synthesis, nitrogen fixation, hydrogen peroxide production, and environmental remediation. This review concludes with the challenges, opportunities and future prospects of noble metal&#8208;free SACs and DACs for artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>X&#8208;ray Induced Release of Nitric Oxide from Hafnium&#8208;Based Nanoradiosensitizers for Enhanced Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) is an extensively used strategy for cancer treatment, but its therapeutic effect is usually limited by the abnormal tumor microenvironment (TME) and it lacks the ability to control tumor metastases. Herein, a nanoscale coordination polymer Hf&#8208;nIm@PEG (HNP) wa s prepared by the coordination of hafnium ions (Hf4+) with 2&#8208;nitroimidazole (2&#8208;nIm), and then modified with lipid bilayers containing PEG. Under low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation, on the one hand, Hf4+ with high computed tomography signal enhancement ability can deposit radiation energy to induce DNA damage, and on the other hand, NO could be persistently released from 2&#8208;nIm, which could not only directly react with the radical DNA to prevent the repair of damaged DNA but also relieve the hypoxic immunosuppressive TME to sensitize radiotherapy. Additionally, NO can also react with superoxide ions to generate reactive nitrogen species (RNS) to induce cell apoptosis. More interestingly, w e discovered that Hf4+ could effectively activate the cyclic&#8208;di&#8208;GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway to promote the immune responses induced by radiotherapy. Thus, ou r work presents a simple but multifunctional nanoscale coordination polymer to deposit radiation energy, trigger the release of NO, modulate the TME, activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway and finally realize synergistic radio&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Ionogel&#8208;Electrode for the Study of Protein Tunnel Junctions under Physiologically Relevant Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrode material made of ionogel is used to conduct measurement of charge transport through protein molecules adsorbed on a surface of a self&#8208;assembled monolayer. It is shown that tunneling through a protein junction can operate via temperature&#8208;independent tunneling at solid states, and switch into the temperature&#8208;dependent hopping with hydrated proteins under physiologically relevant conditions.








Abstract
The study of charge transport through proteins is essential for understanding complicated electrochemical processes in biological activities while the reasons for the coexistence of tunneling and hopping phenomena in protein junctions still remain unclear. In this work, a flexible and conductive ionogel electrode is synthesized and is used as a top contact to form highly reproducible protein junctions. The junctions of proteins, including human serum albumin, cytochrome C and hemoglobin, show temperature&#8208;independent electron tunneling characteristics when the junctions are in solid states while with a different mechanism of temperature&#8208;dependent electron hopping when junctions are hydrated under physiologically relevant conditions. It is demonstrated that the solvent reorganization energy plays an important role in the electron&#8208;hopping process and experimentally shown that it requires &#8776;100 meV for electron hopping through one heme group inside a hydrated protein molecule connected between two electrodes.

&lt;p&gt;A novel electrode material made of ionogel is used to conduct measurement of charge transport through protein molecules adsorbed on a surface of a self-assembled monolayer. It is shown that tunneling through a protein junction can operate via temperature-independent tunneling at solid states, and switch into the temperature-dependent hopping with hydrated proteins under physiologically relevant conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of charge transport through proteins is essential for understanding complicated electrochemical processes in biological activities while the reasons for the coexistence of tunneling and hopping phenomena in protein junctions still remain unclear. In this work, a flexible and conductive ionogel electrode is synthesized and is used as a top contact to form highly reproducible protein junctions. The junctions of proteins, including human serum albumin, cytochrome C and hemoglobin, show temperature-independent electron tunneling characteristics when the junctions are in solid states while with a different mechanism of temperature-dependent electron hopping when junctions are hydrated under physiologically relevant conditions. It is demonstrated that the solvent reorganization energy plays an important role in the electron-hopping process and experimentally shown that it requires &#8776;100 meV for electron hopping through one heme group inside a hydrated protein molecule connected between two electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Electronics on Flexible Substrates Using Inorganic Nanowires Grown on High&#8208;Aspect&#8208;Ratio Printed Gold Micropillars</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electronics on flexible substrates are demonstrated by adopting a hybrid approach involving additive manufacturing for achieving high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio printed gold micropillars and a hydrothermal growth method for obtaining zinc oxide nanowires&#160;on gold micropillar electrode arrays. This leads to hierarchical light&#8208;sensitive nanowire&#8208;connected networks, exhibiting favorable ultraviolet sensing and excellent omnidirectional light&#8208;absorption ability.








Abstract
Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane or&#160;3D&#160;electronics on flexible substrates are an interesting direction that can enable novel solutions such as efficient bioelectricity generation and artificial retina. However, the development of devices with such architectures is limited by the lack of suitable fabrication techniques. Additive manufacturing (AM) can but often fail to provide high&#8208;resolution, sub&#8208;micrometer 3D architectures. Herein, the optimization of a drop&#8208;on&#8208;demand (DoD), high&#8208;resolution electrohydrodynamic (EHD)&#8208;based jet printing method for generating 3D gold (Au) micropillars is reported. Libraries of Au micropillar electrode arrays (MEAs) reaching a maximum height of 196&#160;&#181;m and a maximum aspect ratio of 52 are printed. Further, by combining AM with the hydrothermal growth method, a seedless synthesis of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires (NWs) on the printed Au MEAs is demonstrated. The developed hybrid approach leads to hierarchical light&#8208;sensitive NW&#8208;connected networks exhibiting favorable ultraviolet (UV) sensing as demonstrated via fabricating flexible photodetectors (PDs). The 3D PDs exhibit an excellent omnidirectional light&#8208;absorption ability and thus, maintain high photocurrents over wide light incidence angles (&#177;90&#176;). Lastly, the PDs are tested under both concave and convex bending at 40&#160;mm, showing excellent mechanical flexibility.

         <title>Macrocyclic Engineering of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Emitters for High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

Abstract
Several thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials have been studied and developed to realize high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, TADF macrocycles have not been sufficiently investigated owing to the synthetic challenges, resulting in limited exploration of their luminescent properties and the corresponding highly efficient OLEDs. In this study, a series of TADF macrocycles w ere synthesized using a modularly tunable strategy by introducing xanthones as acceptors and phenylamine derivatives as donors. A detailed analysis of their photophysical properties combined with fragment molecules revealed characteristics of high&#8208;performance macrocycles. The results indicated that (a) the ideal structure decreased the energy loss, which in turn reduced the non&#8208;radiative transitions; (b) reasonable building blocks increase the oscillator strength providing a higher radiation transition rate; (c) the horizontal dipole orientation (&#920;) of extended macrocyclic emitters w as increased. Owing to the high photoluminescence quantum yields of approximately 100 and 92% and excellent &#920; of 80 and 79% for macrocycles MC&#8208;X and MC&#8208;XT in 5 wt% doped films, the corresponding devices exhibited record&#8208;high external quantum efficiencies of 31.6 and 26.9%, respectively, in the field of TADF macrocycles.

         <title>Coaxial 3D Printing of Zeolite&#8208;based Core&#8211;shell Monolithic Cu&#8208;SSZ&#8208;13@SiO2 Catalysts for Diesel Exhaust Treatment</title>

Abstract
Core&#8211;shell catalysts with functional shells could increase the activity and stability of the catalysts in selective catalytic reduction with ammonia (NH3&#8208;SCR) for diesel exhaust NOx treatment. However, the conventional approaches based on the multistep fabrication for core&#8211;shell structures encounter persistent restrictions regarding the strict synthesis condition and limited design flexibility. Herein, a facile coaxial 3D printing strategy has been for the first time developed to construct zeolite&#8208;based core&#8211;shell monolithic catalysts with interconnected honeycomb structures, in which the hydrophilic non&#8208;compact silica serves as shell and Cu&#8208;SSZ&#8208;13 zeolite acts as core. Compared to Cu&#8208;SSZ&#8208;13 monolith suffered from the interfacial diffusion, the SiO2 shell layer can increase the accessibility of active sites over Cu&#8208;SSZ&#8208;13@SiO2, resulting in a 10&#8211;20% higher NO conversion at the 200&#8722;550 &#176;C under 300,000 cm3g&#8722;1h&#8722;1. Meanwhile, a thicker SiO2 shell enhances the hydrothermal stability of the aged catalyst by inhibiting the dealumination and the formation of CuOx. Other representative monolithic catalysts with different topological zeolites as shell and diverse metal oxides as core can be also realized by this coaxial 3D printing. This strategy allows multiple porous materials to be directly integrated, which allows for flexible design and fabrication of various core&#8211;shell monolithic catalysts with customized functionalities.

         <title>Impact of Ti and Zn Dual&#8208;Substitution in P2 Type Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 on Ni&#8211;Mn and Na&#8208;Vacancy Ordering and Electrochemical Properties</title>

         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;substitution by Ti and Zn for Mn and Ni, respectively, in P2 type Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 maintains in&#8208;plane Ni&#8211;Mn ordering but disrupts Na+&#8208;vacancy ordering, resulting in long&#8208;cycling&#8208;life non&#8208;aqueous Na cells with smooth charge&#8211;discharge voltage curves and little structural change from the P2&#8208;type layered structure.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy layered oxide materials containing various metals that exhibit smooth voltage curves and excellent electrochemical performances have attracted attention in the development of positive electrode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, a smooth voltage curve can be obtained by suppression of the Na+&#8208;vacancy ordering, and therefore, transition metal slabs do not need to be more multi&#8208;element than necessary. Here, the Na+&#8208;vacancy ordering is found to be disturbed by dual substitution of TiIV for MnIV and ZnII for NiII in P2&#8208;Na2/3[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2. Dual&#8208;substituted Na2/3[Ni1/4Mn1/2Ti1/6Zn1/12]O2 demonstrates almost non&#8208;step voltage curves with a reversible capacity of 114&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and less structural changes with a high crystalline structure maintained during charging and discharging. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray, neutron, and electron diffraction measurements reveal that dual&#8208;substitution with TiIV and ZnII uniquely promotes in&#8208;plane NiII&#8211;MnIV ordering, which is quite different from the disordered mixing in conventional multiple metal substitution.

Abstract
Recently, one of the primary concerns in e&#8208;textile&#8208;based healthcare monitoring systems for chronic illness patients is reducing wasted power consumption as the system should be always&#8208;on to capture diverse biochemical and physiological characteristics. However, the general conductive fibers, a major component of the existing wearable monitoring systems, have a positive gauge&#8208;factor (GF) that increases electrical resistance when stretched, so that the systems have no choice but to consume power continuously. Herein, we develop a twisted conductive fiber&#8208;based negatively responsive switch&#8208;type (NRS) strain&#8208;sensor with an extremely high negative GF (resistance change ratio &#8776; 3.9&#160;&#215; 108) that can significantly increase its conductivity from insulating to conducting properties. To this end, a precision cracking technology is devised, which could induce a difference in the Young's modulus of the encapsulated layer on the fiber through selective ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;irradiation treatment. Owing to this technology, the NRS strain&#8208;sensors could allow for effective regulation of the mutual contact resistance under tensile strain while maintaining superior durability for over 5000 stretching cycles. For further practical demonstrations, three healthcare monitoring systems (E&#8208;fitness pants, smart&#8208;masks, and posture correction T&#8208;shirts) with near&#8208;zero standby power are also developed, which open up advancements in electronic textiles by expanding the utilization range of fiber strain&#8208;sensors.

&lt;p&gt;Recently, one of the primary concerns in e-textile-based healthcare monitoring systems for chronic illness patients is reducing wasted power consumption as the system should be always-on to capture diverse biochemical and physiological characteristics. However, the general conductive fibers, a major component of the existing wearable monitoring systems, have a positive gauge-factor (GF) that increases electrical resistance when stretched, so that the systems have no choice but to consume power continuously. Herein, we develop a twisted conductive fiber-based negatively responsive switch-type (NRS) strain-sensor with an extremely high negative GF (resistance change ratio &#8776; 3.9&#160;&#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;) that can significantly increase its conductivity from insulating to conducting properties. To this end, a precision cracking technology is devised, which could induce a difference in the Young's modulus of the encapsulated layer on the fiber through selective ultraviolet (UV)-irradiation treatment. Owing to this technology, the NRS strain-sensors could allow for effective regulation of the mutual contact resistance under tensile strain while maintaining superior durability for over 5000 stretching cycles.

         <title>Immobilizing Surface Halide in Perovskite Solar Cells via Calix[4]pyrrole</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small molecule of calix[4]pyrrole (C[4]P) with unique anion&#8208;bonding capability is demonstrated to enhance the stability of metal halide perovskites by immobilization of the surface halide. It largely suppresses the halide&#8208;diffusion induced electrode corrosion, enabling formamidinium&#8211;cesium&#8208;based inverted perovskite solar cells (efficiency over 23%) with operational and thermal lifetimes over 2000 h.








Abstract
Halide diffusion across the charge&#8208;transporting layer followed by a reaction with metal electrode represents a critical factor limiting the long&#8208;term stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, a supramolecular strategy with surface anion complexation is reported for enhancing the light and thermal stability of perovskite films, as well as devices. Calix[4]pyrrole (C[4]P) is demonstrated as a unique anion&#8208;binding agent for stabilizing the structure of perovskite by anchoring surface halides, which increases the activation energy for halide migration, thus effectively suppressing the halide&#8211;metal electrode reactions. The C[4]P&#8208;stabilized perovskite films preserve their initial morphology after ageing at 85&#160;&#176;C or under 1 sun illumination in humid air over 50 h, significantly outperforming the control samples. This strategy radically tackles the halide outward&#8208;diffusion issue without sacrificing charge extraction. Inverted&#8208;structured PSCs based on C[4]P modified formamidinium&#8211;cesium perovskite exhibit a champion power conversion efficiency of over 23%. The lifespans of unsealed PSCs are unprecedentedly prolonged from dozens of hours to over 2000 h under operation (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1) and 85&#160;&#176;C ageing (ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2). When subjected to a harsher protocol of ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 with both light and thermal stresses, the C[4]P&#8208;based PSCs maintain 87% of original efficiency after ageing for 500 h.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Self&#8208;Healing Soft Composite Network with Unprecedented Crack Propagation Resistance Enabled by a Supramolecular Assembled Lamellar Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catastrophic failure of soft self&#8208;healing materials often derives from its low&#8208;energy primary network structure susceptible to fatigue crack propagation. In this work, a biomimetic strategy of introducing high&#8208;energy preferentially aligned lamellar structure into highly dynamic and superstretchable poly(urea&#8208;urethane) is proposed, successfully surpassing the notorious trade&#8208;off between soft self&#8208;healing, high fracture toughness, and fatigue resistance.








Abstract
Soft self&#8208;healing materials are compelling candidates for stretchable devices because of their excellent compliance, extensibility, and self&#8208;restorability. However, most existing soft self&#8208;healing polymers suffer from crack propagation and irreversible fatigue failure due to easy breakage of their dynamic amorphous, low&#8208;energy polymer networks. Herein, inspired by distinct structure&#8211;property relationship of biological tissues, a supramolecular interfacial assembly strategy of preparing soft self&#8208;healing composites with unprecedented crack propagation resistance is proposed by structurally engineering preferentially aligned lamellar structures within a dynamic and superstretchable poly(urea&#8208;ureathane) matrix (which is elongated to 24 750&#215; its original length). Such a design affords a world&#8208;record fracture energy (501.6&#160;kJ m&#8722;2), ultrahigh fatigue threshold (4064.1 J m&#8722;2), and outstanding elastic restorability (dimensional recovery from 13 times elongation), and preserving low modulus (1.2&#160;MPa), high stretchability (3200%), and high room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing efficiency (97%). Thereby, the resultant composite represents the best of its kind and even surpasses most biological tissues. The lamellar 2D transition&#8208;metal carbide/carbonitride (MXene) structure also leads to a relatively high in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity, enabling composites as stretchable thermoconductive skins applied in joints of robotics to thermal dissipation. The present work illustrates a viable approach how autonomous self&#8208;healing, crack tolerance, and fatigue resistance can be merged in future material design.

         <title>Photostable Cascade Activatable Peptide Self&#8208;assembly on a Cancer Cell Membrane for High&#8208;Performance Identification of Human Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Missed or residual tumor burden results in high risk for bladder cancer relapse. However, existing fluorescent probes cannot meet the clinical needs because of inevitable photobleaching properties. Performance could be improved by maintaining intensive and sustained fluorescence signals via resistance to intraoperative saline flushing and intrinsic fluorescent decay, providing surgeons with sufficiently clear and high&#8208;contrast surgical fields, avoiding residual tumors or missed diagnosis. This study designs and synthesizes a photostable cascade&#8208;activatable peptide, a target reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (TRAP) system, which can construct polypeptide&#8208;based nanofibers in situ on the cell membrane to achieve long&#8208;term and stable imaging of bladder cancer. The probe has two parts: a target peptide (TP) targets CD44v6 to recognize bladder cancer cells, and a reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (RAP) was introduced and effectively reacted with TP via a click reaction to enhance the hydrophobicity of the whole molecule, assembling into nanofibers and further nanonetworks. Accordingly, probe retention on the cell membrane was prolonged, and photostability was significantly improved. Finally, the TRAP system is successfully employed in the high&#8208;performance identification of human bladder cancer in ex vivo bladder tumor tissues. This cascade&#8208;activatable peptide molecular probe based on the TRAP system enables efficient and stable imaging of bladder cancer.

         <title>Metal&#8208;bonded Atomic Layers of Transition Metal Carbides (MXenes)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Although two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) have fantastic physical and chemical properties as well as wide applications, it remains challenging to produce stable MXenes due to their rapid structural degradation. Here, unique metal&#8208;bonded atomic layers of transition metal carbides with high stabilities are produced via a simple topological reaction between chlorine&#8208;terminated MXenes and selected metals, where the metals enable to not only remove partially Cl terminations, but also bond with adjacent atomic MXene slabs, driven by the symmetry of MAX phases. The films constructed from Al&#8208;bonded Ti3C2Clx atomic layers show high oxidation resistance up to 400&#176;C and low sheet resistance of 9.3 &#937;/&#9633;. Coupled to the multi&#8208;layer structure, the Al&#8208;bonded Ti3C2Clx film displays a significantly improved EMI shielding capability with a total shielding effectiveness value of 39&#160;dB at a low thickness of 3.1&#160;&#956;m, outperforming pure Ti3C2Clx film.

Abstract
Thermochromic fluorescence materials (TFMs) characterized by noticeable emission color variation with temperature have attracted pervasive attention for their frontier application in stimulus&#8208;response and optical encryption technologies. However, existing TFMs typically suffer from weak PL reversibility as well as limited mild operating temperature and severe temperature PL quenching. PL switching under extreme conditions such as high temperature will undoubtedly improve the encryption security while it is still challenging for present TFMs. In this work, high temperature thermochromic fluorescence up to 473 K and robust structural and optical reversibility of 80 cycles are observed in Rb2MnBr4(H2O)2 and related crystals, which is seldom reported for PL change at such a high temperature. Temperature driven nonluminous, red and green light emission states can be achieved at specific temperatures and the modulation mechanism is verified by in&#8208;situ optical and structural measurements and single particle transition. By virtue of this unique feature, a multi&#8208;color anti&#8208;counterfeiting label based on a broad temperature gradient and multi&#8208;dimension information encryption applications are demonstrated. This work opens a window for the design of inorganic materials with multi&#8208;PL change and the development of advanced encryption strategy with extreme stimuli source.

         <title>Giant Nonlinear Optical Response via Coherent Stacking of&#160;In&#8208;Plane Ferroelectric Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric materials are great candidates for nonlinear optics and electro&#8208;optic modulators. A giant second&#8208;harmonic generation effect is reported in physical vapor&#8208;deposited ferroelectric material, SnSe. Nanoscale in&#8208;plane ferroelectric domains are revealed, those with ferroelectric stacking exhibit &#8776;100 times higher nonlinear optical efficiency than monolayer TMDs, due to a parallel stacking structure where nonlinear dipoles in each vdW ferroelectric layer add constructively.








Abstract
Thin ferroelectric materials hold great promise for compact nonvolatile memory and nonlinear optical and optoelectronic devices. Herein, an ultrathin in&#8208;plane ferroelectric material that exhibits a giant nonlinear optical effect, group&#8208;IV monochalcogenide SnSe, is reported. Nanometer&#8208;scale ferroelectric domains with &#8776;90&#176;/270&#176; twin boundaries or &#8776;180&#176; domain walls are revealed in physical&#8208;vapor&#8208;deposited SnSe by lateral piezoresponse force microscopy. Atomic structure characterization reveals both parallel and antiparallel stacking of neighboring van der Waals ferroelectric layers, leading to ferroelectric or antiferroelectric ordering. Ferroelectric domains exhibit giant nonlinear optical activity due to coherent enhancement of second&#8208;harmonic fields and the as&#8208;resulted second&#8208;harmonic generation&#160;was&#160;observed to be 100 times more intense than monolayer WS2. This work demonstrates&#160;in&#8208;plane ferroelectric ordering and giant nonlinear optical activity in SnSe, which paves the way for applications in on&#8208;chip nonlinear optical components and nonvolatile memory devices.

         <title>Reaction&#8208;Induced Formation of Stable Mononuclear Cu(I)Cl Species on Carbon for Low&#8208;Footprint Vinyl Chloride Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;supported copper generates interest as a replacement for noble&#8208;metal&#8208; or mercury&#8208;containing acetylene hydrochlorination catalysts in vinyl chloride production. It is shown that mononuclear Cu(I)Cl species, which form under reaction conditions due to a favorable interaction with oxygen coordination sites, are the main active species, and quantify their potential for improving the sustainability of the process.








Abstract
Copper catalysts are attractive candidates for Hg&#8208;free vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) production via acetylene hydrochlorination due to their non&#8208;toxic nature and high stability. However, the optimal architecture for Cu&#8208;based catalysts at the nanoscale is not yet fully understood. To address this gap, the metal precursor and the annealing temperature are modified to prepare copper nanoparticles or single atoms, either in chlorinated or ligand&#8208;free form, on an unmodified carbon support. Evaluation in the reaction reveals a remarkable convergence of the performance of all materials to the stable VCM productivity of the single&#8208;atom catalyst. In&#8208;depth characterization by advanced microscopy, quasi in situ and operando spectroscopy, and simulations uncover a reaction&#8208;induced formation of low&#8208;valent, single atom Cu(I)Cl site motif, regardless of the initial nanostructure. Various surface oxygen groups promote nanoparticle redispersion by stabilizing single&#8208;atom CuClx species. The anchoring site structure does not strongly influence the acetylene adsorption energy or the crucial role they play in stabilizing key reaction intermediates. A life&#8208;cycle assessment demonstrates the potential environmental benefits of copper catalysts over state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art alternatives. This work contributes to a better understanding of optimal metal speciation and highlights the sustainability of Cu&#8208;based catalysts for VCM production.

         <title>Extraordinary Ionic Conductivity Excited by Hierarchical Ion&#8208;Transport Pathways in MOF&#8208;Based Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interstices and cracks can play an important role in ion transport of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes (QSEs). An extraordinarily high ionic conductivity (1.02 mS cm&#8722;1) is observed for MOFs QSEs with an optimal hierarchical pore structure. This work redefines the understanding of ion transport in MOF&#8208;based QSEs and breaks the bottleneck of MOF&#8208;based QSEs.








Abstract
Liquid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;laden metal&#8211;organic frameworks (LE&#8208;laden MOFs) are promising quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes (QSEs) for metal&#8208;anode batteries. To achieve a high ionic conductivity, considerable efforts have been devoted to designing continuous and compact LE&#8208;laden MOF layers. Surprisingly, in this work, an extraordinarily high ionic conductivity (1.02 mS cm&#8722;1) is observed in an LE&#8208;laden MOF electrolyte with abundant interstices and cracks. Herein, various macroscopic and mesoscopic pore structures of Li&#8208;LE&#8208;laden HKUST&#8208;1 QSEs are prepared via morphology control and different cold&#8208;pressing procedures. Thereinto, Li&#8208;LE&#8208;laden cuboctahedron HKUST&#8208;1 prepared under 150&#160;MPa cold&#8208;pressing with an optimal hierarchical pore structure (Li&#8208;Cuboct&#8208;H) exhibits the highest ambient ionic conductivity (1.02 mS cm&#8722;1). It is found that interstices and cracks in electrolytes construct a set of interconnected Li&#8208;LE networks with innate MOF channels and facilitate Li+ transfer in the hybrid ion&#8208;transport pathways. The Li/LiFePO4 cells based on Li&#8208;Cuboct&#8208;H deliver a splendid capacity retention of 93% over 210 cycles at 1 C. Meanwhile, the high ionic conductivities (higher than 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1) can be achieved in different ion conductor systems (Na, Mg, and Al) under the same guideline. This work redefines the understanding of ion transport in MOF&#8208;based QSEs and breaks the bottleneck of MOF&#8208;based QSEs.

         <title>Multichannel Single&#8208;Photon Emissions with On&#8208;Demand Momentums by Using Anisotropic Quantum Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anisotropic metasurface with phase&#8208;independent and phase&#8208;dependent schemes is proposed to freely manipulate single&#8208;photon spin angular momentums (SAMs) and linear momentums. Multichannel single&#8208;photon emissions with independently controlled SAMs are demonstrated to propagate in different directions. The introduction of anisotropic nanoscatterers and anisotropic arrangements of nanoscatterers to construct metasurfaces provides more flexibility to fully shape light fields.








Abstract
Photon momentums and their control are important for carrying quantum information and increasing information capacities. It is a great challenge to freely control multiple momentums of single photons based on only phase&#8208;dependent schemes in isotropic metasurfaces because exact manipulations of interference phases and precise alignments between quantum emitters and metasurfaces are involved. Here, an anisotropic metasurface, in which anisotropic rather than isotropic nanoscatterers are arranged anisotropically, is proposed to freely control multiple momentums of single photons. In the metasurfaces, the phase&#8208;independent and phase&#8208;dependent schemes are used to independently control spin angular momentums (SAMs) and linear momentums (LMs), respectively. The phase&#8208;independent scheme allows robust alignment between quantum emitters and metasurfaces. The anisotropic design amends geometrical phases for oblique emissions, providing larger ranges (up to 53&#176;) for tailoring LMs. In experiments, three&#8208;channel single&#8208;photon emissions with independent SAMs and LMs are demonstrated. The introduction of anisotropic nanoscatterers and anisotropic arrangements of nanoscatterers is a more general design method for metasurfaces, and it could provide more flexibility to freely and efficiently tailor single&#8208;photon emissions.

         <title>Rationally Design and Acoustically Assemble Human Cerebral Cortex&#8208;like Microtissues from hiPSC&#8208;derived Neural Progenitors and Neurons</title>

Abstract
Development of human biologically relevant and clinically relevant cerebral cortex models is demanded by mechanistic studies of human cerebral cortex&#8208;associated neurological diseases and discovery of preclinical neurological drug candidates. Here, we demonstrated rational design of human sourced brain&#8208;like cortical tissue models by reverse engineering and bionic design. To implement this design, we employed acoustic assembly technique to assemble hiPSC&#8208;derived neural progenitors and neurons separately in a label&#8208;free and contact&#8208;free manner followed by subsequent neural differentiation and culture. The generated microtissues encapsulated neuronal microanatomy of human cerebral&#8208;cortex tissue that contained six&#8208;layered neuronal architecture, 400&#8208;micrometer interlayer distance, synaptic connections between interlayers, and neuroelectrophysiological transmission. Furthermore, we infected these microtissues with HSV&#8208;1 virus and determined the HSV&#8208;induced pathogenesis associated with Alzheimer's disease, including neuron loss and the expression of A&#946;. Overall, we provided a high&#8208;fidelity human&#8208;relevant in vitro histotypic models for cerebral cortex, and these models will facilitate wide applications in probing the mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases and screening the candidates of neuroprotective agents.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Induced Spin Selectivity: An Enabling Technology for Quantum Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular spins are promising qudits but their weak interaction with external fields makes single&#8208;molecule readout challenging. A solution that exploits chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) in photoinduced electron transfer is envisioned in this work. Progress toward the detection of CISS at the molecular level by magnetic resonance is overviewed and it is shown how CISS could enable initialization, manipulation, and readout of molecular spins at high temperature.








Abstract
Molecular spins are promising building blocks of future quantum technologies thanks to the unparalleled flexibility provided by chemistry, which allows the design of complex structures targeted for specific applications. However, their weak interaction with external stimuli makes it difficult to access their state at the single&#8208;molecule level, a fundamental tool for their use, for example, in quantum computing and sensing. Here, an innovative solution exploiting the interplay between chirality and magnetism using the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect on electron transfer processes is foreseen. It is envisioned to use a spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion mechanism that can be realized by connecting a molecular spin qubit to a dyad where an electron donor and an electron acceptor are linked by a chiral bridge. By numerical simulations based on realistic parameters, it is shown that the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect could enable initialization, manipulation, and single&#8208;spin readout of molecular qubits and qudits even at relatively high temperatures.

         <title>Induction of Bleb Structures in Lipid Nanoparticle Formulations of mRNA Leads to Improved Transfection Potency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The transfection potency of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) mRNA systems is critically dependent on the ionizable cationic lipid component. LNP mRNA systems composed of optimized ionizable lipids often display distinctive mRNA rich &#8220;bleb&#8221; structures. Here we show that such structures can also be induced for LNP containing nominally less active ionizable lipids by formulating in the presence of high concentrations of pH 4 buffers such as sodium citrate, leading to improved transfection potencies both in vitro and in vivo. Induction of bleb structure and improved potency is dependent on the type of pH 4 buffer employed, with LNP mRNA systems prepared using 300&#160;mM sodium citrate buffer displaying maximum transfection. The improved transfection potencies of LNP mRNA systems displaying bleb structure can be attributed, at least in part, to enhanced integrity of the encapsulated mRNA. It is concluded that enhanced transfection can be achieved by optimizing formulation parameters to improve mRNA stability and that optimization of ionizable lipids to achieve enhanced potency may well lead to improvements in mRNA integrity through formation of bleb structure rather than enhanced intracellular delivery.

         <title>Revisiting the Role of Discharge Products in Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>

Abstract
Rechargeable lithium&#8208;carbon dioxide (Li&#8208;CO2) batteries are promising devices for CO2 recycling and energy storage. However, thermodynamically stable and electrically insulating discharge products (DPs) (e.g., Li2CO3) deposited at cathodes require rigorous conditions for completed decomposition, resulting in large recharge polarization and poor battery reversibility. Although progresses have been achieved in cathode design and electrolyte optimization, the significance of DPs is generally underestimated. Therefore, it is necessary to revisit the role of DPs in Li&#8208;CO2 batteries to boost overall battery performance. Here, we report for the first time, a critical and systematic review of DPs in Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. We appraise fundamentals of reactions for formation and decomposition of DPs and demonstrate impacts on battery performance including, overpotential, capacity and stability, and highlight the necessity of discharge product management. We assess practical in&#8208;situ/operando technologies to characterize reaction intermediates and the corresponding DPs for mechanism investigation. Additionally, achievable control measures to boost the decomposition of DPs are evidenced to provide battery design principles and improve the battery performance. Findings from this work will deepen the understanding of electrochemistry of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries and promote practical applications.

         <title>Fluorinated Poly(aryl piperidinium) Membranes for Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Side&#8208;chain fluorination leads to poly(aryl piperidinium) membranes with both high conductivity and high dimensional stability. These membranes are stable over 500&#160;h in anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) with a PGM&#8208;free (Co&#8211;Mn spinel) cathode.








Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are a cost&#8208;effective alternative to proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). The development of high&#8208;performance and durable AEMFCs requires highly conductive and robust anion&#8208;exchange membranes (AEMs). However, AEMs generally exhibit a trade&#8208;off between conductivity and dimensional stability. Here, a fluorination strategy to create a phase&#8208;separated morphological structure in poly(aryl piperidinium) AEMs is reported. The highly hydrophobic perfluoroalkyl side chains augment phase separation to construct interconnected hydrophilic channels for anion transport. As a result, these fluorinated PAP (FPAP) AEMs simultaneously possess high conductivity (&gt;150&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#160;&#176;C) and high dimensional stability (swelling ratio &lt;20% at 80&#160;&#176;C), excellent mechanical properties (tensile strength &gt;80&#160;MPa and elongation at break &gt;40%) and chemical stability (&gt;2000&#160;h in 3&#160;m KOH at 80&#160;&#176;C). AEMFCs with a non&#8208;precious Co&#8211;Mn spinel cathode using the present FPAP AEMs achieve an outstanding peak power density of 1.31&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2. The AEMs remain stable over 500&#160;h of fuel cell operation at a constant current density of 0.2&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2.

Abstract
The sluggish kinetics and issues associated with the parasitic reactions of cathodes are major obstacles to the large&#8208;scale application of Li&#8208;O2 batteries, despite their large theoretical energy density. Therefore, efficient electrocatalyst design is critical for optimizing their performance. Ni5P4 was analyzed theoretically as a cathode material, and the downshift of the d&#8208;band center was found to enhance electron occupation in antibonding orbits, providing a valuable descriptor for understanding and enhancing the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. In this study, we demonstrated that incorporating additional nitrogen atoms into Ni5P4 nanoroses regulated the electronic structure, resulting in superior electrocatalytic performance in Li&#8208;O2 batteries. Further spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory calculations revealed that the incorporated nitrogen sites could effectively induce localized structure polarization, lowering the energy barrier for the production of desirable intermediates and thus enhancing battery capacity and preventing cell degradation. This approach provides a sound basis for developing advanced electrode materials with optimized electronic structures for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;O2 batteries.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Additive Strategy Enables Efficient Pure&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

Abstract
Lead halide perovskites have shown exceptional performance in light&#8208;emitting devices (PeLED), particularly in producing significant electroluminescence in sky&#8208;blue to near&#8208;infrared wavelengths. However, PeLEDs emitting pure&#8208;blue light at 465 to 475 nm are still not satisfactory. Herein, we report efficient and stable pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs by phase distribution controlling, defect passivation as well as surface modifications using multi&#8208;functional phenylethylammonium trifluoroacetate (PEATFA) in reduced&#8208;dimensional CsPb(Br0.55Cl0.45)3 perovskites polycrystalline films. Compared with 4&#8208;fluorophenylethylammonium (p&#8208;F&#8208;PEA+) in the pristine films, phenylethylammonium (PEA+) has lower adsorption energy while interacting with perovskites, resulting in large&#8208;n low&#8208;dimensional perovskites, which can greatly facilitate charge transport within the low&#8208;dimensional perovskite films. The interaction between the C = O group in TFA&#8722; and perovskites significantly reduces defects in the perovskite films. Additionally, the electron&#8208;giving &#8208;CF3 group in TFA&#8208; uplifts surface potential in the films, resulting in smooth electronic injection in devices. The multifunctional additive strategy leads to elevated radiative recombination and efficient carrier transport in the films and devices. As a result, the devices exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 11.87% at 468 nm with stable spectral output, the highest reported to date for pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs. Thus, this study extends the way for high&#8208;efficiency pure&#8208;blue LED with perovskite polycrystal films.

         <title>Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework/ReS2 Heterojunction Phototransistor for Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Visual Adaptation Emulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polarization&#8208;sensitive device is demonstrated based on a porous metal&#8211;organic framework/ReS2 heterojunction phototransistor. The most intriguing properties of polarization&#8208;sensitive visual adaptation can be achieved by tuning the bottom&#8208;gate bias and different light environments. It can provide a fascinating opportunity for next generation of artificial visual perception systems.








Abstract
Visual adaptation allows organisms to accurately perceive the external world even in dramatically changing environments, from dim starlight to bright sunlight. In particular, polarization&#8208;sensitive visual adaptation can effectively process the polarized visual information that is ubiquitous in nature. However, such an intriguing characteristic still remains a great challenge in semiconductor devices. Herein, a novel porous metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework phototransistor with anisotropic&#8208;ReS2&#8208;based heterojunction is demonstrated for polarization&#8208;sensitive visual adaptation emulation. The device exhibits intriguing polarized sensitivity and an adaptive ability due to its strong anisotropic and trapping&#8211;detrapping characteristics, respectively. A series of polarization&#8208;sensitive neuromorphic behaviors like polarization&#8208;perceptual excitatory postsynaptic current, multimode adjustable dichroic ratio and reconfigurable sensory adaption, are experimentally demonstrated through this porous heterojunction phototransistor. More importantly, with the polarization&#8211;electricity cooperation strategy, advanced polarization&#8208;sensitive visual adaptation with strong bottom&#8208;gate control and environment dependence is successfully realized. These results represent a significant step toward the new generation of intelligent visual perception systems in autonomous navigation and human&#8211;machine interaction, etc.

         <title>Tailored Electronic Structure of Ir in High Entropy Alloy for Highly Active and Durable Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Water Splitting under an Acidic Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compositional engineering using the high entropy alloy (HEA) platform enables the design of an efficient and durable electrocatalyst. Mn incorporation in ZnNiCoIrMn induces redistribution of electron density around Ir, tailoring the cohesive energy of metal (Ecoh) and adsorption energy of oxygen species (&#8710;EO). The enhanced Ecoh and weakened &#8710;EO of Ir in ZnNiCoIrMn are responsible for the enhanced activity and durability of OER and HER under acidic conditions.








Abstract
Proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) requires an efficient and durable bifunctional electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, Ir&#8208;based electrocatalyst is designed using the high entropy alloy (HEA) platform of ZnNiCoIrX with two elements (X: Fe and Mn). A facile dealloying in the vacuum system enables the construction of a nanoporous structure with high crystallinity using Zn as a sacrificial element. Especially, Mn incorporation into HEAs tailors the electronic structure of the Ir site, resulting in the d&#8208;band center being far away from the Fermi level. Downshifting of the d&#8208;band center weakens the adsorption energy with reaction intermediates, which is beneficial for catalytic reactions. Despite low Ir content, ZnNiCoIrMn delivers only 50&#160;mV overpotential for HER at &#8722;50&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 237&#160;mV overpotential for the OER at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, ZnNiCoIrMn shows almost constant voltage for the HER and OER for 100&#160;h and a high stability number of 3.4&#160;&#215;&#160;105 nhydrogen nIr&#8722;1 and 2.4&#160;&#215;&#160;105 noxygen nIr&#8722;1, demonstrating the exceptional durability of the HEA platform. The compositional engineering of ZnNiCoIrMn limits the diffusion of elements by high entropy effects and simultaneously tailors the electronic structure of active Ir sites, resulting in the modified cohesive and adsorption energies, all of which can suppress the dissolution of elements.

         <title>Tunable Interfacial Charge Transfer in a 2D&#8211;2D Composite for Efficient Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The severe charge&#8208;transfer resistance and slow charge kinetics of pure Bi2MoO6 (BMO) limit the utilization of photogenerated carriers for CO2 conversion. In this work, an Ohmic contact with tunable interfacial resistance is constructed between bismuthene and BMO with oxygen vacancies, which can reduce the CO2 activation energy barrier, establish an efficient catalytic reaction system, and demonstrate unprecedented activity, and stability.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 conversion for hydrocarbon fuel production has been known as one of the most promising strategies for achieving carbon neutrality. Yet, its conversion efficiency remains unsatisfactory mainly due to its severe charge&#8208;transfer resistance and slow charge kinetics. Herein, a tunable interfacial charge transfer on an oxygen&#8208;vacancies&#8208;modified bismuth molybdate nanoflower assembled by 2D nanosheets (BMOVs) and 2D bismuthene composite (Bi/BMOVs) is demonstrated for photocatalytic CO2 conversion. Specifically, the meticulous design of the Ohmic contact formed between BMOVs and bismuthene can allow the modulation of the interfacial charge&#8208;transfer resistance. According to density functional theory (DFT) simulations, it is ascertained that such exceptional charge kinetics is attributed to the tunable built&#8208;in electric field (IEF) of the Ohmic contact. As such, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance of the optimized Bi/BMOVs (CO and CH4 productions rate of 169.93 and 4.65&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively) is ca. 10 times higher than that of the pristine BMO (CO and CH4 production rates of 16.06 and 0.51&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively). The tunable interfacial resistance of the Ohmic contact reported in this work can shed some important light on the design of highly efficient photocatalysts for both energy and environmental applications.

The tunable interfacial resistance of the Ohmic contact reported in this work can shed some important light on the design of highly efficient photocatalysts for both energy and environmental applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optimizing Lipid Nanoparticles for Delivery in Primates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;human primates (NHPs) are regarded as the gold standard for translating preclinical lipid nanoparticle (LNP) data to humans, accurately predicting potency outcomes. By optimizing key LNP attributes and composition, such as particle size and amount of PEGylation, an eightfold increase in protein expression for IV&#8208;administered mRNA&#8208;LNP in NHP is achieved. These findings are significant to the development and clinical translation of nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based therapies.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are clinically proven to successfully deliver both small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics and larger mRNA payloads for prophylactic vaccine applications. Non&#8208;human primates (NHPs) are generally considered to be the most predictive of human responses. However, for ethical and economic reasons, LNP compositions have historically been optimized in rodents. It has been difficult to translate LNP potency data from rodents to NHPs for intravenously (IV) administered products in particular. This presents a major challenge for preclinical drug development. An attempt to investigate LNP parameters, which have historically been optimized in rodents, is carried out, and seemingly innocuous changes are found to result in large potency differences between species. For example, the ideal particle size for NHPs (50&#8211;60&#160;nm) is found to be smaller than for rodents (70&#8211;80&#160;nm). Surface chemistry requirements are also different, with almost double the amount of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)&#8208;conjugated lipid needed for maximal potency in NHPs. By optimizing these two parameters, approximately eight&#8208;fold increase in protein expression from intravenously administered messenger RNA (mRNA)&#8208;LNP in NHP is gained. The optimized formulations are well tolerated when administered repeatedly with no loss of potency. This advancement enables the design of optimal LNP products for clinical development.

         <title>Clinical Validation of a Wearable Piezoelectric Blood&#8208;Pressure Sensor for Continuous Health Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable piezoelectric blood&#8208;pressure sensor (WPBPS) using an extremely sensitive flexible piezoelectric sensor is demonstrated for continuous and non&#8208;invasive arterial pressure (CNAP) monitoring. Its transfer function is designed by a linear regression model, offering a simple solution to convert the sensor signals into BP values. The high accuracy of WPBPS is confirmed through clinical validation with an oscillometric sphygmomanometer as a reference.








Abstract
Wearable blood&#8208;pressure sensors have recently attracted attention as healthcare devices for continuous non&#8208;invasive arterial pressure (CNAP) monitoring. However, the accuracy of wearable blood&#8208;pressure (BP) monitoring devices has been controversial due to the low signal quality of sensors, the absence of an accurate transfer function to convert the sensor signals into BP values, and the lack of clinical validation regarding measurement precision. Here, a wearable piezoelectric blood&#8208;pressure sensor (WPBPS) is reported, which achieves a high normalized sensitivity (0.062 kPa&#8722;1), and fast response time (23&#160;ms) for CNAP monitoring. The transfer function of a linear regression model is designed, offering a simple solution to convert the flexible piezoelectric sensor signals into BP values. In order to verify the measurement accuracy of WPBPS, clinical trials are performed on 35 subjects aged from 20 to 80 s after screening. The mean difference between the WPBPS and a commercial sphygmomanometer of 175 BP data pairs is &#8722;0.89 &#177; 6.19 and &#8722;0.32 &#177; 5.28&#160;mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), respectively. By building a WPBPS&#8208;embedded wristwatch, the potentially promising use of a convenient, portable, continuous BP monitoring system for cardiovascular disease diagnosis is demonstrated.

         <title>Jellybean Quantum Dots in Silicon for Qubit Coupling and On&#8208;Chip Quantum Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly elliptical, elongated, quantum dots&#8212;so&#8208;called jellybean quantum dots&#8212;can be used for qubit&#8211;qubit coupling over short&#8208;to&#8208;intermediate distances and alleviate crowding in scaled&#8208;up quantum processors. Such a jellybean dot is formed in a silicon&#8208;MOS quantum device and reported to support controlled charge filling and well&#8208;defined spin states for higher charge occupations, corroborating its potential for qubit&#8211;qubit couplers in quantum computing architectures.








Abstract
The small size and excellent integrability of silicon metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (SiMOS) quantum dot spin qubits make them an attractive system for mass&#8208;manufacturable, scaled&#8208;up quantum processors. Furthermore, classical control electronics can be integrated on&#8208;chip, in&#8208;between the qubits, if an architecture with sparse arrays of qubits is chosen. In such an architecture qubits are either transported across the chip via shuttling or coupled via mediating quantum systems over short&#8208;to&#8208;intermediate distances. This paper investigates the charge and spin characteristics of an elongated quantum dot&#8212;a so&#8208;called jellybean quantum dot&#8212;for the prospects of acting as a qubit&#8211;qubit coupler. Charge transport, charge sensing, and magneto&#8208;spectroscopy measurements are performed on a SiMOS quantum dot device at mK temperature and compared to Hartree&#8211;Fock multi&#8208;electron simulations. At low electron occupancies where disorder effects and strong electron&#8211;electron interaction dominate over the electrostatic confinement potential, the data reveals the formation of three coupled dots, akin to a tunable, artificial molecule. One dot is formed centrally under the gate and two are formed at the edges. At high electron occupancies, these dots merge into one large dot with well&#8208;defined spin states, verifying that jellybean dots have the potential to be used as qubit couplers in future quantum computing&#160;architectures.

         <title>Alloying of Cu with Ru Enabling the Relay Catalysis for Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Converting NO3&#8722; to NH3 with renewable energy is of great practical significance to balance the environmental problems and economic benefits. Ru1Cu10 alloy exhibits high activity for direct reduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3 under an ultralow potential due to a relay effect on Cu (NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722;) and Ru (NO2&#8722; to NH3) sites.








Abstract
Involving eight electron transfer process and multiple intermediates of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction reaction leads to a sluggish kinetic and low Faradaic efficiency, therefore, it is essential to get an insight into the reaction mechanism to develop highly efficient electrocatalyst. Herein, a series of reduced&#8208;graphene&#8208;oxide&#8208;supported RuCu alloy catalysts (RuxCux/rGO) are fabricated and used for the direct reduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3. It is found that the Ru1Cu10/rGO shows the ammonia formation rate of 0.38&#160;mmol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 (loading 1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and the ammonia Faradaic efficiency of 98% under an ultralow potential of &#8722;0.05&#160;V versus Reversible Hydrogen Electode (RHE), which is comparable to Ru catalyst. The highly efficient activity of Ru1Cu10/rGO can be attributed to the synergetic effect between Ru and Cu sites via a relay catalysis, in which the Cu shows the exclusively efficient activity for the reduction of NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722; and Ru exhibits the superior activity for NO2&#8722; to NH3. In addition, the doping of Ru into Cu tunes the d&#8208;band center of alloy and effectively modulates the adsorption energy of the NO3&#8722; and NO2&#8722;, which promotes the direct reduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3. This synergetic electrocatalysis strategy opens a new avenue for developing highly efficient multifunctional catalysts.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and Ru exhibits the superior activity for NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In addition, the doping of Ru into Cu tunes the d-band center of alloy and effectively modulates the adsorption energy of the NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, which promotes the direct reduction of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This synergetic electrocatalysis strategy opens a new avenue for developing highly efficient multifunctional catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deciphering Structural Origins of Highly Reversible Lithium Storage in High Entropy Oxides with In Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, distinct reaction dynamics and phase transformations during (de)lithiation of rocksalt high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) are visualized by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methodology, revealing composition&#8208;dependent conversion/alloying reaction kinetics and spatiotemporal variations of valence states. Unexpectedly, the post&#8208;lithiation polyphase can be fully and reversibly recovered to the original rocksalt structure upon delithiation. These findings afford valuable guidelines to compositionally engineer novel HEO electrodes.








Abstract
Configurational entropy&#8208;stabilized single&#8208;phase high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) have been considered revolutionary electrode materials with both reversible lithium storage and high specific capacity that are difficult to fulfill simultaneously by conventional electrodes. However, precise understanding of lithium storage mechanisms in such HEOs remains controversial due to complex multi&#8208;cationic oxide systems. Here, distinct reaction dynamics and structural evolutions in rocksalt&#8208;type HEOs upon cycling are carefully studied by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) including imaging, electron diffraction, and electron energy loss spectroscopy at atomic scale. The mechanisms of composition&#8208;dependent conversion/alloying reaction kinetics along with spatiotemporal variations of valence states upon lithiation are revealed, characterized by disappearance of the original rocksalt phase. Unexpectedly, it is found from the first visualization evidence that the post&#8208;lithiation polyphase state can be recovered to the original rocksalt&#8208;structured HEOs via reversible and symmetrical delithiation reactions, which is unavailable for monometallic oxide systems. Rigorous electrochemical tests coupled with postmortem ex situ TEM and bulk&#8208;level phase analyses further validate the crucial role of structural recovery capability in ensuring the reversible high&#8208;capacity Li&#8208;storage in HEOs. These findings can provide valuable guidelines to design compositionally engineer HEOs for almighty electrodes of next&#8208;generation long&#8208;life energy storage devices.

         <title>Reusable Electronic Tongue Based on Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 Nanodisc&#8208;Conjugated Graphene Field&#8208;Effect Transistor for a Spiciness&#8208;Related Pain Evaluation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pain&#8208;related receptor transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 is activated by noxious stimuli such as chemical, physical, and thermal stimuli. The stimuli of pungent compounds induce a sensation of burning or prickling of the tongue. To verify reversible TRPV1 activation to pungent materials, a reusable electronic tongue based on TRPV1 nanodisc conjugated graphene field&#8208;effect transistor is presented.








Abstract
The sense of spiciness is related to the stimulation of vanilloid compounds contained in the foods. Although, the spiciness is commonly considered as the part of taste, it is more classified to the sense of pain stimulated on a tongue, namely, pungency, which is described as a tingling or burning on the tongue. Herein, first, a reusable electronic tongue based on a transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) nanodisc conjugated graphene field&#8208;effect transistor is fabricated and spiciness&#8208;related pain evaluation with reusable electrode is demonstrated. The pungent compound reactive receptor TRPV1 is synthesized in the form of nanodiscs to maintain stability and reusability. The newly developed platform shows highly selective and sensitive performance toward each spiciness related vanilloid compound repeatably: 1 aM capsaicin, 10 aM dihydrocapsaicin, 1 fM piperine, 10&#160;nM allicin, and 1 pM AITC. The binding mechanism is also examined by simulation. Furthermore, the elimination of the burning sensation on the tongue after eating spicy foods is not investigated. Based on the synthesis of micelles composed of casein protein (which is contained in skim milk) that remove pungent compounds bound to TRPV1 nanodisc, the deactivation of TRPV1 is investigated, and the electrode is reusable that mimics electronic tongue.

         <title>Anisotropic Excitons Reveal Local Spin Chain Directions in a van der Waals Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, sharp exciton resonances in antiferromagnet NiPS3 have been reported to correlate with magnetic order. It is found that the polarization of maximal exciton emission in NiPS3 rotate locally, revealing three possible spin chain directions. This discovery establishes a new understanding of the antiferromagnetic order hidden in previous neutron scattering and optical experiments.








Abstract
A long&#8208;standing pursuit in materials science is to identify suitable magnetic semiconductors for integrated information storage, processing, and transfer. Van der Waals magnets have brought forth new material candidates for this purpose. Recently, sharp exciton resonances in antiferromagnet NiPS3 have been reported to correlate with magnetic order, that is, the exciton photoluminescence intensity diminishes above the N&#233;el temperature. Here, it is found that the polarization of maximal exciton emission rotates locally, revealing three possible spin chain directions. This discovery establishes a new understanding of the antiferromagnet order hidden in previous neutron scattering and optical experiments. Furthermore, defect&#8208;bound states are suggested as an alternative exciton formation mechanism that has yet to be explored in NiPS3. The supporting evidence includes chemical analysis, excitation power, and thickness dependent photoluminescence and first&#8208;principles calculations. This mechanism for exciton formation is also consistent with the presence of strong phonon side bands. This study shows that anisotropic exciton photoluminescence can be used to read out local spin chain directions in antiferromagnets and realize multi&#8208;functional devices via spin&#8208;photon transduction.

         <title>Geometric Tuning of Single&#8208;Atom FeN4 Sites via Edge&#8208;Generation Enhances Multi&#8208;Enzymatic Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Geometric tuning of single&#8208;atom active sites is desirable way to enhance catalytic activity. H2O2&#8208;etching to carbon matrix generates abundant edge&#8208;located FeN4 sites with distinct geometric and electronic structures compared to basal plane&#8208;located FeN4 sites. FeNC&#8208;edge with the unique local environment exhibits remarkably improved multi&#8208;enzymatic activity and inhibits tumor growth effectively.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) are considered promising alternatives to natural enzymes. The catalytic performance of SAzymes featuring homogeneous, well&#8208;defined active structures can be enhanced through elucidating structure&#8208;activity relationship and tailoring physicochemical properties. However, manipulating enzymatic properties through structural variation is an underdeveloped approach. Herein, the synthesis of edge&#8208;rich Fe single&#8208;atom nanozymes (FeNC&#8208;edge) via an H2O2&#8208;mediated edge generation is reported. By controlling the number of edge sites, the peroxidase (POD)&#8208; and oxidase (OXD)&#8208;like performance is significantly enhanced. The activity enhancement results from the presence of abundant edges, which provide new anchoring sites to mononuclear Fe. Experimental results combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that FeN4 moieties in the edge sites display high electron density of Fe atoms and open N atoms. Finally, it is demonstrated that FeNC&#8208;edge nanozyme effectively inhibits tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that edge&#8208;tailoring is an efficient strategy for developing artificial enzymes as novel catalytic therapeutics.

         <title>Enhanced Superconductivity and Upper Critical Field in Ta&#8208;Doped Weyl Semimetal Td&#8208;MoTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The superconducting transition temperature is greatly enhanced to be as large as 7.5 K in bulk Mo1&#8722;xTaxTe2 single crystals, which is attributed to an enrichment of density of states at the Fermi level.&#160;We&#160;also find the enhanced upper critical field beyond the Pauli limit in Ta&#8208;doped Weyl semimetal Td&#8208;MoTe2, which is likely due to the mixed singlet&#8211;triplet superconductivity.








Abstract
2D transition metal dichalcogenides are promising platforms for next&#8208;generation electronics and spintronics. The layered Weyl semimetal (W,Mo)Te2 series features structural phase transition, nonsaturated magnetoresistance, superconductivity, and exotic topological physics. However, the superconducting critical temperature of the bulk (W,Mo)Te2 remains ultralow without applying a high pressure. Here, the significantly enhanced superconductivity is observed with a transition temperature as large as about 7.5 K in bulk Mo1&#8722;xTaxTe2 single crystals upon Ta doping (0 &#8804; x&#160;&#8804; 0.22), which is attributed to an enrichment of density of states at the Fermi level. In addition, an enhanced perpendicular upper critical field of 14.5 T exceeding the Pauli limit is also observed in Td&#8208;phase Mo1&#8722;xTaxTe2 (x&#160;= 0.08), indicating the possible emergence of unconventional mixed singlet&#8211;triplet superconductivity owing to the inversion symmetry breaking. This work provides a new pathway for exploring the exotic superconductivity and topological physics in transition metal dichalcogenides.

         <title>Realizing the Heteromorphic Superlattice: Repeated Heterolayers of Amorphous Insulator and Polycrystalline Semiconductor with Minimal Interface Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superlattices represent the epitome of combinatorial materials science: their properties can transcend those of their constituent layers, such as improved mobility with modulation doped structures. Here superlattice combinations are expanded into the morphological domain by introducing direct growth of alternating amorphous and polycrystalline layers, realizing a high&#8208;quality, high mobility &#8220;heteromorphic superlattice,&#8221; originally conceived by Raphael Tsu in 1989.








Abstract
An unconventional &#8220;heteromorphic&#8221; superlattice (HSL) is realized, comprised of repeated layers of different materials with differing morphologies: semiconducting pc&#8208;In2O3 layers interleaved with insulating a&#8208;MoO3 layers. Originally proposed by Tsu in 1989, yet never fully realized, the high quality of the HSL heterostructure demonstrated here validates the intuition of Tsu, whereby the flexibility of the bond angle in the amorphous phase and the passivation effect of the oxide at interfacial bonds serve to create smooth, high&#8208;mobility interfaces. The alternating amorphous layers prevent strain accumulation in the polycrystalline layers while suppressing defect propagation across the HSL. For the HSL with 7:7&#160;nm layer thickness, the observed electron mobility of 71 cm2&#160;Vs&#8208;1, matches that of the highest quality In2O3 thin films. The atomic structure and electronic properties of crystalline In2O3/amorphous MoO3 interfaces are verified using ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations and hybrid functional calculations. This work generalizes the superlattice concept to an entirely new paradigm of morphological combinations.

         <title>Integrating Mixed Halide Perovskite Photocatalytic HI Splitting and Electrocatalysis into a Loop for Efficient and Robust Pure Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The difficult pure water splitting is disassembled into two parts that are easy to implement, namely mixed halide perovskite photocatalytic HI splitting for H2 production, and simultaneous electrocatalytic I3&#8722; reduction and O2 production. The circulation of I3&#8722;/I&#8722; between the designed photocatalytic and electrocatalytic systems can achieve efficient and robust pure water splitting.








Abstract
Developing a hydrogen economy to replace traditional fossil fuels is essential for sustainable human development. As two promising H2 production strategies, photocatalytic and electrocatalytic water splitting with large reaction energy barriers still face the great challenges of poor solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency and large electrochemical overpotentials, respectively. Herein, a new strategy is proposed to disassemble the difficult pure water splitting into two parts that are easy to implement, namely mixed halide perovskite photocatalytic HI splitting for H2 production, and simultaneous electrocatalytic I3&#8722; reduction and O2 production. The efficient charge separation, abundant H2 production active sites, and a small HI splitting energy barrier contribute to the superior photocatalytic H2 production activity of MoSe2/MAPbBr3&#8722;xIx (CH3NH3+&#160;= MA). Subsequent electrocatalytic I3&#8722; reduction and O2 production reactions only need a small voltage of 0.92&#160;V to drive, which is far lower than that of the electrocatalytic pure water splitting (&gt;1.23&#160;V). The molar ratio of H2 (6.99&#160;mmol g&#8722;1) to O2 (3.09&#160;mmol g&#8722;1) produced during the first photocatalytic and electrocatalytic cycle is close to 2:1, and the continuous circulation of I3&#8722;/I&#8722; between the photocatalytic and electrocatalytic systems can achieve efficient and robust pure water splitting.

         <title>Near&#8208; and Long&#8208;Range Electronic Modulation of Single Metal Sites to Boost CO2 Electrocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnN4 sites decorated with axial sulfur ligand and surrounded phosphorus atoms are successfully constructed in the hollow carbon supports, which exhibits excellent performance for CO2 reduction reaction. The total energy efficiency of CO2RR device can be improved by coupling with anodic hydrazine oxidation reaction.








Abstract
Tuning the electronic structure of the active center is effective to improve the intrinsic activity of single&#8208;atom catalysts but the realization of precise regulation remains challenging. Herein, a strategy of &#8220;synergistically near&#8208; and long&#8208;range regulation&#8221; is reported to effectively modulate the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom sites. ZnN4 sites decorated with axial sulfur ligand in the first coordination and surrounded phosphorus atoms in the carbon matrix are successfully constructed in the hollow carbon supports (ZnN4S1/P&#8208;HC). ZnN4S1/P&#8208;HC exhibits excellent performance for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) with a Faraday efficiency of CO close to 100%. The coupling of the CO2RR with thermodynamically favorable hydrazine oxidation reaction to replace oxygen evolution reaction in a two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer can greatly lower the cell voltage by 0.92&#160;V at a current density of 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, theoretically saving 46% of energy consumption. Theoretical calculation reveals that the near&#8208;range regulation with axial thiophene&#8208;S ligand and long&#8208;range regulation with neighboring P atoms can synergistically lead to the increase of electron localization around the Zn sites, which strengthens the adsorption of *COOH intermediate and therefore boosts the CO2RR.

The coupling of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR with thermodynamically favorable hydrazine oxidation reaction to replace oxygen evolution reaction in a two-electrode electrolyzer can greatly lower the cell voltage by 0.92&#160;V at a current density of 5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, theoretically saving 46% of energy consumption. Theoretical calculation reveals that the near-range regulation with axial thiophene-S ligand and long-range regulation with neighboring P atoms can synergistically lead to the increase of electron localization around the Zn sites, which strengthens the adsorption of *COOH intermediate and therefore boosts the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Intrinsic Ferromagnetic Chromium Tellurium Compounds with Thickness&#8208;Tunable Magnetic Texture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generic van der Waals epitaxial approach is demonstrated to synthesize the non&#8208;van der Waals 2D ternary chromium tellurium compounds with thicknesses as low as mono&#8208;UC. Intrinsic ferromagnetic behavior is observed in the bi&#8208;UC, tri&#8208;UC, and few&#8208;UC nanosheets. Thickness&#8208;dependent magnetic textures are studied and applied in neuromorphic computing tasks.








Abstract
2D ferromagnetic chromium tellurides exhibit intriguing spin configurations and high&#8208;temperature intrinsic ferromagnetism, providing unprecedented opportunities to explore the fundamental spin physics and build spintronic devices. Here, a generic van der Waals epitaxial approach is developed to synthesize the 2D ternary chromium tellurium compounds with thicknesses down to mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and few&#8208;unit cells&#160;(UC). The Mn0.14Cr0.86Te evolves from intrinsic ferromagnetic behavior in bi&#8208;UC, tri&#8208;UC, and few&#8208;UC to temperature&#8208;induced ferrimagnetic behavior as the thickness increases, resulting in a sign reversal of the anomalous Hall resistance. Temperature&#8208; and thickness&#8208;tunable labyrinthine&#8208;domain ferromagnetic behaviors are derived from the dipolar interactions in Fe0.26Cr0.74Te and Co0.40Cr0.60Te. Furthermore, the dipolar&#8208;interaction&#8208;induced stripe domain and field&#8208;induced domain wall (DW) motion velocity are studied, and multibit data storage is realized through an abundant DW state. The magnetic storage can function in neuromorphic computing tasks, and the pattern recognition accuracy can reach up to 97.93%, which is similar to the recognition accuracy of ideal software&#8208;based training (98.28%). Room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic chromium tellurium compounds with intriguing spin configurations can significantly promote the exploration of the processing, sensing, and storage based on 2D magnetic systems.

Abstract
A unique class of advanced materials&#8212;quantum composites based on polymers with fillers composed of a van der Waals quantum material that reveals multiple charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave quantum condensate phases&#8212;is demonstrated. Materials that exhibit quantum phenomena are typically crystalline, pure, and have few defects because disorder destroys the coherence of the electrons and phonons, leading to collapse of the quantum states. The macroscopic charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave phases of filler particles after multiple composite processing steps are successfully preserved in this work. The prepared composites display strong charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave phenomena even above room temperature. The dielectric constant experiences more than two orders of magnitude enhancement while the material maintains its electrically insulating properties, opening a venue for advanced applications in energy storage and electronics. The results present a conceptually different approach for engineering the properties of materials, extending the application domain for van der Waals materials.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Small Nano&#8208;Assemblies as Tumor&#8208;Targeted and Renal Clearable Theranostic Agent for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, an ultra&#8208;small nano photosensitizer is presented through a facile self&#8208;assembly strategy that can target a disease state, boost reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, as well as be cleared efficiently from the body in a reasonable amount of time.








Abstract
It is a challenge to design photosensitizers to balance between the tumor&#8208;targeting enrichment for precise treatment and efficient clearance within a reasonable timescale for reducing side effects. Herein, an ultra&#8208;small nano&#8208;photosensitizer 1a with excellent tumor&#8208;specific accumulation and renal clearance is reported. It is formed from the self&#8208;assembly of compound 1 bearing three triethylene glycol (TEG) arms&#160;and two pyridinium groups in water. The positively charged surface with neutral TEG coating enables 1a to efficiently target the tumor, with the signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio reaching as high as 11.5 after tail intravenous injection. The ultra&#8208;small size of 1a with an average diameter of 5.6&#160;nm allows its fast clearance through kidney. Self&#8208;assembly also endows 1a with an 18.2&#8208;fold enhancement of reactive oxygygen species generation rate compared to compound 1 in organic solution. Nano&#8208;PS 1a manifests an excellent photodynamic therapy efficacy on tumor&#8208;bearing mouse models. This work provides a promising design strategy of photosensitizers with renal clearable and tumor&#8208;targeting ability.

         <title>User&#8208;Controlled 4D Biomaterial Degradation with Substrate&#8208;Selective Sortase Transpeptidases for Single&#8208;Cell Biology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using engineered sortase transpeptidases that orthogonally recognize and cleave peptide substrates largely absent from the mammalian proteome, multiplexed cell liberation from within 3D hydrogel biomaterials is uniquely achieved without significantly altering cell fate. Cell recovery is compatible with downstream single&#8208;cell&#8208;based functional assays including flow cytometry.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive biomaterials show great promise for modeling disease dynamics ex vivo with spatiotemporal control over the cellular microenvironment. However, harvesting cells from such materials for downstream analysis without perturbing their state remains an outstanding challenge in 3/4&#8208;dimensional (3D/4D) culture and tissue engineering. In this manuscript, a fully enzymatic strategy for hydrogel degradation that affords spatiotemporal control over cell release while maintaining cytocompatibility is introduced. Exploiting engineered variants of the sortase transpeptidase evolved to recognize and selectively cleave distinct peptide sequences largely absent from the mammalian proteome, many limitations implicit to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods to liberate cells from gels are sidestepped. It is demonstrated that evolved sortase exposure has minimal impact on the global transcriptome of primary mammalian cells and that proteolytic cleavage proceeds with high specificity; incorporation of substrate sequences within hydrogel crosslinkers permits rapid and selective cell recovery with high viability. In composite multimaterial hydrogels, it is shown that sequential degradation of hydrogel layers enables highly specific retrieval of single&#8208;cell suspensions for phenotypic analysis. It is expected that the high bioorthogonality and substrate selectivity of the evolved sortases will lead to their broad adoption as an enzymatic material dissociation cue and that their multiplexed use will enable newfound studies in 4D cell culture.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Resolved Imaging of Antiferromagnetic Order in Fe4Se5 Ultrathin Films on SrTiO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe4Se5 ultrathin films are experimentally demonstrated to host a pair&#8208;checkerboard antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state with in&#8208;plane magnetization, evident with magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;dependent spin contrasts in real&#8208;space by spin&#8208;polarized scanning tunneling microscopy. The AFM order is modulated by a spin&#8211;lattice coupling and exhibits three types of nanoscale AFM domains, which are subject to thermal fluctuations into short&#8208;ranged patches at elevated temperatures.








Abstract
Unraveling the magnetic order in iron chalcogenides and pnictides at atomic scale is pivotal for understanding their unconventional superconducting pairing mechanism, but is experimentally challenging. Here, by utilizing spin&#8208;polarized scanning tunneling microscopy, real&#8208;space spin contrasts are successfully resolved to exhibit atomically unidirectional stripes in Fe4Se5 ultrathin films, the plausible closely related compound of bulk FeSe with ordered Fe&#8208;vacancies, which are grown by molecular beam epitaxy. As is substantiated by the first&#8208;principles electronic structure calculations, the spin contrast originates from a pair&#8208;checkerboard antiferromagnetic ground state with in&#8208;plane magnetization, which is modulated by a spin&#8211;lattice coupling. These measurements further identify three types of nanoscale antiferromagnetic domains with distinguishable spin contrasts, which are subject to thermal fluctuations into short&#8208;ranged patches at elevated temperatures. This work provides promising opportunities in understanding the emergent magnetic order and the electronic phase diagram for FeSe&#8208;derived superconductors.

         <title>Volumetric Printing of Thiol&#8208;Ene Photo&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linkable Poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone): A Tunable Material Platform Serving Biomedical Applications</title>

         <dc:description>
Thiol&#8208;ene cross&#8208;linkable poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone)&#160;is introduced and the effect of the cross&#8208;link density on the networks&#8217; physico&#8208;chemical properties, volumetric printability, and biocompatibility is investigated. Notably, this is the first report on volumetric 3D&#8208;printing of polyesters and 3D&#8208;printing of the smallest features to date, for non&#8208;acrylate&#8208;based resins, is illustrated.








Abstract
Current thoroughly described biodegradable and cross&#8208;linkable polymers mainly rely on acrylate cross&#8208;linking. However, despite the swift cross&#8208;linking kinetics of acrylates, the concomitant brittleness of the resulting materials limits their applicability. Here, photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linkable poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone)&#160;networks through orthogonal thiol&#8208;ene chemistry are introduced. The step&#8208;growth polymerized networks are tunable, predictable by means of the rubber elasticity theory and it is shown that their mechanical properties are significantly improved over their acrylate cross&#8208;linked counterparts. Tunability is introduced to the materials, by altering Mc (or the molar mass between cross&#8208;links), and its effect on the thermal properties, mechanical strength and degradability of the materials is evaluated. Moreover, excellent volumetric printability is illustrated and the smallest features obtained via volumetric 3D&#8208;printing to date are reported, for thiol&#8208;ene systems. Finally, by means of in vitro and in vivo characterization of 3D&#8208;printed constructs, it is illustrated that the volumetrically 3D&#8208;printed materials are biocompatible. This combination of mechanical stability, tunability, biocompatibility, and rapid fabrication by volumetric 3D&#8208;printing charts a new path toward bedside manufacturing of biodegradable patient&#8208;specific implants.

         <title>A Concerted Redox&#8208; and Light&#8208;Activated Agent for Controlled Multimodal Therapy against Hypoxic Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypoxia represents a compelling tumor therapeutic target. The first metal&#8208;based multimodal theranostic agent (RuAzNM) for targeting hypoxia is reported. The&#160;activity of RuAzNM is caged by a conjugated azo group, and selectively unleashed in hypoxic cancer cells. This allows emission&#8208;directed multimodal therapy, elicits apoptosis, and suggests that RuAzNM can deliver&#160;an efficacious theranostic outcome for hypoxic cancer cells.








Abstract
Hypoxia represents a remarkably exploitable target for cancer therapy, is encountered only in solid human tumors, and is highly associated with cancer resistance and recurrence. Here, a hypoxia&#8208;activated mitochondria&#8208;accumulated Ru(II) polypyridyl prodrug functionalized with conjugated azo (Az) and nitrogen mustard (NM) functionalities, RuAzNM, is reported. This prodrug has multimodal theranostic properties toward hypoxic cancer cells. Reduction of the azo group in hypoxic cell microenvironments gives rise to the generation of two primary amine products, a free aniline mustard, and the polypyridyl RuNH2 complex. Thus, the aniline mustard triggers generation of&#160;reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mtDNA crosslinking. Meanwhile, the resultant biologically benign phosphorescent RuNH2 gives rise to a diagnostic signal and signals activation of the phototherapy. This multimodal therapeutic effect eventually elevates ROS levels, depletes reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and induces mitochondrial membrane damage, mtDNA damage, and ultimately cell apoptosis. This unique strategy allows controlled multimodal theranostics to be realized in hypoxic cells and multicellular spheroids, making RuAzNM a highly selective and effective cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;selective theranostic agent (IC50&#160;= 2.3&#160;&#181;m for hypoxic HepG2 cancer cells vs 58.2&#160;&#181;m for normoxic THL&#8208;3 normal cells). This is the first report of a metal&#8208;based compound developed as a multimodal theranostic agent for hypoxia.

         <title>Electrostatic Epitaxy of Orientational Perovskites for Microlasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substrate&#8208;free electrostatic epitaxy is achieved toward orientational growth of single&#8208;crystalline microwire arrays and thin films. This is facilitated by a negatively charged surfactant layer at the air&#8211;liquid interface, where the strong and selective interaction between surfactant anion and perovskite facet induces preferential nucleation and orientational growth. The high&#8208;quality microwire permits a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of photonic lasing, waveguide coupling, and coherent&#8208;light propagation.








Abstract
Orientational growth of single&#8208;crystalline structures is pivotal in the semiconductor industry, which is achievable by epitaxy for producing thin films, heterostructures, quantum wells, and superlattices. Beyond silicon and III&#8211;V semiconductors, solution&#8208;processible semiconductors, such as metal&#8208;halide perovskites, are emerging for scalable and cost&#8208;effective manufacture of optoelectronic devices, whereas the polycrystalline nature of fabricated structures restricts their application toward integrated devices. Here, electrostatic epitaxy, a process sustained by strong electrostatic interactions between self&#8208;assembled surfactants (octanoate anions) and Pb2+, is developed to realize orientational growth of single&#8208;crystalline CsPbBr3 microwires. Strong electrostatic interactions localized at the air&#8211;liquid interface not only support preferential nucleation for single crystallinity, but also select the crystal facet with the highest Pb2+ areal density for pure crystallographic orientation. Due to the epitaxy at the air&#8211;liquid interface, direct growth of oriented single&#8208;crystalline microwires onto different substrates without the processes of lift&#8208;off and transfer is realized. Photonic lasing emission, waveguide coupling, and on&#8208;chip propagation of coherent light are demonstrated based on these single&#8208;crystalline microwires. These findings open an avenue for on&#8208;chip integration of single&#8208;crystalline materials.

Abstract
Current functional assessment of biomaterial&#8208;induced stem cell lineage fate in vitro mainly relies on biomarker&#8208;dependent methods with limited accuracy and efficiency. Here a &#8220;Mesenchymal stem cell Differentiation Prediction (MeD&#8208;P)&#8221; framework for biomaterial&#8208;induced cell lineage fate prediction is reported. MeD&#8208;P contains a cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific gene expression profile as a reference by integrating public RNA&#8208;seq data related to tri&#8208;lineage differentiation (osteogenesis, chondrogenesis, and adipogenesis) of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and a predictive model for classifying hMSCs differentiation lineages using the k&#8208;nearest neighbors (kNN) strategy. It is shown that MeD&#8208;P exhibits an overall accuracy of 90.63% on testing datasets, which is significantly higher than the model constructed based on canonical marker genes (80.21%). Moreover, evaluations of multiple biomaterials show that MeD&#8208;P provides accurate prediction of lineage fate on different types of biomaterials as early as the first week of hMSCs culture. In summary, it is demonstrated that MeD&#8208;P is an efficient and accurate strategy for stem cell lineage fate prediction and preliminary biomaterial functional evaluation.

         <title>Iridescence from Total Internal Reflection at 3D Microscale Interfaces: Mechanistic Insights and Spectral Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An experimental investigation and the optical modeling of structural coloration produced from total internal reflection interference within 3D microstructures are described. Ray tracing coupled with spectral analysis techniques are used to examine the iridescence generated for a range of microgeometries, including hemicylinders and truncated hemispheres. Microstructure arrays with varying orientation and size create unique color&#8208;traveling optical effects with customizable iridescence.








Abstract
An experimental investigation and the optical modeling of the structural coloration produced from total internal reflection interference within 3D microstructures are described. Ray&#8208;tracing simulations coupled with color visualization and spectral analysis techniques are used to model, examine, and rationalize the iridescence generated for a range of microgeometries, including hemicylinders and truncated hemispheres, under varying illumination conditions. An approach to deconstruct the observed iridescence and complex far&#8208;field spectral features into its elementary components and systematically link them to ray trajectories that emanate from the illuminated microstructures is demonstrated. The results are compared with experiments, wherein microstructures are fabricated with methods such as chemical etching, multiphoton lithography, and grayscale lithography. Microstructure arrays patterned on surfaces with varying orientation and size lead to unique color&#8208;traveling optical effects and highlight opportunities for how total internal reflection interference can be used to create customizable reflective iridescence. The findings herein provide a robust conceptual framework for rationalizing this multibounce interference mechanism and establish approaches for characterizing and tailoring the optical and iridescent properties of microstructured surfaces.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Regulation of the Microenvironment of Ni(II)&#8208;Porphyrin Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudo&#8208;pyridine&#8208;substituted Ni(II)&#8208;porphyrins (o&#8208;NiTPyP, m&#8208;NiTPyP, p&#8208;NiTPyP) are prepared as model catalysts for fine&#8208;tuning the microenvironment around the active site via affecting the H&#8208;bonding interaction and N&#63743;Ni&#63743;N bond angles. Among them, m&#8208;NiTPyP as the electrocatalyst delivers the lowest overpotentials of 267/138&#160;mV for the OER/HER, and as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in an alkaline electrolyzer only requires a cell voltage of 1.62&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 current density.








Abstract
Accurately regulating the microenvironment around active sites is an important approach for boosting the overall water splitting performance of bifunctional electrocatalysts,&#160;which&#160;can drive both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the same electrolyte. Herein, pseudo&#8208;pyridine&#8208;substituted Ni(II)&#8208;porphyrins (o&#8208;NiTPyP, m&#8208;NiTPyP, and p&#8208;NiTPyP) with pseudo&#8208;pyridine N&#8208;atoms located at the ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, or para&#8208;position are prepared and used as model catalysts for alkaline water splitting. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the pseudo&#8208;pyridine N&#8208;atom positions can regulate the microenvironment around the active sites and the adsorption free energy of H&#8208;donating substances by affecting the H&#8208;bonding interaction and the N&#63743;Ni&#63743;N bond angles of active sites, and thus those pseudo&#8208;pyridine&#8208;substituted Ni(II)&#8208;porphyrins deliver better electrocatalytic activity than the Ni(II)&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin (NiTPP) without pseudo&#8208;pyridine N&#8208;atoms. Among them, m&#8208;NiTPyP on carbon nanotubes delivers the lowest overpotentials of 267 and 138&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for the OER and HER, respectively. Specifically, m&#8208;NiTPyP as bifunctional electrocatalyst in an alkaline electrolyzer requires only 1.62&#160;V to drive efficient overall water splitting at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 while remaining durable. This work proposes a new H&#8208;bond&#8208;regulating approach of the microenvironment of electrocatalysts for effectively boosting the overall water splitting activity and deeply understanding its related mechanism.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Reversal of Phase Segregation in Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;induced halide segregation is a major barrier to the implementation of mixed&#8208;halide perovskites in tandem solar cells. Increasing temperature from 125&#160;K kinetically enhances halide segregation up to 290&#160;K, but higher temperatures are found to hinder it owing to entropic remixing. Increasing the incident light intensity can also induce remixing, but this effect is transient.








Abstract
Understanding the mechanism of light&#8208;induced halide segregation in mixed&#8208;halide perovskites is essential for their application in multijunction solar cells. Here, photoluminescence spectroscopy is used to uncover how both increases in temperature and light intensity can counteract the halide segregation process. It is observed that, with increasing temperature, halide segregation in CH3NH3Pb(Br0.4I0.6)3 first accelerates toward &#8776;290&#160;K, before slowing down again toward higher temperatures. Such reversal is attributed to the trade&#8208;off between the temperature activation of segregation, for example through enhanced ionic migration, and its inhibition by entropic factors. High light intensities meanwhile can also reverse halide segregation; however, this is found to be only a transient process that abates on the time scale of minutes. Overall, these observations pave the way for a more complete model of halide segregation and aid the development of highly efficient and stable perovskite multijunction and concentrator&#160;photovoltaics.

         <title>Hierarchical Superstructure of Plant Polyphenol and Arginine Surfactant for Long&#8208;Lasting and Target&#8208;Selective Antimicrobial Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of long&#8208;lasting antimicrobial agent with anti&#8208;water washing property and broad substrate adhesion is constructed by bottom&#8211;up assembly from plant polyphenol and amino acid surfactant. The antimicrobial molecules dissociate from the secondary structure of hexagonal column by multi&#8208;stage and on&#8208;demand release to selectively kill the pathogen without generating toxicity and irritation to the normal human tissue.








Abstract
Antimicrobial agents are massively used to disinfect the pathogen contaminated surfaces since the Corona&#160;Virus&#160;Disease&#160;2019&#160;(COVID&#8208;19) outbreak. However, their defects of poor durability, strong irritation, and high environmental accumulation are exposed.

&lt;p&gt;A kind of long-lasting antimicrobial agent with anti-water washing property and broad substrate adhesion is constructed by bottom&#8211;up assembly from plant polyphenol and amino acid surfactant. The antimicrobial molecules dissociate from the secondary structure of hexagonal column by multi-stage and on-demand release to selectively kill the pathogen without generating toxicity and irritation to the normal human tissue.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial agents are massively used to disinfect the pathogen contaminated surfaces since the Corona&#160;Virus&#160;Disease&#160;2019&#160;(COVID-19) outbreak. However, their defects of poor durability, strong irritation, and high environmental accumulation are exposed. Herein, a convenient strategy is developed to fabricate long-lasting and target-selective antimicrobial agent with the special hierarchical structure through bottom&#8211;up assembly of natural gallic acid with arginine surfactant. The assembly starts from rodlike micelles, further stacking into hexagonal columns and finally interpenetrating into spherical assemblies, which avoid explosive release of antimicrobial units.

         <title>Lead(II) 2&#8208;Ethylhexanoate for Simultaneous Modulated Crystallization and Surface Shielding to Boost Perovskite Solar Cell Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead(II) 2&#8208;ethylhexanoate (LDE) is introduced via an antisolvent process into perovskite films to change the kinetics of crystallization, resulting in high&#8208;quality perovskite film. The carboxyl functional group coordinates with the Pb cation, reducing the defect concentration. Meanwhile, the long alkyl chains form a protecting layer to prevent chemical attack by water and air, prolonging the lifetime of perovskite devices.








Abstract
The bulk and surface of a perovskite light&#8208;harvesting layer are two pivotal aspects affecting its carrier transport and long&#8208;term stability. In this work, lead(II) 2&#8208;ethylhexanoate (LDE) is introduced via an antisolvent process into perovskite films to change the reaction kinetics of the crystallization process, resulting in a high&#8208;quality perovskite film. Meanwhile, a carboxyl functional group with a long alkyl chain coordinates with the Pb cation, reducing the defect density related to unsaturated Pb atoms. Moreover, the long alkyl chains form a protecting layer at the surface of the perovskite film to prevent chemical attack by water and air, prolonging the lifetime of perovskite devices. Consequently, the assembled device demonstrates a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.84%. Both of the thermal and operational stability are significantly improved due to reduced ion&#8208;migration channels.

         <title>Fluorinated Li10GeP2S12 Enables Stable All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
LiF&#8208;coated core&#8211;shell electrolyte LiF@Li10GeP2S12 is achieved by in situ gas&#8208;phase fluoridation. Benefiting from the LiF shell, LiF@Li10GeP2S12 exhibits excellent compatibility toward moisture and lithium metal, realizing a high ionic conductivity after air exposure and three times higher critical current density. The assembled all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery exhibits a capacity retention of 94.8% after 1000 cycles at 1 C.








Abstract
The instability of Li10GeP2S12 toward moisture and that toward lithium metal are two challenges for the application in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. In this work, Li10GeP2S12 is fluorinated to form a LiF&#8208;coated core&#8211;shell solid electrolyte LiF@Li10GeP2S12. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations confirm the hydrolysis mechanism of Li10GeP2S12 solid electrolyte, including H2O adsorption on Li atoms of Li10GeP2S12 and the subsequent PS43&#8722; dissociation affected by hydrogen bond. The hydrophobic LiF shell can reduce the adsorption site, thus resulting in superior moisture stability when exposing in 30% relative humidity air. Moreover, with LiF shell, Li10GeP2S12 shows one order lower electronic conductivity, which can significantly suppress lithium dendrite growth and reduce the side reaction between Li10GeP2S12 and lithium, realizing three times higher critical current density to 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The assembled LiNbO3@LiCoO2/LiF@Li10GeP2S12/Li battery exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 101.0 mAh g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 94.8% after 1000 cycles at 1 C.

         <title>Genetically Programmable Vesicles for Enhancing CAR&#8208;T Therapy against Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetically programmable cellular vesicles expressing high&#8208;affinity anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 scFv loaded with glutamine antagonist (D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs) are developed to metabolically dismantle the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and improve the infiltration and effector functions of chimeric antigen receptor&#8208;T (CAR&#8208;T) cells. The combination of D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs with CAR&#8208;T cells increases the therapeutic effect against orthotopic lung cancer and generates a long&#8208;term immune memory response.








Abstract
Chimeric antigen receptor&#8208;T (CAR&#8208;T) cell therapy has shown remarkable success in eradicating hematologic malignancies; however, its efficacy in treating solid tumors has always been limited due to the presence of an immune&#8208;suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, genetically programmable cellular vesicles expressing high&#8208;affinity anti&#8208;programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 single chain variable fragment (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1&#160;scFv) loaded with glutamine antagonist (D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs) are developed to metabolically dismantle the immunosuppressive TME and enhance the efficiency of anti&#8208;mesothelin CAR&#8208;T cells in orthotopic lung cancer. As anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 scFv can specifically bind to the programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) on tumor cells, D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs enable the targeted delivery of glutamine antagonists to the tumor site and address the upregulation of PD&#8208;L1 on tumor cells, which prevents the premature exhaustion of CAR&#8208;T cells. More importantly, D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs effectively reduce the number of immunosuppressive cells and promote the recruitment of inflammatory cells and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines in tumor tissues. These unique features of D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs improve the infiltration and effector functions of CAR&#8208;T cells, which ultimately enhance the anti&#8208;tumor ability and long&#8208;term memory immunity of CAR&#8208;T cells. The findings support that D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs act as a promising drug to strengthen the effectiveness of CAR&#8208;T cells against solid tumors.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional&#160;Cs2AgInxBi1&#8208;xCl6 Alloyed Double Perovskite Nanoplatelets for Solution&#8208;Processed Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D Cs2AgInxBi1&#8208;xCl6 (0 &#8804; x&#160;&#8804; 1) alloyed double perovskite nanoplatelets are synthesized. The outstanding optical properties can be well explained by temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence spectroscopy study and first&#8208;principal density functional theory calculations. The as&#8208;prepared alloyed double perovskite nanoplatelets exhibit unprecedent stability toward air and polar solvents. All&#8208;solution&#8208;processed light&#8208;emitting diodes using this material as the sole emitting layer are successfully fabricated.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free double perovskites have emerged as a promising class of materials with potential to be integrated into a wide range of optical and optoelectronic applications. Herein, the first synthesis of 2D Cs2AgInxBi1&#8208;xCl6 (0 &#8804; x&#160;&#8804; 1) alloyed double perovskite nanoplatelets (NPLs) with well controlled morphology and composition is demonstrated. The obtained NPLs show unique optical properties with the highest photoluminescence quantum yield of 40.1%. Both temperature dependent spectroscopic studies and density functional theory calculation results reveal that the morphological dimension reduction and In&#8211;Bi alloying effect together boost the radiative pathway of the self&#8208;trapped excitons of the alloyed double perovskite NPLs.

The outstanding optical properties can be well explained by temperature-dependent photoluminescence spectroscopy study and first-principal density functional theory calculations. The as-prepared alloyed double perovskite nanoplatelets exhibit unprecedent stability toward air and polar solvents.

&lt;p&gt;Lead-free double perovskites have emerged as a promising class of materials with potential to be integrated into a wide range of optical and optoelectronic applications. Herein, the first synthesis of 2D Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AgIn&lt;i&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (0 &#8804; &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8804; 1) alloyed double perovskite nanoplatelets (NPLs) with well controlled morphology and composition is demonstrated. The obtained NPLs show unique optical properties with the highest photoluminescence quantum yield of 40.1%. Both temperature dependent spectroscopic studies and density functional theory calculation results reveal that the morphological dimension reduction and In&#8211;Bi alloying effect together boost the radiative pathway of the self-trapped excitons of the alloyed double perovskite NPLs. Moreover, the NPLs exhibit good stability under ambient conditions and against polar solvents, which is ideal for all solution-processing of the materials in low-cost device manufacturing. The first solution-processed light-emitting diodes is demonstrated using the Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AgIn&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; alloyed double perovskite NPLs as the sole emitting component, showing luminance maximum of 58&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and peak current efficiency of 0.013&#160;cd A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Abstract
Detection of biomarkers associated with wound conditions provides in&#8208;depth healthcare information and benefits wound healing treatment. The current aim of wound detection is to achieve in situ multiple detections. Novel encoded structural color microneedle patches (EMNs) combining photonic crystals (PhCs) and microneedle arrays (MNs) for multiple wound biomarker detection in situ are described here. Using a partitioned and layered casting strategy, the EMNs can be divided into different modules and each serves for the detection of small molecules , including pH, glucose, and histamine. pH sensing is based on the interaction between hydrogen ions and carboxyl groups from hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (PAM); glucose sensing is achieved with the help of glucose&#8208;responsive fluorophenylboronic acid (FPBA); while histamine sensing relies on specific recognition of aptamers and target molecules. Owing to the responsive volume change of these three modules in the presence of target molecules, the EMNs can create structural color change and characteristic peak shift of the PhCs, thus realizing the qualitative measurement of target molecules with a spectrum analyzer. It is further demonstrated that the EMNs behave well in the multivariate detection of rat wound molecules. These features indicate that the EMNs can be valuable smart detection systems for wound status screening.

         <title>A Superconducting Micro&#8208;Magnetometer for Quantum Vortex in Superconducting Nanoflakes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superconducting quantum interferometer devices are important in investigating magnetic properties in quantum materials, but cannot probe micro&#8208;scale samples with small magnetic signals. Based on the superconducting micro&#8208;magnetometer, the density of vortex pinning centers in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 nanoflake can be determined as 1.1 &#215; 1012 m&#8722;2. This superconducting micro&#8208;magnetometer sheds light on the detection of small magnetic signals of nanoflakes.








Abstract
Superconducting quantum interferometer device (SQUID) plays a key role in understanding electromagnetic properties and emergent phenomena in quantum materials. The technological appeal of SQUID is that its detection accuracy for the electromagnetic signal can precisely reach the quantum level of a single magnetic flux. However, conventional SQUID techniques normally can only be applied to a bulky sample and do not have the capability to probe the magnetic properties of micro&#8208;scale samples with small magnetic signals. Herein, it is demonstrated that, based on a specially designed superconducting nano&#8208;hole array, the contactless detection of magnetic properties and quantized vortices in micro&#8208;sized superconducting nanoflakes is realized. An anomalous hysteresis loop and a suppression of Little&#8211;Parks oscillation are observed in the detected magnetoresistance signal, which originates from the disordered distribution of the pinned vortices in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+&#948;. Therefore, the density of pinning centers of the quantized vortices on such micro&#8208;sized superconducting samples can be quantitatively evaluated, which is technically inaccessible for conventional SQUID detection. The superconducting micro&#8208;magnetometer provides a new approach to exploring mesoscopic electromagnetic phenomena of quantum materials.

         <title>The First Demonstration of Strain&#8208;Controlled Periodic Ferroelectric Domains with Superior Piezoelectric Response in Molecular Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By applying tensile strain to the thin film of molecular ferroelectric trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichlorocadmium (TMCM&#8208;CdCl3), a large area of highly ordered periodic domain structures can be obtained. The density and width of these periodic domains can be adjusted by the magnitude of strain and the thickness of the film, respectively, and the piezoelectric response at the domain wall is enhanced.








Abstract
Achieving a periodic domain structure in ferroelectric materials to tailor the macroscopic properties or realize new functions has always been a hot topic. However, methods to construct periodic domain structures, such as epitaxial growth, direct writing by scanning tips, and the patterned electrode method, are difficult or inefficient to implement in emerging molecular ferroelectrics, which have the advantages of lightweight, flexibility, biocompatibility, etc. An efficient method for constructing and controlling periodic domain structures is urgently needed to facilitate the development of molecular ferroelectrics in nanoelectronic devices. In this work, it is demonstrated that large&#8208;area, periodic and controllable needle&#8208;like domain structures can be achieved in thin films of the molecular ferroelectric trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichlorocadmium (TMCM&#8208;CdCl3) upon the application of tensile strain. The domain evolution under various tensile strains can be clearly observed, and such processes are accordingly identified. Furthermore, the domain wall exhibits a superior piezoelectric response, with up to fivefold enhancement compared to that of the pristine samples. Such large&#8208;area tunable periodic domain structure and abnormally strong piezoresponse are not only of great interests in fundamental studies, but also highly important in the future applications in functional molecular materials.

         <title>The Emerging Layered Hydroxide Plates with Record Thickness for Enhanced High&#8208;Mass&#8208;Loading Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the NH4+ and F&#8722; synergy mechanism, the intrinsic growth limit of &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 is broken,&#160;realizing record&#8208;level thickness (over 700&#160;nm) for the tailored F&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 (Ni&#8211;F&#8211;OH) superstructure. The ultrathick plate superstructure is found to have a versatile family, which can open a new era of novel energy&#8208;storage materials to meet various future demands.








Abstract
The past decade has witnessed the development of layered&#8208;hydroxide&#8208;based self&#8208;supporting electrodes, but the low active mass ratio impedes its all&#8208;around energy&#8208;storage applications. Herein, the intrinsic limit of layered hydroxides is broken by engineering F&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 (Ni&#8211;F&#8211;OH) plates with a sub&#8208;micrometer thickness (over 700&#160;nm), producing a superhigh mass loading of 29.8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 on the carbon substrate. Theoretical calculation and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis demonstrate that Ni&#8211;F&#8211;OH shares the &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2&#8208;like structure with slightly tuned lattice parameters. More interestingly, the synergy modulation of NH4+ and F&#8722; is found to serve as the key enabler to tailor these sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;thickness 2D plates thanks to the modification effects on the (001) plane surface energy and local OH&#8722; concentration. Guided by this mechanism, the superstructures of bimetallic hydroxides and their derivatives are further developed, revealing they are a versatile family with great promise. The tailored ultrathick phosphide superstructure achieves a superhigh specific capacity of 7144 mC cm&#8722;2 and a superior rate capability (79% at 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). This work highlights a multiscale understanding of how exceptional structure modulation happens in low&#8208;dimensional layered materials. The as&#8208;built unique methodology and mechanisms will boost the development of advanced materials to better meet future energy demands.

&lt;p&gt;With the NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; synergy mechanism, the intrinsic growth limit of &#946;-Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is broken,&#160;realizing record-level thickness (over 700&#160;nm) for the tailored F-substituted &#946;-Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Ni&#8211;F&#8211;OH) superstructure. The ultrathick plate superstructure is found to have a versatile family, which can open a new era of novel energy-storage materials to meet various future demands.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past decade has witnessed the development of layered-hydroxide-based self-supporting electrodes, but the low active mass ratio impedes its all-around energy-storage applications. Herein, the intrinsic limit of layered hydroxides is broken by engineering F-substituted &#946;-Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Ni&#8211;F&#8211;OH) plates with a sub-micrometer thickness (over 700&#160;nm), producing a superhigh mass loading of 29.8&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; on the carbon substrate. Theoretical calculation and X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis demonstrate that Ni&#8211;F&#8211;OH shares the &#946;-Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-like structure with slightly tuned lattice parameters. More interestingly, the synergy modulation of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is found to serve as the key enabler to tailor these sub-micrometer-thickness 2D plates thanks to the modification effects on the (001) plane surface energy and local OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; concentration. Guided by this mechanism, the superstructures of bimetallic hydroxides and their derivatives are further developed, revealing they are a versatile family with great promise. The tailored ultrathick phosphide superstructure achieves a superhigh specific capacity of 7144 mC cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a superior rate capability (79% at 50&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). This work highlights a multiscale understanding of how exceptional structure modulation happens in low-dimensional layered materials. The as-built unique methodology and mechanisms will boost the development of advanced materials to better meet future energy demands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Van der Waals Epitaxy Growth of 2D Single&#8208;Element Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of 2D single&#8208;element cobalt nanosheets with a sub&#8208;millimeter scale via van der Waals epitaxy is demonstrated for the first time, which is guaranteed by the synergistic effect between van der Waals interactions and surface energy minimization. Cobalt nanosheets exhibit significant in&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy and magnetoresistance effects, opening up exciting opportunities for the exploration of 2D single&#8208;element magnetism.








Abstract
2D single&#8208;element materials, which are pure and intrinsically homogeneous on the nanometer scale, can cut the time&#8208;consuming material&#8208;optimization process and circumvent the impure phase, bringing about opportunities to explore new physics and applications. Herein, for the first time, the synthesis of ultrathin cobalt single&#8208;crystalline nanosheets with a sub&#8208;millimeter scale via van der Waals epitaxy is demonstrated. The thickness can be as low as &#8776;6&#160;nm. Theoretical calculations reveal their intrinsic ferromagnetic nature and epitaxial mechanism: that is, the synergistic effect between van der Waals interactions and surface energy minimization dominates the growth process. Cobalt nanosheets exhibit ultrahigh&#160;blocking temperatures above 710 K and in&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy. Electrical transport measurements further reveal that cobalt nanosheets have significant magnetoresistance (MR) effect, and can realize a unique coexistence of positive MR and negative MR under different magnetic field configurations, which can be attributed to the competition and cooperation effect among ferromagnetic interaction, orbital scattering, and electronic correlation. These results provide a valuable case for synthesizing 2D elementary metal crystals with pure phase and room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism and pave the way for investigating new physics and related applications in spintronics.

         <title>Quantifiable Relationship Between Antibacterial Efficacy and Electro&#8211;Mechanical Intervention on Nanowire Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quantifiable relationship between biophysical force and antibacterial efficiency is demonstrated. Electrical interactions not only supplement mechanical damage by accentuating the electrostatic attraction between the bacteria and implant surface, but also facilitate electron flow from the bacteria to the materials to boost production of intracellular reactive oxygen species. This principle aids the development of non&#8208;leaching antibacterial implant materials with clinical significance.








Abstract
Physical disruption is an important antibacterial means as it is lethal to bacteria without spurring antimicrobial resistance. However, it is very challenging to establish a quantifiable relationship between antibacterial efficacy and physical interactions such as mechanical and electrical forces. Herein, titanium nitride (TN) nanowires with adjustable orientations and capacitances are prepared to exert gradient electro&#8211;mechanical forces on bacteria. While vertical nanowires show the strongest mechanical force resulting in an antibacterial efficiency of 0.62 log reduction (vs 0.22 for tiled and 0.36 for inclined nanowires, respectively), the addition of electrical charges maximizes the electro&#8211;mechanical interactions and elevates the antibacterial efficacy to more than 3 log reduction. Biophysical and biochemical analyses indicate that electrostatic attraction by electrical charge narrows the interface. The electro&#8211;mechanical intervention more easily stiffens and rips the bacteria membrane, disturbing the electron balance and generating intracellular oxidative stress. The antibacterial ability is maintained in vivo and bacteria&#8208;challenged rats are protected from serious infection. The physical bacteria&#8208;killing process demonstrated here can be controlled by adjusting the electro&#8211;mechanical interactions. Overall, these results revealed important principles for rationally designing high&#8208;performance antibacterial interfaces for clinical applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Scanning Second&#8208;Harmonic&#8208;Generation Microscopy for Polar Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput scanning second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation microscope with automatic partitioning, accurate positioning, and fast scanning is developed. The microscope&#160;is capable of rapidly screening high&#8208;throughput polar materials without common artifacts arising from leakage current and electrostatic interference, and is successfully applied to compositional&#8208;gradient as well as thickness&#8208;gradient polar materials to demonstrate its high&#8208;throughput capabilities.








Abstract
The Materials Genome Initiative aims to discover, develop, manufacture, and deploy advanced materials at twice the speed of conventional approaches. To achieve this, high&#8208;throughput characterization is essential for the rapid screening of candidate materials. In this study, a high&#8208;throughput scanning second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation microscope with automatic partitioning, accurate positioning, and fast scanning is developed that can rapidly probe and screen polar materials. Using this technique, typical ferroelectrics, including periodically poled lithium niobate crystals and PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) thin films are first investigated, whereby the microscopic domain structures are clearly revealed. This technique is then applied to a compositional&#8208;gradient (100&#8722;x)%BaTiO3&#8722;x%SrTiO3 film and a thickness&#8208;gradient PZT film to demonstrate its high&#8208;throughput capabilities. Since the second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation signal is correlated with the macroscopic remnant polarization over the probed region determined by the laser spot, it is free of artifacts arising from leakage current and electrostatic interference, while materials&#8217; symmetries and domain structures must be carefully considered in the data analysis. It is believed that this work can help promote the high&#8208;throughput development of polar materials and contribute to the Materials Genome Initiative.

         <title>Doping by Design: Enhanced Thermoelectric Performance of GeSe Alloys Through Metavalent Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A common denominator for successful dopants of GeSe is revealed, which is related to metavalent bonding. These dopants can simply be identified in a chemical bonding map. The metavalently bonded GeSe shows strong lattice anharmonicity, a low band effective mass, and a large Fermi surface complexity factor, leading to significantly improved thermoelectric performance.








Abstract
Doping is usually the first step to tailor thermoelectrics. It enables precise control of the charge&#8208;carrier concentration and concomitant transport properties. Doping should also turn GeSe, which features an intrinsically a low carrier concentration, into a competitive thermoelectric. Yet, elemental doping fails to improve the carrier concentration. In contrast, alloying with Ag&#8211;V&#8211;VI2 compounds causes a remarkable enhancement of thermoelectric performance. This advance is closely related to a transition in the bonding mechanism, as evidenced by sudden changes in the optical dielectric constant &#949;&#8734;, the Born effective charge, the maximum of the optical absorption &#949;2(&#969;), and the bond&#8208;breaking behavior. These property changes are indicative of the formation of metavalent bonding (MVB), leading to an octahedral&#8208;like atomic arrangement. MVB is accompanied by a thermoelectric&#8208;favorable band structure featuring anisotropic bands with small effective masses and a large degeneracy. A quantum&#8208;mechanical map, which distinguishes different types of chemical bonding, reveals that orthorhombic GeSe employs covalent bonding, while rhombohedral and cubic GeSe utilize MVB. The transition from covalent to MVB goes along with a pronounced improvement in thermoelectric performance. The failure or success of different dopants can be explained by this concept, which redefines doping rules and provides a &#8220;treasure map&#8221; to tailor p&#8208;bonded chalcogenides.

A quantum-mechanical map, which distinguishes different types of chemical bonding, reveals that orthorhombic GeSe employs covalent bonding, while rhombohedral and cubic GeSe utilize MVB. The transition from covalent to MVB goes along with a pronounced improvement in thermoelectric performance. The failure or success of different dopants can be explained by this concept, which redefines doping rules and provides a &#8220;treasure map&#8221; to tailor p-bonded chalcogenides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lithium&#8208;Induced Optimization Mechanism for an Ultrathin&#8208;Strut Biodegradable Zn&#8208;Based Vascular Scaffold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin&#8208;strut (&#8804;70&#160;&#181;m) design in durable metallic vascular stents remains challengeable in biodegradable scaffolds. In this work, a zinc&#8208;based scaffold with a 65&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick strut and adequate radial force isn achieved via introducing trace amounts of lithium (Li). The scaffold's ultrafine microstructure, which contains nanoscale Li&#8208;containing phases, alters its biodegradable behavior and enhances its biofunction for vessel healing.








Abstract
To reduce incidences of in&#8208;stent restenosis and thrombosis, the use of a thinner&#8208;strut stent has been clinically proven to be effective. Therefore, the contemporary trend is toward the use of ultrathin&#8208;strut (&#8804;70&#160;&#181;m) designs for durable stents. However, stents made from biodegradable platforms have failed to achieve intergenerational breakthroughs due to their excessively thick struts. Here, microalloying is used to create an ultrathin&#8208;strut (65&#160;&#181;m) zinc (Zn) scaffold with modified biodegradation behavior and improved biofunction, by adding lithium (Li). The scaffold backbone consists of an ultrafine&#8208;grained Zn matrix (average grain diameter 2.28&#160;&#181;m) with uniformly distributed nanoscale Li&#8208;containing phases. Grain refinement and precipitation strengthening enable it to achieve twice the radial strength with only 40% of the strut thickness of the pure Zn scaffold. Adding Li alters the thermodynamic formation pathways of products during scaffold biodegradation, creating an alkaline microenvironment. Li2CO3&#160;may actively stabilize this microenvironment due to its higher solubility and better buffering capability than Zn products. The co&#8208;release of ionic zinc and lithium enhances the beneficial differential effects on activities of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, resulting in good endothelialization and limited intimal hyperplasia in porcine coronary arteries. The findings here may break the predicament of the next&#8208;generation biodegradable scaffolds.

         <title>Supporting Trimetallic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks on S/N&#8208;Doped Carbon Macroporous Fibers for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trimetallic metal&#8208;organic frameworks supported over the hollow S/N&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (S/N&#8208;CMF@FexCoyNi1&#8208;x&#8208;y&#8208;MOF) are prepared as a promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefiting from the trimetallic composition with improved intrinsic activity, hollow S/N&#8208;CMF matrix facilitating active sites exposure, as well as their robust integration, the resultant S/N&#8208;CMF@FexCoyNi1&#8208;x&#8208;y&#8208;MOF electrocatalyst delivers excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 296&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, a Tafel slope of 53.5&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1, and outstanding durability.








Abstract
Hybrid materials, integrating the merits of individual components, are ideal structures for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the rational construction of hybrid structures with decent physical/electrochemical properties is yet challenging. Herein, a promising OER electrocatalyst composed of trimetallic metal&#8208;organic frameworks supported over S/N&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (S/N&#8208;CMF@FexCoyNi1&#8208;x&#8208;y&#8208;MOF) via a cation&#8208;exchange strategy is delicately fabricated. Benefiting from the trimetallic composition with improved intrinsic activity, hollow S/N&#8208;CMF matrix facilitating exposure of active sites, as well as their robust integration, the resultant S/N&#8208;CMF@FexCoyNi1&#8208;x&#8208;y&#8208;MOF electrocatalyst delivers outstanding activity and stability for alkaline OER. Specifically, it needs an overpotential of 296&#160;mV to reach the benchmark current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a small Tafel slope of 53.5&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1. In combination with X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, the post&#8208;formed Fe/Co&#8208;doped &#947;&#8208;NiOOH during the OER operation is revealed to account for the high OER performance of S/N&#8208;CMF@FexCoyNi1&#8208;x&#8208;y&#8208;MOF.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Incorporated Mg&#8208;Ion Solvation Modulation Enables Fast Magnesium Storage Kinetics of Conversion&#8208;Type Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of the trifluoromethanesulfonate anion in the Mg&#8208;ion solvation structure of the borate&#8208;based Mg&#8208;ion electrolyte enables the fast magnesium storage kinetics of the conversion&#8208;type cathode materials. The as&#8208;prepared copper selenide cathode achieved a more than twofold capacity increase at a high rate and the highest reversible capacities compared to those of the previously reported metal selenide cathodes.








Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMB) have emerged as one of the most promising alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to the prominent advantages of magnesium metal anodes. Nevertheless, their application is hindered by sluggish Mg&#8208;ion storage kinetics in cathodes, although various structural modifications of cathode materials have been performed. Herein, an electrolyte design using an anion&#8208;incorporated Mg&#8208;ion solvation structure is developed to promote the Mg&#8208;ion storage reactions of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials. The addition of the trifluoromethanesulfonate anion (OTf&#8722;) in the ether&#8208;based Mg&#8208;ion electrolyte modulates the solvation structure of Mg2+ from [Mg(DME)3]2+ to [Mg(DME)2.5OTf]+ (DME = dimethoxy ethane), which facilitates Mg&#8208;ion desolvation and thus significantly expedites the charge transfer of the cathode material. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared CuSe cathode material on copper current collector exhibits a considerable increase in magnesium storage capacity from 61% (228 mAh g&#8208;1) to 95% (357 mAh g&#8208;1) of the theoretical capacity at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 and a more than twofold capacity increase at a high current density of 1.0 A g&#8208;1. This work provides an efficient strategy via electrolyte modulation to achieve high&#8208;rate conversion&#8208;type cathode materials for RMBs. The incorporation of the trifluoromethanesulfonate anion in the Mg&#8208;ion solvation structure of the borate&#8208;based Mg&#8208;ion electrolyte enables the fast magnesium storage kinetics of the conversion&#8208;type cathode materials.

         <title>Multileveled Hierarchical Hydrogel with Continuous Biophysical and Biochemical Gradients for Enhanced Repair of Full&#8208;Thickness Osteochondral Defect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multileveled continuous gradient hydrogel is developed by inserting gradedly distributed MagHA, mechanical, and magnetism gradients simultaneously in double&#8208;network (DN) hydrogel via a brief exposure of a magneto field using the computed and optimized parameter. Such gradient hierarchically triggers bi&#8208;directional (cartilage&#8208;subchondral bone) differentiation and extracellular matrix (ECM) rearrangement to repair full&#8208;thickness osteochondral tissue.








Abstract
The repair of hierarchical osteochondral defect requires sophisticated gradient reestablishment; however, few strategies for continuous gradient casting consider the relevance to clinical practice regarding cell adaptability, multiple gradient elements, and precise gradient mirroring native tissue. Here, a hydrogel with continuous gradients in nano&#8208;hydroxyapatite (HA) content, mechanical, and magnetism is developed using synthesized superparamagnetic HA nanorods (MagHA) that easily respond to a brief magnetic field. To precisely reconstruct osteochondral tissue, the optimized gradient mode is calculated according to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of healthy rabbit knees. Then, MagHA are patterned to form continuous biophysical and biochemical gradients, consequently generating incremental HA, mechanical, and electromagnetic cues under an external magnetic stimulus. To make such depth&#8208;dependent biocues work, an adaptable hydrogel is developed to facilitate cell infiltration. Furthermore, this approach is applied in rabbit full&#8208;thickness osteochondral defects equipped with a local magnetic field. Surprisingly, this multileveled gradient composite hydrogel repairs osteochondral unit in a perfect heterogeneous feature, which mimics the gradual cartilage&#8208;to&#8208;subchondral transition.

     alt="Multileveled Hierarchical Hydrogel with Continuous Biophysical and Biochemical Gradients for Enhanced Repair of Full-Thickness Osteochondral Defect"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multileveled continuous gradient hydrogel is developed by inserting gradedly distributed MagHA, mechanical, and magnetism gradients simultaneously in double-network (DN) hydrogel via a brief exposure of a magneto field using the computed and optimized parameter. Such gradient hierarchically triggers bi-directional (cartilage-subchondral bone) differentiation and extracellular matrix (ECM) rearrangement to repair full-thickness osteochondral tissue.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repair of hierarchical osteochondral defect requires sophisticated gradient reestablishment; however, few strategies for continuous gradient casting consider the relevance to clinical practice regarding cell adaptability, multiple gradient elements, and precise gradient mirroring native tissue. Here, a hydrogel with continuous gradients in nano-hydroxyapatite (HA) content, mechanical, and magnetism is developed using synthesized superparamagnetic HA nanorods (MagHA) that easily respond to a brief magnetic field. To precisely reconstruct osteochondral tissue, the optimized gradient mode is calculated according to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of healthy rabbit knees. Then, MagHA are patterned to form continuous biophysical and biochemical gradients, consequently generating incremental HA, mechanical, and electromagnetic cues under an external magnetic stimulus. To make such depth-dependent biocues work, an adaptable hydrogel is developed to facilitate cell infiltration. Furthermore, this approach is applied in rabbit full-thickness osteochondral defects equipped with a local magnetic field. Surprisingly, this multileveled gradient composite hydrogel repairs osteochondral unit in a perfect heterogeneous feature, which mimics the gradual cartilage-to-subchondral transition. Collectively, this is the first study that combines an adaptable hydrogel with magneto-driven MagHA gradients to achieve promising outcomes in osteochondral regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Regulated 2D ReSe2: A Universal Platform Boostin Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;level regulated ReSe2 nanosheets serve as the general platform to significantly advance the photocatalytic H2 evolution on various semiconductors, such as TiO2, CdS, ZnIn2S4, and C3N4. The outstanding activity is attributed to the existence of abundant Re/Se active sites and strongly coupled interface between atomic&#8208;level regulated ReSe2 and the semiconductor photocatalyst.








Abstract
Solar hydrogen (H2) generation via photocatalytic water splitting is practically promising, environmentally benign, and sustainably carbon neutral. It is important therefore to understand how to controllably engineer photocatalysts at the atomic level. In this work, atomic&#8208;level engineering of defected ReSe2 nanosheets (NSs) is reported to significantly boost photocatalytic H2 evolution on various semiconductor photocatalysts including TiO2, CdS, ZnIn2S4, and C3N4. Advanced characterizations, such as atomic&#8208;resolution aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC&#8208;STEM), synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transient&#8208;state surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy, and transient&#8208;state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, together with theoretical computations confirm that the strongly coupled ReSe2/TiO2 interface and substantial atomic&#8208;level active sites of defected ReSe2 NSs result in the significantly raised activity of ReSe2/TiO2. This work not only for the first time realizes the atomic&#8208;level engineering of ReSe2 NSs as a versatile platform to significantly raise the activities on different photocatalysts, but, more importantly, underscores the immense importance of atomic&#8208;level synthesis and exploration on 2D materials for energy conversion and storage.

         <title>Ethanol&#8208;Induced Ni2+&#8208;Intercalated Cobalt Organic Frameworks on Vanadium Pentoxide for Synergistically Enhancing the Performance of 3D&#8208;Printed Micro&#8208;Supercapacitors</title>

The hollow structure is synthesized by controlling the amount of Ni doping by using the different coordination abilities of Ni2+ and Co2+ with N and O atoms and the incompatibility between the d8 electronic configuration of Ni2+ and the 3D structure of ZIF&#8208;67. The composite material applied to 3D printing micro supercapacitor has excellent specific capacitance and energy density.








Abstract
The synthesis of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanocomposites with high energy density and excellent mechanical strength is limited by the degree of lattice matching and crystal surface structure. In this study, dodecahedral ZIF&#8208;67 is synthesized uniformly on vanadium pentoxide nanowires. The influence of the coordination mode on the surface of ZIF&#8208;67 in ethanol is also investigated. Benefitting from the different coordination abilities of Ni2+, Co2+, and N atoms, spatially separated surface&#8208;active sites are created through metal&#8208;ion exchange. Furthermore, the incompatibility between the d8 electronic configuration of Ni2+ and the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structure of ZIF&#8208;67 afforded the synthesis of hollow structures by controlling the amount of Ni doping. The formation of NiCo&#8208;MOF@CoOOH@V2O5 nanocomposites is confirmed using X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis. The high performance of the obtained composite is illustrated by fabricating a 3D&#8208;printed micro&#8208;supercapacitor, exhibiting a high area specific capacitance of 585 mF cm&#8722;2 and energy density of 159.23 &#181;Wh cm&#8722;2 (at power density = 0.34&#160;mW cm&#8722;2). The solvent/coordination tuning strategy demonstrated in this study provides a new direction for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance nanomaterials for electrochemical energy storage applications.

         <title>Fibro&#8208;Gel: An All&#8208;Aqueous Hydrogel Consisting of Microfibers with Tunable Release Profile and its Application in Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable fibro&#8208;gel with controllable physicochemical properties and tunable drug release rates is demonstrated. The release of distinct drugs at different rates from fibro&#8208;gels can accelerate wound healing with high efficiency. These properties enable precise tailoring of the fibro&#8208;gel for potential applications, such as in situ tissue engineering.








Abstract
Injectable hydrogels are valuable tools in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine due to their unique advantages of injectability with minimal invasiveness and usability for irregularly shaped sites. However, it remains challenging to achieve scalable manufacturing together with matching physicochemical properties and on&#8208;demand drug release for a high level of control over biophysical and biomedical cues to direct endogenous cells. Here, the use of an injectable fibro&#8208;gel is demonstrated, a water&#8208;filled network of entangled hydrogel microfibers, whose physicochemical properties and drug release profiles can be tailored to overcome these shortcomings. This fibro&#8208;gel exhibits favorable in vitro biocompatibility and the capability to aid vascularization. The potential use of the fibro&#8208;gel for advancing tissue regeneration is explored with a mice excision skin model. Preliminary in vivo tests indicate that the fibro&#8208;gel promotes wound healing and new healthy tissue regeneration at a faster rate than a commercial gel. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the release of distinct drugs at different rates can further accelerate wound healing with higher efficiency, by using a two&#8208;layer fibro&#8208;gel model. The combination of injectability and tailorable properties of this fibro&#8208;gel offers a promising approach in biomedical fields such as therapeutic delivery, medical dressings, and 3D tissue scaffolds for tissue engineering.

         <title>2D Nano&#8208;Sonosensitizers Facilitate Energy Transfer to Enhance Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D metal&#8211;organic nano&#8208;sonosensitizers are constructed from photosensitizing iridium&#8208;based linkers and surface&#8208;anchored porphyrin sonosensitizers to absorb high&#8208; and low&#8208;energy regions of sonoluminescence, respectively. The excited iridium&#8208;based linkers undergo triplet&#8211;triplet Dexter energy transfer to porphyrin sonosensitizers for efficient singlet oxygen generation, leading to greatly enhanced sonodynamic therapy efficacy over free sonosensitizers in mouse models of colorectal and breast cancer.








Abstract
Although sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has shown promise for cancer treatment, the lack of efficient sonosensitizers (SSs) has limited the clinical application of SDT. Here, a new strategy is reported for designing efficient nano&#8208;sonosensitizers based on 2D nanoscale metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs). Composed of Hf&#8208;oxo secondary building units (SBUs) and iridium&#8208;based linkers, the MOL is anchored with 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetra(p&#8208;benzoato)porphyrin (TBP) sensitizers on the SBUs to afford TBP@MOL. TBP@MOL shows 14.1&#8208; and 7.4&#8208;fold higher singlet oxygen (1O2) generation than free TBP ligands and Hf&#8208;TBP, a 3D nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework, respectively. The 1O2 generation of TBP@MOL is enhanced by isolating TBP SSs on the SBUs of the MOL, which prevents&#160;aggregation&#8208;induced quenching of the excited sensitizers, and by triplet&#8211;triplet Dexter energy transfer between excited iridium&#8208;based linkers and TBP SSs, which more efficiently harnesses broad&#8208;spectrum sonoluminescence. Anchoring TBP on the MOL surface also enhances the energy transfer between the excited sensitizer and ground&#8208;state triplet oxygen to increase 1O2 generation efficacy. In mouse models of colorectal and breast cancer, TBP@MOL demonstrates significantly higher SDT efficacy than Hf&#8208;TBP and TBP. This work uncovers a new strategy to design effective nano&#8208;sonosensitizers by facilitating energy transfer to efficiently capture broad&#8208;spectrum sonoluminescence and enhance 1O2 generation.

&lt;p&gt;2D metal&#8211;organic nano-sonosensitizers are constructed from photosensitizing iridium-based linkers and surface-anchored porphyrin sonosensitizers to absorb high- and low-energy regions of sonoluminescence, respectively. The excited iridium-based linkers undergo triplet&#8211;triplet Dexter energy transfer to porphyrin sonosensitizers for efficient singlet oxygen generation, leading to greatly enhanced sonodynamic therapy efficacy over free sonosensitizers in mouse models of colorectal and breast cancer.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has shown promise for cancer treatment, the lack of efficient sonosensitizers (SSs) has limited the clinical application of SDT. Here, a new strategy is reported for designing efficient nano-sonosensitizers based on 2D nanoscale metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs). Composed of Hf-oxo secondary building units (SBUs) and iridium-based linkers, the MOL is anchored with 5,10,15,20-tetra(&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-benzoato)porphyrin (TBP) sensitizers on the SBUs to afford TBP@MOL. TBP@MOL shows 14.1- and 7.4-fold higher singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) generation than free TBP ligands and Hf-TBP, a 3D nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework, respectively. The &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation of TBP@MOL is enhanced by isolating TBP SSs on the SBUs of the MOL, which prevents&#160;aggregation-induced quenching of the excited sensitizers, and by triplet&#8211;triplet Dexter energy transfer between excited iridium-based linkers and TBP SSs, which more efficiently harnesses broad-spectrum sonoluminescence. Anchoring TBP on the MOL surface also enhances the energy transfer between the excited sensitizer and ground-state triplet oxygen to increase &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation efficacy. In mouse models of colorectal and breast cancer, TBP@MOL demonstrates significantly higher SDT efficacy than Hf-TBP and TBP. This work uncovers a new strategy to design effective nano-sonosensitizers by facilitating energy transfer to efficiently capture broad-spectrum sonoluminescence and enhance &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Whole&#8208;Course&#8208;Repair System Based on Neurogenesis&#8208;Angiogenesis Crosstalk and Macrophage Reprogramming Promotes Diabetic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined neurogenesis&#8208;angiogenesis crosstalk and macrophage reprogramming can pave way for the next generation of regenerative hydrogels to accelerate the recovery of chronic wounds. The work presents a novel approach to deliver drug&#8208;loaded extracellular vesicles and magnesium ions by an in situ injectable hydrogel for concurrent supportive cycles of neurogenesis&#8208;angiogenesis under a favorable immune&#8208;microenvironment to heal diabetic wounds.








Abstract
Diabetic wound (DW) therapy is currently a big challenge in medicine and strategies to enhance neurogenesis and angiogenesis have appeared to be a promising direction. However, the current treatments have failed to coordinate neurogenesis and angiogenesis simultaneously, leading to an increased disability rate caused by DWs. Herein, a whole&#8208;course&#8208;repair system is introduced by a hydrogel to concurrently achieve a mutually supportive cycle of neurogenesis&#8208;angiogenesis under a favorable immune&#8208;microenvironment. This hydrogel can first be one&#8208;step packaged in a syringe for later in situ local injections to cover wounds long&#8208;termly for accelerated wound healing via the synergistic effect of magnesium ions (Mg2+) and engineered small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). The self&#8208;healing and bio&#8208;adhesive properties of the hydrogel make it an ideal physical barrier for DWs. At the inflammation stage, the formulation can recruit bone marrow&#8208;derived mesenchymal stem cells to the wound sites and stimulate them toward neurogenic differentiation, while providing a favorable immune microenvironment via macrophage reprogramming. At the proliferation stage of wound repair, robust angiogenesis occurs by the synergistic effect of the newly differentiated neural cells and the released Mg2+, allowing a regenerative neurogenesis&#8208;angiogenesis cycle to take place at the wound site. This whole&#8208;course&#8208;repair system provides a novel platform for combined DW therapy.

Multiplexed Cell Capture
Harvesting cells from biomaterials for downstream analysis without perturbing their state represents an outstanding challenge in 3D/4D culture and tissue engineering. In article number 2209904, Cole A. DeForest and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that engineered sortase transpeptidases can be used to selectively degrade and recover single&#8208;cell suspensions from specific subvolumes of hydrogel multimaterials, permitting multiplexed cell capture with largely &#8220;biologically invisible&#8221; cues.

Exotic Superconductivity
In article number 2207841, Fucong Fei, Zhicheng Zhong, Fengqi Song, Xuefeng Wang, and co&#8208;workers report boosted superconductivity with a transition temperature of about 7.5 K in Ta&#8208;doped MoTe2 single crystals under ambient pressure. An enhanced upper critical field beyond the Pauli limit is also observed in Ta&#8208;doped Weyl semimetal Td&#8208;MoTe2, which is likely due to the mixed singlet&#8211;triplet superconductivity.

Antibacterial Surfaces
In article number 2212315, Guomin Wang, Kaiwei Tang, Jianzhong Du, Paul K. Chu, and co&#8208;workers report a titanium nitride nanowire coating synthesized by a liquid&#8208;phase oxidation process and nitridation. The charged surfaces kill bacteria by exerting electro&#8211;mechanical forces, piercing the bacterial membrane and disturbing the electron balance. This work provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance antibacterial interfaces with clinical applications.

Volumetric 3D Printing
In volumetric 3D printing, the whole 3D object is developed simultaneously (i.e., volume&#8208;at&#8208;once) by means of light&#8208;induced crosslinking of a (rotating) liquid resin, as reported by Sandra Van Vlierberghe and co&#8208;workers in article number 2210136. The 3D&#8208;structure illustrated in the image is based on the chemical network structure of the reported thiol&#8211;ene crosslinked poly(caprolactone) (PCL) network, which can be considered a homogeneous 3D network consisting of telechelic alkene&#8208;functionalized PCL and tetra&#8208;functional thiol crosslinker junctions.

This review discusses the present state and future direction of soft robotic biomedical devices in supporting the inotropic function of the heart, focusing on electrothermally artificial heart muscles. The current state of the ventricular assist devices and the key factors for the development of a full soft robotic ventricular assist device were discussed.








Abstract
Medical soft robotics constitutes a rapidly developing field in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, with a promising future for millions of patients suffering from heart failure worldwide. Herein, the present state and future direction of artificial muscle&#8208;based soft robotic biomedical devices in supporting the inotropic function of the heart are reviewed, focusing on the emerging electrothermally artificial heart muscles (AHMs). Artificial muscle powered soft robotic devices can mimic the action of complex biological systems such as heart compression and twisting. These artificial muscles possess the ability to undergo complex deformations, aiding cardiac function while maintaining a limited weight and use of space. Two very promising candidates for artificial muscles are electrothermally actuated AHMs and biohybrid actuators using living cells or tissue embedded with artificial structures. Electrothermally actuated AHMs have demonstrated superior force generation while creating the prospect for fully soft robotic actuated ventricular assist devices. This review will critically analyze the limitations of currently available devices and discuss opportunities and directions for future research. Last, the properties of the cardiac muscle are reviewed and compared with those of different materials suitable for mechanical cardiac compression.

         <title>Shaping a Soft Future: Patterning Liquid Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shaping liquid metals down to the sub&#8208;micrometer scale has enabled a wide range of novel soft and stretchable devices. This review highlights patterning techniques such as injection/vacuum filling, direct ink writing, selective adhesion, and stenciling. Applications are highlighted, followed by a summary of present&#8208;day challenges and opportunities for future development.








Abstract
This review highlights the unique techniques for patterning liquid metals containing gallium (e.g., eutectic gallium indium, EGaIn). These techniques are enabled by two unique attributes of these liquids relative to solid metals: 1) The fluidity of the metal allows it to be injected, sprayed, and generally dispensed. 2) The solid native oxide shell allows the metal to adhere to surfaces and be shaped in ways that would normally be prohibited due to surface tension. The ability to shape liquid metals into non&#8208;spherical structures such as wires, antennas, and electrodes can enable fluidic metallic conductors for stretchable electronics, soft robotics, e&#8208;skins, and wearables. The key properties of these metals with a focus on methods to pattern liquid metals into soft or stretchable devices are summari.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Based Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese&#8208;based nanomaterials have unique features to be used in tumor traceable immunotherapy in the form of nanocarriers, immunomodulators, and immunoactivators. This review focuses on the recent progress of Mn&#8208;based immunotherapy, including immunotherapy alone, immunotherapy&#8208;involved multimodal synergistic therapy, and imaging&#8208;guided immunotherapy. It is highly anticipated that Mn&#8208;based immunotherapy can open up a promising avenue in nanomedicine.








Abstract
As an essential micronutrient, manganese (Mn) participates in various physiological processes and plays important roles in host immune system, hematopoiesis, endocrine function, and oxidative stress regulation. Mn&#8208;based nanoparticles are considered to be biocompatible and show versatile applications in nanomedicine, in particular utilized in tumor immunotherapy in the following ways: 1) acting as a biocompatible nanocarrier to deliver immunotherapeutic agents for tumor immunotherapy; 2) serving as an adjuvant to regulate tumor immune microenvironment and enhance immunotherapy; 3) activating host's immune system through the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway to trigger tumor immunotherapy; 4) real&#8208;time monitoring tumor immunotherapy effect by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) since Mn2+ ions are ideal MRI contrast agent which can significantly enhance the T1&#8208;weighted MRI signal after binding to proteins. This comprehensive review focuses on the most recent progress of Mn&#8208;based nanoplatforms in tumor immunotherapy. The characteristics of Mn are first discussed to guide the design of Mn&#8208;based multifunctional nanoplatforms. Then the biomedical applications of Mn&#8208;based nanoplatforms, including immunotherapy alone, immunotherapy&#8208;involved multimodal synergistic therapy, and imaging&#8208;guided immunotherapy are discussed in detail. Finally, the challenges and future developments of Mn&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy are highlighted.

     alt="Manganese-Based Tumor Immunotherapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manganese-based nanomaterials have unique features to be used in tumor traceable immunotherapy in the form of nanocarriers, immunomodulators, and immunoactivators. This review focuses on the recent progress of Mn-based immunotherapy, including immunotherapy alone, immunotherapy-involved multimodal synergistic therapy, and imaging-guided immunotherapy. It is highly anticipated that Mn-based immunotherapy can open up a promising avenue in nanomedicine.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an essential micronutrient, manganese (Mn) participates in various physiological processes and plays important roles in host immune system, hematopoiesis, endocrine function, and oxidative stress regulation. Mn-based nanoparticles are considered to be biocompatible and show versatile applications in nanomedicine, in particular utilized in tumor immunotherapy in the following ways: 1) acting as a biocompatible nanocarrier to deliver immunotherapeutic agents for tumor immunotherapy; 2) serving as an adjuvant to regulate tumor immune microenvironment and enhance immunotherapy; 3) activating host's immune system through the cGAS-STING pathway to trigger tumor immunotherapy; 4) real-time monitoring tumor immunotherapy effect by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) since Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are ideal MRI contrast agent which can significantly enhance the &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted MRI signal after binding to proteins. This comprehensive review focuses on the most recent progress of Mn-based nanoplatforms in tumor immunotherapy. The characteristics of Mn are first discussed to guide the design of Mn-based multifunctional nanoplatforms. Then the biomedical applications of Mn-based nanoplatforms, including immunotherapy alone, immunotherapy-involved multimodal synergistic therapy, and imaging-guided immunotherapy are discussed in detail. Finally, the challenges and future developments of Mn-based tumor immunotherapy are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Recent advances on lactate oxidase (LOx)&#8208;based biosensors are summarized, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)&#8208;based, oxygen (O2)2&#8208;based, pH&#8208;sensitive, and electrochemical, for cancer diagnosis, and various LOx&#8208;based cancer therapy strategies, including lactate&#8208;depletion&#8208;based metabolic cancer therapy/immunotherapy, hypoxia&#8208;activated chemotherapy, H2O2&#8208;based chemodynamic therapy, and multimodal synergistic cancer therapy, are discussed.








Abstract
Lactate oxidase (LOx) has attracted extensive interest in cancer diagnosis and therapy in recent years owing to its specific catalysis on l&#8208;lactate; its catalytic process consumes oxygen (O2) and generates a large amount of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and pyruvate. Given high levels of lactate in tumor tissues and its tight correlation with tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence, LOx&#8208;based biosensors including H2O2&#8208;based, O2&#8208;based, pH&#8208;sensitive, and electrochemical have been designed for cancer diagnosis, and various LOx&#8208;based cancer therapy strategies including lactate&#8208;depletion&#8208;based metabolic cancer therapy/immunotherapy, hypoxia&#8208;activated chemotherapy, H2O2&#8208;based chemodynamic therapy, and multimodal synergistic cancer therapy have also been developed. In this review, the lactate&#8208;specific catalytic properties of LOx are introduced, and the recent advances on LOx&#8208;instructed cancer diagnostic or therapeutic platforms and corresponding biological applications are summarized. Additionally, the challenges and potential of LOx&#8208;based nanomedicines are highlighted.

Research on all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries is currently transitioning from lab&#8208;scale fundamental study to industry&#8208;scale application research. This review provides a timely summary of the current progress on inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolyte&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells, analyzes their technical challenges, and outlines future research targets for realizing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;ion and lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries have piqued global research interest because of their unprecedented safety and high energy density. Significant advances have been made in achieving high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity and good air stability of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs), mitigating the challenges at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, and developing feasible manufacturing processes. Along with the advances in fundamental study, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells using inorganic SSEs have been widely demonstrated, revealing their immense potential for industrialization. This review provides an overview of inorganic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells, focusing on ultrathin SSE membranes, sheet&#8208;type thick solid&#8208;state electrodes, and bipolar stacking. Moreover, several critical parameters directly influencing the energy density of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;ion and lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cells are outlined. Finally, perspectives on all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells are provided and specific metrics to meet certain energy density targets are specified. This review looks to facilitate the development of inorganic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells with high energy density and excellent safety.

         <title>Semiconductor Thermal and Electrical Properties Decoupled by Localized Phonon Resonances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity of semiconductor membranes is reduced by coupling heat&#8208;carrying phonons with localized phonon resonances in deposited nanopillars. This full&#8208;spectrum resonance&#8208;hybridization mechanism decouples the electrical properties of the membrane from its thermal properties, paving the way for novel thermoelectric materials and device designs. The experimental results are a manifestation of nanophononic metamaterial effects previously shown in molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations.








Abstract
Thermoelectric materials convert heat into electricity through thermally driven charge transport in solids or vice versa for cooling. To compete with conventional energy&#8208;conversion technologies, a thermoelectric material must possess the properties of both an electrical conductor and a thermal insulator.&#160;However, these properties are normally mutually exclusive because of the interconnection between scattering mechanisms for charge carriers and phonons. Recent theoretical investigations on sub&#8208;device scales have revealed that nanopillars attached to a membrane exhibit a multitude of local phonon resonances, spanning the full spectrum, that couple with the heat&#8208;carrying phonons in the membrane and cause a reduction in the in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity, with no expected change in the electrical properties because the nanopillars are outside the pathway of voltage generation and charge transport. Here this effect is demonstrated experimentally for the first time by investigating device&#8208;scale suspended silicon membranes with GaN nanopillars grown on the surface. The nanopillars cause up to 21% reduction in the thermal conductivity while the power factor remains unaffected, thus demonstrating an unprecedented decoupling in the semiconductor's thermoelectric properties.&#160;The measured thermal conductivity behavior for coalesced nanopillars and corresponding lattice&#8208;dynamics calculations provide evidence that the reductions are mechanistically tied to the phonon resonances. This finding paves the way for high&#8208;efficiency solid&#8208;state energy recovery and cooling.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moisture&#8208;enabled electric generation (MEG) has been attracting much attention over the past few years due to the merits of simple device structure and outstanding electric performance, as well as the green&#8208;energy feature. The evolvement and development of MEG are summarized in a chronological order. The mechanism of MEG, optimization strategies, and promising applications are reviewed and discussed in detail.








Abstract
Water utilization is accompanied with the development of human beings, whereas gaseous moisture is usually regarded as an underexploited resource. The advances of highly efficient hygroscopic materials endow atmospheric water harvesting as an intriguing solution to convert moisture into clean water. The discovery of hygroelectricity, which refers to the charge buildup at a material surface dependent on humidity, and the following moisture&#8208;enabled electric generation (MEG) realizes energy conversion and directly outputs electricity. Much progress has been made since then to optimize MEG performance, pushing forward the applications of MEG into a practical level. Herein, the evolvement and development of MEG are systematically summarized in a chronological order. The optimization strategies of MEG are discussed and comprehensively evaluated. Then, the latest applications of MEG are presented, including high&#8208;performance powering units and self&#8208;powered devices. In the end, a perspective on the future development of MEG is given for inspiring more researchers into this promising area.

Recent advances in long&#8208;pulsed organic lasers are comprehensively summarized with respect to molecular designs, optical&#8208;resonator architectures, triplet scavenging, and potential triplet&#8208;contribution strategies. Future directions and perspectives for CW operation are discussed.








Abstract
A continuous&#8208;wave (CW) organic solid&#8208;state laser is highly desirable for spectroscopy, sensing, and communications, but is a significant challenge in optoelectronics. The accumulation of long&#8208;lived triplet excitons and relevant excited&#8208;state absorptions, as well as singlet&#8211;triplet annihilation, are the main obstacles to CW lasing. Here, progress in singlet&#8208; and triplet&#8208;state utilizations in organic gain media is reviewed to reveal the issues in working with triplets. Then, exciton behaviors that inhibit light oscillations during long excitation pulses are discussed. Further, recent advances in increasing organic lasing pulse widths from microseconds toward the indication of CW operation are summarized with respect to molecular designs, advanced resonator architectures, triplet scavenging, and potential triplet contribution strategies. Finally, future directions and perspectives are proposed for achieving stable CW organic lasers with significant triplet contribution.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Dual&#8208;Emitting Luminescence of a Spiropyran&#8208;Encapsulated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Dynamic Information Encryption</title>

A novel photo&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive dual&#8208;emitting luminescent material ZJU&#8208;128&#8835;SP is obtained by encapsulating spiropyran molecules into a cadmium&#8208;based MOF,&#160;ZJU&#8208;128. ZJU&#8208;128&#8835;SP exhibits a switchable dynamic fluorescent behavior under alternating UV&#8208; and visible&#8208;light irradiation, enabling its good potential applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and multiplexed coding.








Abstract
The development of photo&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent materials is essential to address emerging demands in encryption security. Here, a novel photo&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive dual&#8208;emitting luminescent material ZJU&#8208;128&#8835;SP (SP = spiropyran) is reported, which is obtained by encapsulating spiropyran molecules into a cadmium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), [Cd3(TCPP)2]&#183;4DMF&#183;4H2O (ZJU&#8208;128, H4TCPP = 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)pyrazine). This MOF/dye composite ZJU&#8208;128&#8835;SP exhibits a blue emission from the ligand of ZJU&#8208;128 at 447&#160;nm and a red emission around 650&#160;nm from spiropyran. Utilizing the photoisomerization of spiropyran from ring&#8208;closed to ring&#8208;open form under UV&#8208;light irradiation, significant fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process between ZJU&#8208;128 and spiropyran is achieved. As a result, the blue emission of ZJU&#8208;128 is gradually decreased while the red emission of spiropyran increases. This dynamic fluorescent&#160;behavior can fully recover to the original state following exposure to visible light (&gt;405&#160;nm). By taking advantage of the time&#8208;dependent fluorescence, dynamical anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns and multiplexed coding are successfully developed based on ZJU&#8208;128&#8835;SP film. This work provides an inspiring point for the design of information encryption materials with higher security requirements.

         <title>Programming 3D Curves with Discretely Constrained Cylindrical Inflatables</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inverse design method is proposed that outputs geometric parameters for patch&#8208;clad cylindrical inflatables such that they match target 3D curves. The approach uses an initial conceptual solution based on curve kinematics to seed a finite element simulation nested within an optimization algorithm, resulting in excellent curve matching. Demonstrations showcase the utility of bespoke 3D inflatables for robotics applications.








Abstract
Programming inflatable systems to deform to desired 3D&#160;shapes opens up multifarious applications in robotics, morphing architecture, and interventional medicine. This work elicits complex deformations by attaching discrete strain limiters to cylindrical hyperelastic inflatables. Using this system, a method is presented to solve the inverse problem of programming myriad 3D centerline curves upon inflation. The method entails two steps: first, a reduced&#8208;order model generates a conceptual solution giving coarse indications of strain limiter placement on the undeformed cylindrical inflatable. This low&#8208;fidelity solution then seeds a finite element simulation nested within an optimization loop to further tune strain limiter parameters.&#160;We&#160;leverage this framework to achieve functionality through a priori programmed deformations of cylindrical inflatables, including 3D curve matching, self&#8208;tying knotting, and manipulation. The results hold broad significance for the emerging computational design of inflatable systems.

Aiming to solve the trade&#8208;off of &#8220;room&#8208;temperature phosphoresence (RTP)&#8211;flexibility&#8221; in principle,&#160;RTP&#160;crystals with plastic/elastic deformation are achieved by self&#8208;partitioned molecular packing, and&#160;adjusted by the controllable distributions of intermolecular interactions from different directions. An elastic RTP crystal with lifetime of 972.3&#160;ms is achieved as the record, and afterglow delivery is realized by plastic RTP crystals for biomedical optical technology.








Abstract
Aiming to solve the trade&#8208;off of &#8220;room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP)&#8211;flexibility&#8221; in principle, organic RTP crystals with elastic/plastic deformation are realized. These properties are mainly due to the divisional aggregation structures of aromatics and alkoxy chains, and can be modulated by the controllable molecular configurations. The longest RTP lifetime of 972.3&#160;ms is achieved as the highest record for organic flexible crystals. Plastic crystals with persistent RTP are realized, which can be applied into biomedical optical technologies by afterglow delivery. Moreover, the relationship among elastic/plastic deformation, RTP property, and aggregated structures is established. The elastic/plastic deformation is mainly determined by the difference of interaction energies from the aromatics and the alkoxy chains. For the BP&#8208;OR series with twisted configurations, the alkoxy chain with the middle length is favorable for the RTP property, while the strength of the &#960;&#8211;&#960; coupling is the cruical factor to the RTP property of the Xan&#8208;OR series with planar skeletons. A new way to promote the development of flexible RTP crystals, by modulation of aggregated structures as well as rational distribution of intermolecular interactions, is explored.

         <title>Visualizing the Atomic Configuration of Carbonate Groups&#160; in a (Cu,C)Ba2Ca3Cu4O11+&#948; Superconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonates (CO32&#8722;) are always known to suppress superconductivity in oxycarbonate superconductors. By employing integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC), the triangular atomic configuration of carbonates and their alternated spatial arrangement are visualized in (Cu,C)Ba2Ca3Cu4O11+&#948;. Combined with first&#8208;principles calculations, a competitive mechanism is unveiled with the decreased number of charge carriers while the improved flatness in CuO2 layers.








Abstract
Carbonates (CO32&#8722;) have always been known as impurities to degrade the superconductivity in cuprate high&#8208;Tc superconductors. Herein, the atomic arrangement of carbonates is directly visualized in (Cu,C)Ba2Ca3Cu4O11+&#948; via integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC) combined with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art scanning transmission electron microscopy. The carbon atoms replace Cu atoms in the charge&#8208;reservoir layers, contributing to the formation of carbonates through strong orbital hybridization with the surrounding oxygen atoms. Using first&#8208;principles calculations, the spatial configuration of the carbonate groups is confirmed and their influence on the local crystal lattice and electronic states is further investigated. The carbonates not only accommodate distortions by improving the flatness of the outer CuO2 layers but also reduce the density of states at the Fermi level. These two factors play competitive roles to affect the superconductivity. This study provides direct evidence of the presence of CO32&#8722; groups and gains an insight into the underlying mechanism of superconductivity in oxycarbonate superconductors.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Assisted Nanozyme Design: Lessons from Materials and Engineered Enzymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning (ML) shows promising potential for discovering new materials. However, the design of new nanozymes remains challenging. Here, recent advancements in ML&#8208;assisted discovery and design of materials and engineered enzymes is summarized, along with a discussion as to how these successful cases can be implicated in addressing the current problems facing the nanozyme field. The prospective design of nanozymes based on ML technology is also proposed.








Abstract
Nanozymes are nanomaterials that exhibit enzyme&#8208;like biomimicry. In combination with intrinsic characteristics of nanomaterials, nanozymes have broad applicability in materials science, chemical engineering, bioengineering, biochemistry, and disease theranostics. Recently, the heterogeneity of published results has highlighted the complexity and diversity of nanozymes in terms of consistency of catalytic capacity. Machine learning (ML) shows promising potential for discovering new materials, yet it remains challenging for the design of new nanozymes based on ML approaches. Alternatively, ML is employed to promote optimization of intelligent design and application of catalytic materials and engineered enzymes. Incorporation of the successful ML algorithms used in the intelligent design of catalytic materials and engineered enzymes can concomitantly facilitate the guided development of next&#8208;generation nanozymes with desirable properties. Here, recent progress in ML, its utilization in the design of catalytic materials and enzymes, and how emergent ML applications serve as promising strategies to circumvent challenges associated with time&#8208;expensive and laborious testing in nanozyme research and development are summarized. The potential applications of successful examples of ML&#8208;aided catalytic materials and engineered enzymes in nanozyme design are also highlighted, with special focus on the unified aims in enhancing design and recapitulation of substrate selectivity and catalytic activity.

         <title>Hollow Hierarchical Cu2O&#8208;Derived Electrocatalysts Steering CO2 Reduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Chemicals at Low Overpotentials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through rational design of catalyst morphology and elaborate calculations, a heteroseed&#8208;induced crystallization strategy is developed for the synthesis of hollow hierarchical vertex Cu/Cu2O catalysts that can provide intermediate confinement and surface electric field enhancement for CO intermediate dimerization, thereby boosting electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to multi&#8208;carbon products at low overpotentials.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide&#160;into multi&#8208;carbon products (C2+) using renewably generated electricity provides a promising pathway for energy and environmental sustainability. Various oxide&#8208;derived copper (OD&#8208;Cu) catalysts have been showcased, but still require high overpotential to drive C2+ production owing to sluggish carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation and low CO intermediate (*CO) coverage. Here, the dilemma is circumvented by elaborately devising the OD&#8208;Cu morphology. First, computational studies propose a hollow and hierarchical OD&#8208;Cu microstructure that can generate a core&#8211;shell microenvironment to inhibit CO evolution and accelerate *CO dimerization via intermediate confinement and electric field enhancement, thereby boosting C2+ generation. Experimentally, the designed nanoarchitectures are synthesized through a heteroseed&#8208;induced approach followed by electrochemical activation. In situ spectroscopic studies further elaborate correlation between *CO dimerization and designed architectures. Remarkably, the hierarchical OD&#8208;Cu manifests morphology&#8208;dependent selectivity of CO2 reduction, giving a C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 75.6% at a considerably positive potential of &#8722;0.55&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode.

         <title>The Myth of &#8220;Metavalency&#8221; in Phase&#8208;Change Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unusual properties of phase&#8208;change materials have been related to the presence of a &#8220;unique,&#8221; &#8220;fundamentally different,&#8221; and &#8220;unconventional&#8221; bonding mechanism, &#8220;metavalency.&#8221; However, bonding in these materials involves just two types of covalent bond: two&#8208;center, two&#8208;electron (2c&#8208;2e) and electron&#8208;rich multicenter (3c&#8208;4e) bonds involving lone&#8208;pair electrons.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;change memory materials (PCMs) have unusual properties and important applications, and recent efforts to find improved materials have focused on their bonding mechanisms. &#8220;Metavalent bonding&#8221; or &#8220;metavalency,&#8221; intermediate between &#8220;metallic&#8221; and &#8220;covalent&#8221; bonding and comprising single&#8208;electron bonds, has been proposed as a fundamentally new mechanism that is relevant both here and for halide perovskite materials. However, it is shown that PCMs, which violate the octet rule, have two types of covalent bond: two&#8208;center, two&#8208;electron (2c&#8208;2e) bonds, and electron&#8208;rich, multicenter bonds (3c&#8208;4e bonds, hyperbonds) involving lone&#8208;pair electrons. The latter have bond orders less than one and are examples of the century&#8208;old concept of &#8220;partial&#8221;&#160;bonds.

         <title>Wetting Effect on Patterned Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Droplet wetting on patterned substrate is addressed by the Cassie&#8211;Wenzel theory (CWT). This review discusses recent applications of CWT and its limitations. Anisotropic wetting effects beyond the scope of CWT are summarized for droplet size comparable to the pattern dimension. An additional focus is placed on the case when droplet partially wets the pore for mechanically patterned substrate.








Abstract
A droplet deposited on a solid substrate leads to the wetting phenomenon. A natural observation is the lotus effect, known for its superhydrophobicity. This special feature is engendered by the structured microstructure of the lotus leaf, namely, surface heterogeneity, as explained by the quintessential Cassie&#8211;Wenzel theory (CWT). In this work, recent designs of functional substrates are overviewed based on the CWT via manipulating the contact area between the liquid and the solid substrate as well as the intrinsic Young's contact angle. Moreover, the limitation of the CWT is discussed. When the droplet size is comparable to the surface heterogeneity, anisotropic wetting morphology often appears, which is beyond the scope of the Cassie&#8211;Wenzel work. In this case, several recent studies addressing the anisotropic wetting effect on chemically and mechanically patterned substrates are elucidated. Surface designs for anisotropic wetting morphologies are summarized with respect to the shape and the arrangement of the surface heterogeneity, the droplet volume, the deposition position of the droplet, as well as the mean curvature of the surface heterogeneity. A thermodynamic interpretation for the wetting effect and the corresponding open questions are presented at the&#160;end.

         <title>A Novel Ultra&#8208;Wideband Electromagnetic&#8208;Wave&#8208;Absorbing Metastructure Inspired by Bionic Gyroid Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Butterfly wings possess strut&#8208;gyroid structural color, which shows that varying structures can reflect differing wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. This property inspires creation of a sheet&#8208;gyroid metastructure for subwavelength electromagnetic wave absorption. By using additive manufacturing and a dipping process, this metastructure is able to achieve broadband absorption from 2 to 40 GHz, with a high level of radiation incident angle and polarization&#8208;resistance.








Abstract
Traditional honeycomb&#8208;like structural electromagnetic (EM)&#8208;wave&#8208;absorbing materials have been widely used in various equipment as multifunctional materials. However, current EM&#8208;wave&#8208;absorbing materials are limited by narrow absorption bandwidths and incidence angles because of their anisotropic structural morphology. The work presented here proposes a novel EM&#8208;wave&#8208;absorbing metastructure with an isotropic morphology inspired by the gyroid microstructures seen in Parides sesostris butterfly wings. A matching redesign methodology between the material and subwavelength scale properties of the gyroid microstructure is proposed, inspired by the interaction mechanism between the microstructure and the material properties on the EM&#8208;wave&#8208;absorption performance of the prepared metastructure. The bioinspired metastructure is fabricated by additive manufacturing (AM) and subsequent coating through dipping processes, filled with dielectric lossy materials. Based on simulations and experiments, the metastructure designed in this work exhibits an ultrawide absorption bandwidth covering the frequency range of 2&#8211;40&#160;GHz with a fractional bandwidth of 180% at normal incidence. Moreover, the metastructure has a stable frequency response when the incident angle is 60&#176; under transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarization. Finally, the synergistic mechanism between the microstructure and the material is elucidated, which provides a new paradigm for the design of novel ultra&#8208;broadband EM&#8208;absorbing materials.

         <title>Graphdiyne and Its Derivatives as Efficient Charge Reservoirs and Transporters in Semiconductor Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphdiyne (GDY) is a 2D carbon material with sp&#8208;sp2 conjugated carbon network containing evenly distributed pores, which endows GDY with unique properties in charge storage and transport. The applications of GDY and its derivatives as charge reservoirs and transporters in semiconductor devices, including memories, solar cells, photodetectors, and field&#8208;effect transistors, are summarized and analyzed.








Abstract
2D graphdiyne (GDY), which is composed of sp and sp2 hybridized carbon atoms, is a promising semiconductor material with a unique porous lamellar structure. It has high carrier mobility, tunable bandgap, high density of states, and strong electrostatic interaction ability with ions and organic functional units. In recent years, interests in applying GDYs (GDY and its derivatives) in semiconductor devices have been growing rapidly, and great achievements have been made. Attractively, GDYs could act as efficient reservoirs and transporters for both carriers and ions, which endows them with enormous potential in future novel optoelectronics. In this review, the progress in this field is systematically summarized, aiming to bring an in&#8208;depth insight into the GDYs&#8217; intrinsic uniqueness. Particularly, the effects of GDYs on carrier dynamics and ionic interactions in various semiconductor devices are succinctly described, analyzed, and concluded.

         <title>Progress of Microfluidic Hydrogel&#8208;Based Scaffolds and Organ&#8208;on&#8208;Chips for the Cartilage Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogels are among the most promising options employed for cartilage repair. Subsequent to analyzing different types of hydrogels, microfluidic hydrogel&#8208;based scaffolds are selected due to displaying superior characteristics compared to their counterparts. The application of microfluidic chips, known as organ&#8208;on&#8208;chips, is also investigated in the cartilage tissue engineering.








Abstract
Cartilage degeneration is among the fundamental reasons behind disability and pain across the globe. Numerous approaches have been employed to treat cartilage diseases. Nevertheless, none have shown acceptable outcomes in the long run. In this regard, the convergence of tissue engineering and microfabrication principles can allow developing more advanced microfluidic technologies, thus offering attractive alternatives to current treatments and traditional constructs used in tissue engineering applications. Herein, the current developments involving microfluidic hydrogel&#8208;based scaffolds, promising structures for cartilage regeneration, ranging from hydrogels with microfluidic channels to hydrogels prepared by the microfluidic devices, that enable therapeutic delivery of cells, drugs, and growth factors, as well as cartilage&#8208;related organ&#8208;on&#8208;chips are reviewed. Thereafter, cartilage anatomy and types of damages, and present treatment options are briefly overviewed. Various hydrogels are introduced, and the advantages of microfluidic hydrogel&#8208;based scaffolds over traditional hydrogels are thoroughly discussed. Furthermore, available technologies for fabricating microfluidic hydrogel&#8208;based scaffolds and microfluidic chips are presented. The preclinical and clinical applications of microfluidic hydrogel&#8208;based scaffolds in cartilage regeneration and the development of cartilage&#8208;related microfluidic chips over time are further explained. The current developments, recent key challenges, and attractive prospects that should be considered so as to develop microfluidic systems in cartilage repair are highlighted.

         <title>Single&#8208;Layer Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes With Near&#8208;Unity Internal Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient blue single&#8208;layer organic light&#8208;emitting diodes are demonstrated, achieving 27.7% external quantum efficiency, low roll&#8208;off, and low operating voltages. The internal quantum efficiency approaches unity, demonstrating that highly simplified single&#8208;layer OLEDs without confinement layers can achieve state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance, while greatly reducing the complexity of the design, fabrication, and device analysis.








Abstract
Efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) commonly comprise a multilayer stack including charge&#8208;transport and charge&#8208; and exciton&#8208;blocking layers, to confine charge recombination to the emissive layer. Here, a highly simplified single&#8208;layer blue&#8208;emitting OLED is demonstrated based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence with the emitting layer simply sandwiched between ohmic contacts consisting of a polymeric conducting anode and a metal cathode. The single&#8208;layer OLED exhibits an external quantum efficiency of 27.7% with minor roll&#8208;off at high brightness. The internal quantum efficiency approaches unity, demonstrating that highly simplified single&#8208;layer OLEDs without confinement layers can achieve state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance, while greatly reducing the complexity of the design, fabrication, and device analysis.

         <title>Zinc Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Regulated Hard Carbons for High&#8208;Rate and Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Zn single&#8208;atom&#8208;regulated hard carbon with unprecedented sodium&#8208;storage performance is reported. The Zn doping can induce a local electric field to enable the fast bulk Na+ transportation and meanwhile catalyze the decomposition of NaPF6 to form a robust inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase and fast interfacial Na+ storage kinetics, both of which contribute to the boosted electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Hard carbons, as one of the most commercializable anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), have to deal with the trade&#8208;off between the rate capability and specific capacity or initial Columbic efficiency (ICE), and the fast performance decline at low temperature (LT) remains poorly understood. Here, a comprehensive regulation on the interfacial/bulk electrochemistry of hard carbons through atomic Zn doping is reported, which demonstrates a record&#8208;high reversible capacity (546 mAh g&#8722;1), decent ICE (84%), remarkable rate capability (140 mAh g&#8722;1 @ 50 A g&#8722;1), and excellent LT capacity (443 mAh g&#8722;1 @ &#8722;40 &#176;C), outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art literature. This work reveals that the Zn doping can generally induce a local electric field to enable fast bulk Na+ transportation, and meanwhile catalyze the decomposition of NaPF6 to form a robust inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, which elaborates the underlying origin of the boosted electrochemical performance. Importantly, distinguished from room temperature, the intrinsic Na+ migration/desolvation ability of the electrolyte is disclosed to be the crucial rate&#8208;determining factors for the SIB performance at LT. This work provides a fundamental understanding on the charge&#8208;storage kinetics at varied temperatures.

         <title>A Bifunctional Carbazide Additive For Durable CsSnI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An additive&#8208;assisted two&#8208;step annealing process&#160;was&#160;developed for high&#8208;performance CsSnI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The carbazide (CBZ) can slow down crystallization for dense coverage at 80&#160;&#176;C. After further annealing at 150&#160;&#176;C, the uncoordinated CBZ reduces Sn4+ to Sn2+ with few deep traps. The efficiency of CsSnI3:CBZ is 11.21%, which is the highest performance for CsSnI3&#8208;based PSCs to date.








Abstract
Inorganic CsSnI3 with low toxicity and a narrow bandgap is a promising photovoltaic material. However, the performance of CsSnI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is much lower than that of Pb&#8208;based and hybrid Sn&#8208;based (e.g., CsPbX3 and CH(NH2)2SnX3) PSCs, which may be attributed to its poor film&#8208;forming property and the deep traps induced by Sn4+. Here, a bifunctional additive carbazide (CBZ) is adapted to deposit a pinhole&#8208;free film and remove the deep traps via two&#8208;step annealing. The lone electrons of the &#63743;NH2 and &#63743;CO units in CBZ can coordinate with Sn2+ to form a dense film with large grains during the phase transition at 80&#160;&#176;C. The decomposition of CBZ can reduce Sn4+ to Sn2+ during annealing at 150&#160;&#176;C to remove the deep traps. Compared with the control device (4.12%), the maximum efficiency of the CsSnI3:CBZ PSC reaches 11.21%, which is the highest efficiency of CsSnI3 PSC reported to date. A certified efficiency of 10.90% is obtained by an independent photovoltaic testing laboratory. In addition, the unsealed CsSnI3:CBZ devices maintain initial efficiencies of &#8776;100%, 90%, and 80% under an inert atmosphere (60&#160;days), standard maximum power point tracking (650&#160;h at 65&#160;&#176;C), and ambient air (100&#160;h), respectively.

However, the performance of CsSnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is much lower than that of Pb-based and hybrid Sn-based (e.g., CsPbX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CH(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) PSCs, which may be attributed to its poor film-forming property and the deep traps induced by Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;. Here, a bifunctional additive carbazide (CBZ) is adapted to deposit a pinhole-free film and remove the deep traps via two-step annealing. The lone electrons of the &lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;CO units in CBZ can coordinate with Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to form a dense film with large grains during the phase transition at 80&#160;&#176;C. The decomposition of CBZ can reduce Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; to Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; during annealing at 150&#160;&#176;C to remove the deep traps. Compared with the control device (4.12%), the maximum efficiency of the CsSnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:CBZ PSC reaches 11.21%, which is the highest efficiency of CsSnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PSC reported to date. A certified efficiency of 10.90% is obtained by an independent photovoltaic testing laboratory. In addition, the unsealed CsSnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:CBZ devices maintain initial efficiencies of &#8776;100%, 90%, and 80% under an inert atmosphere (60&#160;days), standard maximum power point tracking (650&#160;h at 65&#160;&#176;C), and ambient air (100&#160;h), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single Quantum Dot Selection and Tailor&#8208;Made Photonic Device Integration using a Nanoscale&#8208;Focus Pinspot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoscale&#8208;focus pinspot technique reveals a new paradigm for a deterministic integration between quantum emitters and photonic structures. The technique can reduce the luminescent quantum dot density from the high&#8208;density quantum dots (QDs)&#160;without destroying their pristine structures, so that individual QD characterization and tailor&#8208;made photonic structure integration can be done deterministically.








Abstract
Among the diverse platforms of quantum light sources, epitaxially grown semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are one of the most attractive workhorses for realizing quantum photonic technologies owing to their outstanding brightness and scalability. However, the spatial and spectral randomness of most QDs severely hinders the construction of large&#8208;scale photonic platforms. In this work, a methodology is presented to deterministically integrate single QDs with tailor&#8208;made photonic structures. A nondestructive luminescence picking method termed as nanoscale&#8208;focus pinspot (NFP) is applied using helium&#8208;ion microscopy to reduce the luminous QD density while retaining the surrounding medium. A single QD emission is only extracted out of the high&#8208;density ensemble QDs. Then the tailor&#8208;made photonic structure of a circular Bragg reflector (CBR) is designed and deterministically integrated with the selected QD. Given that the microscopy can image with nanoscale resolution and apply NFP in situ, photonic devices can be deterministically fabricated on target QDs. The extraction efficiency of the NFP&#8208;selected QD emission is improved by 25 times after the CBR integration. Since the NFP method only controls the luminescence without destroying the medium, it is applicable to various photonic structures such as photonic waveguides or photonic crystal cavities regardless of materials.

         <title>Interfacial Regulation for 3D Printing based on Slice&#8208;Based Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The significant progress in slice&#8208;based 3D printing has boomed the rapid development of advanced manufacturing fields worldwide for scientific research and commercial communities. This review discusses the scientific impetus for improving the printing process and the printing details of slice&#8208;based 3D&#8208;printing technology from the point of view of the involved interfaces and corresponding interfacial adhesions.








Abstract
3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, can turn computer&#8208;aided designs into delicate structures directly and on demand by eliminating expensive molds, dies, or lithographic masks. Among the various technical forms, light&#8208;based 3D printing mainly involved the control of polymer&#8208;based matter fabrication and realized a field of manufacturing with high tunability of printing format, speed, and precision. Emerging slice&#8208; and light&#8208;based 3D&#8208;printing methods have prosperously advanced in recent years but still present challenges to the versatility of printing continuity, printing process, and printing details control. Herein, the field of slice&#8208; and light&#8208;based 3D printing is discussed and summarized from the view of interfacial regulation strategies to improve the printing continuity, printing process control, and the character of printed results, and several potential strategies to construct complex 3D structures of distinct characteristics with extra external fields, which are favorable for the further improvement and development of 3D printing, are proposed.

         <title>Multifunctional Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskite Microcrystalline Engineering and Electromagnetic Response Switching Multi&#8208;Band Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile one&#8208;step solution processing method is developed to rapidly prepare gram&#8208;scale MAPbX3&#160;microcrystals. Utilizing its intrinsic electromagnetic (EM) properties, a series of EM devices is designed and fabricated, which can be applied in the fields of ultra&#8208;wideband bandpass filters and multi&#8208;band photodetection covering X&#8208;rays, UV, visible light, and microwaves.








Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency electromagnetic (EM) functional materials are the core building block of high&#8208;performance EM absorbers and devices, and they are indispensable in various fields ranging from industrial manufacture to daily life, or even from national defense security to space exploration. Searching for high&#8208;efficiency EM functional materials and realizing high&#8208;performance EM devices remain&#160;great challenges. Herein, a simple solution&#8208;process is developed to rapidly grow gram&#8208;scale organic&#8211;inorganic (MAPbX3, X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I) perovskite microcrystals. They exhibit excellent EM response in multi bands covering microwaves, visible light, and X&#8208;rays. Among them, outstanding microwave absorption performance with multiple absorption bands can be achieved, and their intrinsic EM properties can be tuned by adjusting polar group. An ultra&#8208;wideband bandpass filter with high suppression level of &#8722;71.8&#160;dB in the stopband in the GHz band, self&#8208;powered photodetectors with tunable broadband or narrowband photoresponse in the visible&#8208;light band, and a self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detector with high sensitivity of 3560&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;in the X&#8208;ray band are designed and realized by precisely regulating the physical features of perovskite and designing a novel planar device structure. These findings open a door toward developing high&#8208;efficiency EM functional materials for realizing high&#8208;performance EM absorbers and devices.

         <title>A New Zinc Salt Chemistry for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new aqueous Zn salt with an anion group, N&#8208;(benzenesulfonyl)benzenesulfonamide C12H10N(SO2)2&#8722;,&#160;(BBI&#8722;) is designed and synthesized. The 1 m Zn(BBI)2 electrolyte decreases the decomposition activity of H2O molecules, suppresses the&#160;hydrogen evolution reaction, enables compact and uniform zinc deposition, and improves the cycling and calendar stabilities of aqueous Zn batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising energy storage solutions with low cost and superior safety, but they suffer from chemical and electrochemical degradations closely related to the electrolyte. Here, a new zinc salt design and a drop&#8208;in solution for long cycle&#8208;life aqueous ZIBs are reported. The salt Zn(BBI)2 with a rationally designed anion group, N&#8208;(benzenesulfonyl)benzenesulfonamide (BBI&#8722;), has a special amphiphilic molecular structure, which combines the benefits of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups to properly tune the solubility and interfacial condition. This new zinc salt does not contain fluorine and is synthesized via a high&#8208;yield and low&#8208;cost method. It is shown that 1&#160;m Zn(BBI)2 aqueous electrolyte with a widened cathodic stability window effectively stabilizes Zn metal/H2O interface, mitigates chemical and electrochemical degradations, and enables both symmetric and full cells using a&#160;zinc&#8208;metal electrode.

         <title>Toughening Double&#8208;Network Hydrogels by Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The employment of the Hoffmeister effect to toughen double&#8208;network hydrogels and broadly tune the mechanical properties using polyelectrolytes is reported. This strategy is verified to work for other Hoffmeister&#8208;effect&#8208;sensitive polymers and polyelectrolytes. As a biomedical patch, the advanced hydrogel can inhibit hernia formation and accelerate the healing of abdominal wall defects in vivo.








Abstract
The Hoffmeister effect of inorganic salts is verified as a promising way to toughen hydrogels, however, the high concentration of inorganic salts may be accompanied by poor biocompatibility. In this work, it is found that polyelectrolytes can obviously elevate the mechanical performances of hydrogels through the Hoffmeister effect. The introduction of anionic poly(sodium acrylate) into poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel induces the aggregation and crystallization of the PVA to boost the mechanical properties of the resulting double&#8208;network hydrogel: elevation of 73, 64, 28, 135, and 19 times in the tensile strength, compressive strength, Young's modulus, toughness, and fracture energy compared with poly(acrylic acid), respectively. It is noteworthy that the mechanical performances of the hydrogels can be flexibly tuned by the variation of polyelectrolyte concentration, ionization degree, relative hydrophobicity of the ionic component, and polyelectrolyte type in a wide range. This strategy is verified to work for other Hoffmeister&#8208;effect&#8208;sensitive polymers and polyelectrolytes. Also, the introduction of urea bonds into the polyelectrolyte can further improve the mechanical properties and antiswelling capability of hydrogels. As a biomedical patch, the advanced hydrogel can efficiently inhibit hernia formation and promote the regeneration of soft tissues in an abdominal wall defect model.

         <title>A Protophilic MOF Enables Ni&#8208;Rich Lithium&#8208;Battery Stable Cycling in a High Water/Acid Content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique ionic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) that combines ultrahigh surface areas and ionic pore environments is used to selectively and effectively adsorb protic impurities from battery electrolytes, realizing high water/acid tolerant&#160;batteries. Even if H2O is introduced into the batteries and generates hydrofluoric acid (HF), such MOF&#8208;based batteries with a high&#8208;nickel cathode still show high cycling performance.








Abstract
Trace protic impurities, such as water and hydrofluoric acid (HF), can severely degrade the stable and long cycling of lithium batteries. Therefore, the costly water removal process is inevitably needed throughout production of lithium batteries, leaving the paradox that energy&#8208;saving lithium&#8208;battery technology consumes non&#8208;negligible amounts of energy. Herein, a unique ionic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is reported that enables highly destructive H2O/HF&#8208;tolerant lithium batteries. The isolated ionic fluorine sites in the MOF exhibit unusual protophilicity and efficiently capture ppm&#8208;levels H2O/HF from the highly polar electrolyte solvents. The resulting MOF&#8208;based LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2&#9474;Li battery achieves over 300 cycles in the presence of 800&#160;ppm H2O or 1107&#160;ppm acidic impurity. This tenfold longer battery lifespan relative to those for batteries with conventional standard separators demonstrates its excellent electrochemical cycling performance. The results reveal that the rational use of unique nanoporous features of MOFs can provide new possibilities for long&#8208;standing challenges in the lithium&#8208;battery industry.

         <title>Amorphous MXene Opens New Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed synthesis methods of amorphous MXene are discussed. The unique structure of amorphous MXenes may possess unexpected properties. The work opens new perspectives on the possibility of MXene amorphization, and their energy conversion, energy storage, and other applications.








Abstract
Recently, novel amorphous nanomaterials formed by introducing atomic irregular arrangement factors have been successfully fabricated, showing superior performance in catalysis, energy storage, and mechanics. Among them, 2D&#160;amorphous nanomaterials are the stars, as they combine the benefits of both 2D structure and amorphous. Up to now, many research studies have been published on the study of 2D amorphous materials. However, as one of the most important parts of 2D materials, the research on MXenes mainly focuses on the crystalline counterpart, while the study of highly disordered forms is much less. This work will provide insight into the possibility of MXenes amorphization, and discusses the application prospect of amorphous MXenes materials.

         <title>Intramolecular&#8208;Catalyzed Vitrimers with White&#8208;Light Emission for Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of intramolecular&#8208;catalyzed vitrimers with white&#8208;light emissions via the synergies between blue and yellow light for light&#8208;emitting diode encapsulations is proposed and developed, where the successful unification of photochemistry and dynamic bond chemistry allows for a rare integration of photoluminescence, dynamic stability, and sustainability in a system.








Abstract
Currently available encapsulating materials for white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs) have certain limitations, such as the toxicity of phosphors and the non&#8208;recyclable nature of the encapsulating materials. In this study, relatively promising encapsulating materials with two significant advantages are developed. First, the chips can be directly encapsulated without phosphors using luminescent encapsulating materials. Second, the encapsulating materials can be reprocessed for recycling via intramolecular catalysis. To this end, blue&#8208;light&#8208;emitting vitrimers (BEVs) are prepared by the reaction of epoxy resin with amines and are found to exhibit strong blue emission and fast stress relaxation via internal catalysis. To obtain white&#8208;light emission, a well&#8208;designed yellow component, perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride, is grafted into the BEVs to generate white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting vitrimers (WEVs). A rare synergy of blue&#8208; and yellow&#8208;light emission affords white&#8208;light emission. When the WEV is used as an encapsulating adhesive for 365 nm LED chips without inorganic phosphors, stable white light with CIE coordinates (0.30, 0.32) is successfully achieved, indicating a promising future for WLED encapsulation.

         <title>A Fully Integrated Miniaturized Optical Biosensor for Fast and Multiplexing Plasmonic Detection of High&#8208; and Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Analytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A miniaturized optical biosensor based on organic optoelectronic and nanoplasmonic components, able to perform fast and multiplex plasmonic detection of analytical targets for milk quality and safety: lactoferrin and streptomycin, is presented. Software&#8208;based data analysis and calibration of the sensor is reported, which shows for lactoferrin a limit of detection of 3.7 &#181;g mL&#8722;1, comparable with a reference benchtop analytical instrument.








Abstract
Optical biosensors based on plasmonic sensing schemes combine high sensitivity and selectivity with label&#8208;free detection. However, the use of bulky optical components is still hampering the possibility of obtaining miniaturized systems required for analysis in real settings. Here, a fully miniaturized optical biosensor prototype based on plasmonic detection is demonstrated, which enables fast and multiplex sensing of analytes with high&#8208; and low molecular weight (80&#8239;000 and 582 Da) as quality and safety parameters for milk: a protein (lactoferrin) and an antibiotic (streptomycin). The optical sensor is based on the smart integration of: i) miniaturized organic optoelectronic devices used as light&#8208;emitting and light&#8208;sensing elements and ii) a functionalized nanostructured plasmonic grating for highly sensitive and specific localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) detection. The sensor provides quantitative and linear response reaching a limit of detection of 10&#8722;4 refractive index units once it is calibrated by standard solutions. Analyte&#8208;specific and rapid (15 min long) immunoassay&#8208;based detection is demonstrated for both targets. By using a custom algorithm based on principal&#8208;component analysis, a linear dose&#8211;response curve is constructed which correlates with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 3.7&#160;&#181;g mL&#8722;1 for lactoferrin, thus assessing that the miniaturized optical biosensor is well&#8208;aligned with the chosen reference benchtop SPR method.

         <title>Toward a Novel Energy&#8208;Dissipation Metamaterial with Tensegrity Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>A new dissipator with a tensegrity&#8208;based architecture that is highly customizable is presented. It has movement amplification capabilities due to its internal geometry and it is possible to control its stiffness and damping by adjusting the pre&#8208;strain. A 3D&#8208;printed prototype is analyzed and its excellent dissipation abilities are confirmed. Furthermore, this design can serve as a building block for more complex assemblies, like periodic metamaterials with tensegrity architecture.








Abstract
The interest in novel energy&#8208;dissipation devices that offer advanced functionalities for optimal performance in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art engineering applications is growing. In this regard, a highly tunable and innovative dissipator is developed. This dissipator features movement amplification capabilities resulting from the radial replication of a unit&#8208;cell with tensegrity architecture. The kinematic response of the dissipator is analyzed for several layouts, by varying the number of unit&#8208;cells within the device, their internal geometry, and identifying the corresponding locking configurations. A fully operational 3D&#8208;printed prototype is presented, demonstrating its excellent performance in terms of damping capabilities and feasibility. The experimental results are used to validate a numerical model of the flower unit. This model demonstrates the importance of pre&#8208;strain on the overall stiffness and dissipative features of the proposed system. By utilizing these numerical models, it is shown that the proposed device can be used as a building block for more complex assemblies such as periodic metamaterials with tensegrity architecture.

         <title>Tailoring Molecular&#8208;Scale Contact at the Perovskite/Polymeric Hole&#8208;Transporting Material Interface for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With tailored conjugated ligand design, the 2D/3D heterostructure built in perovskite solar cells enhances the interface adhesion between the polymeric hole&#8208;transporting layer&#8212;PTAA and perovskite, and at the same time, realizes a uniform growth of 2D structure on top of 3D perovskite. Therefore, the as&#8208;fabricated device yields a 23.7% power conversion efficiency, along with excellent stability.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have delivered a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 25% and incorporating polymers as hole&#8208;transporting layers (HTLs) can further enhance the stability of devices toward the goal of commercialization. Among the various polymeric hole&#8208;transporting materials, poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA) is one of the promising HTL candidates with good stability; however, the hydrophobicity of PTAA causes problematic interfacial contact with the perovskite, limiting the device performance. Using molecular side&#8208;chain engineering, a uniform 2D perovskite interlayer with conjugated ligands, between 3D perovskites and PTAA is successfully constructed. Further, employing conjugated ligands as cohesive elements, perovskite/PTAA interfacial adhesion is significantly improved. As a result, the thin and lateral extended 2D/3D heterostructure enables as&#8208;fabricated PTAA&#8208;based PSCs to achieve a PCE of 23.7%, improved from the 18% of reference devices. Owing to the increased ion&#8208;migration energy barrier and conformal 2D coating, unencapsulated devices with the new ligands exhibit both superior thermal stability under 60&#160;&#176;C heating and moisture stability in ambient conditions.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional V2C MXene Assembly in Facilitating Sulfur Evolution Kinetics and Li&#8208;Ion Sieving toward Practical Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The scale&#8208;identified V2C MXene spheres can synchronously promote sulfur&#8208;evolution kinetics and sieve Li&#8208;ions, thereby showing an outstanding dual protection effect on the sulfur cathode and lithium anode for practically working lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are considered as one of the most promising candidates to achieve an energy density of 500&#160;Wh kg&#8315;1. However, the challenges of shuttle effect, sluggish sulfur conversion kinetics, and lithium&#8208;dendrite growth severely obstruct their practical implementation. Herein, multiscale V2C MXene (VC) with a spherical confinement structure is designed as a high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional promotor for the evolution of sulfur and lithium species in Li&#8211;S batteries. Combining synchrotron X&#8208;ray 3D nano&#8208;computed tomography (X&#8208;ray 3D nano&#8208;CT), small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS), and first&#8208;principle calculations, it is revealed that the activity of VC can be maximized by tuning the scale, and the as&#8208;attained functions are conducted as follows: (i) the VC acts as the efficient lithium polysulfide (LiPS) scavenger due to the large number of active sites; (ii) the VC exhibits significantly improved electrocatalytic function for the Li2S nucleation and decomposition reaction kinetics owing to the scale effect; and (iii) the VC can regulate the dynamic behavior of Li&#8208;ions and thus stabilize the lithium plating/stripping effectively on account of the unique ion&#8208;sieving effect.

         <title>Atom&#8208;Precise Heteroatom Core&#8208;Tailoring of Nanoclusters for Enhanced Solar Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Titania&#8208;supported atomically precise gold&#8208;silver core&#8211;shell nanoclusters, Au12Ag32/TiO2, are fabricated through strong cluster&#8211;support interactions. The controlled modulation of the electronic structure of the nanoclusters through the incorporation of the metallic gold core plays a critical role in the enhanced separation of photoinduced charge carriers, making Au12Ag32/TiO2 a &#8776;38&#8208;fold more efficient photocatalyst than TiO2 for hydrogen production (6.8 mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) from solar water splitting.








Abstract
While core&#8211;shell nanomaterials are highly desirable for realizing enhanced optical and catalytic properties, their synthesis with atomic&#8208;level control is challenging. Here, the synthesis and crystal structure of [Au12Ag32(SePh)30]4&#8722;, the first example of selenolated Au&#8211;Ag core&#8211;shell nanoclusters, comprising a gold icosahedron core trapped in a silver dodecahedron, which is protected by an Ag12(SePh)30 shell, is presented. The gold core strongly modifies the overall electronic structure and induces synergistic effects, resulting in high enhancements in the stability and near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II photoluminescence. The Au12Ag32 and its homometal analog Ag44, show strong interactions with oxygen vacancies of TiO2, facilitating the interfacial charge transfer for photocatalysis. Indeed, the Au12Ag32/TiO2 exhibits remarkable solar H2 production (6810&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1), which is &#8776;6.2 and &#8776;37.8 times higher than that of Ag44/TiO2 and TiO2, respectively. Good stability and recyclability with minimal catalytic activity loss are additional features of Au12Ag32/TiO2. The experimental and computational results reveal that the Au12Ag32 acts as an efficient cocatalyst by possessing a favorable electronic structure that aligns well with the TiO2 bands for the enhanced separation of photoinduced charge carriers due to the relatively negatively charged Au12 core. These atomistic insights will motivate uncovering of the structure&#8211;catalytic activity relationships of other nanoclusters.

         <title>Designed Concave Octahedron Heterostructures Decode Distinct Metabolic Patterns of Epithelial Ovarian Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concave octahedron Mn2O3/(Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4 composite with heterojunction, rough surface, hollow interior, and sharp corners is developed to directly record serum metabolic fingerprints by laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, distinguishing malignant ovarian tumors from benign controls with a value of the area under the curve of 0.987. Their approach accelerates the growth of nanomaterials&#8208;based platforms toward precision diagnosis.








Abstract
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a polyfactorial process associated with alterations in metabolic pathways.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a polyfactorial process associated with alterations in metabolic pathways. A high-performance screening tool for EOC is in high demand to improve prognostic outcome but is still missing. Here, a concave octahedron Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/(Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (MO/CMO) composite with a heterojunction, rough surface, hollow interior, and sharp corners is developed to record metabolic patterns of ovarian tumors by laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI-MS). The MO/CMO composites with multiple physical effects induce enhanced light absorption, preferred charge transfer, increased photothermal conversion, and selective trapping of small molecules. The MO/CMO shows &#8776;2&#8211;5-fold signal enhancement compared to mono- or dual-enhancement counterparts, and &#8776;10&#8211;48-fold compared to the commercialized products. Subsequently, serum metabolic fingerprints of ovarian tumors are revealed by MO/CMO-assisted LDI-MS, achieving high reproducibility of direct serum detection without treatment. Furthermore, machine learning of the metabolic fingerprints distinguishes malignant ovarian tumors from benign controls with the area under the curve value of 0.987. Finally, seven metabolites associated with the progression of ovarian tumors are screened as potential biomarkers. The approach guides the future depiction of the state-of-the-art matrix for intensive MS detection and accelerates the growth of nanomaterials-based platforms toward precision diagnosis scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible Perspiring Artificial &#8220;Fingertips&#8221;</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a coating made of liquid crystal networks&#160;is designed to mimic not only the unique fingerprint topography, but also the liquid secretion in human fingertips. The biomimetic perspiration of the coating is reversible as controlled by light, which can be used to fine&#8208;tune the tribological property when the coating is in contact with other surfaces.








Abstract
Fingertip perspiration is a vital process within human predation, to which the species owes its survival and its biological success. In this paper, the unique human ability of extensive perspiration and controlled friction in self&#8208;assembled cholesteric liquid crystals is recreated, mimicking the natural processes that occur in the dermis and epidermis of human skin. This is achieved by inducing porosity in responsive, liquid&#8208;bearing material through the controlled&#8208;polymerization phase&#8208;separation process. The unique topography of human fingerprints is further emulated in the materials by balancing the parallel chirality&#8208;induced force and the perpendicular substrate&#8208;anchoring force during synthesis. As a result, artificial fingertips are capable of secreting and re&#8208;absorbing liquid upon light illumination. By demonstrating the function of the soft material in a tribological aspect, it exhibits a controllable anti&#8208;sliding property&#160;comparable to human fingertips and subsequently attains a higher degree of biomimicry. This biomimetic fingertip is envisioned being applied in a multitude of fields, ranging from biomedical instruments to interactive, human&#8208;like soft robotic devices.

         <title>Oxidization&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Triggered Rapid Preparation of Large&#8208;Area Single&#8208;Crystal Cu(111) Foil</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through low&#8208;temperature oxidization of polycrystalline Cu foils, rapid preparation of large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) (up to 320 cm2) is achieved within 60 min, thanks to the transformation of the thin CuxO layer to a Cu(111) seed layer. Large&#8208;size high&#8208;quality graphene films are synthesized on the single&#8208;crystal Cu(111), and the graphene/Cu(111) composites exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity and ductility compared to their polycrystalline counterpart.








Abstract
The controlled preparation of single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) is intensively investigated owing to the superior properties of Cu(111) and its advantages in synthesizing high&#8208;quality 2D materials, especially graphene. However, the accessibility of large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) is still hindered by time&#8208;consuming, complicated, and high&#8208;cost preparation methods. Here, the oxidization&#8208;temperature&#8208;triggered rapid preparation of large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) in which an area up to 320 cm2 is prepared within 60 min, and where low&#8208;temperature oxidization of polycrystalline Cu foil surface plays a vital role, is reported. A mechanism is proposed, by which the thin CuxO layer transforms to a Cu(111) seed layer on the surface of Cu to induce the formation of a large&#8208;area Cu(111) foil, which is supported by both experimental data and molecular dynamics simulation results. In addition, a large&#8208;size high&#8208;quality graphene film is synthesized on the single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) foil surface and the graphene/Cu(111) composites exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity and ductility compared to their polycrystalline counterpart. This work, therefore, not only provides a new avenue toward the monocrystallinity of Cu with specific planes but also contributes to improving the mass production of high&#8208;quality 2D materials.

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of Dual&#8208;Function Fabric for Zero&#8208;Energy Thermal Environmental Management through Multiband, Synergistic, and Asymmetric Optical Modulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;function fabric with both radiative cooling and solar heating functions on two sides of the fabric is developed. The dual&#8208;function fabric demonstrates high adaption to the dynamic environment and superior performance for zero&#8208;energy&#8208;input temperature regulation. As a roof coating, the dual&#8208;function fabric can achieve &#8776;22.4&#160;MJ m&#8722;2 y&#8722;1 energy saving, corresponding to &#8776;173.7 billion kg global CO2 emission reduction.








Abstract
Solar heating and radiative cooling techniques have been proposed for passive space thermal management to reduce the global energy burden. However, the currently used single&#8208;function envelope/coating materials can only achieve static temperature regulation, presenting limited energy savings and poor adaption to dynamic environments. In this study, a sandwich&#8208;structured fabric, composed of vertical graphene, graphene glass fiber fabric, and polyacrylonitrile nanofibers is developed, with heating and cooling functions integrated through multiband, synergistic, (solar spectrum and mid&#8208;infrared ranges) and asymmetric optical modulations on two sides of the fabric. The dual&#8208;function fabric demonstrates high adaption to the dynamic environment and superior performance in a zero&#8208;energy&#8208;input temperature regulation. Furthermore, it demonstrates &#8776;15.5 and &#8776;31.1&#160;MJ m&#8722;2 y&#8722;1 higher annual energy savings compared to those of their cooling&#8208;only and heating&#8208;only counterparts, corresponding to &#8776;173.7 MT reduction in the global CO2 emission. The fabric exhibits high scalability for batch manufacturing with commercially abundant raw materials and facile technologies, providing a favorable guarantee of its mass production and use.

         <title>Engineering and Development of a Tissue Model for the Evaluation of Microneedle Penetration Ability, Drug Diffusion, Photothermal Activity, and Ultrasound Imaging: A Promising Surrogate to Ex Vivo and In Vivo Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissue models based on hydrogel/silicone are prepared for different applications in biomedical sectors. Such customized tissue surrogates can be employed as a platform to evaluate the ability of microneedle insertion, the diffusion of drugs, the activity of photothermal agents, as well as the performance of ultrasound bioimaging.








Abstract
Driven by regulatory authorities and the ever&#8208;growing demands from industry, various artificial tissue models have been developed. Nevertheless, there is no model to date that is capable of mimicking the biomechanical properties of the skin whilst exhibiting the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity properties of the skin layers. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, tissue surrogates based on gel and silicone are fabricated for the evaluation of microneedle penetration, drug diffusion, photothermal activity, and ultrasound bioimaging. The silicone layer aims to imitate the stratum corneum while the gel layer aims to mimic the water&#8208;rich viable epidermis and dermis present in in vivo tissues. The diffusion of drugs across the tissue model is assessed, and the results reveal that the proposed tissue model shows similar behavior to a cancerous kidney. In place of typical in vitro aqueous solutions, this model can also be employed for evaluating the photoactivity of photothermal agents since the tissue model shows a similar heating profile to skin of mice when irradiated with near&#8208;infrared laser. In addition, the designed tissue model exhibits promising results for biomedical applications in optical coherence tomography and ultrasound imaging. Such a tissue model paves the way to reduce the use of animals testing in research whilst obviating ethical concerns.

&lt;p&gt;Tissue models based on hydrogel/silicone are prepared for different applications in biomedical sectors. Such customized tissue surrogates can be employed as a platform to evaluate the ability of microneedle insertion, the diffusion of drugs, the activity of photothermal agents, as well as the performance of ultrasound bioimaging.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driven by regulatory authorities and the ever-growing demands from industry, various artificial tissue models have been developed. Nevertheless, there is no model to date that is capable of mimicking the biomechanical properties of the skin whilst exhibiting the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity properties of the skin layers. As a proof-of-concept study, tissue surrogates based on gel and silicone are fabricated for the evaluation of microneedle penetration, drug diffusion, photothermal activity, and ultrasound bioimaging. The silicone layer aims to imitate the stratum corneum while the gel layer aims to mimic the water-rich viable epidermis and dermis present in in vivo tissues. The diffusion of drugs across the tissue model is assessed, and the results reveal that the proposed tissue model shows similar behavior to a cancerous kidney. In place of typical in vitro aqueous solutions, this model can also be employed for evaluating the photoactivity of photothermal agents since the tissue model shows a similar heating profile to skin of mice when irradiated with near-infrared laser. In addition, the designed tissue model exhibits promising results for biomedical applications in optical coherence tomography and ultrasound imaging. Such a tissue model paves the way to reduce the use of animals testing in research whilst obviating ethical concerns.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mobile Trions in Electrically Tunable 2D Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrically controlled, bipolar tuning of the excitonic light emission is achieved in 2D perovskites via the field effect in a van der Waals heterostructure. The formation of trions with exceptionally high binding energies up to 46&#160;meV is demonstrated. Localized at liquid helium temperature, these charged excitons become mobile toward 50&#160;K with effective mobilities up to 200 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1.








Abstract
2D hybrid perovskites are currently in the spotlight of material research for light&#8208;harvesting and &#8208;emitting applications. It remains extremely challenging, however, to externally control their optical response due to the difficulties of introducing electrical doping. Here, an approach of interfacing ultrathin sheets of perovskites with few&#8208;layer graphene and hexagonal boron nitride into gate&#8208;tunable, hybrid heterostructures, is demonstrated. It allows for bipolar, continuous tuning of light emission and absorption in 2D perovskites by electrically injecting carriers to densities as high as 1012&#160;cm&#8722;2. This reveals the emergence of both negatively and positively charged excitons, or trions, with binding energies up to 46&#160;meV, among the highest measured for 2D systems. Trions are shown to dominate light emission and propagate with mobilities reaching 200&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at elevated temperatures. The findings introduce the physics of interacting mixtures of optical and electrical excitations to the broad family of 2D inorganic&#8211;organic nanostructures. The presented strategy to electrically control the optical response of 2D perovskites highlights it as a promising material platform toward electrically modulated light&#8208;emitters, externally guided charged exciton currents, and exciton transistors based on layered, hybrid&#160;semiconductors.

         <title>Modular Design of a Polymer&#8208;Bilayer&#8208;Based Mechanically Compliant Worm&#8208;Like Robot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically compliant earthworm&#8208;like robot with a fully modular soft body that primarily consists of polymers is presented. The robot is based on electrothermally actuated polymer&#8208;bilayer&#8208;based segments and is capable of directional locomotion on various surfaces, turning on the spot, steering during forward movement, and, most strikingly, squeezing itself through constrictions that are smaller than its cross&#8208;section in the resting state.








Abstract
Soft earthworm&#8208;like robots that exhibit mechanical compliance can, in principle, navigate through uneven terrains and constricted spaces that are inaccessible to traditional legged and wheeled robots. However, unlike the biological originals that&#160;they mimic, most of the worm&#8208;like robots reported to date contain rigid components that limit their compliance, such as electromotors or pressure&#8208;driven actuation systems. Here, a mechanically compliant worm&#8208;like robot with a fully modular body that is based on soft polymers is reported. The robot is composed of strategically assembled, electrothermally activated polymer bilayer actuators, which are based on a semicrystalline polyurethane with an exceptionally large nonlinear thermal expansion coefficient. The segments are designed on the basis of a modified Timoshenko model, and finite element analysis simulation is used to describe their performance. Upon electrical activation of the segments with basic waveform patterns, the robot can move through repeatable peristaltic locomotion on exceptionally slippery or sticky surfaces and it can be oriented in any direction. The soft body enables the robot to wriggle through openings and tunnels that are much smaller than its cross&#8208;section.

         <title>All&#8208;Transfer Electrode Interface Engineering Toward Harsh&#8208;Environment&#8208;Resistant MoS2 Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors are demonstrated by engineering the electrode&#8211;channel interfaces with an all&#8208;transfer technique of van der Waals electrodes. The intact and defect&#8208;free interfaces not only reduce the Schottky barrier height at electrodes, but enable high resistances of the MoS2 devices to humid, oxidizing, and high&#8208;temperature environments, surpassing the devices with other kinds of electrodes.








Abstract
Nanoscale electronic devices that can work in harsh environments are in high demand for wearable, automotive, and aerospace electronics. Clean and defect&#8208;free interfaces are of vital importance for building nanoscale harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant devices. However, current nanoscale devices are subject to failure in these environments, especially at defective electrode&#8211;channel interfaces. Here, harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant MoS2 transistors are developed by engineering electrode&#8211;channel interfaces with an all&#8208;transfer of van der Waals electrodes. The delivered defect&#8208;free, graphene&#8208;buffered electrodes keep the electrode&#8211;channel interfaces intact and robust. As a result, the as&#8208;fabricated MoS2 devices have reduced Schottky barrier heights, leading to a very large on&#8208;state current and high carrier mobility. More importantly, the defect&#8208;free, hydrophobic graphene buffer layer prevents metal diffusion from the electrodes to MoS2 and the intercalation of water molecules at the electrode&#8211;MoS2 interfaces. This enables high resistances of MoS2 devices with all&#8208;transfer electrodes to various harsh environments, including humid, oxidizing, and high&#8208;temperature environments, surpassing the devices with other kinds of electrodes. The work deepens the understanding of the roles of electrode&#8211;channel interfaces in nanoscale devices and provides a promising interface engineering strategy to build nanoscale harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant devices.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electro&#8208;opto&#8208;coupled silicon&#8208; and Mott&#8208;based integrated infrared photodetectors ares developed, which exhibit a large superlinear photoresponse (exponent &gt;18), an ultralow dark current of 4.46&#160;pA, high photocurrent on/off ratio (&gt;106), responsivity (&gt;1&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1), and great detectivity (&gt;1012&#160;Jones). Night vision pattern recognition even with noisy inputs is demonstrated, offering intensity&#8208;selective near&#8208;sensor vision processing.








Abstract
Light&#8208;intensity selective superlinear photodetectors with ultralow dark current can provide an essential breakthrough for the development of high&#8208;performing near&#8208;sensor vision processing. However, the development of near&#8208;sensor vision processing is not only conceptually important for device operation (given that sensors naturally exhibit linear/sublinear responses), but also essential to get rid of the massive amount of data generated during object sensing and classification with noisy inputs. Therefore, achieving the giant superlinear photoresponse while maintaining the picoampere leakage current, irrespective of the measurement bias, is one of the most challenging tasks. Here, Mott material (vanadium dioxide) and silicon&#8208;based integrated infrared photodetectors are developed that show giant superlinear photoresponse (exponent &gt;18) and ultralow dark current of 4.46&#160;pA. Specifically, the device demonstrates an electro&#8208;opto&#8208;coupled insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition, which leads to outstanding photocurrent on/off ratio (&gt;106), a high responsivity (&gt;1&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1), and excellent detectivity (&gt;1012&#160;Jones), while maintaining response speed (&#964;r&#160;=&#160;6&#160;&#181;s and &#964;f&#160;=&#160;10&#160;&#181;s). Further, intensity&#8208;selective near&#8208;sensor processing is demonstrated and night vision pattern reorganization even with noisy inputs is exhibited. This research will pave the way for the creation of high&#8208;performance photodetectors with potential uses, such as in night vision, pattern recognition, and neuromorphic processing.

Night vision pattern recognition even with noisy inputs is demonstrated, offering intensity-selective near-sensor vision processing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light-intensity selective superlinear photodetectors with ultralow dark current can provide an essential breakthrough for the development of high-performing near-sensor vision processing. However, the development of near-sensor vision processing is not only conceptually important for device operation (given that sensors naturally exhibit linear/sublinear responses), but also essential to get rid of the massive amount of data generated during object sensing and classification with noisy inputs. Therefore, achieving the giant superlinear photoresponse while maintaining the picoampere leakage current, irrespective of the measurement bias, is one of the most challenging tasks. Here, Mott material (vanadium dioxide) and silicon-based integrated infrared photodetectors are developed that show giant superlinear photoresponse (exponent &amp;gt;18) and ultralow dark current of 4.46&#160;pA. Specifically, the device demonstrates an electro-opto-coupled insulator-to-metal transition, which leads to outstanding photocurrent on/off ratio (&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;), a high responsivity (&amp;gt;1&#160;mA&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and excellent detectivity (&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;Jones), while maintaining response speed (&#964;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;6&#160;&#181;s and &#964;&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;10&#160;&#181;s). Further, intensity-selective near-sensor processing is demonstrated and night vision pattern reorganization even with noisy inputs is exhibited. This research will pave the way for the creation of high-performance photodetectors with potential uses, such as in night vision, pattern recognition, and neuromorphic processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Principles for 2D&#8208;Material&#8208;Assisted Nitrides Epitaxial Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through systematically studying the crystallographic information of nitrides/2D materials&#160;interface, it is found that graphene is the ideal buffer layer for nitrides&#8217; remote epitaxy while WS2 for nitrides&#8217; van der Waals epitaxy. As a result, a suitable growth&#8208;front construction strategies and basic guidelines for high&#8208;quality 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;assisted nitrides&#8217; epitaxy is presented. This work may open a pathway toward various semiconductors heterointegration.








Abstract
Beyond traditional heteroepitaxy, 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;assisted epitaxy opens opportunities to revolutionize future material integration methods. However, basic principles in 2D&#8208;material&#8208;assisted nitrides&#8217; epitaxy remain unclear, which impedes understanding the essence, thus hindering its progress. Here, the crystallographic information of nitrides/2D material interface is theoretically established, which is further confirmed experimentally. It is found that the atomic interaction at the nitrides/2D material interface is related to the nature of underlying substrates. For single&#8208;crystalline substrates, the heterointerface behaves like a covalent one and the epilayer inherits the substrate's lattice. Meanwhile, for amorphous substrates, the heterointerface tends to be a van der Waals one and strongly relies on the properties of 2D materials. Therefore, modulated by graphene, the nitrides&#8217; epilayer is polycrystalline. In contrast, single&#8208;crystalline GaN films are successfully achieved on WS2. These results provide a suitable growth&#8208;front construction strategy for high&#8208;quality 2D&#8208;material&#8208;assisted nitrides&#8217; epitaxy. It also opens a pathway toward various semiconductors heterointegration.

         <title>Dynamic and Reversible Decoration of DNA&#8208;Based Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;based approach to decorating DNA&#8208;based scaffolds in a dynamic and reversible way is demonstrated. Enzyme&#8208;responsive strands in the assembled scaffolds undergo degradation and spontaneous replacement by strands decorated with different labels in the presence of their corresponding enzymes.








Abstract
An approach to achieving dynamic and reversible decoration of DNA&#8208;based scaffolds is demonstrated here. To do this, rationally engineered DNA tiles containing enzyme&#8208;responsive strands covalently conjugated to different molecular labels are employed. These strands are designed to be recognized and degraded by specific enzymes (i.e., Ribonuclease H, RNase H, or Uracil DNA Glycosylase, UDG) inducing their spontaneous de&#8208;hybridization from the assembled tile and replacement by a new strand conjugated to a different label. Multiple enzyme&#8208;responsive strands that specifically respond to different enzymes allow for dynamic, orthogonal, and reversible decoration of the DNA structures. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle of the strategy, the possibility to orthogonally control the distribution of different labels (i.e., fluorophores and small molecules) on the same scaffold without crosstalk is demonstrated. By doing so, DNA scaffolds that display different antibody recognition patterns are obtained. The approach offers the possibility to control the decoration of higher&#8208;order supramolecular assemblies (including origami) with several functional moieties to achieve functional biomaterials with improved adaptability, precision, and sensing capabilities.

         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;sensing of their body shape is significant for soft robots planning trajectories and actions, which can also be a feedback to interactions with the environment. We&#160;present a shape&#8208;sensing electronic skin, confluence with machine learning technique, endows soft robots with proprioception of their own status and exteroception of environment awareness, exhibiting advanced artificial intelligence.








Abstract
Inspired by natural biological systems, soft robots have recently been developed, showing tremendous potential in real&#8208;world applications because of their intrinsic softness and deformability. The confluence of electronic skins and machine learning is extensively studied to create effective biomimetic robotic systems. Based on a differential piezoelectric matrix, this study presents a shape&#8208;sensing electronic skin (SSES) that can recognize surface conformations with minimal interference from pressing, stretching, or other surrounding stimuli. It is then integrated with soft robots to reconstruct their shape during movement, serving as a proprioceptive sense. Additionally, the robot can utilize machine learning to identify various terrains, demonstrating exteroception and pointing toward more advanced autonomous robots capable of performing real&#8208;world tasks in challenging environments.

         <title>Heteroepitaxy of 2D CuCr2Te4 with Robust Room&#8208;temperature Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a heteroepitaxial growth strategy of ferromagnetic CuCr2Te4 nanosheets on mica and Cr2Te3, with thickness&#8208;dependent ferromagnetism of CuCr2Te4 nanosheets on mica and an enhanced robust ferromagnetism with TC up to 340&#160;K via interfacial charge transfer in lattice&#8208;matched CuCr2Te4/Cr2Te3 heterostructure. The thickness&#8208;dependent room&#8208;temperature 2D ferromagnetic heterostructures are promising for constructing functional spintronic devices.








Abstract
Magnetic materials in 2D have attracted widespread attention for their intriguing magnetic properties. 2D magnetic heterostructures can provide unprecedented opportunities for exploring fundamental physics and novel spintronic devices. Here, the heteroepitaxial growth of ferromagnetic CuCr2Te4 nanosheets is reported on Cr2Te3 and mica by chemical vapor deposition. Magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect measurements reveal the thickness&#8208;dependent ferromagnetism of CuCr2Te4 nanosheets on mica, where a decrease of Curie temperature (TC) from 320 to 260&#160;K and an enhancement of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with reducing thickness are observed. Moreover, lattice&#8208;matched heteroepitaxial ultrathin CuCr2Te4 on Cr2Te3 exhibits an enhanced robust ferromagnetism with TC up to 340&#160;K due to the interfacial charge transfer. Stripe&#8208;type magnetic domains and single magnetic domain are discovered in this heterostructure with different thicknesses. The work provides a way to construct robust room&#8208;temperature 2D magnetic heterostructures for functional spintronic devices.

M&#8208;CAR Ts are created by decorating CAR T cells with immunomagnetic beads using click conjugation, and they are capable of magnetic&#8211;acoustic actuation for precision targeting and antitumor immune responses, resulting in a 6.6&#8208;fold increase in accumulated CAR T. Anti&#8208;CD3/CD28 immunomagnetic beads stimulate infiltrated CAR T proliferation and activation in situ, significantly enhancing their antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Despite its clinical success, chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T)&#8208;cell immunotherapy remains limited in solid tumors, owing to the harsh physical barriers and immunosuppressive microenvironment. Here a CAR&#8208;T&#8208;cell&#8208;based live microrobot (M&#8208;CAR T) is created by decorating CAR T with immunomagnetic beads using click conjugation. M&#8208;CAR Ts are capable of magnetic&#8211;acoustic actuation for precision targeting and in situ activation of antitumor immune responses. Sequential actuation endows M&#8208;CAR Ts with magnetically actuated anti&#8208;flow and obstacle avoidance as well as tissue penetration driven by acoustic propulsion, enabling efficient migration and accumulation in artificial tumor models. In vivo, sequentially actuated M&#8208;CAR Ts achieves long&#8208;distance targeting and accumulate at the peritumoural area under programmable magnetic guidance, and subsequently acoustic tweezers actuate M&#8208;CAR Ts to migrate&#160;into deep tumor tissues, resulting in a 6.6&#8208;fold increase in accumulated exogenous CD8+ CAR T cells compared with that without actuation. Anti&#8208;CD3/CD28 immunomagnetic beads stimulate infiltrated CAR T proliferation and activation in situ, significantly enhancing their antitumor efficacy. Thus, this&#160;sequential&#8208;actuation&#8208;guided cell microrobot combines the merits of autonomous targeting and penetration of intelligent robots with in situ T&#8208;cell immunoactivation, and holds considerable promise for precision navigation and cancer immunotherapies.

         <title>Blocking Spatiotemporal Crosstalk between Subcellular Organelles for Enhancing Anticancer Therapy with Nanointercepters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organelle communication interception nanosystem is constructed with an amorphous Fe0 core and an ultrathin crystalline Fe3O4 shell (ACFeNPs). &#183;OH can efficiently generate along with the spatiotemporal trajectory of ACFeNPs within tumor cells. ACFeNPs transfer from lysosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum and block the crosstalk between them, sequentially trigger&#160;AMPK/mTOR, lysosomal damage, and the IRE1/JNK signaling pathway, ultimately inducing deep apoptosis of tumor cells that cannot be alleviated. All experiments confirm the enhanced tumor inhibition of the organelle communication spatiotemporal interception strategy and reveal the biomolecular mechanism.








Abstract
The spatiotemporal characterization of signaling crosstalk between subcellular organelles is crucial for the therapeutic effect of malignant tumors. Blocking interactive crosstalk in this fashion is significant but challenging. Herein, a communication interception strategy is reported, which blocks spatiotemporal crosstalk between subcellular organelles for cancer therapy with underlying molecular mechanisms. Briefly, amorphous&#8208;core@crystalline&#8208;shell Fe@Fe3O4 nanoparticles (ACFeNPs) are fabricated to specifically block the crosstalk between lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by hydroxyl radicals generated along with their trajectory through heterogeneous Fenton reaction. ACFeNPs initially enter lysosomes and trigger autophagy, then continuous lysosomal damage blocks the generation of functional autolysosomes, which mediates ER&#8211;lysosome crosstalk, thus the autophagy is paralyzed. Thereafter, released ACFeNPs from lysosomes induce ER stress. Without the alleviation by autophagy, the ER&#8208;stress&#8208;associated apoptotic pathway is fully activated, resulting in a remarkable therapeutic effect. This strategy provides a wide venue for nanomedicine to exert biological advantages and confers new perspective for the design of novel anticancer drugs.

         <title>Young Exosome Bio&#8208;Nanoparticles Restore Aging&#8208;Impaired Tendon Stem/Progenitor Cell Function and Reparative Capacity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exosome&#160;bio&#8208;nanoparticles from stem cells of human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED&#8208;Exos) inhibit senescent phenotypes of aged tendon stem/progenitor cells and rescue their tenogenic differentiation capacity by inhibiting histone methylation and nuclear factor&#8208;&#954;B. Local delivery of SHED&#8208;Exos&#8208;loaded microspheres exhibits excellent anti&#8208;aging effects, including reducing senescent cells and heterotopic&#160;ossification, and thereby restores endogenous tendon regeneration capacity in aged rats.








Abstract
Aging impairs tendon stem/progenitor&#160;cell function and tendon homeostasis, however, effective treatments for aging&#8208;induced tendon diseases are lacking. Exosomes are naturally derived nanoparticles that contain bioactive molecules, and therefore, have attracted great interest in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In this study, it is shown that young exosomes secreted by stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED&#8208;Exos) possess abundant anti&#8208;aging signals. These young bio&#8208;nanoparticles can alleviate the aging phenotypes of aged tendon stem/progenitor cells (AT&#8208;SCs) and maintain their tenogenic capacity. Mechanistically, SHED&#8208;Exos modulate histone methylation and inhibit nuclear factor&#8208;&#954;B to reverse AT&#8208;SC aging. In a naturally aging mouse model, systemic administration of SHED&#8208;Exo bio&#8208;nanoparticles retards tendon degeneration. Interestingly, local delivery of SHED&#8208;Exos&#8208;loaded microspheres confers anti&#8208;aging phenotypes, including reduced senescent cells and decreased ectopic bone formation, thereby functionally and structurally rescuing endogenous tendon regeneration and repair capacity in aged rats. Overall, SHED&#8208;Exos, as natural bioactive nanoparticles, have promising translational and therapeutic potential for aging&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Tough Hydrogel Electrolytes for Anti&#8208;Freezing Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>

Co&#8208;nonsolvency and &#8220;salting&#8208;out&#8221; are synergistically utilized to create a flexible electrolyte with superior strength, freezing tolerance, high mass transport (10&#215; lower overpotential over semi&#8208;closed&#8208;pore&#160;counterparts), and stable cycling, benefitting from the suppressed dendritic growth and side reactions (30&#8201;000 cycles), which pushes the limit of flexible batteries toward higher stability in harsh environments.








Abstract
As the soaring demand for energy storage continues to grow, batteries that can cope with extreme conditions are highly desired. Yet, existing battery materials are limited by weak mechanical properties and freeze&#8208;vulnerability, prohibiting safe energy storage in devices that are exposed to low temperature and unusual mechanical impacts. Herein, a fabrication method harnessing the synergistic effect of co&#8208;nonsolvency and &#8220;salting&#8208;out&#8221; that can produce poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel electrolytes with unique open&#8208;cell porous structures, composed of strongly aggregated polymer chains, and containing disrupted hydrogen bonds among free water molecules, is introduced. The hydrogel electrolyte simultaneously combines high strength (tensile strength 15.6&#160;MPa), freeze&#8208;tolerance (&lt;&#160;&#8722;77 &#176;C), high mass transport (10&#215; lower overpotential), and dendrite and parasitic reactions suppression for stable performance (30&#8201;000 cycles). The high generality of this method is further demonstrated with poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) and poly(N&#8208;tertbutylacrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;acrylamide) hydrogels. This work takes a further step toward flexible battery development for harsh environments.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanosecond 2D Perovskite Scintillators by Dielectric Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design strategy to shorten the scintillation decay time by maximizing the dielectric difference between organic amines and [PbBr6]2&#8722; octahedral emitters in 2D perovskites is shown. Benzimidazole (BM) with conjugated structure inserts between [PbBr6]2&#8722; layers, shortening the emitting decay time into sub&#8208;nanosecond region. The sub&#8208;nanosecond BM2PbBr4 scintillator exhibits excellent performance in high energy photons and particles detection.








Abstract
Perovskite materials have demonstrated great potential for ultrafast scintillators with high light yield. However, the decay time of perovskite still cannot be further minimized into sub&#8208;nanosecond region, while sub&#8208;nanosecond scintillators are highly demanded in various radiation detection, including high speed X&#8208;ray imaging, time&#8208;of&#8208;flight based tomography or particle discrimination, and timing resolution measurement in synchrotron radiation facilities, etc. Here, a rational design strategy is showed to shorten the scintillation decay time, by maximizing the dielectric difference between organic amines and Pb&#8208;Br octahedral emitters in 2D organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHP). Benzimidazole (BM) with low dielectric constant inserted between [PbBr6]2&#8722; layers, resulting in a surprisingly large exciton binding energy (360.3 &#177; 4.8 meV) of 2D OIHP BM2PbBr4. The emitting decay time is shortened as 0.97&#160;ns, which is smallest among all the perovskite materials. Moreover, the light yield is 3190&#160;photons&#160;MeV&#8722;1, which is greatly higher than conventional ultrafast scintillator BaF2 (1500&#160;photons&#160;MeV&#8722;1). The rare combination of ultrafast decay time and considerable light yield renders BM2PbBr4 excellent performance in &#947;&#8208;ray, neutron, &#945;&#8208;particle detection, and the best theoretical coincidence time resolution of 65.1&#160;ps, which is only half of the reference sample LYSO (141.3&#160;ps).

         <title>Tetramode Metamaterials as Phonon Polarizers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An experimental realization and application of a tetramode material are presented. According to Cauchy elasticity, four out of the six deformation modes of such materials are considered &#8220;easy&#8221;. A property that can be exploited as a compact broadband polarizer for transverse phonons. This is demonstrated experimentally with a 3D metamaterial structure fabricated using direct laser writing.








Abstract
In classical Cauchy elasticity, 3D materials exhibit six eigenmodes of deformation. Following the 1995 work of Milton and Cherkaev, extremal elastic materials can be classified by the number of eigenmodes, N, out of these six that are &#8220;easy&#8221;. Using Greek number words, this leads to hexamode (N&#160;= 6), pentamode (N&#160;= 5), tetramode (N&#160;= 4), trimode (N&#160;= 3), dimode (N&#160;= 2), and monomode (N&#160;= 1) materials. While hexamode materials are unstable in all regards, the possibility of pentamode metamaterials (&#8220;meta&#8208;fluids&#8221;) has attracted considerable attention throughout the last decade. Here, inspired by the 2021 theoretical work of Wei, Liu, and Hu, microstructured 3D polymer&#8208;based tetramode metamaterials are designed and characterized by numerical band&#8208;structure calculations, fabricated by laser printing, characterized by ultrasound experiments, and compared to the theoretical ideal. An application in terms of a compact and broadband polarizer for acoustical phonons at ultrasound frequencies is demonstrated.

         <title>Prominent Free Charges Tunneling Through Organic Interlayer of 2D Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We&#160;have constructed convertible RP (4AEPy)2PbI4 and DJ (4AEPy)PbI4 perovskite with one organic amine through a protonation control strategy. Organic cations in (4AEPy)PbI4 participate in band edge construction, making its exciton binding energy as low as 27.3 meV and producing more free carriers.








Abstract
The diversity of organic cations greatly enriches the species of 2D perovskites; traditional 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) and Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ) perovskites are synthesized by two different organic amines. Here, according to the difference in pKa values between conjugated acids of monoprotonated and biprotonated 4&#8208;(2&#8208;Aminoethyl)pyridine (4AEPy) ions, the 2D perovskites of RP (4AEPy)2PbI4 and DJ (4AEPy)PbI4 from same organic amine is reported, which can realize reversible transformation under the treatment of HI and NH3, respectively. The interaction of N&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N hydrogen bond between adjacent organic molecules in (4AEPy)2PbI4 leads to the bending conformation of ethylamine groups, which results in a 2.4 &#197; reduction in layer spacing compared to typical phenylethylamine lead iodine ((PEA)2PbI4) 2D perovskite. Besides, the ethylamine groups of organic layers in (4AEPy)PbI4 are deeply inserted into octahedral cavities and directly participate in the construction of the conduction band minimum, which leads to a small exciton binding energy of 27.3 meV&#160;to&#160;generate&#160;free&#160;charges. The stronger coupling between the organic and inorganic layers and the minor exciton binding energy can promote the DJ phase to possess a more stable structure and better optoelectronic properties. Thus&#160;the (4AEPy)PbI4 device displays better light response and X&#8208;ray detection capability with a high sensitivity of 5627 &#181;C Gyair&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 and the lowest detectable dose rate of 20 nGyair s&#8208;1.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Fabrication of Ultrathin Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facile fabrication of ultrathin NUS&#8208;8 membranes in large area (&gt;200 cm2) with remarkable homogeneity and texture along [00l] direction is presented. This stems from the superior solution processability of the NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets synthesized via a scalable approach. The resultant NUS&#8208;8 membranes exhibit outstanding rejections toward various metal ion and dye solutions while at modest permeance compared with other reported membranes.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based membranes, featuring potential molecular sieving effects and therefore capable of surmounting the ubiquitous trade&#8208;off between membrane selectivity and permeability, hold great promise for multitudinous chemical separations. Nevertheless, it remains highly challenging for the large&#8208;area fabrication of ultrathin MOF membranes with variable thickness, great homogeneity, and preferential orientation. Herein, this work reports the facile fabrication of ultrathin (down to 20&#160;nm) NUS&#8208;8 membranes in large&#8208;area (&gt;200 cm2) yet with great homogeneity and texture along (00l) direction due to the superior solution processability of the as&#8208;synthesized NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets. The resultant NUS&#8208;8 membranes with good adhesion properties and certain flexibility exhibit excellent rejections (&gt;98% for Mg2+ and Al3+, and dyes with molecular weights larger than 585.5 g mol&#8722;1) toward aqueous separation of various metal ions and dyes at modest permeance (1&#8211;3.2 L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1) due to the well&#8208;aligned structures. Such separation performance outstands among polymetric membranes, thin&#8208;film composite membranes, mixed matrix membranes, and other MOF membranes reported in the literature. The separation mechanism is reasonably discussed based on the experimental and theoretical results. This study opens up novel perspectives for preparing ultrathin and large&#8208;area MOF membranes using the solution processability of MOFs.

         <title>Interlayer&#8208;Spacing Engineering of Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Single Crystal for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>

A new A&#8208;site cation aminoguanidinium (AG) with all&#8208;NH2 terminals is designed to shorten the interlayer spacing of A3Bi2I9&#8208;type HPs by forming more and stronger N&#63743;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I hydrogen bonds and large AG3Bi2I9 single crystals (SCs) are prepared. The interlayer spacing shortened AG3Bi2I9 SC shows a large mobility&#8208;lifetime product, high sensitivity and low detection limit in X&#8208;ray detection, high spatial resolution in X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free A3Bi2I9&#8208;type perovskites are demonstrated as a class of promising semiconductors for high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detection due to their high bulk resistivity and strong X&#8208;ray absorption, as well as reduced ion migration. However, due to their long interlamellar distance along their c&#8208;axis, their limited carrier transport along the vertical direction is a bottleneck for their detection sensitivity. Herein, a new A&#8208;site cation of aminoguanidinium (AG) with all&#8208;NH2 terminals is designed to shorten the interlayer spacing by forming more and stronger N&#63743;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I hydrogen bonds. The prepared large AG3Bi2I9 single crystals (SCs) render shorter interlamellar distance for a larger mobility&#8208;lifetime product of 7.94&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1, which is three times higher than the value measured on the best MA3Bi2I9 SC (2.87 &#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1). Therefore, the X&#8208;ray detectors fabricated on the AG3Bi2I9 SC exhibit high sensitivity of 5791 uC&#160;Gy&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2, a low detection limit of 2.6&#160;nGy s&#8722;1, and a short response time of 690&#160;&#181;s, all of which are far better than those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MA3Bi2I9 SC detectors. The combination of high sensitivity and high stability enables astonishingly high spatial resolution (8.7 lp&#160;mm&#8722;1) X&#8208;ray imaging. This work will facilitate the development of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance lead&#8208;free X&#8208;ray detectors.

         <title>Multiexciton Generation from a 2D Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskite with Nearly 200% Quantum Yield of Red Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiexciton generation (MEG) is found in a 2D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite, phenylammonium cadmium chloride (PACC). The MEG effect induced by Mn2+ doping improves the red phosphorescent quantum yield of PACC from 6% to nearly 200%, thus resulting in a switching from blue to red afterglow.








Abstract
2D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) show obvious advantages in the field of optoelectronics due to their high luminescent stability and good solution processability. However, the thermal quenching and self&#8208;absorption of excitons caused by the strong interaction between the inorganic metal ions lead to a low luminescence efficiency of 2D perovskites. Herein, a 2D Cd&#8208;based OIHP phenylammonium cadmium chloride&#160;(PACC) with a weak red phosphorescence (&#934;P&#160;&lt; 6%) at 620&#160;nm and a blue afterglow is reported. Interestingly, the Mn&#8208;doped PACC exhibits very strong red emission with nearly 200% quantum yield and 15&#160;ms lifetime, thus resulting in a red afterglow. The experimental data prove that the doping of Mn2+ not only induces the multiexciton generation (MEG) process of the perovskite, avoiding the energy loss of inorganic excitons, but also promotes the Dexter energy transfer from organic triplet excitons to inorganic excitons, thus realizing the superefficient red&#8208;light emission of Cd2+. This work suggests that guest metal ions can induce host metal ions to realize MEG in 2D bulk OIHPs, which provides a new idea for the development of optoelectronic materials and devices with ultrahigh energy utilization.

         <title>Full Control of Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Electrostatic Gating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled operation of solid&#8208;state electrolytes for gating applications is demonstrated via the realization of high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistor, free of the spurious effects caused by electrochemical reactions. The devices exhibit high geometrical capacitances 20&#8202;&#8211;&#8202;50&#8287;&#181;F&#8287;cm&#8722;2\[20--50\:\mu {\rm{F}}\:{\rm{c}}{{\rm{m}}^{ - 2}}\] (depending on the polarity of the accumulated charges) enabling the accumulation of electron densities above 1014 cm&#8722;2, to gate&#8208;induced superconductivity, and to perform ionic&#8208;gate spectroscopy.








Abstract
Ionic gating is a powerful technique to realize field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) enabling experiments not possible otherwise. So far, ionic gating has relied on the use of top electrolyte gates, which pose experimental constraints and make device fabrication complex. Promising results obtained recently in FETs based on solid&#8208;state electrolytes remain plagued by spurious phenomena of unknown origin, preventing proper transistor operation, and causing limited control and reproducibility. Here, a class of solid&#8208;state electrolytes for gating (Lithium&#8208;ion conducting glass&#8208;ceramics, LICGCs) is explored, the processes responsible for the spurious phenomena and irreproducible behavior are identified, and properly functioning transistors exhibiting high density ambipolar operation with gate capacitance of &#8776;20&#8202;&#8722;&#8202;50&#8201;&#181;F cm&#8722;2\[20{\bm{ - }}50\;\mu F c{m^{{\bm{ - }}2}}\] (depending on the polarity of the accumulated charges) are demonstrated. Using 2D semiconducting transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides, the ability to implement ionic&#8208;gate spectroscopy to determine the semiconducting bandgap, and to accumulate electron densities above 1014 cm&#8722;2 are demostrated, resulting in gate&#8208;induced superconductivity in MoS2 multilayers. As LICGCs are implemented in a back&#8208;gate configuration, they leave the surface of the material exposed, enabling the use of surface&#8208;sensitive techniques (such as scanning tunneling microscopy and photoemission spectroscopy) impossible so far in ionic&#8208;gated devices. They also allow double ionic gated devices providing independent control of charge density and electric&#160;field.

         <title>Controllable Oxidation of ZrS2 to Prepare High&#8208;&#954;, Single&#8208;Crystal m&#8208;ZrO2 for 2D Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controllable preparation of ultrathin monoclinic ZrO2 (m&#8208;ZrO2) single crystals (EOT&#8776;0.29 nm, EOT is equivalent oxide thickness) via thermal oxidation of ZrS2 is achieved. By using K3[Fe(CN)6] as seeding, the large&#8208;scale parent ZrS2 is easily grown. The grown m&#8208;ZrO2 presents a high dielectric constant of &#8776;19 and a breakdown voltage of &#8776;7.22 MV cm&#8722;1. Using m&#8208;ZrO2 as top gate dielectric, the MoS2 field effect transistor (FET) shows excellent device performance.








Abstract
High&#8208;&#954; materials that exhibit large permittivity and band gaps are needed as gate dielectrics to enhance capacitance and prevent leakage current in downsized technology nodes. Among these, monoclinic ZrO2 (m&#8208;ZrO2) shows good potential because of its inertness and high&#8208;&#954; with respect to SiO2, but a method to produce ultrathin single crystal is lacking. Here, the controllable preparation of ultrathin m&#8208;ZrO2 single crystals via the in situ thermal oxidation of ZrS2 is achieved. As&#8208;grown m&#8208;ZrO2 presents an equivalent oxide thickness of &#8776;0.29&#160;nm, a high dielectric constant of &#8776;19, and a breakdown voltage (EBD) of &#8776;7.22 MV cm&#8722;1. MoS2 field effect transistor (FET) by using m&#8208;ZrO2 as a dielectric layer shows comparable mobility to that using SiO2 dielectric. The ultraclean interface of m&#8208;ZrO2/MoS2 and high crystalline quality of m&#8208;ZrO2 lead to negligible hysteresis in transfer curves. Single crystal m&#8208;ZrO2 dielectric shows potential application in digital complementary metal oxidesemiconductor (CMOS) logic FET.

By using K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] as seeding, the large-scale parent ZrS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is easily grown. The grown m-ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; presents a high dielectric constant of &#8776;19 and a breakdown voltage of &#8776;7.22 MV cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Using m-ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as top gate dielectric, the MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; field effect transistor (FET) shows excellent device performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-&#954; materials that exhibit large permittivity and band gaps are needed as gate dielectrics to enhance capacitance and prevent leakage current in downsized technology nodes. Among these, monoclinic ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (m-ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) shows good potential because of its inertness and high-&#954; with respect to SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but a method to produce ultrathin single crystal is lacking. Here, the controllable preparation of ultrathin m-ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals via the in situ thermal oxidation of ZrS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is achieved. As-grown m-ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; presents an equivalent oxide thickness of &#8776;0.29&#160;nm, a high dielectric constant of &#8776;19, and a breakdown voltage (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;BD&lt;/sub&gt;) of &#8776;7.22 MV cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; field effect transistor (FET) by using m-ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a dielectric layer shows comparable mobility to that using SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dielectric. The ultraclean interface of m-ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and high crystalline quality of m-ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lead to negligible hysteresis in transfer curves. Single crystal m-ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dielectric shows potential application in digital complementary metal oxidesemiconductor (CMOS) logic FET.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constructing a Uniform and Stable Mixed Conductive Layer to Stabilize the Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte/Li Interface by Cold Bonding at Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The great potential of the application of room&#8208;temperature in the situ cold bonding technique for the rational design and optimization of LLZ/Li interfaces with low cost, high safety and operability is highlighted. The prepared RT&#8208;MCL shows good interfacial compatibility and excellent electrochemical properties.








Abstract
Garnet&#8208;type Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZ) electrolyte&#160;is a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries, while its applications are hindered by interfacial problems. Although the utilization of functional coatings and molten lithium (Li) effectively solves the LLZ interfacial compatibility problem with Li metal, it poses problems such as high cost, high danger, and structural damage. Herein, a mixed conductive layer (MCL) is introduced at the LLZ/Li interface (RT&#8208;MCL) via an in situ cold bonding process at room temperature. Such a stable and compact RT&#8208;MCL can effectively suppress side reactions and protect the crystal structure of LLZ, and it also inhibits growth of Li dendrites and promotes uniform Li deposition. The critical current density (CCD) of the Li symmetric cell composed of RT&#8208;MCL&#8208;LLZ is increased to 1.8&#160;mA cm&#8208;2 and provides stable cycling performance over 2000 h under 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8208;2. Additionally, this in situ cold bonding treatment can significantly reduce cost and eliminate potential safety issues caused by the high&#8208;temperature processing of Li metal. This work highlights tremendous potential of this cold bonding technique in the reasonable design and optimization of the LLZ/Li interface.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Changeable Dynamic Conformal Electrode/electrolyte Interlayer enabling Pressure&#8208;Independent Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic conformal interlayer with the reversible phase&#8208;changeable feature is developed. This interlayer (P&#8208;P&#8208;I) comprises PCL polymer skeleton, PC cosolvent, and LiTFSI salt, exhibiting high ionic conductivity of 1.3 &#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 S&#160;cm&#8722;1, strong adhesion bonding (250 N pulling&#8208;out resistance), and reversible phase&#8208;change property, disengaging Li&#8208;SSBs from pressure dependence and solving the issue of SSE/Li interfacial morphological degeneration.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries (Li&#8208;SSBs) are one of the most promising energy storage devices due to their high energy densities. However, under insufficient pressure constraints (&lt;MPa&#8208;level), Li&#8208;SSBs usually exhibit poor electrochemical performances owing to the continuous interfacial degradation between the solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) and electrodes. Herein, a phase&#8208;changeable interlayer is developed to construct the self&#8208;adhesive and dynamic conformal electrode/SSE contact in Li&#8208;SSBs. The strong adhesive and cohesive strengths of the phase&#8208;changeable interlayer enable Li&#8208;SSBs to resist up to 250 N pulling force (=1.9&#160;MPa), affording Li&#8208;SSBs ideal interfacial integrality even without extra stack pressure. Remarkably, this interlayer exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 1.3 &#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1, attributed to the shortened steric solvation hindrance and optimized Li+ coordination structure. Furthermore, the changeable phase property of the interlayer endows Li&#8208;SSBs with a healable Li/SSE interface, accommodating the stress&#8211;strain evolution of the lithium metal and constructing the dynamic conformal interface. Consequently, the contact impedance of the modified solid symmetric cell exhibits a pressure&#8208;independent manner and does not increase over 700&#160;h (0.2&#160;MPa). The LiFePO4 pouch cell with the phase&#8208;changeable interlayer shows 85% capacity retention after 400 cycles at a low pressure of 0.1&#160;MPa.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;fast Piezocatalysts Enabled By Interfacial Interaction of Reduced Graphene Oxide/MoS2 Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rGO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructure (GMH) shows a record&#8208;high piezo&#8208;catalytic degradation rate and can totally degrade the organic dyes within 50 s. The fundamental interfacial phenomena and the charge transfer in GMH are carefully examined by theoretical and experimental methods. It opens a new door for creation of new piezo&#8208;catalysts and toward a deeper understanding of the mechanism of piezo&#8208;catalysis.








Abstract
The catalytic activity has been investigated in 2D materials, and the unique structural and electronic properties contribute to their success in conventional heterogeneous catalysis. Heterojunction&#8208;based piezocatalysis has attracted increasing attention due to the band&#8208;structure engineering and the enhanced charge carrier separation by prominent piezoelectric effect. However, the piezocatalytic behavior of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is still unknown, and the finite active sites, catalyst poisoning, and poor conductivity are challenges for developing good piezocatalysts. Herein, a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)&#8208;MoS2 heterostructure is rationally designed to tackle these challenges. The heterostructure shows a record&#8208;high piezocatalytic degradation rate of 1.40 &#215; 102 L mol&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which is 7.86 times higher than MoS2 nanosheets. Piezoresponse force microscope measurements and density functional theory calculation reveal that the coupling between semiconductive and piezoelectric properties in the vdW heterojunction is vital to break the metallic state screening effect at the MoS2 edge for keeping the piezoelectric potential. The dynamic charges generated by MoS2 and the fast charge transfer in rGO activate and maintain catalytically active sites for pollutant degradation with an ultra&#8208;fast rate and good stability. The working mechanism opens new avenues for developing efficient catalysts significant to wastewater treatments and other applications.

         <title>PIP2 Alteration Caused by Elastic Modulus and Tropism of Electrospun Scaffolds Facilitates Altered BMSCs Proliferation and Differentiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high expression of PIP2 on the tropic fibers with low elastic modulus is the main reason for the increased potential of stem cell proliferation and differentiation. The cells on random fibers or high elastic modulus aligned fibers&#160;were&#160;altered by BCL&#8208;6 and miR&#8208;126&#8208;5p mediated regulatory mechanisms to be consistent with cells on low elastic modulus aligned fibers.








Abstract
Aligned submicron fibers have played an essential role in inducing stem cell proliferation and differentiation. In this study, it is aimed to identify the differential causes of stem cell proliferation and differentiation between bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on aligned&#8208;random fibers with different elastic modulus, and to change the differential levels through a regulatory mechanism mediated by B&#8208;cell lymphoma 6 protein(BCL&#8208;6) and miRNA&#8208;126&#8208;5p(miR&#8208;126&#8208;5p). The results showed that phosphatidylinositol(4,5)bisphosphate alterations are found in the aligned fibers compared with the random fibers, which has a regular and oriented structure, excellent cytocompatibility, regular cytoskeleton, and high differentiation potential. The same trend is actual for the aligned fibers with a lower elastic modulus. The level of proliferative differentiation genes in cells is altered by BCL&#8208;6 and miR&#8208;126&#8208;5p mediated regulatory mechanisms to make the cell distribution nearly consistent with the cell state on low elastic modulus aligned fibers.

     alt="PIP2 Alteration Caused by Elastic Modulus and Tropism of Electrospun Scaffolds Facilitates Altered BMSCs Proliferation and Differentiation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high expression of PIP2 on the tropic fibers with low elastic modulus is the main reason for the increased potential of stem cell proliferation and differentiation. The cells on random fibers or high elastic modulus aligned fibers&#160;were&#160;altered by BCL-6 and miR-126-5p mediated regulatory mechanisms to be consistent with cells on low elastic modulus aligned fibers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aligned submicron fibers have played an essential role in inducing stem cell proliferation and differentiation. In this study, it is aimed to identify the differential causes of stem cell proliferation and differentiation between bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on aligned-random fibers with different elastic modulus, and to change the differential levels through a regulatory mechanism mediated by B-cell lymphoma 6 protein(BCL-6) and miRNA-126-5p(miR-126-5p). The results showed that phosphatidylinositol(4,5)bisphosphate alterations are found in the aligned fibers compared with the random fibers, which has a regular and oriented structure, excellent cytocompatibility, regular cytoskeleton, and high differentiation potential. The same trend is actual for the aligned fibers with a lower elastic modulus. The level of proliferative differentiation genes in cells is altered by BCL-6 and miR-126-5p mediated regulatory mechanisms to make the cell distribution nearly consistent with the cell state on low elastic modulus aligned fibers. This work demonstrates the reason for the difference of cells between the two kinds of fibers and on fibers with different elastic modulus. These findings provide more insights for understanding the gene-level regulation of cell growth in tissue engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling the Morphological and Physical Mechanism of Burn&#8208;in Loss Alleviation by Ternary Matrix Toward Stable and Efficient All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a high&#8208;efficiency ternary matrix platform for all&#8208;polymer solar cells, the operational stability enhancement strategy is proposed with carefully studied underlying reasons, in terms of morphology and photo&#8208;physics. Based on the &#8220;canceling&#8208;out&#8221; phenomenon, further ternary OPV blend design can be nourished by considering this principle during material combination, which can be useful in boosting both PCE and stability.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (All&#8208;PSCs) are considered the most promising candidate in achieving both efficient and stable organic photovoltaic devices, yet the field has rarely presented an in&#8208;depth understanding of corresponding device stability while efficiency is continuously boosted via the innovation of polymer acceptors. Herein, a ternary matrix is built for all&#8208;PSCs with optimized morphology, improved film ductility and importantly, boosted efficiency and better operational stability than its parental binary counterparts, as a platform to study the underlying mechanism. The target system PQM&#8208;Cl:PTQ10:PY&#8208;IT (0.8:0.2:1.2) exhibits an alleviated burn&#8208;in loss of morphology and efficiency under light soaking, which supports its promoted device lifetime. The comprehensive characterizations of fresh and light&#8208;soaked active layers lead to a clear illustration of opposite morphological and physical degradation direction of PQM&#8208;Cl and PTQ10, thus resulting in a delicate balance at the optimal ternary system. Specifically, the enlarging tendency of PQM&#8208;Cl and shrinking preference of PTQ10 in terms of phase separation leads to a stable morphology in their mixing phase; the hole transfer kinetics of PQM&#8208;Cl:PY&#8208;IT host is stabilized by incorporating PTQ10. This work succeeds in reaching a deep insight into all&#8208;PSC's stability promotion by a rational ternary design, which booms the prospect of gaining high&#8208;performance all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Functional Ultrathin Separators Proactively Stabilizing Zinc Anodes for Zinc&#8208;Based Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
23&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick functional ultrathin separators for zinc&#8208;based energy storage are reported. The separators are composed of a high&#8208;strength cellulose nanofiber substrate and a zincophilic sites&#8208;rich decoration layer, in which the former one presents uniform nanoporous structure, ion&#8208;sieving ability, and ultrathin thickness and the latter one possesses high specific surface area and abundant zincophilic sites, and thus can proactively stabilize zinc anodes.








Abstract
Ultrathin separators are indispensable to high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), but their easy failure caused by zinc dendrites poses a great challenge. Herein, 23&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick functional ultrathin separators (FUSs), realizing superb electrochemical stability of zinc anodes and outstanding long&#8208;term durability of ultrathin separators, are reported. In the FUSs, an ultrathin but mechanically strong nanoporous membrane substrate benefits fast and flux&#8208;homogenized Zn2+ transport, while a metal&#8211;organic&#160;framework&#160;(MOF)&#8208;derived C/Cu nanocomposite decoration layer provides rich low&#8208;barrier zinc nucleation sites, thereby synergistically stabilizing zinc anodes to inhibit zinc dendrites and dendrite&#8208;caused separator failure. Investigation of the zinc affinity of the MOF&#8208;derived C/Cu nanocomposites unravels the high zincophilicity of heteroatom&#8208;containing C/Cu interfaces. Zinc anodes coupled with the FUSs present superior electrochemical stability, whose operation lifetime exceeds 2000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 600&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 40&#8211;50 times longer than that of the zinc anodes using glass&#8208;fiber separators. The reliability of the FUSs in ZIBs and zinc&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors is also validated. This work proposes a new strategy to stabilize zinc anodes and provides theoretical guidance in developing ultrathin separators for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc&#8208;based energy storage.

         <title>Dynamic Reconstitution Between Copper Single Atoms and Clusters for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic C&#63743;N coupling between carbon dioxide and nitrate emerges to meet comprehensive demands of carbon footprint closing, valorization of waste, and sustainable manufacture of urea. Herein, the urea synthesis catalyzed by Cu1&#8211;CeO2 is reported. The dynamic reversible reconstitution of the catalyst configuration is monitored using operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectra and the Cu4 clusters are real active sites for electrocatalytic urea synthesis. Transform of clusters back to single&#8208;atom configurations occurs when the applied potential is switched to an open&#8208;circuit potential, endowing the catalyst with superior structural and electrochemical stabilities.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic C&#63743;N coupling between carbon dioxide and nitrate has emerged to meet the comprehensive demands of carbon footprint closing, valorization of waste, and sustainable manufacture of urea. However, the identification of catalytic active sites and the design of efficient electrocatalysts remain a challenge. Herein, the synthesis of urea catalyzed by copper single atoms decorated on a CeO2 support (denoted as Cu1&#8211;CeO2) is reported. The catalyst exhibits an average urea yield rate of 52.84&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 gcat.&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.6&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectra demonstrate the reconstitution of copper single atoms (Cu1) to clusters (Cu4) during electrolysis. These electrochemically reconstituted Cu4 clusters are real active sites for electrocatalytic urea synthesis. Favorable C&#63743;N coupling reactions and urea formation on Cu4 are validated using operando synchrotron&#8208;radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Dynamic and reversible transformations of clusters to single&#8208;atom configurations occur when the applied potential is switched to an open&#8208;circuit potential, endowing the catalyst with superior structural and electrochemical stabilities.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Specific Photothermal&#8208;Therapy&#8208;Assisted Immunomodulation via Multiresponsive Adjuvant Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;enzyme&#8208;near&#8208;infrared multi&#8208;responsive immune&#8208;adjuvant nanoparticle is fabricated to perform tumor&#8208;specific photothermal therapy and photothermal&#8208;assisted manipulation of immune cells including dendritic cells, macrophages, and T cells for effective treatment of malignant tumor, which significantly inhibits the primary tumor and its metastasis, resulting in the dramatic enhancement of survival rate of lung metastatic tumor&#8208;bearing mice.








Abstract
Multiresponsive adjuvant nanoparticles (RMmAGL) are fabricated to perform tumor&#8208;specific photothermal therapy while regulating the behavior of tumor&#8208;associated immune cells for primary tumor eradication and metastasis inhibition. Core&#8211;satellite&#8208;like RMmAGL have a core of mannose&#8208;functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded with the TLR7 agonist imiquimod (R837@MSN&#8208;mannose) connected via hydrazone bonds to satellites of glutamine (Glu)&#8208; and lysine (Lys)&#8208;comodified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys). During therapy, the acidic environment in tumor tissue cleaves the hydrazone bonds to release AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys, which further accumulate in tumor cells. After internalization, photothermal agents (aggregated AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys) are generated in situ through the intratumoral enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reaction between Glu and Lys, resulting in tumor&#8208;specific photothermal therapy. The detachment of AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys also triggers the release of R837, which matured dendritic cells (DCs) via a vaccine&#8208;like mechanism along with the tumor&#8208;associated antigens generated by photothermal therapy.

&lt;p&gt;A pH-enzyme-near-infrared multi-responsive immune-adjuvant nanoparticle is fabricated to perform tumor-specific photothermal therapy and photothermal-assisted manipulation of immune cells including dendritic cells, macrophages, and T cells for effective treatment of malignant tumor, which significantly inhibits the primary tumor and its metastasis, resulting in the dramatic enhancement of survival rate of lung metastatic tumor-bearing mice.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiresponsive adjuvant nanoparticles (RMmAGL) are fabricated to perform tumor-specific photothermal therapy while regulating the behavior of tumor-associated immune cells for primary tumor eradication and metastasis inhibition. Core&#8211;satellite-like RMmAGL have a core of mannose-functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded with the TLR7 agonist imiquimod (R837@MSN-mannose) connected via hydrazone bonds to satellites of glutamine (Glu)- and lysine (Lys)-comodified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs-Glu/Lys). During therapy, the acidic environment in tumor tissue cleaves the hydrazone bonds to release AuNPs-Glu/Lys, which further accumulate in tumor cells. After internalization, photothermal agents (aggregated AuNPs-Glu/Lys) are generated in situ through the intratumoral enzyme-catalyzed reaction between Glu and Lys, resulting in tumor-specific photothermal therapy. The detachment of AuNPs-Glu/Lys also triggers the release of R837, which matured dendritic cells (DCs) via a vaccine-like mechanism along with the tumor-associated antigens generated by photothermal therapy. These matured DCs further activates surrounding T cells for immunotherapy. Moreover, the resulting free MSN-mannose serves as an artificial glycocalyx to continuously induce the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages from an immunosuppressive phenotype to an inflammatory phenotype, thus further enhancing immunotherapy. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate significant inhibition of malignant tumors after therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intrinsic Dipole Arrangement to Coordinate Energy Levels for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ordered arrangement of methylamine dipoles is induced by the polar molecule to form a top&#8208;down macroscopic polarization of the film. Reorientation of dipoles contributes to forming a gradient energy band and changes the surrounding dielectric environment, facilitating efficient separation and directional transport of carriers. The photoelectric conversion efficiency and stability of the perovskite solar cells are significantly improved.








Abstract
Despite great progress in perovskite photovoltaics, it should be noted that the intrinsic disorder dipolar cations in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites exert negative effects on the energy band structure as well as the carrier separation and transfer dynamics. However, oriented polarization achieved by applying an external electric field may cause irreversible damage to perovskites. Herein, a unique and efficient strategy is developed to modulate the intrinsic dipole arrangement in perovskite films for high&#8208;performance and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The spontaneous reorientation of dipolar cation methylamine is triggered by a polar molecule, constructing a vertical polarization during crystallization regulation. The oriented dipole determines a gradient energy&#8208;level arrangement in PSCs and more favorable energetics at interfaces, effectively enhancing the built&#8208;in electric field and suppressing the nonradiative recombination. Besides, the dipole reorientation induces a local dielectric environment to remarkably reduce exciton binding energy, leading to an ultralong carrier diffusion length of up to 1708&#160;nm. Accordingly, the n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSCs achieve a significant increase in power conversion efficiency, reaching 24.63% with negligible hysteresis and exhibiting outstanding stabilities. This strategy also provides a facile route to eliminate the mismatched energetics and enhance carrier dynamics for other novel photovoltaic devices.

         <title>A Heteroanionic Zinc Ion Conductor for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heteroanionic compound (ZnyO1&#8722;xFx, ZOF) with an aliovalent F&#8208;doped wurtzite motif shows selective Zn2+ conductivity to regulate zinc migration and deposition. ZOF@Zn anode exhibits a low overpotential of 13.3&#160;mV at 0.2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2 in symmetric cells, and high stability of 169.7&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8211;1 in MnO2//Zn full batteries for 1000 cycles.








Abstract
Although zinc&#8208;based batteries are promising candidates for eco&#8208;friendly and cost&#8208;effective energy storage devices, their performance is severely retarded by dendrite formation. As the simplest zinc compounds, zinc chalcogenides, and halides are individually applied as a Zn protection layer due to high zinc ion conductivity. However, the mixed&#8208;anion compounds are not studied, which constrains the Zn2+ diffusion in single&#8208;anion lattices to their own limits. A heteroanionic zinc ion conductor (ZnyO1&#8722;xFx) coating layer is designed by in situ growth method with tunable F content and thickness. Strengthened by F aliovalent doping, the Zn2+ conductivity is enhanced within the wurtzite motif for rapid lattice Zn migration. ZnyO1&#8722;xFx also affords zincophilic sites for oriented superficial Zn plating to suppress dendrite growth. Therefore, ZnyO1&#8722;xFx&#8208;coated anode exhibits a low overpotential of 20.4&#160;mV for 1000&#160;h cycle life at a plating capacity of 1.0&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;cm&#8722;2 during symmetrical cell test. The MnO2//Zn full battery further proves high stability of 169.7 mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 for 1000 cycles. This work may enlighten the mixed&#8208;anion tuning for high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>Chelated Ion&#8208;Exchange Strategy toward BiOCl Mesoporous Single&#8208;Crystalline Nanosheets for Boosting Photocatalytic Selective Aromatic Alcohols Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a chelated ion&#8208;exchange strategy is proposed to synthesize BiOCl mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline nanosheets (BiOCl MSCN) with ultra&#8208;thin structure by chelating interaction of Bi3+ ions and acetate ions, and ion exchange between Cl&#8722; ions and acetate ions. The prepared BiOCl MSCN exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity stability and general adaptability for oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde.








Abstract
The photoresponse and photocatalytic efficiency of bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) are greatly limited by rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers. The construction of porous single&#8208;crystal BiOCl photocatalyst can effectively alleviate this issue and provide accessible active sites. Herein, a facile chelated ion&#8208;exchange strategy is developed to synthesize BiOCl mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline nanosheets (BiOCl MSCN) using acetic acid and ammonia solution respectively as chelating agent and ionization promoter. The strong chelation between acetate ions and Bi3+ ions introduces acetate ions into the precipitated product to exchange with Cl&#8208; ions, resulting in large lattice mismatch, strain release, and formation of void&#8208;like mesopores. The prepared BiOCl MSCN photocatalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance with 99% conversion and 98% selectivity for oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and superior general adaptability for various aromatic alcohols. The theoretical calculations and characterizations confirm that the superior performance is mainly attributed to the abundant oxygen vacancies, plenty of accessible adsorption/active sites and fast charge transport path without grain boundaries.

         <title>Piezocatalytic 2D WS2 Nanosheets for Ultrasound&#8208;Triggered and Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Piezodynamic Cancer Therapy Synergized with Energy Metabolism&#8208;Targeted Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezocatalytic 2D WS2 nanosheets are developed for efficient cancer treatment via ultrasound&#8208;triggered piezodynamic cancer therapy. 2D WS2 nanosheets are functionalized with mitochondrial&#8208;targeting triphenylphosphonium to significantly enhance their anticancer efficacy via mitochondria&#8208;targeted piezodynamic therapy. FX11, a potent glycolysis inhibitor that can inhibit cellular energy metabolism, is loaded into WS2 nanosheets to synergistically potentiate the piezodynamic cancer therapy.








Abstract
Piezoelectric nanomaterials that can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) by piezoelectric polarization under an external mechanical force have emerged as an effective platform for cancer therapy. In this study, piezoelectric 2D WS2 nanosheets are functionalized with mitochondria&#8208;targeting triphenylphosphonium (TPP) for ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered, mitochondria&#8208;targeted piezodynamic cancer therapy. In addition, a glycolysis inhibitor (FX11) that can inhibit cellular energy metabolism is loaded into TPP&#8208; and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)&#8208;conjugated WS2 nanosheet (TPEG&#8208;WS2) to potentiate its therapeutic efficacy. Upon US irradiation, the sono&#8208;excited electrons and holes generated in the WS2 are efficiently separated by piezoelectric polarization, which subsequently promotes the production of ROS.

&lt;p&gt;Piezocatalytic 2D WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets are developed for efficient cancer treatment via ultrasound-triggered piezodynamic cancer therapy. 2D WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets are functionalized with mitochondrial-targeting triphenylphosphonium to significantly enhance their anticancer efficacy via mitochondria-targeted piezodynamic therapy. FX11, a potent glycolysis inhibitor that can inhibit cellular energy metabolism, is loaded into WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets to synergistically potentiate the piezodynamic cancer therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piezoelectric nanomaterials that can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) by piezoelectric polarization under an external mechanical force have emerged as an effective platform for cancer therapy. In this study, piezoelectric 2D WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets are functionalized with mitochondria-targeting triphenylphosphonium (TPP) for ultrasound (US)-triggered, mitochondria-targeted piezodynamic cancer therapy. In addition, a glycolysis inhibitor (FX11) that can inhibit cellular energy metabolism is loaded into TPP- and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-conjugated WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheet (TPEG-WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to potentiate its therapeutic efficacy. Upon US irradiation, the sono-excited electrons and holes generated in the WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are efficiently separated by piezoelectric polarization, which subsequently promotes the production of ROS. FX11-loaded&#160;TPEG-WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (FX11@TPEG-WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&#160;selectively accumulates in the mitochondria of human breast cancer cells. In addition, FX11@TPEG-WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; effectively inhibits the&#160;production of adenosine triphosphate . Thus, FX11@TPEG-WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits outstanding anticancer effects under US irradiation. An in vivo study using tumor-xenograft mice demonstrates that FX11@TPEG-WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; effectively accumulated in the tumors. Its&#160;tumor accumulation is visualized using in vivo computed tomography .

         <title>Perovskite Grain&#8208;Boundary Manipulation Using Room&#8208;Temperature Dynamic Self&#8208;Healing &#8220;Ligaments&#8221; for Developing Highly Stable Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells with 23.8% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grain&#8208;boundary &#8220;ligaments&#8221; are developed to endow fragile perovskite grain boundaries with toughness, water resistance, and room temperature self&#8208;healing properties. Meanwhile, they can also passivate the defects and release the residual tensile strain in perovskite films. The resultant flexible perovskite solar cells achieve a record 23.84% power conversion efficiency and robust mechanical, operational, and ambient stabilities.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) are the best candidates to complement traditional silicon SCs in portable power applications. However, their mechanical, operational, and ambient stabilities are still unable to meet the practical demands because of the natural brittleness, residual tensile strain, and high defect density along the perovskite grain boundaries. To overcome these issues, a cross&#8208;linkable monomer TA&#8208;NI with dynamic covalent disulfide bonds, H&#8208;bonds, and ammonium is carefully developed. The cross&#8208;linking acts as &#8220;ligaments&#8221; attached on the perovskite grain boundaries. These &#8220;ligaments&#8221; consisting of elastomers and 1D perovskites can not only passivate the grain boundaries and enhance moisture resistance but also release the residual tensile strain and mechanical stress in 3D perovskite films. More importantly, the elastomer can repair bending&#8208;induced mechanical cracks in the perovskite film because of dynamic self&#8208;healing characteristics. The resultant flexible pero&#8208;SCs exhibit promising improvements in efficiency, and record values (23.84% and 21.66%) are obtained for 0.062&#160;and 1.004&#160;cm2&#160;devices; the flexible devices also show overall improved stabilities with T90&#160;&gt;20&#160;000&#160;bending cycles, operational stability with T90&#160;&gt;1248&#160;h, and ambient stability (relative humidity&#160;=&#160;30%) with T90&#160;&gt;3000&#160;h. This strategy paves a new way for the industrial&#8208;scale development of high&#8208;performance flexible pero&#8208;SCs.

         <title>Genetically Engineering Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated BTO Nanoparticles for MMP2&#8208;Activated Piezocatalysis&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>

Cell membrane expressed &#945;PD&#8208;L1 with MMP2 responsive shielding domain is engineered to coat on BTO NPs, the resulting M@BTO NPs generate ROS and O2 to induce immunogenic cell death under ultrasound induced piezocatalysis, effectively switching &#8220;immune&#8208;cold&#8221; tumors to &#8220;immune&#8208;hot&#8221; tumors while achieving specific immune checkpoint blockade, providing a robust stimuli&#8208;responsive bioengineering system for augmenting tumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
Tumor immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) still suffers from low host response rate and non&#8208;specific distribution of immune checkpoint inhibitors, greatly compromising the therapeutic efficiency. Herein, cellular membrane stably expressing matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2)&#8208;activated PD&#8208;L1 blockades is engineered to coat ultrasmall barium titanate (BTO) nanoparticle for overcoming the immunosuppressive microenvironment of tumors. The resulting M@BTO NPs can significantly promote the BTO's tumor accumulation, while the masking domains on membrane PD&#8208;L1 antibodies are cleaved when exposure to MMP2 highly expressed in tumor. With ultrasound (US)&#160;irradiation, M@BTO NPs can simultaneously generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and O2 based on BTO mediated piezocatalysis and water splitting, significantly promoting the intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and improving the PD&#8208;L1 blockade therapy to the tumor, resulting in effective tumor growth inhibition and lung metastasis suppression in a melanoma mouse model. This nanoplatform combines MMP2&#8208;activated genetic editing cell membrane with US responsive BTO for both immune stimulation and specific PD&#8208;L1 inhibition, providing a safe and robust strategy in enhancing immune response against tumor.

         <title>Durable and Adjustable Interfacial Engineering of Polymeric Electrolytes for Both Stable Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes and High&#8208;Energy Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With surface in situ polymerization technology, solid polymeric ether&#8208;based electrolytes containing sulfonimide&#8208;based salts are designed as a high&#8208;performance cathode coating, enabling the durable compatibility with both Ni&#8208;rich LiNixCoyMnzO2 cathodes and metallic anodes, accompanying with anticorrosion of aluminum current collectors. This novel interface with high&#8208;voltage tolerance and adjustable components provides a new strategy toward long&#8208;term cyclability of high&#8208;voltage metal batteries.








Abstract
Achieving stable cycling of high&#8208;voltage solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries is crucial for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries with high energy density and high safety. However, the complicated interface problems in both cathode/anode electrodes preclude their practical applications hitherto. Herein, to simultaneously solve such interfacial limitations and obtain sufficient Li+ conductivity in the electrolyte, an ultrathin and adjustable interface is developed at the cathode side through a convenient surface in situ polymerization (SIP), achieving a durable high&#8208;voltage tolerance and Li&#8208;dendrite inhibition. The integrated interfacial engineering fabricates a homogeneous solid electrolyte with optimized interfacial interactions that contributes to tame the interfacial compatibility between LiNixCoyMnzO2 and polymeric electrolyte accompanied by anticorrosion of aluminum current collector. Further, the SIP enables a uniform adjustment of solid electrolyte composition by dissolving additives such as Na+ and K+ salts, which presents prominent cyclability in symmetric Li cells (&gt;300 cycles at 5 mA cm&#8722;2). The assembled LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (4.3 V)||Li batteries show excellent cycle life with high Coulombic efficiencies (&gt;99%). This SIP strategy is also investigated and verified in sodium metal batteries. It opens a new frontier for solid electrolytes toward high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;energy metal battery technologies.

         <title>A Nonswelling Hydrogel with Regenerable High Wet Tissue Adhesion for Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonswelling hydrogels with regenerable high wet tissue adhesion are fabricated. Subsequently, neural microelectrode arrays and rapid&#8208;response strain sensors are integrated into the hydrogel to fabricate bifunctional tissue&#8208;interface bioelectronics. Additionally, these bioelectronics possess excellent electrical properties. Electrocardiogram&#160;(ECG), electromyography (EMG), and tissue movement information are accurately recorded by the bioelectronics, and tissue fatigue is successfully monitored.








Abstract
Reducing the swelling of tissue&#8208;adhesive hydrogels is crucial for maintaining stable tissue adhesion and inhibiting tissue inflammation. However, reported strategies for reducing swelling always result in a simultaneous decrease in the tissue adhesive strength of the hydrogel. Furthermore, once the covalent bonds break in the currently reported hydrogels, they cannot be rebuilt, and the hydrogel loses its tissue adhesive ability. In this work, a nonswelling hydrogel (named as &#8220;PAACP&#8221;) possessing regenerable high tissue adhesion is synthesized by copolymerizing and crosslinking poly(vinyl butyral) with acrylic acid, gelatin, and chitosan&#8208;grafted N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine. The tissue adhesive strength of the obtained PAACP reaches 211.4&#160;kPa, which is approximately ten times higher than that of the reported nonswelling hydrogels, and the hydrogel can be reused for multiple cycles. The as&#8208;prepared hydrogel shows great potential in soft bioelectronics, as muscle fatigue is successfully monitored via the electrode array and strain sensor integrated on PAACP substrates. The success of these bioelectronics offers potential applicability in the long&#8208;term diagnosis of muscle&#8208;related health conditions and prosthetic manipulations.

         <title>13% Single&#8208;Component Organic Solar Cells based on Double&#8208;Cable Conjugated Polymers with Pendent Y&#8208;Series Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regular and random double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers with pendent Y&#8208;series acceptors are designed and synthesized, in which the random copolymer provides a high efficiency of 13.02% compared to the regular polymer with an efficiency of 2.75% in single&#8208;component organic solar cells.








Abstract
Double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers with pendent electron acceptors, including fullerene, rylene diimides, and nonfused acceptors, have been developed for application in single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) with efficiencies approaching 10%. In this work, Y&#8208;series electron acceptors have been firstly incorporated into double&#8208;cable polymers in order to further improve the efficiencies of SCOSCs. A highly crystalline Y&#8208;series acceptor based on quinoxaline core and the random copolymerized strategy are used to optimize the ambipolar charge transport&#160;and the nanophase separation of the double&#8208;cable polymers. As a result, an efficiency of 13.02% is obtained in the random double&#8208;cable polymer, representing the highest performance in SCOSCs, while the regular double&#8208;cable polymer only provides a low efficiency of 2.75%. The significantly enhanced efficiencies are attributed to higher charge carrier mobilities, better ordering conjugated backbones and Y&#8208;series acceptors in random double&#8208;cable polymers.

Soft Robotics
Wormlike robots can navigate through uneven terrain and constricted spaces, but it has proved difficult to completely avoid rigid components, limiting the compliance of such machines. In article 2210409, Hillel J. Chiel, Roger D. Quinn, Christoph Weder, Kathryn A. Daltorio, and co&#8208;workers report an earthworm&#8208;inspired robot that is based on soft polymer actuators. The robot moves through peristaltic locomotion and can wiggle itself through small openings.

Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production
In article number 2207765, Megalamane Siddaramappa Bootharaju, Jong Suk Yoo, Nanfeng Zheng, Taeghwan Hyeon, and co&#8208;workers show how gold doping selectively at the core of a 44&#8208;atom silver nanocluster can modulate the electronic structure and enhance the stability of the resulting gold&#8211;silver core&#8211;shell sub&#8208;nanostructure through synergistic effects. Increased interfacial charge transfer due to a favorably modified band alignment makes the core&#8211;shell nanocluster a promising cocatalyst for hydrogen generation from solar water splitting.

Artificial Fingertips
Human fingertips with intricate structures and delicate perspiration system help people in gripping, climbing, or even more complex activities. In article number 2209729, Dirk J. Broer, Danqing Liu, and co&#8208;workers report the design of a coating made of cholesteric liquid crystal networks to mimic not only the unique fingerprint topography but also the liquid secretion in human fingertips. The biomimetic perspiration of the coating is reversible, as controlled by light, which can be used to fine&#8208;tune the surface tribological property. The performance of this material shows its potential to be applied for robotic devices.

         <title>Probing the Mechanically Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase and the Implications in Design Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for realizing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. This review summarizes the desirable mechanical properties of SEI, mechanical characterization methods, and previous optimization attempts. Inconsistencies in these efforts are clarified and the causes are explored. A research protocol is proposed to accelerate the achievement of superior battery cycling performance by improving the mechanical stability of SEI.








Abstract
The inevitable volume expansion of secondary battery anodes during cycling imposes forces on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The battery performance is closely related to the capability of SEI to maintain intact under the cyclic loading conditions, which basically boils down to the mechanical properties of SEI. The volatile and complex nature of SEI as well as its nanoscale thickness and environmental sensitivity make the interpretation of its mechanical behavior many roadblocks. Widely varied approaches are adopted to investigate the mechanical properties of SEI, and diverse opinions are generated. The lack of consensus at both technical and theoretical levels has hindered the development of effective design strategies to maximize the mechanical stability of SEIs. Here, the essential and desirable mechanical properties of SEI, the available mechanical characterization methods, and important issues meriting attention for higher test accuracy are outlined. Previous attempts to optimize battery performance by tuning SEI mechanical properties are also scrutinized, inconsistencies in these efforts are elucidated, and the underlying causes are explored. Finally, a set of research protocols is proposed to accelerate the achievement of superior battery cycling performance by improving the mechanical stability of SEI.

         <title>Small&#8208;Scale Robotics with Tailored Wettability</title>

         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;scale robots (SSRs) have emerged as promising tools in a variety of biomedical, sensing, and decontamination applications. The review encompasses the basic understanding, theory, and up&#8208;to&#8208;date developments related to SSRs with tailored wettabilities, ranging from hydrophilic to hydrophobic.








Abstract
Small&#8208;scale robots (SSRs) have emerged as promising and versatile tools in various biomedical, sensing, decontamination, and manipulation applications, as they are uniquely capable of performing tasks at small length scales. With the miniaturization of robots from the macroscale to millimeter&#8208;, micrometer&#8208;, and nanometer&#8208;scales, the viscous and surface forces, namely adhesive forces and surface tension have become dominant. These forces significantly impact motion efficiency. Surface engineering of robots with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic functionalization presents a brand&#8208;new pathway to overcome motion resistance and enhance the ability to target and regulate robots for various tasks. This review focuses on the current progress and future perspectives of SSRs with hydrophilic and hydrophobic modifications (including both tethered and untethered robots). The study emphasizes the distinct advantages of SSRs, such as improved maneuverability and reduced drag forces, and outlines their potential applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small-scale robots (SSRs) have emerged as promising and versatile tools in various biomedical, sensing, decontamination, and manipulation applications, as they are uniquely capable of performing tasks at small length scales. With the miniaturization of robots from the macroscale to millimeter-, micrometer-, and nanometer-scales, the viscous and surface forces, namely adhesive forces and surface tension have become dominant. These forces significantly impact motion efficiency. Surface engineering of robots with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic functionalization presents a brand-new pathway to overcome motion resistance and enhance the ability to target and regulate robots for various tasks. This review focuses on the current progress and future perspectives of SSRs with hydrophilic and hydrophobic modifications (including both tethered and untethered robots). The study emphasizes the distinct advantages of SSRs, such as improved maneuverability and reduced drag forces, and outlines their potential applications. With continued innovation, rational surface engineering is expected to endow SSRs with exceptional mobility and functionality, which can broaden their applications, enhance their penetration depth, reduce surface fouling, and inhibit bacterial adhesion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gate Dielectrics Integration for 2D Electronics: Challenges, Advances, and Outlook</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent development of dielectrics for high&#8208;performance 2D devices. Adapting integration protocols of conventional high&#8208;&#954; dielectrics and emerging dielectrics with inert surface can significantly improve the dielectric film and interface quality. The advancement of novel dielectrics boosts overall performance of 2D devices and paves way toward next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics.








Abstract
2D semiconductors have emerged both as an ideal platform for fundamental studies and as promising channel materials in beyond&#8208;silicon field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistors due to their outstanding electrical properties and exceptional tunability via external field. However, the lack of proper dielectrics for 2D semiconductors has become a major roadblock for their further development toward practical applications. The prominent issues between conventional 3D dielectrics and 2D semiconductors arise from the integration and interface quality, where defect states and imperfections lead to dramatic deterioration of device performance. In this review article, the root causes of such issues are briefly analyzed and recent advances on some possible solutions, including various approaches of adapting conventional dielectrics to 2D semiconductors, and the development of novel dielectrics with van der Waals surface toward high&#8208;performance 2D electronics are summarized. Then, in the perspective, the requirements of ideal dielectrics for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D devices are outlined and an outlook for their future development is provided.

         <title>Hardware and Information Security Primitives Based on 2D Materials and Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review of hardware security solutions using novel electronics, optical, and material properties of 2D materials and their corresponding heterostructure device configurations for Internet of Things platforms. The five quintessential security domains for discussion are physically unclonable functions, true random number generators, logic locking, hardware watermarking and anticounterfeiting, and hardware camouflaging.








Abstract
Hardware security is a major concern for the entire semiconductor ecosystem that accounts for billions of dollars in annual losses. Similarly, information security is a critical need for the rapidly proliferating edge devices that continuously collect and communicate a massive volume of data. While silicon&#8208;based complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor technology offers security solutions, these are largely inadequate, inefficient, and often inconclusive, as well as resource intensive in time, energy, and cost, leading to tremendous room for innovation in this field. Furthermore, silicon&#8208;based security primitives have shown vulnerability to machine learning (ML) attacks. In recent years, 2D materials such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides have been intensely explored to mitigate these security challenges. In this review, 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;based hardware security solutions such as camouflaging, true random number generation, watermarking, anticounterfeiting, physically unclonable functions, and logic locking of integrated circuits (ICs) are summarized with accompanying discussion on their reliability and resilience to ML attacks. In addition, the role of native defects in 2D materials in developing high entropy hardware security primitives is also examined. Finally, the existing challenges for 2D materials, which must be overcome for large&#8208;scale deployment of 2D ICs to meet the security needs of the semiconductor industry, are discussed.

Boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#160;is an outstanding fluorescent molecule, with high molar absorption coefficients and good chemical stability. Improvements in self&#8208;assembly technology have fueled the applications of BODIPY&#160;in diagnosis and treatment. This review summarizes the molecular structure design and self&#8208;assembly strategy of BODIPY, and its applications as a multifunctional theranostic agent in biomedical fields.








Abstract
The use of boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#160;in&#160;biomedicine&#160;is&#160;reviewed.&#160;To open, its synthesis and regulatory strategies are summarized, and inspiring cutting&#8208;edge work in post&#8208;functionalization strategies is highlighted. A brief overview of assembly model of BODIPY is then provided: BODIPY is introduced as a promising building block for the formation of single&#8208; and multicomponent self&#8208;assembled systems, including nanostructures suitable for aqueous environments, thereby showing the great development potential of supramolecular assembly in biomedicine applications. The frontier progress of BODIPY in biomedical application is thereafter described, supported by examples of the frontiers of biomedical applications of BODIPY&#8208;containing smart materials: it mainly involves the application of materials based on BODIPY building blocks and their assemblies in fluorescence bioimaging, photoacoustic imaging, disease treatment including photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, and immunotherapy. Lastly, not only the current status of the BODIPY family in the biomedical field but also the challenges worth considering are summarized. At the same time, insights into the future development prospects of biomedically applicable BODIPY are provided.
