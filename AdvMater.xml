      <title>Interplay of Different Major Ampullate Spidroins during Assembly and Implications for Fiber Mechanics</title>
      <dc:description>
Natural spider major ampullate silk exhibits mechanical properties unmatched by most other known natural or man&#8208;made fibrous materials. Upon recombinant co&#8208;production of two different spidroins derived from one spider species, they interconnect already in solution and during assembly. Their interplay yields fibers with overall properties different to that of one&#8208;protein fibers, but equaling that of the natural blueprint.








Abstract
Major ampullate (MA) spider silk has fascinating mechanical properties combining strength and elasticity. All known natural MA silks contain at least two or more different spidroins; however, it is unknown why and if there is any interplay in the spinning dope. Here, two different spidroins from Araneus diadematus are co&#8208;produced in Escherichia coli to study the possible dimerization and effects thereof on the mechanical properties of fibers. During the production of the two spidroins, a mixture of homo&#8208; and heterodimers is formed triggered by the carboxyl&#8208;terminal domains. Interestingly, homodimeric species of the individual spidroins self&#8208;assemble differently in comparison to heterodimers, and stoichiometric mixtures of homo&#8208; and heterodimers yield spidroin networks upon assembly with huge impact on fiber mechanics upon spinning. The obtained results provide the basis for man&#8208;made tuning of spinning dopes to yield high&#8208;performance fibers.

      <title>Charge Transfer: Identifying Ionic and Electronic Charge Transfer at Oxide Heterointerfaces (Adv. Mater. 4/2021)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2004132, Marc&#8208;Andr&#233; Rose,  David N. Mueller, Felix Gunkel, and co&#8208;workers identify how ion and electron transfer naturally balance at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 oxide heterointerface, affecting the band alignment and magnetic signature of the interface. They utilize near&#8208;ambient&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, showing that Sr ions are more mobile at the interface than in the bulk, and implicating a high importance of ionic charge transfer in oxide heterostructures.

      <title>Thermoelectric Materials: Gate&#8208;Tunable Polar Optical Phonon to Piezoelectric Scattering in Few&#8208;Layer Bi2O2Se for High&#8208;Performance Thermoelectrics (Adv. Mater. 4/2021)</title>
      <dc:description>
A new strategy of tuning the scattering mechanism to decouple electric conductivity with Seebeck coefficient for high&#8208;performance thermoelectrics is realized by Jing Wu, Junpeng Lu, Zhenhua Ni, and co&#8208;workers, as described in article number 2004786. By applying a gate voltage on a 2D Bi2O2Se&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor, a high thermoelectric power factor over a wide temperature range is achieved due to persistently high mobility arising from the highly gate&#8208;tunable scattering mechanism.

      <title>Ferromagnetic Materials: Strong Ferromagnetism Achieved via Breathing Lattices in Atomically Thin Cobaltites (Adv. Mater. 4/2021)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2001324, the authors report the achievement of strong ferromagnetism in atomically thin cobaltite by local structural modification, where a surprisingly large magnetic moment and Curie temperature are observed. Thus, a strategy for creating functional quantum heterostructures by exploiting atomic interface engineering is demonstrated.

      <title>Ferromagnetic Materials: Gigantic Current Control of Coercive Field and Magnetic Memory Based on Nanometer&#8208;Thin Ferromagnetic van der Waals Fe3GeTe2 (Adv. Mater. 4/2021)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2004110, Kaixuan Zhang, Hyun&#8208;Woo Lee, Je&#8208;Geun Park, and co&#8208;workers report gigantic current control of the coercive field in the van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2. This results from an unusual type of gigantic spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT) within Fe3GeTe2 itself, which is directly related to its special symmetries, large Berry curvature, and band topology. The current&#8208;induced SOT substantially changes the energy profile ball and suppresses the energy barrier, creating an easy path for magnetization switching and pushing the hard ferromagnet loop to a soft one. Such an effect will be extremely useful for magnetic memory and spintronics.

      <title>State&#8208;Of&#8208;The&#8208;Art and Future Challenges in High Energy Lithium&#8211;Selenium Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Li&#8211;Se batteries (LSeBs) have garnered intensive attention since Se cathode possesses high capacity and electronic conductivity. LSeBs experience a solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transformation accompanied by side reactions in carbonate electrolytes while multiphase conversion in ether&#8208;based ones. The advances for cathode design, blocking layer engineering, and emerging solid&#8208;state electrolytes are summarized. The future research directions are also outlined to motivate more insightful works.








Abstract
Li&#8208;chalcogen batteries, especially the Li&#8211;S batteries (LSBs), have received paramount interests as next generation energy storage techniques because of their high theoretical energy densities. However, the associated challenges need to be overcome prior to their commercialization. Elemental selenium, another chalcogen member, would be an attractive alternative to sulfur owing to its higher electronic conductivity, comparable capacity density, and moreover, excellent compatibility with carbonate electrolytes. Unlike LSBs, the research and development of Li&#8211;Se batteries (LSeBs) have garnered burgeoning attention but are still in their infant stage, where a comprehensive yet in&#8208;depth overview is highly imperative to guide future research. Herein, a critical review of LSeBs, in terms of the underlying mechanisms, cathode design, blocking layer engineering, and emerging solid&#8208;state electrolytes is provided. First, the electrolyte&#8208;dependent electrochemistry of LSeBs is discussed. Second, the advances in Se&#8208;based cathodes are comprehensively summarized, especially highlighting the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art SexSy cathodes, and mainly focusing on their structures, compositions, and synthetic strategies. Third, the versatile separators/interlayers optimization and interface regulation are outlined, with a particular focus on the emerging solid&#8208;state electrolytes for advanced LSeBs. Last, the remaining challenges and research orientations in this booming field are proposed, which are expected to motivate more insightful works.

      <title>Heterogeneous Hydrogel Structures with Spatiotemporal Reconfigurability using Addressable and Tunable Voxels</title>
      <dc:description>
Creating hyper&#8208;redundant miniaturized soft robots with multiple active degrees of freedom is challenging. Using building blocks called soft voxel actuators (SVAs) in a muscle&#8208;inspire bottom&#8208;up manufacturing strategy, hyper&#8208;redundant soft robots are created demonstrating spatiotemporal reconfigurability and thus ability to work in unstructured environments. A facile mixed&#8208;solvent photopolymerization developed for poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hydrogels, supports the mass production of SVAs.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels can sense environmental cues and change their volume accordingly without the need for additional sensors or actuators. This enables a significant reduction in the size and complexity of resulting devices. However, since the responsive volume change of hydrogels is typically uniform, their robotic applications requiring localized and time&#8208;varying deformations have been challenging to realize. Here, using addressable and tunable hydrogel building blocks&#8212;referred to as soft voxel actuators (SVAs)&#8212;heterogeneous hydrogel structures with programmable spatiotemporal deformations are presented. SVAs are produced using a mixed&#8208;solvent photopolymerization method, utilizing a fast reaction speed and the cononsolvency property of poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) to produce highly interconnected hydrogel pore structures, resulting in tunable swelling ratio, swelling rate, and Young's modulus in a simple, one&#8208;step casting process that is compatible with mass production of SVA units. By designing the location and swelling properties of each voxel and by activating embedded Joule heaters in the voxels, spatiotemporal deformations are achieved, which enables heterogeneous hydrogel structures to manipulate objects, avoid obstacles, generate traveling waves, and morph to different shapes. Together, these innovations pave the way toward tunable, untethered, and high&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom hydrogel robots that can adapt and respond to changing conditions in unstructured&#160;environments.

Using building blocks called soft voxel actuators (SVAs) in a muscle&#8208;inspire bottom&#8208;up manufacturing strategy, hyper&#8208;redundant soft robots are created demonstrating spatiotemporal reconfigurability and thus ability to work in unstructured environments. A facile mixed&#8208;solvent photopolymerization developed for poly(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hydrogels, supports the mass production of SVAs.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels can sense environmental cues and change their volume accordingly without the need for additional sensors or actuators. This enables a significant reduction in the size and complexity of resulting devices. However, since the responsive volume change of hydrogels is typically uniform, their robotic applications requiring localized and time&#8208;varying deformations have been challenging to realize. Here, using addressable and tunable hydrogel building blocks&#8212;referred to as soft voxel actuators (SVAs)&#8212;heterogeneous hydrogel structures with programmable spatiotemporal deformations are presented. SVAs are produced using a mixed&#8208;solvent photopolymerization method, utilizing a fast reaction speed and the cononsolvency property of poly(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) to produce highly interconnected hydrogel pore structures, resulting in tunable swelling ratio, swelling rate, and Young's modulus in a simple, one&#8208;step casting process that is compatible with mass production of SVA units. By designing the location and swelling properties of each voxel and by activating embedded Joule heaters in the voxels, spatiotemporal deformations are achieved, which enables heterogeneous hydrogel structures to manipulate objects, avoid obstacles, generate traveling waves, and morph to different shapes. Together, these innovations pave the way toward tunable, untethered, and high&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom hydrogel robots that can adapt and respond to changing conditions in unstructured&#160;environments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ultrathin Amorphous/Crystalline Heterophase Rh and Rh Alloy Nanosheets as Tandem Catalysts for Direct Indole Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>
Ultrathin Rh and RhM (M = Cu, Zn, Ru) alloy nanosheets with amorphous/crystalline heterophases are successfully synthesized. In tandem catalysis to directly synthesize indole, the amorphous/crystalline heterophase Rh nanosheets (NSs) outperform their crystalline counterpart, demonstrating much higher catalytic activity. Impressively, the amorphous/crystalline heterophase RhCu NSs show dramatically enhanced indole selectivity of over 99.9% and excellent activity.








Abstract
Heterogeneous noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysis plays an essential role in the production of fine chemicals. Rh&#8208;based catalysts are one of the most active candidates for indole synthesis. However, it is still highly desired to develop heterogeneous Rh&#8208;based catalysts with high activity and selectivity. In this work, a general, facile wet&#8208;chemical method is reported to synthesize ultrathin amorphous/crystalline heterophase Rh and Rh&#8208;based bimetallic alloy nanosheets (NSs), including RhCu, RhZn, and RhRu. Impressively, the amorphous/crystalline heterophase Rh NSs exhibit enhanced catalytic activity toward the direct synthesis of indole compared to the crystalline counterpart. Importantly, the obtained amorphous/crystalline heterophase RhCu alloy NSs can further enhance the selectivity to indole of &gt;99.9% and the conversion is 100%. This work demonstrates the importance of phase engineering and metal alloying in the rational design and synthesis of tandem heterogeneous catalysts toward fine chemical synthesis.

      <title>Design Strategy for Transformative Electronic System toward Rapid, Bidirectional Stiffness Tuning using Graphene and Flexible Thermoelectric Device Interfaces</title>
      <dc:description>
Transformative electronics capable of rapid bidirectional stiffness tuning are developed to provide adaptive rigid and soft interfaces for versatile applications. Integration of graphene and a flexible thermoelectric device with a gallium platform facilitates solid&#8211;liquid phase transition of gallium, enabling accelerated rigid&#8211;soft transformation. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of reconfigurable personal electronics shows the potential of this approach, which can significantly enhance the versatility of electronics.








Abstract
Electronics with tunable shape and stiffness can be applied in broad range of applications because their tunability allows their use in either rigid handheld form or soft wearable form, depending on needs. Previous research has enabled such reconfigurable electronics by integrating a thermally tunable gallium&#8208;based platform with flexible/stretchable electronics. However, supercooling phenomenon caused in the freezing process of gallium impedes reliable and rapid bidirectional rigid&#8211;soft conversion, limiting the full potential of this type of &#8220;transformative&#8221; electronics. Here, materials and electronics design strategies are reported to develop a transformative system with a gallium platform capable of fast reversible mechanical switching. In this electronic system, graphene is used as a catalyst to accelerate the heterogeneous nucleation of gallium to mitigate the degree of supercooling. Additionally, a flexible thermoelectric device is integrated as a means to provide active temperature control to further reduce the time for the solid&#8211;liquid transition of gallium. Analytical and experimental results establish the fundamentals for the design and optimized operation of transformative electronics for accelerated bidirectional transformation. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of a reconfigurable system, which can convert between rigid handheld electronics and a flexible wearable biosensor, demonstrates the potential of this design approach for highly versatile electronics that can support multiple applications.

      <title>Designing the Bending Stiffness of 2D Material Heterostructures</title>
      <dc:description>
Interfacial engineering is used to tune the bending stiffness of 2D material heterostructures composed of graphene and MoS2 by over several hundred percent. The incorporation of twisted or heterointerfaces facilitates interlayer slip, which dramatically softens the 2D stacks. A bending model is developed to predict and design the deformability of 2D heterostructures as a function of composition, stacking order, and geometry of the structure.








Abstract
2D monolayers represent some of the most deformable inorganic materials, with bending stiffnesses approaching those of lipid bilayers. Achieving 2D heterostructures with similar properties would enable a new class of deformable devices orders of magnitude softer than conventional thin&#8208;film electronics. Here, by systematically introducing low&#8208;friction twisted or heterointerfaces, interfacial engineering is leveraged to tailor the bending stiffness of 2D heterostructures over several hundred percent. A bending model is developed and experimentally validated to predict and design the deformability of 2D heterostructures and how it evolves with the composition of the stack, the atomic arrangements at the interfaces, and the geometry of the structure. Notably, when each atomic layer is separated by heterointerfaces, the total bending stiffness reaches a theoretical minimum, equal to the sum of the constituent layers regardless of scale of deformation&#8212;lending the extreme deformability of 2D monolayers to device&#8208;compatible&#160;multilayers.

      <title>Combination of Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation with Selective Oxygenation of Organic Substrates using Manganese Borophosphates</title>
      <dc:description>
Helical manganese borophosphates are employed to address two highly demanding yet kinetically controlled reactions: durable electrochemical water oxidation to efficiently produce molecular oxygen and the selective oxygenation of organics to deliver prominent value&#8208;added chemicals.








Abstract
One of the key catalytic reactions for life on earth, the oxidation of water to molecular oxygen, occurs in the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex of the photosystem II (PSII) mediated by a manganese&#8208;containing cluster. Considerable efforts in this research area embrace the development of efficient artificial manganese&#8208;based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Using artificial OER catalysts for selective oxygenation of organic substrates to produce value&#8208;added chemicals is a worthwhile objective. However, unsatisfying catalytic performance and poor stability have been a fundamental bottleneck in the field of artificial PSII analogs. Herein, for the first time, a manganese&#8208;based anode material is developed and paired up for combining electrocatalytic water oxidation and selective oxygenations of organics delivering the highest efficiency reported to date. This can be achieved by employing helical manganese borophosphates, representing a new class of materials. The uniquely high catalytic activity and durability (over 5 months) of the latter precursors in alkaline media are attributed to its unexpected surface transformation into an amorphous MnOx phase with a birnessite&#8208;like short&#8208;range order and surface&#8208;stabilized MnIII sites under extended electrical bias, as unequivocally demonstrated by a combination of in situ Raman and quasi in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy as well as ex situ methods.

      <title>Bioorthogonal Coordination Polymer Nanoparticles with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission for Deep Tumor&#8208;Penetrating Radio&#8208; and Radiodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Coordination polymer nanoparticles constructed from a photosensitizer with aggregation&#8208;induced emission property (AIE PS) and the high&#8208;Z element hafnium (Hf) is fabricated through a solvothermal method. After PEGylation followed by bioorthogonal click chemistry, Hf&#8208;AIE&#8208;PEG&#8208;DBCO (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol); DBCO: dibenzocyclooctyne) can react on the surface of tumor cells to realize deep tumor&#8208;penetrating radiotherapy and radiodynamic therapy with enhanced tumor accumulation and extended tumor retention.








Abstract
Radiodynamic therapy (RDT), an emerging therapeutic approach for cancer treatment by employing ionizing irradiation to induce localized photodynamic therapy (PDT) can overcome the drawbacks of the limited penetration depth for traditional PDT and the unconcentrated energy in the tumor for traditional radiotherapy (RT). Taking advantage of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers with bright fluorescence and efficient singlet oxygen production in the aggregate state, Hf&#8208;AIE coordination polymer nanoparticles (CPNs), which show both strong RT and RDT effect under X&#8208;ray irradiation, are developed. Furthermore, to enhance the tumor accumulation and prolong the tumor retention of the CPNs, bioorthogonal click chemistry is applied in the system through coupling between dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;modified CPNs (Hf&#8208;AIE&#8208;PEG&#8208;DBCO) (PEG: poly(ethylene glycol)) and azide groups on the cell membrane formed by metabolic glycoengineering. Thanks to the high penetration of X&#8208;ray irradiation, the bioorthogonal&#8208;assisted RT and RDT combination therapy realizes significant killing of cancer cells without showing noticeable biotoxicity after intravenous administration of CPNs.

      <title>Materials Screening for Disorder&#8208;Controlled Chalcogenide Crystals for Phase&#8208;Change Memory Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Ab initio simulations and transport experiments elucidate why Sb2Te3 can form an insulating rocksalt structure, extending the exploration of Anderson insulators to binary chalcogenides. A systematic computational screening over binary and ternary chalcogenides, which leads to an in&#8208;depth understanding of the critical factors that affect the stability of the rocksalt structure is also carried out.








Abstract
Tailoring the degree of disorder in chalcogenide phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) plays an essential role in nonvolatile memory devices and neuro&#8208;inspired computing. Upon rapid crystallization from the amorphous phase, the flagship Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te PCMs form metastable rocksalt&#8208;like structures with an unconventionally high concentration of vacancies, which results in disordered crystals exhibiting Anderson&#8208;insulating transport behavior. Here, ab initio simulations and transport experiments are combined to extend these concepts to the parent compound of Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te alloys, viz., binary Sb2Te3, in the metastable rocksalt&#8208;type modification. Then a systematic computational screening over a wide range of homologous, binary and ternary chalcogenides, elucidating the critical factors that affect the stability of the rocksalt structure is carried out. The findings vastly expand the family of disorder&#8208;controlled main&#8208;group chalcogenides toward many more compositions with a tunable bandgap size for demanding phase&#8208;change applications, as well as a varying strength of spin&#8211;orbit interaction for the exploration of potential topological Anderson insulators.

      <title>Optical Microfluidic Waveguides and Solution Lasers of Colloidal Semiconductor Quantum Wells</title>
      <dc:description>
Solution of semiconductor quantum wells (CQWs) colloidally synthesized and used as the gain medium in a capillary microfluidic waveguide yields record low optical gain threshold in solution. A Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity was&#160;created between metallized sidewalls of the ends of microfluidic channel and optically pumped along the side of the waveguide to generate a single&#8208;mode output laser beam.








Abstract
The realization of high&#8208;quality lasers in microfluidic devices is crucial for numerous applications, including biological and chemical sensors and flow cytometry, and the development of advanced lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip (LOC) devices. Herein, an ultralow&#8208;threshold microfluidic single&#8208;mode laser is proposed and demonstrated using an on&#8208;chip cavity. CdSe/CdS@CdxZn1&#8722;xS core/crown@gradient&#8208;alloyed shell colloidal semiconductor quantum wells (CQWs) dispersed in toluene are employed in the cavity created inside a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microfluidic device using SiO2&#8208;protected Ag mirrors to achieve in&#8208;solution lasing. Lasing from such a microfluidic device having CQWs solution as a microfluidic gain medium is shown for the first time with a record&#8208;low optical gain threshold of 17.1 &#181;J cm&#8722;&#178; and lasing threshold of 68.4 &#181;J cm&#8722;&#178; among all solution&#8208;based lasing demonstrations. In addition, air&#8208;stable SiO2 protected Ag films are used and designed to form highly tunable and reflective mirrors required to attain a high&#8208;quality Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity. These realized record&#8208;low thresholds emanate from the high&#8208;quality on&#8208;chip cavity together with the core/crown@gradient&#8208;alloyed shell CQWs having giant gain cross&#8208;section and slow Auger rates. This microfabricated CQW laser provides a compact and inexpensive coherent light source for microfluidics and integrated optics covering the visible spectral region.

      <title>A Dual&#8208;Responsive Antibiotic&#8208;Loaded Nanoparticle Specifically Binds Pathogens and Overcomes Antimicrobial&#8208;Resistant Infections</title>
      <dc:description>
A dextran&#8208;coated polymeric nanoparticle is developed to target and eliminate antimicrobial&#8208;resistant pathogens. The NP can bind to lectins expressed by bacteria and accumulate in the infected tissues, releasing the antimicrobial in response to the inflammatory microenvironment, and overcoming antimicrobial resistance. The NP can eliminate biofilm and intracellular infections, and exhibits remarkable in vivo efficacy in treating antimicrobial&#8208;resistant infections.








Abstract
Antimicrobial resistant (AMR) infections are a growing threat to public health and there is a general lack of development in new antibiotics. Here, a dextran&#8208;coated stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoparticle (NP) that encapsulates the hydrophobic antibiotic, rifampicin, and specifically binds bacteria to overcome AMR infections is reported. The NP shows a strong affinity with a variety of pathogens in vitro and effectively accumulates in the bacterial infected tissues. The NP is activated by either low pH or high reactive oxygen species in the infectious microenvironment, and releases both cationic polymer and rifampicin that display synergistic activity against AMR pathogens. The NP carrier also enables the antibiotic to penetrate both bacterial biofilms and mammalian cells, thus allowing the elimination of biofilm and intracellular infections. The NP formulation demonstrates both safety and efficacy in two animal infection models against either Gram&#8208;negative or Gram&#8208;positive AMR pathogens.

      <title>Biomimetic Design of Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Hybrid Nanozymes as Superoxide Scavengers</title>
      <dc:description>
The key factor for de novo design of a metalloenzyme mimetic includes a suitable protein scaffold and enzyme active centers. A biomimetic cascade nanozyme is artificially created based on the hybridization of a recombinant ferritin&#8208;heavy&#8208;chain&#8208;based protein scaffold modified for mitochondria&#8208;targeting and a Mn&#8208;based nanoparticle as the core of enzymatic activity.








Abstract
Development of enzyme mimics for the scavenging of excessive mitochondrial superoxide (O2&#8226;&#8722;) can serve as an effective strategy in the treatment of many diseases. Here, protein reconstruction technology and nanotechnology is taken advantage of to biomimetically create an artificial hybrid nanozyme. These nanozymes consist of ferritin&#8208;heavy&#8208;chain&#8208;based protein as the enzyme scaffold and a metal nanoparticle core as the enzyme active center. This artificial cascade nanozyme possesses superoxide dismutase&#8208; and catalase&#8208;like activities and also targets mitochondria by overcoming multiple biological barriers. Using cardiac ischemia&#8208;reperfusion animal models, the protective advantages of the hybrid nanozymes are demonstrated in vivo during mitochondrial oxidative injury and in the recovery of heart functionality following infarction via systemic delivery and localized release from adhesive hydrogels (i.e., cardiac patch), respectively. This study illustrates a de novo design strategy in the development of enzyme mimics and provides a promising therapeutic option for alleviating oxidative damage in regenerative medicine.

      <title>Hybrid 0D Antimony Halides as Air&#8208;Stable Luminophores for High&#8208;Spatial&#8208;Resolution Remote Thermography</title>
      <dc:description>
Luminescent organic&#8211;inorganic low&#8208;dimensional ns2 metal halides are increasingly explored as thermal phosphors for high&#8208;resolution remote thermography and thermometry due to the high thermal sensitivity of their radiative lifetime. Thin films of such hybrids, conformally coating the surface of interest, can map the temperature with a spatial precision as high as 1 &#956;m using fluorescence&#8208;lifetime imaging.








Abstract
Luminescent organic&#8211;inorganic low&#8208;dimensional ns2 metal halides are of rising interest as thermographic phosphors. The intrinsic nature of the excitonic self&#8208;trapping provides for reliable temperature sensing due to the existence of a temperature range, typically 50&#8211;100 K wide, in which the luminescence lifetimes (and quantum yields) are steeply temperature&#8208;dependent. This sensitivity range can be adjusted from cryogenic temperatures to above room temperature by structural engineering, thus enabling diverse thermometric and thermographic applications ranging from protein crystallography to diagnostics in microelectronics. Owing to the stable oxidation state of Sb3+, Sb(III)&#8208;based halides are far more attractive than all major non&#8208;heavy&#8208;metal alternatives (Sn&#8208;, Ge&#8208;, Bi&#8208;based halides). In this work, the relationship between the luminescence characteristics and crystal structure and microstructure of TPP2SbBr5 (TPP = tetraphenylphosphonium) is established, and then its potential is showcased as environmentally stable and robust phosphor for remote thermography. The material is easily processable into thin films, which is highly beneficial for high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution remote thermography. In particular, a compelling combination of high spatial resolution (1&#160;&#181;m) and high thermometric precision (high specific sensitivities of 0.03&#8211;0.04 K&#8722;1) is demonstrated by fluorescence&#8208;lifetime imaging of a heated resistive pattern on a flat substrate, covered with a solution&#8208;spun film of TPP2SbBr5.

      <title>Multiscale Assembly of [AgS4] Tetrahedrons into Hierarchical Ag&#8211;S Networks for Robust Photonic Water</title>
      <dc:description>
Infinite 2D Ag&#8211;S network&#8208;based hierarchical structures are constructed through the multiscale assembly of the [AgS4] tetrahedron unit, spanning from atomic&#8208;, molecular&#8208;, nanometer&#8208;, to micrometer&#8208;scale. The resulting ensembles show the function of a 1D photonic reflector in water, and have a robust and customizable structural color.








Abstract
There is an urgent need to assemble ultrasmall metal chalcogenides (with atomic precision) into functional materials with the required anisotropy and uniformity, on a micro&#8208; or even macroscale. Here, a delicate yet simple chemistry is developed to produce a silver&#8211;sulfur network microplate with a high monodispersity in size and morphology. Spanning from the atomic, molecular, to nanometer, to micrometer scale, the key structural evolution of the obtained microplates includes 2D confinement growth, edge&#8208;sharing growth mode, and thermodynamically driven layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking, all of which are derived from the [AgS4] tetrahedron unit. The key to such a high hierarchical, complex, and accurate assembly is the dense deprotonated ligand layer on the surface of the microplates, forming an infinite surface with high negative charge density. This feature operates at an orderly distance to allow further hierarchical self&#8208;assembly on the microscale to generate columnar assemblies composed of microplate components, thereby endowing the feature of the 1D photonic reflector to water (i.e., photonic water). The reflective color of the resulting photonic water is highly dependent on the thickness of the building blocks (i.e., silver&#8211;sulfur microplates), and the coexistent order and fluidity help to form robust photonic water.

      <title>Ultrathin and Conformable Lead Halide Perovskite Photodetector Arrays for Potential Application in Retina&#8208;Like Vision Sensing</title>
      <dc:description>
Ultrathin lead halide perovskite photodetector arrays with a thickness of 2.4&#160;&#181;m are fabricated based on patterned all&#8208;inorganic CsPbBr3 films. The device with excellent flexibility and conformal contact characteristics shows robust mechanical stability under bending or compressive strain. More importantly, it conforms to hemispherical support realizing imaging of light distribution, indicating the potential applications in retina&#8208;like vision sensing.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed lead halide perovskites are considered one of the promising materials for flexible optoelectronics. However, the array integration of ultrathin flexible perovskite photodetectors (PDs) remains a significant challenge limited by the incompatibility of perovskite materials with manufacturing techniques involving polar liquids. Here, an ultrathin (2.4&#160;&#181;m) and conformable perovskite&#8208;based PD array (10 &#215; 10 pixels) with ultralight weight (3.12&#160;g m&#8722;2) and excellent flexibility, is reported. Patterned all&#8208;inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite films with precise pixel position, controllable morphology, and homogenous dimension, are synthesized by a vacuum&#8208;assisted drop&#8208;casting patterning process as the active layer. The use of waterproof parylene&#8208;C film as substrate and encapsulation layer effectively protects the perovskite films against penetration of polar liquids during the peeling&#8208;off process. Benefitting from the encapsulation and ultrathin property, the device exhibits long&#8208;term stability in the ambient environment, and robust mechanical stability under bending or 50% compressive strain. More importantly, the ultrathin flexible PD arrays conforming to hemispherical support realize imaging of light distribution, indicating the potential applications in retina&#8208;like vision sensing.

      <title>Bioinspired Spiky Peroxidase&#8208;Mimics for Localized Bacterial Capture and Synergistic Catalytic Sterilization</title>
      <dc:description>
A bioinspired, spiky, and highly catalytic&#8208;active virus&#8208;like peroxidase&#8208;mimic (V&#8208;POD&#8208;M) is synthesized for the localized &#8220;capture and killing&#8221; eradication of pathogenic bacteria. Experimental and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the V&#8208;POD&#8208;M exhibits strong bacterial interactions and efficient capture, synergistic catalytic sterilization, and similar in vivo disinfection efficiency to that of vancomycin, which provides a promising broad&#8208;spectrum therapy for nonantibiotic disinfection.








Abstract
Besides the pandemic caused by the coronavirus outbreak, many other pathogenic microbes also pose a devastating threat to human health, for instance, pathogenic bacteria. Due to the lack of broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotics, it is urgent to develop nonantibiotic strategies to fight bacteria. Herein, inspired by the localized &#8220;capture and killing&#8221; action of bacteriophages, a virus&#8208;like peroxidase&#8208;mimic (V&#8208;POD&#8208;M) is synthesized for efficient bacterial capture (mesoporous spiky structures) and synergistic catalytic sterilization (metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;derived catalytic core). Experimental and theoretical calculations show that the active compound, MoO3, can serve as a peroxo&#8208;complex&#8208;intermediate to reduce the free energy for catalyzing H2O2, which mainly benefits the generation of &#8226;OH radicals. The unique virus&#8208;like spikes endow the V&#8208;POD&#8208;M with fast bacterial capture and killing abilities (nearly 100% at 16 &#181;g mL&#8211;1). Furthermore, the in vivo experiments show that V&#8208;POD&#8208;M possesses similar disinfection treatment and wound skin recovery efficiencies to vancomycin. It is suggested that this inexpensive, durable, and highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) catalytic active V&#8208;POD&#8208;M provides a promising broad&#8208;spectrum therapy for nonantibiotic disinfection.

      <title>Triple&#8208;Cation and Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskite Single Crystal for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
Smaller cations and anions are incorporated into FAPbI3 single crystal to release its lattice stress and enhance its stability. The formed inch&#8208;sized triple&#8208;cation mixed&#8208;halide perovskite single crystals exhibit suppressed ion migration, long carrier diffusion length, large mobility, and excellent uniformity. These superior properties are utilized for the construction of a high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detector array, realizing high&#8208;contrast X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Low ionic migration is required for a semiconductor material to realize stable high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detection. In this work, successful controlled incorporation of not only methylammonium (MA+) and cesium (Cs+) cations, but also bromine (Br&#8211;) anions into the FAPbI3 lattice to grow inch&#8208;sized stable perovskite single crystal (FAMACs SC) is reported. The smaller cations and anions, comparing to the original FA+ and I&#8211; help release lattice stress so that the FAMACs SC shows lower ion migration, enhanced hardness, lower trap density, longer carrier lifetime and diffusion length, higher charge mobility and thermal stability, and better uniformity. Therefore, X&#8208;ray detectors made of the superior FAMACs SCs show the highest sensitivity of (3.5 &#177; 0.2) &#215; 106 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, about 29 times higher than the latest record of 1.22 &#215; 105 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 for polycrystalline MAPbI3 wafer under the same 40 keV X&#8208;ray radiation. Furthermore, the FAMACs SC X&#8208;ray detector shows a low detection limit of 42 nGy s&#8722;1, stable dark current, and photocurrent response. Finally, it is demonstrated that high contrast X&#8208;ray imaging is realized using the FAMACs SC detector. The effective triple&#8208;cation mixed halide strategy and the high crystalline quality make the present FAMACs SCs promising for next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray imaging systems.

      <title>Formation of Novel Octuplex DNA Molecules from Guanine Quadruplexes</title>
      <dc:description>
The self&#8208;driven formation of a novel type of DNA&#8208;based molecule, with the highest number of guanines per cross section, is reported. Atomic force microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and CD spectroscopy of guanine octuplex (G8&#8208;) DNA reveal its organized, mechanically and thermodynamically stable, of high guanine content, coiled&#8208;coil structure&#8212;which make it a prospective candidate for molecular nanoelectronics.








Abstract
Guanine quadruplex (G4)&#8208;DNA structures have sparked the interest of many scientists due to their important biological roles and their potential use in molecular nanoelectronics and nanotechnology. The high guanine content in G4&#8208;DNA endows it with mechanical stability, robustness, and improved charge transport properties&#8212;attractive attributes for a molecular nanowire. The self&#8208;driven formation of a novel G4&#8208;DNA&#8208;based nanostructure, coined guanine octuplex (G8)&#8208;DNA, is reported herein. Atomic force microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy characterization of this molecule reveal its organized coiled&#8208;coil structure, which is found to be stable under different temperatures and surrounding conditions. G8&#8208;DNA exhibits enhanced stiffness, mechanical and thermodynamic stability when compared to its parent G4&#8208;DNA. These, along with its high guanine content, make G8&#8208;DNA a compelling new molecule, and a highly prospective candidate for molecular nanoelectronics.

     alt="Formation of Novel Octuplex DNA Molecules from Guanine Quadruplexes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The self&#8208;driven formation of a novel type of DNA&#8208;based molecule, with the highest number of guanines per cross section, is reported. Atomic force microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and CD spectroscopy of guanine octuplex (G8&#8208;) DNA reveal its organized, mechanically and thermodynamically stable, of high guanine content, coiled&#8208;coil structure&#8212;which make it a prospective candidate for molecular nanoelectronics.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guanine quadruplex (G4)&#8208;DNA structures have sparked the interest of many scientists due to their important biological roles and their potential use in molecular nanoelectronics and nanotechnology. The high guanine content in G4&#8208;DNA endows it with mechanical stability, robustness, and improved charge transport properties&#8212;attractive attributes for a molecular nanowire. The self&#8208;driven formation of a novel G4&#8208;DNA&#8208;based nanostructure, coined guanine octuplex (G8)&#8208;DNA, is reported herein. Atomic force microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy characterization of this molecule reveal its organized coiled&#8208;coil structure, which is found to be stable under different temperatures and surrounding conditions. G8&#8208;DNA exhibits enhanced stiffness, mechanical and thermodynamic stability when compared to its parent G4&#8208;DNA. These, along with its high guanine content, make G8&#8208;DNA a compelling new molecule, and a highly prospective candidate for molecular nanoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tuning the Selective Adsorption Site of Biomass on Co3O4 by Ir Single Atoms for Electrosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>
Single atoms of Ir are anchored on Co3O4 for efficient electro&#8208;oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). It is found that an isolated Ir atom can optimize the adsorption configuration of HMF molecules on catalysts and accelerate HMF oxidation.








Abstract
The electrosynthesis from 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is considered a green strategy to achieve biomass&#8208;derived high&#8208;value chemicals. As the molecular structure of HMF is relatively complicated, understanding the HMF adsorption/catalysis behavior on electrocatalysts is vital for biomass&#8208;based electrosynthesis. The electrocatalysis behavior can be modulated by tuning the adsorption energy of the reactive molecules. In this work, the HMF adsorption behavior on spinel oxide, Co3O4 is discovered. Correspondingly, the adsorption energy of HMF on Co3O4 is successfully tuned by decorating with single&#8208;atom Ir. It is observed that compared with bare Co3O4, single&#8208;atom&#8208;Ir&#8208;loaded Co3O4 (Ir&#8208;Co3O4) can enhance adsorption with the C&#63742;C groups of HMF. The synergetic adsorption can enhance the overall conversion of HMF on electrocatalysts. With the modulated HMF adsorption, the as&#8208;designed Ir&#8208;Co3O4 exhibits a record performance (with an onset potential of 1.15 VRHE) for the electrosynthesis from HMF.

      <title>Efficient Luminescent Halide Quadruple&#8208;Perovskite Nanocrystals via Trap&#8208;Engineering for Highly Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
      <dc:description>
Lead&#8208;free quadruple&#8208;perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) with R3&#773;m space group symmetry are synthesized. The photoluminescence quantum yield can be enhanced by 96&#8208;fold via metal alloying.

Abstract
The colloidal synthesis of a new type of lead&#8208;free halide quadruple&#8208;perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) is reported. The photoluminescence quantum yield and charge&#8208;carrier lifetime of quadruple&#8208;perovskite NCs can be enhanced by 96 and 77&#8208;fold, respectively, via metal alloying. Study of charge&#8208;carrier dynamics provide solid demonstrate that the PL enhancement is due to the elimination of ultrafast (1.4 ps) charge&#8208;carrier trapping processes in the alloyed NCs. Thanks to the high crystallinity, low trap&#8208;state density, and long carrier lifetime (193.4 &#956;s), the alloyed quadruple&#8208;perovskite NCs can serve as the active material for high&#8208;performance photodetectors, which exhibit high responsivity (up to 0.98 &#215; 104 A W&#8722;1) and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 3 &#215; 106%. These numbers are among the highest for perovskite&#8208;NC&#8208;based photodetectors.

      <title>From Understanding Mechanical Behavior to Curvature Prediction of Humidity&#8208;Triggered Bilayer Actuators</title>
      <dc:description>
An in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of the mechanical properties of bilayer actuators based on the humidity&#8208;responsive polymer poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) in combination with volumetric strain measurements allows for the curvature prediction of humidity&#8208;triggered bilayer actuators by an analytic composite beam model.








Abstract
Nature will always be an endless source of bioinspiration for man&#8208;made smart materials and multifunctional devices. Impressively, even cutoff leaves from resurrection plants can autonomously and reproducibly change their shape upon humidity changes, which goes along with total recovery of their mechanical properties after being completely dried. In this work, simple bilayers are presented as autonomously moving, humidity&#8208;triggered bending actuators. The bilayers&#8212;showing reproducible bending behavior with reversible kinematics and multiway behavior&#8212;are studied in terms of their mechanical behavior upon humidity changes. The active layer consists of a highly conducting polymer film based on poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) with poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) as passive layer. The response to humidity is explored with dynamic mechanical thermal analysis and quartz crystal microbalance measurements. Introduction of a composite beam model allows to predict the curvature of the actuators with input from the rheological measurements. It is clearly demonstrated that volumetric strain and Young's modulus, both heavily influenced by the water uptake, dominate the bending behavior and therefore the curvature of the actuators. This loop of rheological characterization coupled with an analytical model allows to predict curvatures of in principle any complex geometry and material combination for moving parts in soft robotics.

      <title>Electrolyte&#8208;Mediated Stabilization of High&#8208;Capacity Micro&#8208;Sized Antimony Anodes for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A new electrolyte&#8208;engineering approach is presented to stabilize the micro&#8208;sized alloying anodes (e.g., Sb anode) in potassium&#8208;ion batteries. A high capacity of 628 mAh g&#8211;1 close to the capacity limit of potassium metal is achieved. An interfacial model related to the electronegativity and stability of the K+&#8208;solvent&#8208;anions is presented to predict and analyze the electrolyte stability and electrode performance.








Abstract
Alloying anodes exhibit very high capacity when used in potassium&#8208;ion batteries, but their severe capacity fading hinders their practical applications. The failure mechanism has traditionally been attributed to the large volumetric change and/or their fragile solid electrolyte interphase. Herein, it is reported that an antimony (Sb) alloying anode, even in bulk form, can be stabilized readily by electrolyte engineering. The Sb anode delivers an extremely high capacity of 628 and 305 mAh g&#8211;1 at current densities of 100 and 3000&#160;mA g&#8211;1, respectively, and remains stable for more than 200 cycles. Interestingly, there is no need to do nanostructural engineering and/or carbon modification to achieve this excellent performance. It is shown that the change in K+ solvation structure, which is tuned by electrolyte composition (i.e., anion, solvent, and concentration), is the main reason for achieving this excellent performance. Moreover, an interfacial model based on the K+&#8208;solvent&#8208;anion complex behavior is presented. The electronegativity of the K+&#8208;solvent&#8208;anion complex, which can be tuned by changing the solvent type and anion species, is used to predict and control electrode stability. The results shed new light on the failure mechanism of alloying anodes, and provide a new guideline for electrolyte design that stabilizes metal&#8208;ion batteries using alloying anodes.

      <title>An Air&#8208;Stable and Li&#8208;Metal&#8208;Compatible Glass&#8208;Ceramic Electrolyte enabling High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A new glass&#8208;ceramic Li3.2P0.8Sn0.2S4 solid&#8208;state electrolyte is developed to simultaneously possess high ionic conductivity (10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 level at room temperature), excellent air&#8208;stability (dry room operable), and good Li metal compatibility. This finding is highly expected that can accelerate the commercialization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.








Abstract
The development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (ASSLMBs) has attracted significant attention due to their potential to maximize energy density and improved safety compared to the conventional liquid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, it is very challenging to fabricate an ideal solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) that simultaneously possesses high ionic conductivity, excellent air&#8208;stability, and good Li metal compatibility. Herein, a new glass&#8208;ceramic Li3.2P0.8Sn0.2S4 (gc&#8208;Li3.2P0.8Sn0.2S4) SSE is synthesized to satisfy the aforementioned requirements, enabling high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs at room temperature (RT). Compared with the conventional Li3PS4 glass&#8208;ceramics, the present gc&#8208;Li3.2P0.8Sn0.2S4 SSE with 12% amorphous content has an enlarged unit cell and a high Li+ ion concentration, which leads to 6.2&#8208;times higher ionic conductivity (1.21 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at RT) after a simple cold sintering process. The (P/Sn)S4 tetrahedron inside the gc&#8208;Li3.2P0.8Sn0.2S4 SSE is verified to show a strong resistance toward reaction with H2O in 5%&#8208;humidity air, demonstrating excellent air&#8208;stability. Moreover, the gc&#8208;Li3.2P0.8Sn0.2S4 SSE triggers the formation of Li&#8211;Sn alloys at the Li/SSE interface, serving as an essential component to stabilize the interface and deliver good electrochemical performance in both symmetric and full cells. The discovery of this gc&#8208;Li3.2P0.8Sn0.2S4 superionic conductor enriches the choice of advanced SSEs and accelerates the commercialization of ASSLMBs.

&lt;p&gt;A new glass&#8208;ceramic Li&lt;sub&gt;3.2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; solid&#8208;state electrolyte is developed to simultaneously possess high ionic conductivity (10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; level at room temperature), excellent air&#8208;stability (dry room operable), and good Li metal compatibility. This finding is highly expected that can accelerate the commercialization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (ASSLMBs) has attracted significant attention due to their potential to maximize energy density and improved safety compared to the conventional liquid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, it is very challenging to fabricate an ideal solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) that simultaneously possesses high ionic conductivity, excellent air&#8208;stability, and good Li metal compatibility. Herein, a new glass&#8208;ceramic Li&lt;sub&gt;3.2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (gc&#8208;Li&lt;sub&gt;3.2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) SSE is synthesized to satisfy the aforementioned requirements, enabling high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs at room temperature (RT). Compared with the conventional Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; glass&#8208;ceramics, the present gc&#8208;Li&lt;sub&gt;3.2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; SSE with 12% amorphous content has an enlarged unit cell and a high Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion concentration, which leads to 6.2&#8208;times higher ionic conductivity (1.21 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at RT) after a simple cold sintering process. The (P/Sn)S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedron inside the gc&#8208;Li&lt;sub&gt;3.2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; SSE is verified to show a strong resistance toward reaction with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in 5%&#8208;humidity air, demonstrating excellent air&#8208;stability.

      <title>Great Location: About Effects of Surface Bound Neighboring Groups for Passive and Active Fine&#8208;Tuning of CO2 Adsorption Properties in Model Carbon Capture Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Changing the molecular environment in direct vicinity to the active amine group opens up vast possibilities to fine&#8208;tune CO2 adsorption. Through the introduction of various neighboring groups (NGs), key metrics such as the heat of adsorption and selectivity can be tuned. The investigation of such NG interaction is enabled by a new, highly flexible model system based on click chemistry.








Abstract
Improved carbon capture materials are crucial for managing the CO2 level in the atmosphere. The past focus was on increasing adsorption capacities. It is widely known that controlling the heat of adsorption (&#916;Hads) is equally important. If it is too low, CO2 uptake takes place at unfavorable conditions and with insufficient selectivity. If it is too high, chemisorption occurs, and the materials can hardly be regenerated. The conventional approach for influencing &#916;Hads is the modification of the adsorbing center. This paper proposes an alternative strategy. The hypothesis is that fine&#8208;tuning of the molecular environment around the adsorbing center is a powerful tool for the adjustment of CO2&#8208;binding properties. Via click chemistry, any desired neighboring group (NG) can be incorporated on the surfaces of the nanoporous organosilica model materials. Passive NGs induce a change in the polarity of the surface, whereas active NGs are capable of direct interaction with the active center/CO2 pair. The effects on &#916;Hads and on the selectivity are studied. A situation can be realized which resembles frustrated Lewis acid&#8211;base pairs, and the investigation of the binding&#8208;species by solid&#8208;state NMR indicates that the push&#8211;pull effects could play an essential role not only in CO2 adsorption but also in its activation.

      <title>Ultrasmall, Bright, and Photostable Fluorescent Core&#8211;Shell Aluminosilicate Nanoparticles for Live&#8208;Cell Optical Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Fourfold coordinated aluminum within ultrasmall aluminosilicate nanoparticles leads to redox&#8208;type blinking of encapsulated organic fluorophores under live&#8208;cell imaging conditions. Their blinking, brightness, and photostability characteristics make these excellent probes for optical super&#8208;resolution microscopy. These nontoxic nanoparticles can be used to interrogate both fixed and live&#8208;cell systems as well as to quantitatively study the processing of nanoparticles within live cells.








Abstract
Stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) is an optical super&#8208;resolution microscopy (SRM) technique that traditionally requires toxic and non&#8208;physiological imaging buffers and setups that are not conducive to live&#8208;cell studies. It is observed that ultrasmall (&lt;10&#160;nm) fluorescent core&#8211;shell aluminosilicate nanoparticles (aC&#8217; dots) covalently encapsulating organic fluorophores enable STORM with a single excitation source and in a regular (non&#8208;toxic) imaging buffer. It is shown that fourfold coordinated aluminum is responsible for dye blinking, likely via photoinduced redox processes. It is demonstrated that this phenomenon is observed across different dye families leading to probes brighter and more photostable than the parent free dyes. Functionalization of aC&#8217; dots with antibodies allows targeted fixed cell STORM imaging. Finally, aC&#8217; dots enable live&#8208;cell STORM imaging providing quantitative measures of the size of intracellular vesicles and the number of particles per vesicle. The results suggest the emergence of a powerful ultrasmall, bright, and photostable optical SRM particle platform with characteristics relevant to clinical translation for the quantitative assessment of cellular structures and processes from live&#8208;cell imaging.

      <title>Fused Aromatic Network with Exceptionally High Carrier Mobility</title>
      <dc:description>
Crystalline fused aromatic network with a basal plane stoichiometry of C5N exhibits exceptionally high carrier mobility. The thin flakes of C5N, obtained by polydimethylsiloxane stamping, show ambipolar charge transport and remarkably high electron and hole mobilities, demonstrating their huge potential for applications in thin film electronics.








Abstract
Recently, studies of 2D organic layered materials with unique electronic properties have generated considerable interest in the research community. However, the development of organic materials with functional electrical transport properties is still needed. Here, a 2D fused aromatic network (FAN) structure with a C5N basal plane stoichiometry is designed and synthesized, and thin films are cast from C5N solution onto silicon dioxide substrates. Then field&#8208;effect transistors are fabricated using C5N thin flakes as the active layer in a bottom&#8208;gate top&#8208;contact configuration to characterize their electrical properties. The C5N thin flakes, isolated by polydimethylsiloxane stamping, exhibit ambipolar charge transport and extraordinarily high electron (996 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and hole (501 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) mobilities, surpassing the performance of most pristine organic materials without doping. These results demonstrate their vast potential for applications in thin&#8208;film optoelectronic devices.

      <title>Synthetic Kramers Pair in Phononic Elastic Plates and Helical Edge States on a Dislocation Interface</title>
      <dc:description>
The topological origin of the &#8220;zone&#8208;folding&#8221; phononic topological insulator is revealed and its interpretation as an analog to the quantum spin Hall effect is shown to present key differences in comparison with its electronic counterpart. Also, the possibility of realizing two counter&#8208;propagating gapless helical edge states on a dislocation interface connecting two subdomains with bulk pattern identical up to a relative translation is shown.








Abstract
In conventional theories, topological band properties are intrinsic characteristics of the bulk material and do not depend on the choice of the reference frame. In this scenario, the principle of bulk&#8208;edge correspondence can be used to predict the existence of edge states between topologically distinct materials. In this study, a 2D elastic phononic plate is proposed with a Kekul&#233;&#8208;distorted honeycomb pattern engraved on it. It is found that the pseudospin and the pseudospin&#8208;dependent Chern numbers are not invariant properties, and the &#8484;2 number is no longer a sufficient indicator to examine the existence of the edge state. The distinctive pseudospin texture and the pseudomagnetic field are also revealed. Finally, the synthetic helical edge states are successfully devised and experimentally implemented on a dislocation interface connecting two subdomains with bulk pattern identical up to a relative translation. The edge state is also imaged via laser&#160;vibrometry.

      <title>Enhanced Redox Kinetics and Duration of Aqueous I2/I&#8722; Conversion Chemistry by MXene Confinement</title>
      <dc:description>
An MXene confinement strategy is proposed to boost the redox kinetics and cycle duration of an aqueous Zn&#8211;I2 battery via an electrodeposition method. The confinement effect and superior electron supply of the Nb2CTX MXene host results in an efficient I2/I&#8722; couple conversion and suppression of the undesired shuttle effect, resulting in excellent power density, energy density, and anti&#8208;self&#8208;discharge performance.








Abstract
Weak binding and affinity between the conductive support and iodine species leads to inadequate electron transfer and the shuttle effect. Herein, redox kinetics and duration are significantly boosted by introducing a Nb2CTX host that is classified as a layered 2D Nb&#8208;based MXene. With a facile electrodeposition strategy, initial I&#8722; ions are electrically driven to insert in the nanosized interlayers and are electro&#8208;oxidized in situ. Linear I2 is firmly confined inside and benefits from the rapid charge supply from the MXene. Consequently, an aqueous Zn battery based on a Zn metal anode and ZnSO4 electrolyte delivers an ultraflat plateau at 1.3&#160;V, which contributes to 84.5% of the capacity and 89.1% of the energy density. Record rate capability (143 mAh g&#8722;1 at 18 A g&#8722;1) and lifespan (23&#160;000) cycles are achieved, which are far superior to those of all reported aqueous MXenes and I2&#8211;metal batteries. Moreover, the low voltage decay rate of 5.6&#160;mV h&#8722;1 indicates its superior anti&#8208;self&#8208;discharge properties. Physicochemical analyses and density functional theory calculations elucidate that the localized electron transfer and trapping effect of the Nb2CTX MXene host are responsible for enhanced kinetics and suppressed shuttle behavior. This work can be extended to the fabrication of other I2&#8211;metal batteries with long&#8208;life&#8208;time expectations.

      <title>In Situ Lignin Modification toward Photonic Wood</title>
      <dc:description>
A photonic wood with high lignin content is fabricated via an in situ, rapid, and scalable process that involves the photocatalytic oxidation of native lignin in wood by H2O2 and UV light. The resulting photonic wood features a unique hierarchical microstructure, high mechanical strength, excellent water stability, remarkable optical properties and designable patterning capability.








Abstract
Lignin serves as a binder that forms strong matrices of the cell walls of wood. However, it has many photolabile chromophore groups that create a monotonic brownish color and make wood susceptible to photodegradation. Herein, a new strategy is reported for modifying lignin using an in situ, rapid, and scalable process that involves the photocatalytic oxidation of native lignin in wood by H2O2 and UV light. The reaction selectively eliminates lignin's chromophores while leaving the aromatic skeleton intact, thus modulating the optical properties of wood. The resulting &#8220;photonic wood&#8221; retains &#8776;80% of its original lignin content, which continues to serve as a strong binder and water&#8208;proofing agent. As a result, photonic wood features a much higher mechanical strength in a wet environment (20&#8208;times higher tensile strength and 12&#8208;times greater compression resistance), significant scalability (&#8776;2 m long sample), and largely reduced processing times (1&#8211;6.5 h vs 4&#8211;14 h) compared with delignification methods. Additionally, this in situ lignin&#8208;modified wood structure is easily patterned through a photocatalytic oxidation process. This photocatalytic production of photonic wood paves the way for the large&#8208;scale manufacturing of sustainable biosourced functional materials for a range of applications, including energy&#8208;efficient buildings, optical management, and fluidic, ionic, electronic, and optical devices.

      <title>Electronic Conductive Inorganic Cathodes Promising High&#8208;Energy Organic Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
The excessive inactive carbon in organic electrode materials (OEMs) is substituted by electronic conductive inorganic cathode materials, which are endowed with high electronic conductivity to transport electrons, high ion&#8208;storage capacity to act as secondary active materials, as well as strong affinity to OEMs. The strategy simultaneously achieves high capacities, low porosity, lean electrolyte, and thus high energy densities.








Abstract
The electrochemical utilization of organic electrode materials (OEMs) is highly dependent on an excess amount of inactive carbon at the expense of low packing density and energy density. In this work, the challenges by substituting inactive carbon with electronic conductive inorganic cathode (ECIC) materials, which are endowed with high electronic conductivity to transport electrons for redox reactions of the whole electrodes, high ion&#8208;storage capacity to act as secondary active materials, and strong affinity with OEMs to inhibit their dissolution, are addressed. Combining representative ECICs (TiS2 and Mo6S8) with organic electrode materials (perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) and hexaazatrinaphthalene (HATN)) simultaneously achieves high capacity, low porosity, lean electrolyte, and thus high energy density. High gravimetric and volumetric energy densities of 153&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 200&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 are delivered with superior cycling stability in a 30 mA h&#8208;level Li/PTCDA&#8208;TiS2 pouch cell. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of organic&#8211;ECIC electrodes is also successfully demonstrated in monovalent Na, divalent Mg, and trivalent Al batteries, indicating their feasibility and generalizability. With the discovery of more ECIC materials and OEMs, it is anticipated that the proposed organic&#8211;ECIC system can result in further improvements at cell level to compete with transition metal&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion batteries.

In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202006336"&gt;2006336&lt;/a&gt;, Claas Willem Visser and co&#8208;workers expand in&#8208;air microfluidics to in&#8208;air photopolymerization, to continuously fabricate a library of architected micromaterials. This platform enables rapid fabrication of anisotropic particles and soft actuators, and printing of tunable microlens arrays.

      <title>2D Metamaterials: Designing Mechanical Metamaterials with Kirigami&#8208;Inspired, Hierarchical Constructions for Giant Positive and Negative Thermal Expansion (Adv. Mater. 3/2021)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2004919, John A. Rogers, Yihui Zhang, and co&#8208;workers present design concepts and fabrication strategies for a kirigami&#8208;inspired class of 2D hierarchical metamaterials. At large filling ratios (&gt;50%), these systems offer not only unprecedented biaxial CTE (i.e., &#8722;5950 and 10710 ppm K&#8722;1), but also large biaxial thermal expansion properties (&gt;21% for 20 K temperature increase), unachievable previously.

      <title>Perovskite Nanoparticles: Extremely Stable Luminescent Crosslinked Perovskite Nanoparticles under Harsh Environments over 1.5 Years (Adv. Mater. 3/2021)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article 2005255, Byeong&#8208;Soo Bae, Tae&#8208;Woo Lee, and co&#8208;workers report exceptionally stable crosslinked perovskite nanoparticles (NPs) under harsh environments, with a novel composite materials design strategy. Noticeably, the crosslinked perovskite NPs (CPNs) show recovery of photoluminescence in the initial stage and retain their photophysical properties under humidified environments. The CPNs overcome the instability of perovskite NPs in air, water, and strong chemicals as well as under high temperature.

      <title>Hetero&#8208;MXenes: Theory, Synthesis, and Emerging Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of hetero&#8208;MXenes, from theoretical predictions to experimental investigations, is presented. The reviewed theoretical calculations focus on three sites of MXenes and the reviewed metal&#8208;/nonmetal&#8208;doped/substituted MXenes are experimentally synthesized by in situ/ex situ strategies. It is believed that this work will be beneficial to bridge the predictions and experiments, further promoting the development of hetero&#8208;MXenes.








Abstract
Since their discovery in 2011, MXenes (abbreviation for transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides) have emerged as a rising star in the family of 2D materials owing to their unique properties. Although the primary research interest is still focused on pristine MXenes and their composites, much attention has in recent years been paid also to MXenes with diverse compositions. To this end, this work offers a comprehensive overview of the progress on compositional engineering of MXenes in terms of doping and substituting from theoretical predictions to experimental investigations. Synthesis and properties are briefly introduced for pristine MXenes and then reviewed for hetero&#8208;MXenes. Theoretical calculations regarding the doping/substituting at M, X, and T sites in MXenes and the role of vacancies are summarized. After discussing the synthesis of hetero&#8208;MXenes with metal/nonmetal (N, S, P) elements by in situ and ex situ strategies, the focus turns to their emerging applications in various fields such as energy storage, electrocatalysts, and sensors. Finally, challenges and prospects of hetero&#8208;MXenes are addressed. It is anticipated that this review will be beneficial to bridge the gap between predictions and experiments as well as to guide the future design of hetero&#8208;MXenes with high performance.

      <title>Design, Fabrication, and Mechanism of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Graphene&#8208;Based Photocatalyst</title>
      <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene plays a significant role in photocatalysis. Rational design, preparation, and understanding the mechanism of N&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;based photocatalyst provide a new opportunity to further enhance the photocatalytic performance. The research progress, atomic and band structures, photocatalytic mechanism, synthesis strategy, unique advantages, and wide application of N&#8208;doped graphene in photocatalysis are highlighted.








Abstract
Solving energy and environmental problems through solar&#8208;driven photocatalysis is an attractive and challenging topic. Hence, various types of photocatalysts have been developed successively to address the demands of photocatalysis. Graphene&#8208;based materials have elicited considerable attention since the discovery of graphene. As a derivative of graphene, nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (NG) particularly stands out. Nitrogen atoms can break the undifferentiated structure of graphene and open the bandgap while endowing graphene with an uneven electron density distribution. Therefore, NG retains nearly all the advantages of original graphene and is equipped with several novel properties, ensuring infinite possibilities for NG&#8208;based photocatalysis. This review introduces the atomic and band structures of NG, summarizes in situ and ex situ synthesis methods, highlights the mechanism and advantages of NG in photocatalysis, and outlines its applications in different photocatalysis directions (primarily hydrogen production, CO2 reduction, pollutant degradation, and as photoactive ingredient). Lastly, the central challenges and possible improvements of NG&#8208;based photocatalysis in the future are presented. This study is expected to learn from the past and achieve progress toward the future for NG&#8208;based photocatalysis.

Paper&#8208;based fully roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufactured flexible lightweight large&#8208;area piezoelectric transducers are presented. Embedding the printed electronic layers into conventional paper webs by inline lamination and inline poling leads to piezoelectric devices with high remnant polarization and high production yield. The development gives the opportunity i.a. for novel surround sound installations of several meter length.








Abstract
The trend to a world with ubiquitous electronics has the need for novel concepts for sensors and actuators that are lightweight, flexible, low&#8208;cost, and also sustainable. Piezoelectric transducers on the basis of functional polymers can meet these expectations. In this work, a novel concept for paper&#8208;embedded large&#8208;area piezoelectric devices realized solely by means of roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) mass printing and post printing technologies including inline poling are introduced. The device set&#8208;up, as well as the process technology, offers the great opportunity for a cost&#8208;efficient and environmentally friendly mass production of thin and flexible organic large&#8208;area piezoelectric devices. As the functional layers are embedded into paper by the hot lamination of two poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene) P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) layers, the printed electronics is protected and invisible. The paper gives insights to the R2R printing of a 500 m long web including R2R post printing processes and electrical and acoustic inline characterization. Fully R2R processed devices show a high remnant polarization of up to 78&#160;mC&#160;m&#8722;2 and can be realized with high yield of &gt;90%.&#160;Finally, a 360&#176; surround&#8208;sound installation realized with a 387&#160;cm long paper web consisting of 56 piezoelectric speakers including wiring is presented.

      <title>Lattice Matching Growth of Conductive Hierarchical Porous MOF/LDH Heteronanotube Arrays for Highly Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>
Porous metal&#8211;organic framework/layered double hydroxide (MOF/LDH) hierarchical heteronanotube arrays consisting of a lattice&#8208;matched 2D conductive MOF and a trimetallic LDH, established by an inner template sacrifice process, enable excellent activity and superior stability toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) reaction among the best MOF and non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts for OER.








Abstract
The conjugation of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) into different multicomponent materials to precisely construct aligned heterostructures is fascinating but elusive owing to the disparate interfacial energy and nucleation kinetics. Herein, a promising lattice&#8208;matching growth strategy is demonstrated for conductive MOF/layered double hydroxide (cMOF/LDH) heteronanotube arrays with highly ordered hierarchical porous structures enabling an ultraefficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

     alt="Lattice Matching Growth of Conductive Hierarchical Porous MOF/LDH Heteronanotube Arrays for Highly Efficient Water Oxidation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porous metal&#8211;organic framework/layered double hydroxide (MOF/LDH) hierarchical heteronanotube arrays consisting of a lattice&#8208;matched 2D conductive MOF and a trimetallic LDH, established by an inner template sacrifice process, enable excellent activity and superior stability toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) reaction among the best MOF and non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts for OER.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conjugation of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) into different multicomponent materials to precisely construct aligned heterostructures is fascinating but elusive owing to the disparate interfacial energy and nucleation kinetics. Herein, a promising lattice&#8208;matching growth strategy is demonstrated for conductive MOF/layered double hydroxide (cMOF/LDH) heteronanotube arrays with highly ordered hierarchical porous structures enabling an ultraefficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER). CoNiFe&#8208;LDH nanowires are used as interior template to engineer an interface by inlaying cMOF and matching two crystal lattice systems, thus conducting a graft growth of cMOF/LDH heterostructures along the LDH nanowire. A class of hierarchical porous cMOF/LDH heteronanotube arrays is produced through continuously regulating the transformation degree. The synergistic effects of the cMOF and LDH components significantly promote the chemical and electronic structures of the heteronanotube arrays and their electroactive surface area. Optimized heteronanotube arrays exhibit extraordinary OER activity with ultralow overpotentials of 216 and 227&#160;mV to deliver current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a small Tafel slope of 34.1 mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ranking it among the best MOF and non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts for OER. The robust performance under high current density and vigorous gas bubble conditions enable such hierarchical MOF/LDH heteronanotube arrays as promising materials for practical water electrolysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>
Sensing robots synergically merge 3D integrated sensors and robotics. Geometrical difficulty from the structural complexity of sensing robots has been the main challenge in the production of sensing robots. 3D integrated electronics prepared by 3D printing is a potential solution for realistic sensing robot systems. The platform of 3D sensing systems is investigated, and their expansion into sensing robots is studied further in practical settings such as in healthcare and manufacturing units.

Abstract
Advanced robotics is the result of various contributions from complex fields of science and engineering and has tremendous value in human society. Sensing robots are highly desirable in practical settings such as healthcare and manufacturing sectors through sensing activities from human&#8211;robot interaction. However, there are still ongoing research and technical challenges in the development of ideal sensing robot systems. The sensing robot should synergically merge sensors and robotics. Geometrical difficulty in the sensor positioning caused by the structural complexity of sensing robots and their corresponding processing have been the main challenges in the production of sensing robots. 3D electronics integrated into 3D objects prepared by the 3D printing process can be the potential solution for designing realistic sensing robot systems. 3D printing provides the advantage to manufacture complex 3D structures in electronics in a single setup, allowing the ease of design flexibility, and customized functions. Therefore, the platform of 3D sensing systems is investigated and their expansion into sensing robots is studied further.

      <title>A Brief History of OLEDs&#8212;Emitter Development and Industry Milestones</title>
      <dc:description>
The history of emitter development and industry's interest in organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) technology are reviewed. OLED device technology has equally inspired and driven innovation in academia and industry. Three generations of emitters based on different emission mechanisms are designed. Recently, research in both academia and industry points towards a fourth generation of light&#8208;emitting materials for OLEDs.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have come a long way ever since their first introduction in 1987 at Eastman Kodak. Today, OLEDs are especially valued in the display and lighting industry for their promising features. As one of the research fields that equally inspires and drives development in academia and industry, OLED device technology has continuously evolved over more than 30&#160;years. OLED devices have come forward based on three generations of emitter materials relying on fluorescence (first generation), phosphorescence (second generation), and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (third generation). Furthermore, research in academia and industry toward the fourth generation of OLEDs is in progress. Excerpts from the history of green, orange&#8208;red, and blue OLED emitter development on the side of academia and milestones achieved by key players in the industry are included in this report.

      <title>Micellar Lyotropic Nematic Gels</title>
      <dc:description>
By adding low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators to lyotropic nematic phases a new kind of liquid crystal network, namely lyotropic nematic physical gels, is obtained. These lyotropic nematic gels combine anisotropy with mechanical stability and are promising new materials for the field of soft robotics and biomimetic actuation.








Abstract
Lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) gels are a new class of liquid crystal (LC) networks that combine the anisotropy of micellar LLCs with the mechanical stability of a gel. However, so far, only micellar LLC gels with lamellar and hexagonal structures have been obtained by the addition of gelators to LLCs. Here, the first examples of lyotropic nematic gels are presented. The key to obtain these nematic gels is the use of gelators that have a non&#8208;amphiphilic molecular structure and thus leave the size and shape of the micellar aggregates essentially unchanged. By adding these gelators to lyotropic nematic phases, an easy and reproducible way to obtain large amounts of lyotropic nematic gels is established. These nematic gels preserve the long&#8208;range orientational order and optical birefringence of a lyotropic nematic phase but have the mechanical stability of a gel. LLC nematic gels are promising new materials for elastic and anisotropic hydrogels to be applied as water&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive actuators and sensors.

      <title>Inelastic Electron Tunneling Spectroscopy at High&#8208;Temperatures</title>
      <dc:description>
Inelastic tunneling spectroscopy is shown to be a viable high&#8208;resolution technique to analyze mobile species in solids at high&#8208;temperatures. In the measurements reported, BaZrO3&#8208;based heterostructures are used as proton conductors and tunnel barriers. By analyzing O&#63743;H bond vibrations at 400 K, the existence of protons in the tunnel barriers is demonstrated.








Abstract
Ion conducting materials are critical components of batteries, fuel cells, and devices such as memristive switches. Analytical tools are therefore sought that allow the behavior of ions in solids to be monitored and analyzed with high spatial resolution and in real time. In principle, inelastic tunneling spectroscopy offers these capabilities. However, as its spectral resolution is limited by thermal softening of the Fermi&#8211;Dirac distribution, tunneling spectroscopy is usually constrained to cryogenic temperatures. This constraint would seem to render tunneling spectroscopy useless for studying ions in motion. Here, the first inelastic tunneling spectroscopy studies above room temperature are reported. For these measurements, high&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable tunnel junctions that incorporate within the tunnel barrier ultrathin layers for efficient proton conduction are developed. By analyzing the vibrational modes of O&#63743;H bonds in BaZrO3&#8208;based heterostructures, the detection of protons with a spectral resolution of 20 meV at 400 K (full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half maximum) is demonstrated. Overturning the hitherto existing prediction for the spectral resolution limit of 186 meV (5.4 kBT ) at 400 K, this resolution enables high&#8208;temperature tunneling spectroscopy of ion conductors. With these advances, inelastic tunneling spectroscopy constitutes a novel, valuable analytical tool for solid&#8208;state ionics.

      <title>A Programmable DNA&#8208;Silicification&#8208;Based Nanocavity for Single&#8208;Molecule Plasmonic Sensing</title>
      <dc:description>
Integrating advances in DNA nanotechnology and plasmonic sensing, this study reports a method, termed DNA&#8208;silicified template for Raman optical beacon (DNA&#8208;STROBE), for development of ultrasmall and structurally resilient nanocavities with high fidelity. The DNA&#8208;STROBE constructs exhibit large, controlled local electromagnetic field enhancement for reproducible single&#8208;molecule surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopic sensing even at elevated background concentrations.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanocavities are highly desirable for optical sensing because of their singular ability to confine light into deep subwavelength volumes. Yet, it remains profoundly challenging to fabricate structurally resilient nanocavities with high fidelity, and to obtain direct, noninvasive visualization of the plasmonic hotspots within such constructs. Herein, highly precise and robust nanocavities, entitled DNA&#8208;silicified template for Raman optical beacon (DNA&#8208;STROBE), are engineered by using silicified DNA scaffolds for spatial organization of discrete plasmonic nanoparticles. In addition to substantially enhancing structural stability and chemical inertness, DNA silicification significantly improves nanogap control, resulting simultaneously in large and controlled local electromagnetic field enhancement. The ultrasmall mode volume of the DNA&#8208;STROBE constructs promotes single&#8208;molecule occupancy enabling surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) observations of single&#8208;molecule activity even at elevated background concentration, significantly relaxing the restrictive pico&#8208; to nanomolar molecular concentration condition typically required for such investigations. Additionally, leveraging super&#8208;resolution SERS measurements allows noninvasive and diffraction&#8208;unlimited spatial profiling of otherwise unresolvable plasmonic hotspots. The highly programmable and reproducible nature of the DNA&#8208;STROBE, coupled with its quantitative label&#8208;free molecular readouts, provides a versatile platform with applications across the spectrum of nanophotonics and biomedical sciences.

      <title>Structure Design of Long&#8208;Life Spinel&#8208;Oxide Cathode Materials for Magnesium Rechargeable Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Defect spinel ZnMnO3 with cation deficiencies at octahedral sites allows highly reversible Mg insertion/extraction avoiding the irreversible transformation into a rocksalt phase. It is successfully demonstrated that the material can work as a high&#8208;performance cathode for magnesium rechargeable batteries exhibiting high potential (&#8776;2.5&#160;V vs Mg2+/Mg) and capacity (&#8776;100&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) with long&#8208;term cyclability.








Abstract
Development of metal&#8208;anode rechargeable batteries is a challenging issue. Especially, magnesium rechargeable batteries are promising in that Mg metal can be free from dendrite formation upon charging. However, in case of oxide cathode materials, inserted magnesium tends to form MgO&#8208;like rocksalt clusters in a parent phase even with another structure, which causes poor cyclability. Here, a design concept of high&#8208;performance cathode materials is shown, based on: i) selecting an element to destabilize the rocksalt&#8208;type structure and ii) utilizing the defect&#8208;spinel&#8208;type structure both to avoid the spinel&#8208;to&#8208;rocksalt reaction and to secure the migration path of Mg cations. This theoretical and experimental work substantiates that a defect&#8208;spinel&#8208;type ZnMnO3 meets the above criteria and shows excellent cycle performance exceeding 100 cycles upon Mg insertion/extraction with high potential (&#8776;2.5&#160;V vs Mg2+/Mg) and capacity (&#8776;100&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1). Thus, this work would provide a design guideline of cathode materials for various multivalent rechargeable batteries.

      <dc:description>
The single&#8208;step growth of alloy/alloy (MoS2(1&#8208;x)Se2x/SnS2(1&#8208;y)Se2y) vertical heterostructures is demonstrated and the heterostructure exhibits nearly intrinsic Van der Waals (vdW) interface in terms of a near&#8208;atomically sharp and defect&#8208;free boundary along the interface as well as a well&#8208;aligned epitaxial relationship. The almost&#8208;ideal interface enables the identification of the intrinsic behaviors of the heterostructures such as the band alignment, charge transfer, and carrier transport.








Abstract
The interfacial tunable band alignment of heterostructures is coveted in device design and optimization of device performance. As an intentional approach, alloying allows band engineering and continuous band&#8208;edge tunability for low&#8208;dimensional semiconductors. Thus, combining the tunability of alloying with the band structure of a heterostructure is highly desirable for the improvement of device characteristics. In this work, the single&#8208;step growth of alloy&#8208;to&#8208;alloy (MoS2(1&#8208;x)Se2x/SnS2(1&#8208;y)Se2y) 2D vertical heterostructures is demonstrated. Electron diffraction reveals the well&#8208;aligned heteroepitaxial relationship for the heterostructure, and a near&#8208;atomically sharp and defect&#8208;free boundary along the interface is observed. The nearly intrinsic van der Waals (vdW) interface enables measurement of the intrinsic behaviors of the heterostructures. The optimized type&#8208;II band alignment for the MoS2(1&#8208;x)Se2x/SnS2(1&#8208;y)Se2y heterostructure, along with the large band offset and effective charge transfer, is confirmed through quenched PL spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations. Devices based on completely stacked heterostructures show one or two orders enhanced electron&#160;mobility and rectification ratio than those of the constituent materials. The realization of device&#8208;quality alloy&#8208;to&#8208;alloy heterostructures provides a new material platform for precisely tuning band alignment and optimizing device applications.

      <title>3D&#8208;Printable Fluoropolymer Gas Diffusion Layers for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
      <dc:description>
Multiscale structural control in 3D&#8208;printable fluoropolymers enables highly tunable gas diffusion electrodes. By modulating the diffusion of reactants to and products from the catalyst layer during electroreduction, the product distribution in favor of higher carbon products is shifted. Insights into the rational design of electrodes offer a platform for developing and optimizing next&#8208;generation flow reactors.








Abstract
The electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added multicarbon products from CO2 is a promising strategy to shift chemical production away from fossil fuels. Particularly important is the rational design of gas diffusion electrode (GDE) assemblies to react selectively, at scale, and at high rates. However, the understanding of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) in these assemblies is limited for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR): particularly important, but incompletely understood, is how the GDL modulates product distributions of catalysts operating in high current density regimes &gt; 300&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Here, 3D&#8208;printable fluoropolymer GDLs with tunable microporosity and structure are reported and probe the effects of permeance, microstructural porosity, macrostructure, and surface morphology. Under a given choice of applied electrochemical potential and electrolyte, a 100&#215; increase in the C2H4:CO ratio due to GDL surface morphology design over a homogeneously porous equivalent and a 1.8&#215; increase in the C2H4 partial current density due to a pyramidal macrostructure are observed. These findings offer routes to improve CO2RR GDEs as a platform for 3D catalyst design.

      <dc:description>
The recent experimental and computational research progress on modulation of MnO2 single&#8208;species and MnO2&#8208;based composites for environmental applications are summarized. MnO2 single&#8208;species can be modified through morphology control, structure construction, facet engineering, and element doping while MnO2&#8208;based composites can be tuned by construction of homojunctions, MnO2/semiconductor/conductor binary heterojunctions, and MnO2&#8208;based ternary heterojunctions.








Abstract
Manganese dioxide (MnO2) is a promising photo&#8211;thermo&#8211;electric&#8208;responsive semiconductor material for environmental applications, owing to its various favorable properties. However, the unsatisfactory environmental purification efficiency of this material has limited its further applications. Fortunately, in the last few years, significant efforts have been undertaken for improving the environmental purification efficiency of this material and understanding its underlying mechanism. Here, the aim is to summarize the recent experimental and computational research progress in the modification of MnO2 single species by morphology control, structure construction, facet engineering, and element doping. Moreover, the design and fabrication of MnO2&#8208;based composites via the construction of homojunctions and MnO2/semiconductor/conductor binary/ternary heterojunctions is discussed. Their applications in environmental purification systems, either as an adsorbent material for removing heavy metals, dyes, and microwave (MW) pollution, or as a thermal catalyst, photocatalyst, and electrocatalyst for the degradation of pollutants (water and gas, organic and inorganic) are also highlighted. Finally, the research gaps are summarized and a perspective on the challenges and the direction of future research in nanostructured MnO2&#8208;based materials in the field of environmental applications is presented. Therefore, basic guidance for rational design and fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency MnO2&#8208;based materials for comprehensive environmental applications is provided.

With increasing demand for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) have emerged as promising complements or alternatives to commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries owing to the low cost, natural abundance of potassium resources, the low standard reduction potential of potassium, and fascinating K+ transport kinetics in the electrolyte. However, the low energy density and unstable cycle life of cathode materials hamper their practical application. Therefore, cathode materials with high capacities, high redox potentials, and good structural stability are required with the advancement toward next&#8208;generation PIBs. To this end, understanding the structure&#8208;dependent intercalation electrochemistry and recognizing the existing issues relating to cathode materials are indispensable prerequisites. This review summarizes the recent advances of PIB cathode materials, including metal hexacyanometalates, layered metal oxides, polyanionic frameworks, and organic compounds, with an emphasis on the structural advantages of the K+ intercalation reaction. Moreover, major current challenges with corresponding strategies for each category of cathode materials are highlighted. Finally, future research directions and perspectives are presented to accelerate the development of PIBs and facilitate commercial applications. It is believed that this review will provide practical guidance for researchers engaged in developing next&#8208;generation advanced PIB cathode materials.

      <title>Liquid Metals: A Novel Possibility of Fabricating 2D Metal Oxides</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent advances in the fabrication of 2D metal oxides (2DMOs) via liquid metals are comprehensively reviewed. The introduction of progress in fabricating 2DMOs by virtue of the features of liquid metals improves diversity in the development and applications of 2DMOs. The current challenges concerning the fabrication of 2DMOs are discussed to promote future research.








Abstract
2D metal oxides (2DMOs) have been widely applied in the fields of electronic, magnetic, optical, and catalytic materials, owing to their rich surface chemistry and unique electronic structures. However, their further development faces challenges such as the difficulty in fabricating 2DMOs with unstable surface induced by strong surface polarizability, or the high cost and limited yield of the fabrication process. Recently, liquid metals have shown great potential in the fabrication of 2DMOs. The native oxide skin formed on the surface of liquid metals can be considered as a perfect 2D planar material. Due to the solubility, fluidity, and reactivity of liquid metals, they can act as the solvent, reactant, and interface in the fabrication of 2DMOs. Moreover, liquid metals undergo a liquid&#8211;solid phase transition, enabling them to be a symmetric matched substrate for growing high&#8208;quality 2DMOs. An insightful survey of the recent progress in this research direction is presented. The features of liquid metals including good solubility, chemical reactivity, weak interface force, and liquid&#8211;solid phase transitions are introduced in detail. Furthermore, strategies for the fabrication of 2DMOs by virtue of these features are summarized comprehensively. Finally, current challenges and prospects regarding the future development in the fabrication of 2DMOs via liquid metals are highlighted.

      <title>Controllable Capillary Assembly of Magnetic Ellipsoidal Janus Particles into Tunable Rings, Chains and Hexagonal Lattices</title>
      <dc:description>
Magnetic ellipsoidal Janus particles assemble into rings, chains, and hexagonal&#8208;lattice structures at fluid&#8211;fluid interfaces driven by capillary interactions, where a dynamical transition between these assembly states can be obtained by dynamically manipulating the external magnetic field.








Abstract
Colloidal assembly at fluid interfaces has a great potential for the bottom&#8208;up fabrication of novel structured materials. However, challenges remain in realizing controllable and tunable assembly of particles into diverse structures. Herein, the capillary assembly of magnetic ellipsoidal Janus particles at a fluid&#8211;fluid interface is reported. Depending on their tilt angle, that is, the angle the particle main axis forms with the fluid interface, these particles deform the interface and generate capillary dipoles or hexapoles. Driven by capillary interactions, multiple particles thus assemble into chain&#8208;, hexagonal&#8208;lattice&#8208;, and ring&#8208;like structures, which can be actively controlled by applying an external magnetic field. A field&#8208;strength phase diagram is predicted in which various structures are present as stable states. Owing to the diversity, controllability, and tunability of assembled structures, magnetic ellipsoidal Janus particles at fluid interfaces could therefore serve as versatile building blocks for novel&#160;materials.

      <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Delivery of Inhaled Immunotherapeutics for Treating Lung Metastasis</title>
      <dc:description>
A noninvasive inhaled immunotherapeutic chitosan (CS)&#8211;antibody complex is developed for immunotherapy against lung cancer. In this system, CS with adjuvant effect is able to assemble with anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (aPDL1) to enable efficient transmucosal delivery, which is promising for immunotherapy against lung metastasis without the concern of systemic toxicity.








Abstract
Despite the critical breakthrough achieved by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), the clinical benefits are usually restricted by inefficient infiltration of immune cells and immune&#8208;associated adverse effects. Noninvasive aerosol inhalation, as a definitive procedure for treatment of respiratory diseases, for ICB immunotherapy against lung metastasis, has not been realized to the best knowledge. Herein, an inhaled immunotherapeutic chitosan (CS)&#8211;antibody complex is developed for immunotherapy against lung cancer. In this system, CS is used as a carrier to assemble with anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (aPD&#8208;L1) to enable efficient transmucosal delivery. Moreover, CS exhibits adjuvant effects to drive potent immune responses via activating the cyclic&#8208;di&#8208;GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. Interestingly, repeated inhalation of CS/aPD&#8208;L1 complex can effectively activate the immune system by promoting the infiltration of different immune cells especially CD8+ T cells around tumor lesions, and finally prolongs the survival of mice to 60 days. Thus, the work presents a unique aerosol inhalation delivery system for ICB antibody, which is promising for immunotherapy against lung metastasis without the concern of systemic toxicity.

      <title>Simultaneous Incorporation of Two Types of Azo&#8208;Groups in the Side Chains of a Conjugated D&#8211;A Polymer for Logic Control of the Semiconducting Performance by Light Irradiation</title>
      <dc:description>
Conjugated D&#8211;A polymers with two types of azo groups, for which trans&#8211;cis isomerization can sequentially occur with light irradiation at different wavelengths, in the side chains possess tri&#8208;stable semiconducting states. As a consequence, the performance of the resulting field&#8208;effect transistors can be logically controlled by light irradiation at three different wavelengths, mimicking three&#8208;value logic gates.








Abstract
A new design strategy for photoresponsive semiconducting polymer with tri&#8208;stable semiconducting states is reported by simultaneous incorporation of tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;methoxy&#8208;substituted azobenzene (mAzo) and arylazopyrazole (pAzo) in the side chains. The trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis transformations for mAzo and pAzo groups can sequentially occur within the polymer thin film after sequential 560 and 365&#160;nm light irradiation. Remarkably, the trans&#8211;cis isomerization of mAzo and pAzo groups can modulate the thin film crystallinity. Accordingly, the performances of the resulting field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) can be reversibly modulated, leading to tri&#8208;stable semiconducting states after sequential 560, 365, and 470&#160;nm light irradiation. Therefore, the device performance can be logically controlled by light irradiation at three different wavelengths. In addition, with light irradiation and device current as the input and output signals, the three&#8208;value logic gate by using single FET device can be successfully mimicked.

      <title>Shape&#8208;Memory Metallopolymers Based on Two Orthogonal Metal&#8211;Ligand Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of shape&#8208;memory metallopolymers based on orthogonal supramolecular interactions are presented; i.e., two different metal complexes. By a cyclo mechanic test, the structure&#8211;property relationship is studied, and a strong correlation between the switching temperature, which ranges in this case from 85 to 115&#160;&#176;C, and the structural parameters is achieved.








Abstract
A new shape&#8208;memory polymer is presented, in which both the stable phase as well as the switching unit consist of two different metal complexes. Suitable metal ions, which simultaneously form labile complexes with histidine and stable ones with terpyridine ligands, are identified via isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements. Different copolymers are synthesized, which contain butyl methacrylate as the main monomer and the metal&#8208;binding ligands in the side chains. Zn(TFMS)2 and NiCl2 are utilized for the dual crosslinking, resulting in the formation of metallopolymer networks. The switching temperature can simply be tuned by changing the composition as well as by the choice of the metal ion. Strain fixity rates (about 99%) and very high strain recovery rates (up to 95%) are achieved and the mechanism is revealed using different techniques such as Raman spectroscopy.

      <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer&#8208;Based Magnetic Composite Films for Reconfigurable Shape&#8208;Morphing Soft Miniature Machines</title>
      <dc:description>
A liquid crystal elastomer material with embedded ferromagnetic microparticles takes advantage of both magnetic and thermal stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. Such monolithic soft material enables reconfigurable magnetic soft miniature machines that self&#8208;adapt to changing environmental conditions. The hybrid material introduces a multi&#8208;modal actuation and physical intelligence capability for wireless soft machines.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive and active materials promise radical advances for many applications. In particular, soft magnetic materials offer precise, fast, and wireless actuation together with versatile functionality, while liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are capable of large reversible and programmable shape&#8208;morphing with high work densities in response to various environmental stimuli, e.g., temperature, light, and chemical solutions. Integrating the orthogonal stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of these two kinds of active materials could potentially enable new functionalities and future applications. Here, magnetic microparticles (MMPs) are embedded into an LCE film to take the respective advantages of both materials without compromising their independent stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. This composite material enables reconfigurable magnetic soft miniature machines that can self&#8208;adapt to a changing environment. In particular, a miniature soft robot that can autonomously alter its locomotion mode when it moves from air to hot liquid, a vine&#8208;like filament that can sense and twine around a support, and a light&#8208;switchable magnetic spring are demonstrated. The integration of LCEs and MMPs into monolithic structures introduces a new dimension in the design of soft machines and thus greatly enhances their use in applications in complex environments, especially for miniature soft robots, which are self&#8208;adaptable to environmental changes while being remotely controllable.

      <title>A Patternable and In Situ Formed Polymeric Zinc Blanket for a Reversible Zinc Anode in a Skin&#8208;Mountable Microbattery</title>
      <dc:description>
A zinc blanket created by the coordination between carbonyl oxygen atoms in a polyimide coating and zinc ions overcomes the thermodynamic instability and facilitates plating/stripping kinetics. Patterning this zinc blanket for a Zn microanode allows for the development of a skin&#8208;mountable microbattery with an outstanding rate capability and stable cycling performance, providing promise for microbatteries integrable for electronic skin.








Abstract
Owing to their high safety and reversibility, aqueous microbatteries using zinc anodes and an acid electrolyte have emerged as promising candidates for wearable electronics. However, a critical limitation that prevents implementing zinc chemistry at the microscale lies in its spontaneous corrosion in an acidic electrolyte that causes a capacity loss of 40% after a ten&#8208;hour rest. Widespread anti&#8208;corrosion techniques, such as polymer coating, often retard the kinetics of zinc plating/stripping and lack spatial control at the microscale. Here, a polyimide coating that resolves this dilemma is reported. The coating prevents corrosion and hence reduces the capacity loss of a standby microbattery to 10%. The coordination of carbonyl oxygen in the polyimide with zinc ions builds up over cycling, creating a zinc blanket that minimizes the concentration gradient through the electrode/electrolyte interface and thus allows for fast kinetics and low plating/stripping overpotential. The polyimide's patternable feature energizes microbatteries in both aqueous and hydrogel electrolytes, delivering a supercapacitor&#8208;level rate performance and 400 stable cycles in the hydrogel electrolyte. Moreover, the microbattery is able to be attached to human skin and offers strong resistance to deformations, splashing, and external shock. The skin&#8208;mountable microbattery demonstrates an excellent combination of anti&#8208;corrosion, reversibility, and durability in wearables.

      <title>Phenylene&#8208;Bridged Bispyridinium with High Capacity and Stability for Aqueous Flow Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A self&#8208;regulated conjugation strategy is proposed to engineer viologen for flow batteries. In the oxidized state, the conjugation is &#8220;off&#8221; and the two pyridinium rings behave independently, yielding concomitant transfer of two electrons and one voltage plateau. In the reduced state, the conjugation is &#8220;on&#8221; and the charge can be effectively delocalized, lowering the Lewis basicity and improving the cycling stability of the battery.








Abstract
A rotating phenyl ring is introduced between the two pyridinium rings, namely, 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis[3&#8208;(trimethylamonium)propyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;(1,4&#8208;phenylene)bispyridinium tetrachloride ((APBPy)Cl4), to form a switchable conjugation. In this design, the conjugation is switched &#8220;off&#8221; in the oxidized state and the two pyridinium rings behave independently during the redox process, yielding a concomitant transfer of two electrons at the same potential and, thus, simplifying the battery management. The conjugation is switched &#8220;on&#8221; in the reduced state and the charge can be effectively delocalized, lowering the Lewis basicity and improving its chemical stability. By pairing 0.50 m (APBPy)Cl4 with a 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl oxyl derivative as the positive electrolyte, a flow battery delivers a high standard cell voltage of 1.730&#160;V and a high specific capacity of 20.0 Ah L&#8211;1. The battery also shows an exceptionally high energy efficiency of 80.8% and a superior cycling stability at 80&#160;mA cm&#8211;2. This strategy proves itself a great success in engineering viologen as a two&#8208;electron storage mediator with high capacity and stability.

      <title>Surface Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Fluorescence for Detecting Sub&#8208;Millimeter&#8208;Sized Tumors</title>
      <dc:description>
A surface plasmon&#8208;enhanced short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) fluorescent probe with high brightness is developed. Both the actively and passively targeted imaging probes can locate tumors in vivo with similar intratumor distributions in an SKOV&#8208;3 ovarian cancer model. In addition, these SWIR imaging probes are able to detect sub&#8208;millimeter&#8208;sized tumor nodules, making them excellent candidates for fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided surgery.








Abstract
Short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR, 900&#8211;1700&#160;nm) enables in vivo imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution and penetration depth due to the reduced tissue autofluorescence and decreased photon scattering at long wavelengths. Although small organic SWIR dye molecules have excellent biocompatibility, they have been rarely exploited as compared to their inorganic counterparts, mainly due to their low quantum yield. To increase their brightness, in this work, the SWIR dye molecules are placed in close proximity to gold nanorods (AuNRs) for surface plasmon&#8208;enhanced emission. The fluorescence enhancement is optimized by controlling the dye&#8208;to&#8208;AuNR number ratio and up to &#8776;45&#8208;fold enhancement factor is achieved. In addition, the results indicate that the highest dye&#8208;to&#8208;AuNR number ratio gives the highest emission intensity per weight and this is used for synthesizing SWIR imaging probes using layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) technique with polymer coating protection. Then, the SWIR imaging probes are applied for in vivo imaging of ovarian cancer and the surface coating effect on intratumor distribution of the imaging probes is investigated in two orthotopic ovarian cancer models. Lastly, it is demonstrated that the plasmon&#8208;enhanced SWIR imaging probe has great potential for fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided surgery by showing its capability to detect sub&#8208;millimeter&#8208;sized tumors.

An unusual benefit of vacancies in monolayer 2D semiconductors is enhancing their charge transport properties of a nearest&#8208;neighbor hopping conduction mechanism, to push the performance limit of atomically thin transistors with record&#8208;setting performance metrics.








Abstract
Monolayer 2D semiconductors (e.g., MoS2) are of considerable interest for atomically thin transistors but generally limited by insufficient carrier mobility or driving current. Minimizing the lattice defects in 2D semiconductors represents a common strategy to improve their electronic properties, but has met with limited success to date. Herein, a hidden benefit of the atomic vacancies in monolayer 2D semiconductors to push their performance limit is reported. By purposely tailoring the sulfur vacancies (SVs) to an optimum density of 4.7% in monolayer MoS2, an unusual mobility enhancement is obtained and a record&#8208;high carrier mobility (&gt;115 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) is achieved, realizing monolayer MoS2 transistors with an exceptional current density (&gt;0.60&#160;mA &#181;m&#8722;1) and a record&#8208;high on/off ratio &gt;1010,&#160;and enabling a logic inverter with an ultrahigh voltage gain &gt;100.&#160;The systematic transport studies reveal that the counterintuitive vacancy&#8208;enhanced transport originates from a nearest&#8208;neighbor hopping conduction model, in which an optimum SV density is essential for maximizing the charge hopping probability. Lastly, the vacancy benefit into other monolayer 2D semiconductors is further generalized; thus, a general strategy for tailoring the charge transport properties of monolayer materials is defined.

      <title>Supramolecular Assembled Programmable Nanomedicine As In Situ Cancer Vaccine for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel strategy to use programmable nanomedicine for cancer immunotherapy is presented. A programmable immune activation nanomedicine (PIAN) is constructed through supramolecular modular assembly, which automatically transforms after intravenous injection and finishes sequential multiple steps for eliciting robust immune responses in vivo.








Abstract
Using nanotechnology for improving the immunotherapy efficiency represents a major research interest in recent years. However, there are paradoxes and obstacles in using a single nanoparticle to fulfill all the requirements in the complicated immune activation processes. Herein, a supramolecular assembled programmable immune activation nanomedicine (PIAN) for sequentially finishing multiple steps after intravenous injection and eliciting robust antitumor immunity in situ is reported. The programmable nanomedicine is constructed by supramolecular assembly via host&#8211;guest interactions between poly&#8208;[(N&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)&#8208;aspartamide]&#8208;Pt(IV)/&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (PPCD), CpG/polyamidoamine&#8208;thioketal&#8208;adamantane (CpG/PAMAM&#8208;TK&#8208;Ad), and methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;thioketal&#8208;adamantane (mPEG&#8208;TK&#8208;Ad). After intravenous injection and accumulation at the tumor site, the high level of reactive oxygen species in the tumor microenvironment promotes PIAN dissociation and the release of PPCD (mediating tumor cell killing and antigen release) and CpG/PAMAM (mediating antigen capturing and transferring to the tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes). This results in antigen&#8208;presenting cell activation, antigen presentation, and robust antitumor immune responses. In combination with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody, the PIAN cures 40% of mice in a colorectal cancer model. This PIAN provides a new framework for designing programmable nanomedicine as in situ cancer vaccine for cancer immunotherapy.

      <title>Two&#8208;Photon Polymerization of Nanocomposites for the Fabrication of Transparent Fused Silica Glass Microstructures</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution 3D printing of photocurable silica nanocomposites using two&#8208;photon direct laser writing is presented. The nanocomposites are consecutively debound and sintered to high&#8208;quality fused silica microstructures with optical surface roughness.








Abstract
Fused silica glass is the material of choice for many high&#8208;performance components in optics due to its high optical transparency combined with its high thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability. Especially, the generation of fused silica microstructures is of high interest for microoptical and biomedical applications. Direct laser writing (DLW) is a suitable technique for generating such devices, as it enables nearly arbitrary structuring down to the sub&#8208;micrometer level. In this work, true 3D structuring of transparent fused silica glass using DLW with tens of micrometer resolution and a surface roughness of Ra&#160;&#8776; 6&#160;nm is demonstrated. The process uses a two&#8208;photon curable silica nanocomposite resin that can be structured by DLW, with the printout being convertible to transparent fused silica glass via thermal debinding and sintering. This technology will enable a plethora of applications from next&#8208;generation optics and photonics to microfluidic and biomedical applications with resolutions on the scale of tens of micrometers.

      <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting Induced by the Giant Internal Electric Field of a g&#8208;C3N4/rGO/PDIP Z&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction</title>
      <dc:description>

A notable quantum efficiency of 4.94% at 420 nm and solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen energy&#8208;conversion efficiency of 0.30% are achieved, prominently surpassing many reported g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts.








Abstract
A graphitic carbon nitride/rGO/perylene diimide polymer (g&#8208;C3N4/rGO/PDIP) Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction is successfully constructed to realize high&#8208;flux charge transfer and efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting. A giant internal electric field in the Z&#8208;scheme junction is built, enabling the charge separation efficiency to be enhanced dramatically by 8.5 times. Thus, g&#8208;C3N4/rGO/PDIP presents an efficient and stable photocatalytic overall water splitting activity with H2 and O2 evolution rate of 15.80 and 7.80 &#181;mol h&#8722;1, respectively, &#8776;12.1 times higher than g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets. Meanwhile, a notable quantum efficiency of 4.94% at 420 nm and solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen energy&#8208;conversion efficiency of 0.30% are achieved, prominently surpassing many reported g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts. Briefly, this work throws light on enhancing the internal electric field by interface control to dramatically improve the photocatalytic performance.

      <dc:description>
The combination of yellow&#8208;emissive CsCu2I3 and blue&#8208;emissive Cs3Cu2I5 for environmentally friendly white LEDs is demonstrated by Zhifeng Shi, Lijun Zhang, Chongxin Shan, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2001367. Both copper halides are highly stable against heat, ultraviolet light, and oxygen/moisture degradation, as is demonstrated, and they use this strategy to overcome photon self&#8208;absorption, color instability, and lead&#8208;toxicity issues, which are among the challenges faced for perovskite white LEDs.

      <title>Hybrid Opals: Transparent Hybrid Opals with Unexpected Strong Resonance&#8208;Enhanced Photothermal Energy Conversion (Adv. Mater. 2/2021)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2004732, Michael R. Bockstaller, George Fytas, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude amplification of optical absorption in low&#8208;contrast opals formed by the self&#8208;assembly of polymer&#8208;tethered nanoparticles. The amplification is shown to be caused by the &#8220;slow photons effect&#8221; and to induce rapid &#8220;melting&#8221; of the opal films even in the absence of visible absorption. This work points to novel opportunities for tailoring light&#8211;matter interactions in hybrid materials by deliberate engineering of the molecular structure of polymer chains at interfaces.

      <title>Review on Li Deposition in Working Batteries: From Nucleation to Early Growth</title>
      <dc:description>
Lithium (Li) nucleation and early growth processes significantly determine the final deposition behavior. The recent progress in influential models proposed to understand the process of Li nucleation and early growth is highlighted. Inspired by the abovementioned understanding, diverse anode&#8208;design strategies, which contribute to better batteries with superior electrochemical performance and dendrite&#8208;free deposition behavior, are also summarized.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal is one of the most promising alternative anode materials of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries demanded for advanced energy storage in the coming fourth industrial revolution. Nevertheless, disordered Li deposition easily causes short lifespan and safety concerns and thus severely hinders the practical applications of Li metal batteries. Tremendous efforts are devoted to understanding the mechanism for Li deposition, while the final deposition morphology tightly relies on the Li nucleation and early growth. Here, the recent progress in insightful and influential models proposed to understand the process of Li deposition from nucleation to early growth, including the heterogeneous model, surface diffusion model, crystallography model, space charge model, and Li&#8208;SEI model, are highlighted. Inspired by the abovementioned understanding on Li nucleation and early growth, diverse anode&#8208;design strategies, which contribute to better batteries with superior electrochemical performance and dendrite&#8208;free deposition behavior, are also summarized. This work broadens the horizon for practical Li metal batteries and also sheds light on more understanding of other important metal&#8208;based batteries involving the metal deposition process.

      <title>Self&#8208;Activatable Photo&#8208;Extracellular Vesicle for Synergistic Trimodal Anticancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Self&#8208;activatable photo&#8208;extracellular vesicles are constructed by loading M1 macrophage&#8208;derived EVs with bis[2,4,5&#8208;trichloro&#8208;6&#8208;(pentyloxycarbonyl)phenyl] oxalate, chlorin e6, and prodrug aldoxorubicin. This skillfully engineered extracellular vesicles can actively target tumors owing to its inherent tumor&#8208;homing ability, wherein it exhibits potent trimodal therapy effects in an intersynergistic and self&#8208;controllable way attributed to the interaction between the engineered EV and the special tumor microenvironment.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold great potential in both disease treatment and drug delivery. However, accurate drug release from EVs, as well as the spontaneous treatment effect cooperation of EVs and drugs at target tissues, is still challenging. Here, an engineered self&#8208;activatable photo&#8208;EV for synergistic trimodal anticancer therapy is reported. M1 macrophage&#8208;derived EVs (M1 EVs) are simultaneously loaded with bis[2,4,5&#8208;trichloro&#8208;6&#8208;(pentyloxycarbonyl) phenyl] oxalate (CPPO), chlorin e6 (Ce6), and prodrug aldoxorubicin (Dox&#8208;EMCH). After administration, the as&#8208;prepared system actively targets tumor cells because of the tumor&#8208;homing capability of M1 EVs, wherein M1 EVs repolarize M2 to M1 macrophages, which not only display immunotherapy effects but also produce H2O2. The reaction between H2O2 and CPPO generates chemical energy that activates Ce6, creating both chemiluminescence for imaging and singlet oxygen (1O2) for photodynamic therapy (PDT). Meanwhile, 1O2&#8208;induced membrane rupture leads to the release of Dox&#8208;EMCH, which is then activated and penetrates the deep hypoxic areas of tumors. The synergism of immunotherapy, PDT, and chemotherapy results in potent anticancer efficacy, showing great promise to fight cancers.

After administration, the as&#8208;prepared system actively targets tumor cells because of the tumor&#8208;homing capability of M1 EVs, wherein M1 EVs repolarize M2 to M1 macrophages, which not only display immunotherapy effects but also produce H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The reaction between H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CPPO generates chemical energy that activates Ce6, creating both chemiluminescence for imaging and singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for photodynamic therapy (PDT). Meanwhile, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;induced membrane rupture leads to the release of Dox&#8208;EMCH, which is then activated and penetrates the deep hypoxic areas of tumors. The synergism of immunotherapy, PDT, and chemotherapy results in potent anticancer efficacy, showing great promise to fight cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Metasurfaces: Three&#8208;Dimensional Photoengraving of Monolithic, Multifaceted Metasurfaces (Adv. Mater. 1/2021)</title>
      <dc:description>
Metasurfaces are traditionally 2D metamaterials that manipulate light. In article number 2005454, Shu Yang and co&#8208;workers bring them into 3D by photoengraving diverse metasurfaces onto different facets of monolithic, 3D microstructured arrays in a high&#8208;throughput and on demand fashion. By patterning locally confined metasurfaces on a cube, each cube becomes a multiplexing pixel for color reflection and filtering.

      <dc:description>
The coupling of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layers is demonstrated by Kai Wang, Rui Chen, Wallace C. H. Choy, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2005570. Their results show that a bifunctional ligand can simultaneously diminish the weak van der Waals gap and passivate perovskite defects for efficient energy transfer and radiative recombination. They fabricate blue PeLEDs that show high performance with an EQE of 10.11% and a long stability of 81.3 min.

      <title>Chiral Materials: Fullerene Desymmetrization as a Means to Achieve Single&#8208;Enantiomer Electron Acceptors with Maximized Chiroptical Responsiveness (Adv. Mater. 1/2021)</title>
      <dc:description>
Solubilized fullerene derivatives have revolutionized the development of organic photovoltaic devices, but the isomeric complexity that arises from addition of the solubilizing group is often ignored. In article number 2004115, Matthew J. Fuchter and co&#8208;workers separate 10 pairs of enantiomers from the 19 structural isomers of a common fullerene acceptor. They demonstrate the potential to discriminate circularly polarized light with a fast light&#8208;response time and with a very high photocurrent dissymmetry factor, enabled by a chiral fullerene.

      <title>Thermoelectric Materials: Compositional Fluctuations Locked by Athermal Transformation Yielding High Thermoelectric Performance in GeTe (Adv. Mater. 1/2021)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2005612, Pai&#8208;Chun Wei, Hsin&#8208;Jay Wu,  and co&#8208;workers leverage the interplay between the spinodal decomposition and athermal phase transition in GeTe&#8208;based thermoelectric materials. The exquisite microstructure, featured by strong composition fluctuations and the coexistence of rhombohedral&#8208; and cubic&#8208;GeTe, yield high zT values of &gt;2.6. This work provides a new thermodynamic route to developing higher&#8208;performance thermoelectric materials in general.
