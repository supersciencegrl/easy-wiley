         <title>Fibrillization of Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors Enables 19% Efficiency Pseudo&#8208;Bulk Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The structural order and aggregation of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFA) are critical toward light absorption, phase separation and charge transport properties of their photovoltaic blends with electron donors, and determine the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the corresponding organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, we demonstrate the fibrillization of small molecular NFA L8&#8208;BO with the assistance of fused&#8208;ring solvent additive 1&#8208;fluornaftalen (FN) to substantially improve device PCE. Molecular dynamics simulations show that FN attaches to the backbone of L8&#8208;BO to enhance the intermolecular packing along the conjugated backbone, inducing one&#8208;dimensional self&#8208;assembly of L8&#8208;BO into fine fibrils with a compact polycrystal structure. The L8&#8208;BO fibrils are incorporated into a pseudo&#8208;bulk heterojunction (P&#8208;BHJ) active layer with D18 as donor, and shows enhanced light absorption, charge transport and collection properties, leading to enhanced PCE from 16.0% to an unprecedented 19.0% in the D18/L8&#8208;BO binary P&#8208;BHJ OSC, featuring a high fill factor of 80%. This work demonstrates a strategy for fibrillating NFAs toward enhanced performance of OSCs.

&lt;p&gt;The structural order and aggregation of non-fullerene acceptors (NFA) are critical toward light absorption, phase separation and charge transport properties of their photovoltaic blends with electron donors, and determine the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the corresponding organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, we demonstrate the fibrillization of small molecular NFA L8-BO with the assistance of fused-ring solvent additive 1-fluornaftalen (FN) to substantially improve device PCE. Molecular dynamics simulations show that FN attaches to the backbone of L8-BO to enhance the intermolecular packing along the conjugated backbone, inducing one-dimensional self-assembly of L8-BO into fine fibrils with a compact polycrystal structure. The L8-BO fibrils are incorporated into a pseudo-bulk heterojunction (P-BHJ) active layer with D18 as donor, and shows enhanced light absorption, charge transport and collection properties, leading to enhanced PCE from 16.0% to an unprecedented 19.0% in the D18/L8-BO binary P-BHJ OSC, featuring a high fill factor of 80%.

         <title>High&#8208;performance solution&#8208;processed 2D p&#8208;type WSe2 transistors and circuits through molecular doping</title>

Abstract
Semiconducting ink based on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) single&#8208;crystal flakes with dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surfaces enables the implementation of high&#8208;performance devices on form&#8208;free substrates by cost&#8208;effective and scalable printing processes. However, the lack of solution&#8208;processed p&#8208;type 2D semiconducting inks with high mobility is an obstacle to the development of complementary integrated circuits. Here, we report a versatile strategy of doping with Br2 to enhance the hole mobility by orders of magnitude for p&#8208;type transistors with 2D layered materials. Br2&#8208;doped WSe2 transistors showed a field&#8208;effect hole mobility of more than 27 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, and a high on/off current ratio of &#8764;107, and exhibits excellent operational stability during the on&#8208;off switching, cycling, and bias stressing testing. Moreover, complementary inverters composed of patterned p&#8208;type WSe2 and n&#8208;type MoS2 layered films are demonstrated with an ultra&#8208;high gain of 1280 under a driving voltage (VDD) of 7&#160;V. This work unveils the high potential of solution&#8208;processed 2D semiconductors with low&#8208;temperature processability for flexible devices and monolithic circuitry.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Magnetic Correlations in Frustrated Spinel ZnFe2O4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Magnetic materials with the spinel structure (A2+B3+2O4) form the core of numerous magnetic devices, and ZnFe2O4 constitutes a peculiar example where the nature of the magnetism is still unresolved. Susceptibility measurements revealed a cusp around Tc = 13&#8197;K resembling an antiferromagnetic transition, despite the positive Curie&#8208;Weiss temperature determined to be &#920;CW = 102.8(1)&#8197;K. Bifurcation of field&#8208;cooled and zero&#8208;field&#8208;cooled data below Tc in conjunction with a frequency dependence of the peak position and a non&#8208;zero imaginary component below Tc&#8197;shows&#8197;it is in fact associated with a spin&#8208;glass transition. Highly structured magnetic diffuse neutron scattering from single crystals develops between 50 K and 25 K revealing the presence of magnetic disorder which is correlated in nature. Here, the 3D&#8208;m&#916;PDF method is used to visualize the local magnetic ordering preferences, and ferromagnetic nearest&#8208;neighbor and antiferromagnetic third nearest&#8208;neighbor correlations are shown to be dominant. Their temperature dependence is extraordinary with some flipping in sign, and a strongly varying correlation length. The correlations can be explained by orbital interaction mechanisms for the magnetic pathways, and a preferred spin cluster. Our study demonstrates the power of the 3D&#8208;m&#916;PDF method in visualizing complex quantum phenomena thereby providing a way to obtain an atomic scale understanding of magnetic frustration.

         <title>Towards Efficient and Stable Donor&#8208;Acceptor Luminescent Radicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In contrast to closed&#8208;shell luminescent molecules, the electronic ground state and lowest excited state in organic luminescent radicals are both spin doublet, which results in spin&#8208;allowed radiative transitions. However, successful examples of highly efficient organic luminescent radicals are still rare. Most reported luminescent radicals with high photoluminescent quantum efficiency (PLQE) have a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A&#8226;) chemical structure where an electron&#8208;donating group is covalently attached to an electron&#8208;withdrawing radical core (A&#8226;). Understanding the main factors that define the efficiency and stability of D&#8208;A&#8226; type luminescent radicals remains challenging. Here, we designed and synthesized a series of tri(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical derivatives with donor substituents varying by their extent of conjugation and their number of imine&#8208;type nitrogen atoms. The experimental results suggest that the luminescence efficiency and stability of the radicals are proportional to the degree of conjugation but inversely proportional to the number of imine nitrogen atoms in the substituents; as a result, the molecule with the average extent of conjugation and number of imine nitrogen atoms in the substituent has the highest PLQE (89%). These experimental trends are very well reproduced by density functional theory calculations. The theoretical results indicate that both the luminescence efficiency and radical stability are related to the energy difference between the charge transfer (CT) and local&#8208;excitation (LE) states, which decreases as either the number of imine nitrogen atoms in the substituent increases or its conjugation length decreases. Our study underlines that the optimization of the CT energy is critical to maximize the emitter PLQE: On the one hand, the CT energy has to be high enough in order to reduce the non&#8208;radiative decay rate related to the energy&#8208;gap law; on the other hand, it should remain low with respect to the LE&#8208;state energies to prevent hybridization with the TTM local excitations.

         <title>Hybrid Block Copolymer/Perovskite Heterointerfaces for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid block copolymer/perovskite heterointerfaces strategy is developed for the first time by introducing a novel and functional block copolymer PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PTY6, and consequently, such an architecture enhances light harvesting, promotes charge transfer and prevents moisture invasion, delivering a champion efficiency over 24% together with enhanced stability.








Abstract
Solution processable semiconductors like organics and emerging lead halide perovskites (LHPs) are ideal candidates for photovoltaics combining high performance and flexibility with reduced manufacturing cost. Moreover, the study of hybrid semiconductors would lead to advanced structures and deep understanding that will propel this field even further. Herein, a novel device architecture involving block copolymer/perovskite hybrid bulk heterointerfaces is investigated, such a modification could enhance light absorption, create an energy level cascade, and provides a thin hydrophobic layer, thus enabling enhanced carrier generation, promoting energy transfer and preventing moisture invasion, respectively. The resulting hybrid block copolymer/perovskite solar cell exhibits a champion efficiency of 24.07% for 0.0725&#160;cm2&#8208;sized devices and 21.44% for 1&#160;cm2&#8208;sized devices, respectively, together with enhanced stability, which is among the highest reports of organic/perovskite hybrid devices. More importantly, this approach has been effectively extended to other LHPs with different chemical compositions like MAPbI3 and CsPbI3, which may shed light on the design of highly efficient block copolymer/perovskite hybrid materials and architectures that would overcome current limitations for realistic application exploration.

The resulting hybrid block copolymer/perovskite solar cell exhibits a champion efficiency of 24.07% for 0.0725&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-sized devices and 21.44% for 1&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-sized devices, respectively, together with enhanced stability, which is among the highest reports of organic/perovskite hybrid devices. More importantly, this approach has been effectively extended to other LHPs with different chemical compositions like MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which may shed light on the design of highly efficient block copolymer/perovskite hybrid materials and architectures that would overcome current limitations for realistic application exploration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#8220;Enzyme&#8208;Like&#8221; Spatially Fixed Polyhydroxyl Microenvironment&#8208;Activated Hydrochromic Molecular Switching for Naked Eye Detection of ppm Level Humidity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#8220;enzyme&#8208;like&#8221; construction strategy for ultralow humidity&#8208;sensitive paper (UHSP) is proposed, which activates hydrochromic molecular switching by constructing a spatially&#8208;fixed polyhydroxyl microenvironment. As a result, recyclable naked eye recognition of 0.01&#8211;100&#160;ppm humidity is achieved first. This UHSP provides a more economical, environmental friendly and convenient choice for ultralow humidity monitoring required by high&#8208;tech manufacturing such as chips, solar cells, etc.








Abstract
The detection and monitoring of ultralow humidity (&lt;100&#160;ppm) are critical in many important industries, such as high&#8208;tech manufacturing, scientific research, and aerospace. However, the development of ppm level humidity sensors with portability, low cost, and ease of regeneration remains a significant challenge. Herein, an innovative &#8220;enzyme&#8208;like&#8221; construction strategy is proposed to address this problem by employing suitable molecular&#8208;level humidity&#8208;sensitive units and chemically constructing a multilevel spatial synergistic sensitization microenvironment around it. The as&#8208;prepared ultralow humidity&#8208;sensitive paper (UHSP) achieved a naked eye recognition humidity of 0.01&#8211;100&#160;ppm. UHSP not only is simple to prepare, handy and low&#8208;cost, but can also be simply and efficiently regenerated as well as recycled many times by skillfully utilizing the &#8220;unconventional sublimation&#8221; and &#8220;lime slaked&#8221; of calcium oxide. The molecular reaction mechanisms involved in the humidity response and regeneration of UHSP have been demonstrated in detail. UHSP can provide a promising new method for ultralow humidity detection in the form of portable kits or sirens. The demonstrated &#8220;enzyme&#8208;like&#8221; construction strategy can bring unlimited ideas and implications to the design and development of sensors with tunable response thresholds, particularly high sensitivity.

         <title>Architected Low&#8208;Tortuosity Electrodes with Tunable Porosity from Nonequilibrium Soft&#8208;Matter Processing</title>

Abstract
Mass transport is performance&#8208;defining across energy storage devices, often causing limitations at high current rates. To optimize and balance the device&#8208;scale energy and power density for a given energy storage demand, tailored electrode architectures with precisely controllable phase dimensions are needed in combination with low&#8208;tortuosity channels that maximize the geometric component of diffusion and species flux. We report a material&#8208;agnostic nonequilibrium soft&#8208;matter process to fabricate free&#8208;standing inorganic composite electrodes with adjustable thicknesses of 100s of&#160;&#956;m, featuring straight and accessible channels ranging in diameter from 5&#8211;30&#160;&#956;m, coupled with tunable material&#8208;to&#8208;pore ratios. Such architected anode and cathode electrodes exhibit electrochemical and architectural stability over extended cycling in a full&#8208;cell battery. Further, mass&#8208;transport constraints appear at high current densities, and we identify the lithiation step as rate&#8208;performance limiting, a result of insufficient lithium&#8208;ion supply and concentration polarization. Our results demonstrate the need for and feasibility of tailored electrode architectures where dimensional ratios between low&#8208;tortuosity channels, the charge&#8208;storing matrix, and electrode thickness are tunable to meet coupled power and energy&#8208;storage requirements.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Tunable Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Metatransistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolithic integration of a dielectric metasurface into a perovskite light&#8208;emitting transistor is demonstrated. The &#8220;metatransistor&#8221; shows an 8&#8208;fold enhancement of the electroluminescence compared to the unpatterned device. The combination of pixelated metasurfaces in the active area and electrically switchable recombination zone enables dynamic tunability of the electroluminescence polarization.








Abstract
Emerging immersive visual communication technologies require light sources with complex functionality for dynamic control of polarization, directivity, wavefront, spectrum, and intensity of light. Currently, this is mostly achieved by free space bulk optic elements, limiting the adoption of these technologies. Flat optics based on artificially structured metasurfaces that operate at the sub&#8208;wavelength scale are a viable solution, however, their integration into electrically driven devices remains challenging. Here, a radically new approach to monolithic integration of a dielectric metasurface into a perovskite light&#8208;emitting transistor is demonstrated. It is shown that nanogratings directly structured on top of the transistor channel yield an 8&#8208;fold increase of electroluminescence intensity and dynamic tunability of polarization. This new light&#8208;emitting metatransistor device concept opens unlimited opportunities for light management strategies based on metasurface design and integration.

Abstract
Riding on the rapid growth in electric vehicles and the stationary energy storage market, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries and next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries (i.e., advanced batteries) have been long&#8208;accepted as essential building blocks for future technology reaching the specific energy density of 400&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at the cell&#8208;level. Such progress, mainly driven by the emerging electrode materials or electrolytes, necessitates the development of polymeric materials with advanced functionalities in the battery to address new challenges. Therefore, it is urgently required to understand the basic chemistry and essential research directions in polymeric materials and establish a library for the polymeric materials that enables the development of advanced batteries. Herein, based on indispensable polymeric materials in advanced high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion, lithium&#8211;sulfur, lithium&#8208;metal, and dual&#8208;ion battery chemistry, the key research directions of polymeric materials for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and safety are summarized and design strategies for further improving performance are examined.

Under the banner of &#8220;More than Moore,&#8221; the key to developing solution&#8208;processed semiconductor&#8208;based optoelectronic devices is to add additional functionality to a limited space. Molecular switches can induce transitions between metastable isomers by non&#8208;destructive stimuli, effectively amplifying the functionality of optoelectronic devices when embedded in semiconductors. This review categorizes and discusses molecular&#8208;switch&#8208;embedded optoelectronic devices according to their operating mechanisms.








Abstract
Recent improvements in the performance of solution&#8208;processed semiconductor materials and optoelectronic devices have shifted research interest to the diversification/advancement of their functionality. Embedding a molecular switch capable of transition between two or more metastable isomers by light stimuli is one of the most straightforward and widely accepted methods to potentially realize the multifunctionality of optoelectronic devices. A molecular switch embedded in a semiconductor can effectively control various parameters such as trap&#8208;level, dielectric constant, electrical resistance, charge mobility, and charge polarity, which can be utilized in photoprogrammable devices including transistors, memory, and diodes. This review classifies the mechanism of each optoelectronic transition driven by molecular switches regardless of the type of semiconductor material or molecular switch or device. In addition, the basic characteristics of molecular switches and the persisting technical/scientific issues corresponding to each mechanism are discussed to help researchers. Finally, interesting yet infrequently reported applications of molecular switches and their mechanisms are also described.

         <title>Synthesis of L10&#8208;Iron Triad (Fe, Co, Ni)/pt Intermetallic Electrocatalysts Via a Phosphide&#8208;Induced Structural Phase Transition</title>

Abstract
Structurally ordered L10&#8208;iron triad (Fe, Co, Ni)/Pt with a M(iron triad)/Pt ratio around 1:1 has drawn increasing attention in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis and fuel cell technologies by virtue of the high performance derived from their strong surface strain. However, the synthesis of intermetallic L10&#8208;M(iron triad)Pt generally requires the accurate content control of multicomponent and the sufficient thermal energy to overcome the kinetic barrier for atom diffusion. This work reports a synthesis of sub &#8764;5 nm L10&#8208;intermetallic nanoparticles using phosphide intermediates induced structural phase transition. Taking the L10&#8208;CoPt intermetallic for examples, the formation of the L10 structure depends on the Co2P intermediates can provide abundant P vacancies to accelerate the Pt diffusion into the orthorhombic Co&#8208;rich skeletons, instead of the traditional route of intermetallic from solid solution. L10&#8208;CoPt prepared by this method has a high degree of ordering, and shows the broad adaptability of various Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts with different loading and state to improve their electrocatalytic performance. Additionally, the other L10&#8208;M(iron triad)Pt intermetallics, i.e., L10&#8208;NiPt and L10&#8208;FePt, are also prepared through this phosphide&#8208;induced phase transition. The findings provide a promising strategy for designing other intermetallic materials alloy materials using a structural phase transition induced by a second phase.

         <title>Toward Rapid and Accurate Molecular Diagnostics at Home</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The global outbreaks of infectious diseases have significantly driven an imperative demand for rapid and accurate molecular diagnostics. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) feature high sensitivity and high specificity; however, the labor&#8208;intensive sample preparation and nucleic acid amplification steps remain challenging to carry out rapid and precision molecular diagnostics at home. This Review discusses the advances and challenges of automatic solutions of sample preparation integrated with on&#8208;chip nucleic acid amplification for effective and accurate molecular diagnostics at home. We examine the sample preparation methods of whole blood, urine, saliva/nasal swab, and stool on chip. Then, we investigate the repurposable integrated sample preparation on a chip using various biological samples. Finally, we evaluate the on&#8208;chip NAATs that can be integrated with automated sample preparation. The user&#8208;friendly approaches with combined sample preparation and NAATs can be the game changers for next&#8208;generation rapid and precision home diagnostics.

         <title>Liesegang Phenomenon of Liquid Metals on Au Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Room temperature liquid metals (LM) such as gallium (Ga) own the potential to react with specific materials which would incubate new application categories. Here, diverse self&#8208;organized ring patterns due to nonequilibrium reaction&#8208;diffusion and spreading&#8208;limitation of Ga&#8208;based LM clusters on gold (Au) film are reported, among which diffusion is the controlling step and the self&#8208;limiting oxide layer plays the role of kinetic barrier. Such phenomena, classically known as the Liesegang rings, mainly occurred in electrolyte media. Unlike existing systems, the present periodic crystallization mechanism enables highly symmetric spatiotemporal periodic Liesegang rings on a smaller scale under ambient conditions. Typically, the Ga&#8208;Au and eutectic gallium&#8208;indium alloy (EGaIn)&#8208;Au reaction&#8208;diffusion&#8208;spreading systems are constructed, obtaining the revert type and hybrid type concentric Liesegang patterns, respectively. Competitive patterning behavior of the intermediate phase products AuGa2 and AuIn2 in hybrid Liesegang patterns is further analyzed by altering the initial Ga/In mass ratio, first&#8208;principles calculations, and molecular dynamic simulations. When the mass ratio of In in GaIn alloy exceeds 15%, it will preferentially react with Au. The discovery of LM Liesegang phenomenon is expected to be a flashpoint for self&#8208;organized reaction&#8208;diffusion systems and offer promising rules for diverse areas such as materials synthesis and the jewelry design industry.

         <title>Metavalent Bonding Origins of Unusual Properties of Group IV Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A distinct type of metavalent bonding (MVB) was recently proposed to explain an unusual combination of anomalous functional properties of group IV chalcogenide crystals, whose electronic mechanisms and origin remain controversial. Through theoretical analysis of evolution of bonding along continuous paths in structural and chemical composition space, we demonstrate emergence of MVB in rocksalt chalcogenides as a consequence of weakly broken symmetry of parent metallic simple&#8208;cubic crystals of Group V metalloids. High electronic degeneracy at the nested Fermi surface of the parent metal drives spontaneous breaking of its translational symmetry with structural and chemical fields, which open up a small energy gap and mediate strong coupling between conduction and valence bands making metavalent crystals highly polarizable, conductive, and sensitive to bond&#8208;lengths. Stronger symmetry breaking structural and chemical fields, however, transform them discontinuously to covalent and ionic semiconducting states respectively. MVB involves bonding and antibonding pairwise interactions alternating along linear chains of at least five atoms, which facilitate long range electron transfer in response to polar fields and cause unusual properties. Our precise picture of MVB predicts anomalous second order Raman scattering as an addition to set of their unusual finger&#8208;printing properties, and will guide in design of new metavalent materials with improved thermoelectric, ferroelectric and nontrivial electronic topological properties.

         <title>Tailoring Optical Properties in Transparent Highly Conducting Perovskites by Cationic Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
SrMoO3, SrNbO3, and SrVO3 are remarkable highly conducting d 1 (V, Nb) or d 2 (Mo) perovskite metals with an intrinsically high transparency in the visible. A key scientific question is how the optical properties of these materials can be manipulated to make them suitable for applications as transparent electrodes and in plasmonics. Here we show how 3d/4d cationic substitution in perovskites tailors the relevant materials parameters, i.e., optical transition energy and plasma frequency. At the example of the solid&#8208;state solution SrV1&#8208;xMoxO3 we show that the absorption and reflection edges can be shifted to the edges of the visible light spectrum, resulting in a material that has the potential to outperform indium tin oxide (ITO) due to its extremely low sheet resistance. We find an optimum for x = 0.5, where a resistivity of 32 &#956;&#937;cm (&#8776; 12 &#937;/sq.) is paired with a transmittance above 84% in the whole visible spectrum. Quantitative comparison between experiments and electronic structure calculations show that the shift of the plasma frequency is governed by the interplay of d&#8208;band filling and electronic correlations. This study advances our knowledge about the peculiar class of highly conducting perovskites toward sustainable transparent conductors and emergent plasmonics.

         <title>Switchable Polyacrylonitrile&#8208;Copolymer for Melt&#8208;Processing and Thermal Carbonization &#8211; 3D Printing of Carbon Supercapacitor Electrodes with High Capacitance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) represents the most widely used precursor for carbon fibers and carbon materials. Carbon materials stand out with their high mechanical performance, but they also show excellent electrical conductivity and high surface area. These properties render carbon materials suitable as electrode material for fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors. However, PAN has to be processed from solution before being thermally converted to carbon, limiting its final format to fibers, films, and non&#8208;wovens. Here, we present a PAN&#8208;copolymer with an intrinsic plasticizer to reduce the melting temperature and avoid undesired entering of the thermal carbonization regime.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) represents the most widely used precursor for carbon fibers and carbon materials. Carbon materials stand out with their high mechanical performance, but they also show excellent electrical conductivity and high surface area. These properties render carbon materials suitable as electrode material for fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors. However, PAN has to be processed from solution before being thermally converted to carbon, limiting its final format to fibers, films, and non-wovens. Here, we present a PAN-copolymer with an intrinsic plasticizer to reduce the melting temperature and avoid undesired entering of the thermal carbonization regime. This plasticizer enables melt extrusion-based additive manufacturing (EAM). The plasticizer in the PAN-copolymer can be switched to increase the melting temperature after processing, allowing the 3D-melt-printed workpiece to be thermally carbonized after EAM. Melt-processing of the PAN copolymer extends the freedom-in-design of carbon materials to mold-free rapid prototyping, in the absence of solvents, which enables more economic and sustainable manufacturing processes. As an example for the capability of this material system, we print open meshed carbon electrodes for supercapacitors that are metal- and binder-free with an optimized thickness of 1.5&#160;mm and a capacitance of up to 387 mF cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Versatile and Low&#8208;Cost polymer donor based on 4&#8208;Chlorothiazole for Highly Efficient Polymer solar cells</title>

Abstract
Benefiting from the emerge of narrow&#8208;band&#8208;gap small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs), especially &#8220;Y&#8221; series, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer solar cells (PSCs) is rapidly improved. However, polymer donors with high efficiency, easy synthesis and good universality are relatively scarce except PM6 and D18. Herein, we designed and synthesized two polymer donors based on 4&#8208;chlorothiazole derivatives with simple structures, namely PTz3Cl and PBTTz3Cl. The OSCs based on PBTTz3Cl with slightly weaker intermolecular forces in comparison to PTz3Cl exhibits a decent PCE of 18.38% in blending with SMA L8&#8208;BO, owing to its strong donor/acceptor interaction with L8&#8208;BO, which shapes suitable phase separation morphology. Further research found that PBTTz3Cl can exhibit excellent photovoltaic performances with various SMA materials, highlighting its universality. Based on this, ternary PSCs are designed where BTP&#8208;eC9 is introduced as a guest into the PBTTz3Cl:L8&#8208;BO host system. Thanks to further optimal blend morphology and more balanced charge transport, the PCE is improved up to 19.12%, which is among the highest values for PSCs. This work provides a new design of low&#8208;cost electron&#8208;deficient units for constructing highly versatile, high&#8208;performance polymer donors.

         <title>Dilute Alloying to Implant Activation Centers in Nitride Electrocatalysts for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dilute alloying is an effective strategy to tune properties of solid catalysts but has rarely been leveraged in complex reactions beyond small molecule conversion. In this work, dilute dopants were demonstrated to serve as activating centers to construct multiatom catalytic domains in metal nitride electrocatalysts for lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, of which the sulfur cathode suffers from sluggish and complex conversion reactions. With titanium nitride (TiN) as a model system, the dilute cobalt alloying was shown to greatly improve the reaction kinetics while inducing negligible catalyst reconstruction. Compared to the pristine TiN, the dilute nitride alloy catalyst enabled one&#8208;fold increase in the high&#8208;rate (2.0 C) capacities of Li&#8211;S batteries, as well as impressively low cyclic decay rate of 0.17% at a sulfur loading of 4.0 mgS cm&#8722;2. This work opens up new opportunities toward the rational design of Li&#8211;S electrocatalysts by dilute alloying and also enlightens the understandings of complex domain&#8208;catalyzed reactions in energy applications.

         <title>Bifacial Dye Membranes: Ultrathin and Free&#8208;Standing although not Being Covalently Bound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of template layers for extension of Langmuir&#8208;Blodgett and related techniques to utilize water&#8208;soluble dyes for the synthesis of quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional molecular layers at the water&#8208;air interface is . Bilayers and intercalated layers stable enough to span 25 &#181;m &#215; 25 &#181;m meshes, although not covalently bonded, are demonstrated. Scalable fabrication of these broadly absorbing pi&#8208;conjugated films is realized via a modified roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll process.








Abstract
Layers of aligned dyes are key to photo&#8208;driven charge separation in dye sensitized solar cells, but cannot be exploited as rectifying membranes in photocatalysis to separate half&#8208;cells because they are not sufficiently stable. While impressive work on the fabrication of stable noncovalent membranes has been recently demonstrated, these membranes are inherently suffering from non&#8208;uniform orientation of the constituting dyes. To stabilize layers made from uniformly assembled and aligned dyes, they can be covalently cross&#8208;linked via functional groups or via chromophores at the expense of their optical properties. Here stable membranes from established dyes are reported that do not need to be elaborately functionalized nor do their chromophores need to be destroyed. These membranes are free&#8208;standing, although being only non&#8208;covalently linked. To enable uniform dye&#8208;alignment, Langmuir layers made from linear, water&#8208;insoluble dyes are used. That water&#8208;soluble charge transfer dyes adsorb onto and intercalate into the Langmuir layer from the aqueous subphase, thus yielding free&#8208;standing, molecularly thin membranes are demonstrated. The developed bifacial layers consist almost entirely of &#960;&#8208;conjugated units and thus can conduct charges and can be further engineered for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications.

         <dc:description>
Topological materials offer conceptual novelties and provide unique platforms for exploring fundamental science questions and transformational next&#8208;generation technologies. This perspective presents a cross section&#160;through the recent work focused on understanding the role of geometry and topology in generating topological states and their responses to external stimuli, and as a basis for connecting theory and experiment within the band theory paradigm. The image highlights how constant energy surfaces in topological materials differ fundamentally from those in normal materials.








Abstract
Interest in topological materials continues to grow unabated in view of their conceptual novelties as well as their potential as platforms for transformational new technologies. Electronic states in a topological material are robust against perturbations and support unconventional electromagnetic responses. The first&#8208;principles band&#8208;theory paradigm has been a key player in the field by providing successful prediction of many new classes of topological materials. This perspective presents a cross section&#160;through the recent work on understanding the role of geometry and topology in generating topological states and their responses to external stimuli, and as a basis for connecting theory and experiment within the band theory framework. In this work, effective strategies for topological materials discovery and impactful directions for future topological materials research are also commented.

         <title>Tolerogenic Nanovaccine for Prevention and Treatment of Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tolerogenic nanovaccine is constructed to deliver a self&#8208;antigen and dexamethasone on an abatacept&#8208;modified polydopamine nanoparticle. In experimental&#8208;autoimmune encephalomyelitis model mice, preimmunization of the nanovaccine completely blocks the development of clinical symptoms. Immunization after the self&#8208;antigen injection ameliorates the symptoms of autoimmune encephalomyelitis. The concept of tolerogenic nanovaccine can be applied to other autoimmune diseases.








Abstract
Herein, a tolerogenic nanovaccine is developed and tested on an animal model of multiple sclerosis. The nanovaccine is constructed to deliver the self&#8208;antigen, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide, and dexamethasone on an abatacept&#8208;modified polydopamine core nanoparticle (AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG). AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG can target dendritic cells and undergo endocytosis followed by trafficking to lysosomes. AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG blocks the interaction between CD80/CD86 and CD28 in antigen&#8208;presenting cells and T cells, leading to decreased interferon gamma secretion. The subcutaneous administration of AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG to mice yields significant biodistribution to lymph nodes and, in experimental&#8208;autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model mice, increases the integrity of the myelin basic sheath and minimizes the infiltration of immune cells. EAE mice are treated with AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG before or after injection of the autoantigen, MOG. Preimmunization of AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG before the injection of MOG completely blocks the development of clinical symptoms. Early treatment with AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG at three days after injection of MOG also completely blocks the development of symptoms. Notably, treatment of EAE symptom&#8208;developed mice with AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG significantly alleviates the symptoms, indicating that the nanovaccine has therapeutic effects. Although AbaLDPN is used for MOG peptide delivery in the EAE model, the concept of AbaLDPN can be widely applied for the prevention and alleviation of other autoimmune diseases.

Notably, treatment of EAE symptom-developed mice with AbaLDPN-MOG significantly alleviates the symptoms, indicating that the nanovaccine has therapeutic effects. Although AbaLDPN is used for MOG peptide delivery in the EAE model, the concept of AbaLDPN can be widely applied for the prevention and alleviation of other autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Through the Lens of a Momentum Microscope: Viewing Light&#8208;Induced Quantum Phenomena in 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, time&#8208;resolved momentum&#8208;microscopy is highlighted as a powerful new technique for characterizing photoexcited two&#8208;dimensional materials in momentum&#8208;space. The recent scientific progress that is&#160;made thanks to this technique is surveyed. The future directions in which it will be impactful are outlined: the dynamics of photoexcitations, and the control of the band&#8208;structure by Floquet band engineering.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) materials at their 2D limit are diverse, flexible, and unique laboratories to study fundamental quantum phenomena and their future applications. Their novel properties rely on their pronounced Coulomb interactions, variety of crystal symmetries and spin&#8208;physics, and the ease of incorporation of different vdW materials to form sophisticated heterostructures. In particular, the excited state properties of many 2D semiconductors and semi&#8208;metals are relevant for their technological applications, particularly those that can be induced by light. In this paper, the recent advances made in studying out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium, light&#8208;induced, phenomena in these materials are reviewed using powerful, surface&#8208;sensitive, time&#8208;resolved photoemission&#8208;based techniques, with a particular emphasis on the emerging multi&#8208;dimensional photoemission spectroscopy technique of time&#8208;resolved momentum microscopy. The advances this technique has enabled in studying the nature and dynamics of occupied excited states in these materials are discussed. Then, the future research directions opened by these scientific and instrumental advancements are projected for studying the physics of 2D materials and the opportunities to engineer their band&#8208;structure and band&#8208;topology by laser fields.

         <title>Heterogenization of Molecular Electrocatalytic Active Sites through Reticular Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Considering the importance of electrochemical catalysis in energy conversion reactions, in this review, notable active sites of molecular and heterogeneous electrocatalysts are identified. The recent progress in metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based electrochemical catalysis, which primarily involves active site heterogenization through reticular chemistry, is also overviewed. Finally, the design strategies for the assembly of effective MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts are discussed.








Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of small molecules, such as CO2, O2, and H2O, has received significant attention as a potential engine for sustainable life. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a promising class of electrocatalytic materials for such processes. An attractive aspect of utilizing this class of materials as electrocatalysts is that well&#8208;known molecular active sites can be introduced to well&#8208;defined crystalline heterogeneous catalytic systems with high tunability. This review offers strategic insights into recent studies on MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts by discussing the notable active sites that have been utilized in both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, while highlighting instances where such active sites have been introduced into MOFs. In addition, material design principles enabling the integration of electrochemically active components with the MOF platform are outlined. Viewpoints on the viability of MOFs as an alternative to currently used electrocatalysts are also discussed. Finally, the future direction of MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysis research is established.

         <title>A Molecular Engineering Strategy for Achieving Blue Phosphorescent Carbon Dots with Outstanding Efficiency Above 50%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Highly efficient emission has been a long&#8208;lasting pursuit for carbon dots (CDs) owing to their enormous potential in optoelectronic applications. Nevertheless, their room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) performance still largely lags behind their outstanding fluorescence emission, especially in the blue&#160;spectral region. Herein, high&#8208;efficiency blue RTP CDs have been designed and constructed via a simple molecular engineering strategy, enabling CDs with an unprecedented phosphorescence quantum efficiency of to 50.17% and a long lifetime of 2.03 s. This treating route facilitates the formation of high&#8208;density (n, &#960;*) configurations in the CD &#960;&#8208;&#960; conjugate system through the introduction of abundant functional groups, which can evoke a strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling and further promote the intersystem crossing from singlet to triplet excited states and radiative recombination from triplet excited states to ground state. With blue phosphorescent CDs as triplet donors, green, red, and white afterglow composites are successfully fabricated via effective phosphorescence F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. Importantly, the color temperature of the white afterglow emission can be widely and facilely tuned from cool white to pure white and warm white. Moreover, advanced information encryption, light illumination, and afterglow/dynamic visual&#160;display have been demonstrated when using these multicolor&#8208;emitting CD&#8208;based afterglow systems.

         <title>Ternary All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Efficiency up to 18.14% Employing a Two&#8208;Step Sequential Deposition</title>

Abstract
Achieving a finely tuned active layer morphology with a suitable vertical phase to facilitate both charge generation and charge transport has long been the main goal for pursuing the highly efficient bulk heterojunction (BHJ) all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Herein, a solution to address the above challenge via synergistically combining the ternary blend strategy and the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) procedure is proposed. By introducing a synthesized polymer acceptor (PA), PY&#8208;Cl, with higher crystallinity into the designed host acceptor PY&#8208;SSe&#8208;V, vertical phase distribution and molecular ordering of the LbL&#8208;type ternary all&#8208;PSCs can be improved in comparison to the LbL&#8208;type PM6/PY&#8208;SSe&#8208;V binary all&#8208;PSCs. The formation of the superior bulk microstructure can not only promote charge transport and extraction properties but also reduce energetic disorder and non&#8208;radiative recombination loss, thus improving all three photovoltaic parameters simultaneously. Consequently, the PM6/(PY&#8208;SSe&#8208;V:PY&#8208;Cl) ternary all&#8208;PSCs show the best efficiency of 18.14%, which is among the highest values reported to date for all&#8208;PSCs. This work provides a facile and effective LbL&#8208;type ternary strategy for obtaining high&#8208;efficiency all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Partially Nitrided Ni Nanoclusters Achieve Energy&#8208;Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CO at Ultralow Overpotential</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a promising strategy to lower CO2 emission while producing value&#8208;added chemicals. A great challenge facing CO2RR is how to improve energy efficiency by reducing overpotentials. Herein, we report partially nitrided Ni nanoclusters (NiNx) immobilized on N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) for CO2RR, which achieves the lowest onset overpotential of 16&#160;mV for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO and the highest cathode energy efficiency of 86.9% with CO Faraday efficiency &gt;99.0% to date. Interestingly, NiNx/NCNT affords a CO generation rate of 43.0 mol&#8901;g&#8722;1&#8901;h&#8722;1 at a low potential of &#8208;0.572&#160;V (versus RHE). DFT calculations reveal that the NiNx nanoclusters favour *COOH formation with lower Gibbs free energy than isolated Ni single&#8208;atom, hence lowering CO2RR overpotential. As NiNx/NCNT is applied to a membrane electrode assembly system coupled with oxygen evolution reaction, a cell voltage of only 2.13&#160;V is required to reach 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, with total energy efficiency of 62.2%.

         <title>A Twin S&#8208;Scheme Artificial Photosynthetic System with Self&#8208;Assembled Heterojunctions yields Superior Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Rate</title>

Abstract
Designing heterojunction photocatalysts imitating natural photosynthetic systems has been a promising approach for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. However, in the traditional Z&#8208;Scheme artificial photosynthetic systems, the poor charge separation, and rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers remain a huge bottleneck. To rationally design S&#8208;Scheme (i.e., Step scheme) heterojunctions by avoiding the futile charge transport routes is therefore seen as an attractive approach to achieving high hydrogen evolution rates. Herein, we propose a twin S&#8208;scheme heterojunction involving graphitic C3N4 nanosheets self&#8208;assembled with hydrogen&#8208;doped rutile TiO2 nanorods and anatase TiO2 nanoparticles. This catalyst shows an excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 62.37&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and high apparent quantum efficiency of 45.9% at 365&#160;nm. The significant enhancement of photocatalytic performance is attributed to the efficient charge separation and transfer induced by the unique twin S&#8208;scheme structure. The charge transfer route in the twin S&#8208;scheme is confirmed by in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron spin resonance (ESR) spin&#8208;trapping tests. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectroscopy, transient&#8208;state surface photovoltage (TPV) and other ex&#8208;situ characterizations further corroborate the efficient charge transport across the catalyst interface. This work offers a new perspective on constructing artificial photosynthetic systems with S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions to enhance photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Self&#8208;healing electronics for prognostic monitoring of methylated circulating tumor DNAs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Methylated circulating DNAs (ctDNAs) have recently been reported as a promising biomarker for early cancer diagnostics, but limited tools are currently available for continuous and dynamic profiling of ctDNAs and their methylation levels, especially when such assays need to be conducted in point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) scenarios. Here, we developed a self&#8208;healing bioelectronic patch (iMethy) that combines transdermal interstitial fluid (ISF) extraction and field effect transistor&#8208;based (FET&#8208;based) biosensing for dynamic monitoring of methylated ctDNAs as a prognostic approach for cancer risk management. The projection micro&#8208;stereolithography&#8208;based 3D patterning of an EGaIn circuit with an unprecedented 10&#160;&#956;m resolution enables the construction of self&#8208;healing Eutectic Gallium&#8208;Indium&#160;microfluidic circuits that remain conductive under 100% strain and self&#8208;healing under severe destruction. In combination with continuous transdermal ISF sampling of methylated ctDNAs, iMethy can detect ctDNAs as low as 10&#8722;16&#160;M in cellular models and is capable of phenotypic analysis of tumor growth in rodent animals. As the first demonstration of a wearable device for real&#8208;time in vivo analysis of disease&#8208;indicative biomarkers, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study well demonstrated the potential of the iMethy platform for cancer risk management based on dynamic transdermal surveillance of methylated ctDNAs via a painless and self&#8208;administrable procedure.

         <title>Engineering Grain Boundaries in Two&#8208;Dimensional Electronic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grain boundary engineering in 2D electronic materials for emergent properties is reviewed. Reported structural engineering methods and emergent properties are introduced for various stacking and stitching boundaries such as twist boundary, tilt boundary, stacking fault, and dislocation arrays. Also, remaining challenges and outlook for the future research directions are discussed.








Abstract
Engineering the boundary structures in 2D materials provides an unprecedented opportunity to program the physical properties of the materials with extensive tunability and realize innovative devices with advanced functionalities. However, structural engineering technology is still in its infancy, and creating artificial boundary structures with high reproducibility remains difficult. In this review, various emergent properties of 2D materials with different grain boundaries, and the current techniques to control the structures, are introduced. The remaining challenges for scalable and reproducible structure control and the outlook on the future directions of the related techniques are also discussed.

         <title>A Hemispherical Image Sensor Array Fabricated with Organic Photomemory Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors develop a photolithographic process to prepare a hemispherical image sensor array using one organic thin film photomemory transistor per pixel. Their organic thin&#8208;film photomemory transistors can achieve linear photoresponse, along with the best responsivity for similar dark currents among all the reported hemispherical image sensor arrays to date.








Abstract
Hemispherical image sensors simplify lens designs, reduce optical aberrations, and improve image resolution for compact wide&#8208;field&#8208;of&#8208;view cameras. To achieve hemispherical image sensors, organic materials are promising candidates due to the following advantages: tunability of optoelectronic/spectral response and low&#8208;temperature low&#8208;cost processes. Here, a photolithographic process is developed to prepare a hemispherical image sensor array using organic thin film photomemory transistors with a density of 308 pixels per square centimeter. This design includes only one photomemory transistor as a single active pixel, in contrast to the conventional pixel architecture, consisting of select/readout/reset transistors and a photodiode. The organic photomemory transistor, comprising light&#8208;sensitive organic semiconductor and charge&#8208;trapping dielectric, is able to achieve a linear photoresponse (light intensity range, from 1 to 50&#160;W m&#8722;2), along with a responsivity as high as 1.6 A W&#8722;1 (wavelength = 465&#160;nm) for a dark current of 0.24 A m&#8722;2 (drain voltage =&#160;&#8722;1.5&#160;V). These observed values represent the best responsivity for similar dark currents among all the reported hemispherical image sensor arrays to date. A transfer method was&#160;further developed that does not damage organic materials for hemispherical organic photomemory transistor arrays. These developed techniques are scalable and are amenable for other high&#8208;resolution 3D organic semiconductor devices.

         <title>A Zn8 Double&#8208;Cavity Metallacalix[8]arene as Molecular Sieve to Realize Self&#8208;Cleaning Intramolecular Tandem Transformation of Li&#8722;S Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intramolecular relay transformation mechanism of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is realized exclusively by the delicately&#8208;designed Zn8 clusters, which originates from the synergy of steric hindrance within Zn8 clusters and selective adsorption of LiPSs to the active site in Zn8 clusters. This unique mechanism innovatively realizes the self&#8208;cleaning of active sites and continuous electrochemistry for Li&#8208;S batteries.








Abstract
Toward the well&#8208;explored lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) catalytic chemistry, the slow adsorption&#8208;migration&#8208;conversion kinetics of lithium polysulfides on catalytic materials and Li2S deposition&#8208;induced passivation of active sites limit the rapid and complete conversion of sulfur. Conceptively, molecular architectures can provide atom&#8208;precise models to understand the underlying active sites responsible for selective adsorption and conversion of LiPSs and Li2S2/Li2S species. Here, an octanuclear Zn(II) (Zn8) cluster is presented, which features a metallacalix[8]arene with double cavities up and down the Zn8 ring. The central Zn8 ring and the specific double cavities with organic ligands of different electronegativity and bonding environments render active sites with variable steric hindrance and interaction toward the sulfur&#8208;borne species. An intramolecular tandem transformation mechanism is realized exclusively by Zn8 cluster, which promotes the self&#8208;cleaning of active sites and continuous electrochemical reaction. Notably, the external azo groups and internal Zn/O sites of Zn8 cluster in sequence stimulate the adsorption and conversion of long chain Li2Sx (x&#160;&#8805; 4) and short chain Li2S/Li2S2, contributing to remarkable rate performance and cycling stability. This work pioneers the application of metallacalix[n]arene clusters with atom&#8208;precise structure in Li&#8722;S batteries, and the proposed mechanism advances the molecule&#8208;level understanding of Li&#8722;S catalytic chemistry.

         <title>Regulation of Polymer Configurations Enables Green Solvent&#8208;Processed Large&#8208;Area Binary All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells With Breakthrough Performance and High Efficiency Stretchability Factor</title>

         <dc:description>
Regulation of the configurations of the non&#8208;conjugated polymer acceptors enables green solvent&#8208;processed large&#8208;area binary all&#8208;polymer solar cells to achieve record efficiency and robustness. This study not only provides a series of reliable novel conductive materials with excellent performance for flexible wearable solar cells but also elucidates a concept to evaluate the comprehensive performance of organic solar cells.








Abstract
With the great potential of the all&#8208;polymer solar cells for large&#8208;area wearable devices, both large&#8208;area device efficiency and mechanical flexibility are very critical but attract limited attention. In this work, from the perspective of the polymer configurations, two types of terpolymer acceptors PYTX&#8208;A and PYTX&#8208;B (X&#160;= Cl or H) are developed. The configuration difference caused by the replacement of non&#8208;conjugated units results in distinct photovoltaic performance and mechanical flexibility. Benefiting from a good match between the intrinsically slow film&#8208;forming of the active materials and the technically slow film&#8208;forming of the blade&#8208;coating process, the toluene&#8208;processed large&#8208;area (1.21 cm2) binary device achieves a record efficiency of 14.70%. More importantly, a new parameter of efficiency stretchability factor (ESF) is proposed for the first time to comprehensively evaluate the overall device performance. PM6:PYTCl&#8208;A and PM6:PYTCl&#8208;B yield significantly higher ESF than PM6:PY&#8208;IT. Further blending with non&#8208;conjugated polymer donor PM6&#8208;A, the best ESF of 3.12% is achieved for PM6&#8208;A:PYTCl&#8208;A, which is among the highest comprehensive performances.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Change Perovskite Microlaser with Tunable Polarization Vortex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A subwavelength&#8208;thin perovskite metasurface supporting multiple bound states in the continuum is used to realize a tunable polarization&#8208;vortex laser. The structural phase&#8208;change properties of the perovskite induce bistable dynamic switching of the topological charges as a function of temperature.








Abstract
Metasurfaces supporting optical bound states in the continuum (BICs) are emerging as simple and compact optical cavities to realize polarization&#8208;vortex lasers. The winding of the polarization around the singularity defines topological charges which are generally set by the cavity design and cannot be altered without changing geometrical parameters. Here, a subwavelength&#8208;thin phase&#8208;change halide perovskite BIC metasurface functioning as a tunable polarization vortex microlaser is demonstrated. Upon the perovskite structural phase transitions, both its refractive index and gain vary substantially, inducing reversible and bistable switching between distinct polarization vortexes underpinned by opposite topological charges. Dynamic tuning and switching of the resulting vector beams may find use in microscopy imaging, particle trapping and manipulation, and optical data storage.

         <title>Tension&#8208;Induced Cavitation in Li Metal Stripping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Designing stable Li metal and supporting solid structures (SSS) is of fundamental importance in rechargeable Li&#8208;metal batteries. Yet, the stripping kinetics of Li metal and its mechanical effect on the supporting solids (including solid electrolyte interface) remain mysterious to date. Here, through nanoscale in&#8208;situ observations of a solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal battery in an electron microscope, we discover two distinct cavitation&#8208;mediated Li stripping modes controlled by the ratio of the SSS thickness (t) to the Li deposit's radius (r). A quantitative criterion is established to understand the damage tolerance of SSS on the Li metal stripping pathways. For mechanically unstable SSS (t/r &lt; 0.21), the stripping proceeds via tension&#8208;induced multisite cavitation accompanied by severe SSS buckling and necking, ultimately leading to Li &#8220;trapping&#8221; or &#8220;dead Li&#8221; formation; for mechanically stable SSS (t/r &gt; 0.21), the Li metal undergoes nearly planar stripping from the root via single cavitation, showing negligible buckling. Our work, by providing a fundamental understanding of the cycling behavior of Li metal inside supporting solid structures, is of potential importance to the design of delicate Li metal supporting structures to high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Ultrasound&#8208;Driven Bioorthogonal Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bioorthogonal chemistry, referring to the rapid and selective synthesis of imaging and/or therapeutic molecules in live animals via transition metal&#8208;mediated non&#8208;natural chemical transformation without disrupting endogenous reactions, has greatly expanded the tools and techniques for biomedicine. However, owing to safety concerns associated with metal toxicity, selectivity, sensitivity, and stability, efficient bioorthogonal reactions that can be reliably executed in complex biological environments remain challenging. In this study, we established an intelligent, versatile bioorthogonal catalyst based on ultrasmall poly(acrylic acid)&#8208;modified copper nanocomplexes (Cu@PAA NCs) to achieve high spatiotemporal catalytic efficacy. The catalytic activity of the Cu@PAA NCs can be reversibly regulated via valence state interconversion between Cu(II) and Cu(I) under exogenous ultrasound irradiation, promoting off&#8208;target prodrug activation in lesion sites through the Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition reaction. Moreover, ultrasound&#8208;triggered electron&#8208;hole separation endowed the Cu@PAA NCs with robust sonosensitizing ability for sonodynamic therapy. Furthermore, the Cu@PAA NCs exhibited enhanced contrast in magnetic resonance and photoacoustic imaging. Notably, the renal&#8208;clearable Cu@PAA NCs exhibit intrinsically benign biocompatibility. This spatiotemporally ultrasound&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal catalysis not only expands the repertoire of in situ therapeutic agents but also provides a new avenue for disease theranostics.

Abstract
Overcoming apoptosis resistance to achieve efficient breast cancer treatment remains a challenge. The precise induction of another form of programmed cell death, pyroptosis, is an excellent alternative for treating cancer. We developed ultrasound (US)&#8208;enhanced enzyme dynamic (enzyodynamic) therapy (EDT) by employing LaFeO3 perovskite nanocrystals as a substrate to increase the rate of deleterious reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation for intensive cell pyroptosis. LaFeO3 nanocrystals possess quadruple enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities, including oxidase&#8208;, peroxidase&#8208;, glutathione peroxidase&#8208;, and catalase&#8208;mimicking activities, which undertake the dominant therapeutic task through cascade catalytic reactions, including the reversal of hypoxic microenvironment, depletion of endogenous glutathione, and continuous output of ROS. US exogenous stimulation increases the transition rate of the intermediate complex to Fe (II) and favors incremental ROS production, by which the ROS burst&#8208;induced pyroptosis process is accomplished through the ROS&#8208;TXNIP&#8208;NLRP3&#8208;GSDMD pathway. Both in vitro and in vivo antineoplastic outcomes affirmed the ascendancy of LaFeO3 nanozyme&#8208;induced pyroptosis. This work highlights the critical role of US coupled with nanocatalytic reactors in pyroptosis&#8208;dominant breast cancer treatment with the apoptosis resistance circumvention feature.

Multi&#8208;resonance (MR)&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters based on B&#8208; and N&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatics are desirable for ultrahigh&#8208;definition organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and narrow bandwidth. But the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rates of MR&#8208;TADF emitters are usually small, resulting in severe efficiency roll&#8208;off at high brightness. To solve the issue, a sensitizer for MR&#8208;TADF emitter is required. Herein, a new MR&#8208;TADF emitter has been developed through coordination of Au with B/N&#8208;embedded polycyclic ligand. Benefitting from the Au perturbation, the RISC rate is dramatically accelerated to 2.3&#215;107 s&#8722;1, leading to delayed fluorescence lifetime as short as 4.3 &#956;s. Meanwhile, the PLQY of 95% and full width at half maximum of 39&#160;nm (0.18&#160;eV) are essentially unchanged after metal coordination. Therefore, a high PLQY, short delayed fluorescence lifetime, and high color purity have been concurrently realized in a single TADF emitter. Accordingly, vacuum&#8208;deposited OLEDs exhibit high&#8208;performance electroluminescence with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 35.8% without sensitization. The EQE is maintained as high as 32.3% at 10000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. Furthermore, solution&#8208;processed OLED based on the emitter also achieves excellent performance with a maximum EQE of 25.7% and a small efficiency roll&#8208;off.

         <title>Rapid Melt&#8208;Quenching Enables General Synthesis of High&#8208;Loading Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Bicontinuous Nanoporous Structure</title>

Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts have attracted extensive attention due to their unique atomic structures and extraordinary activities in catalyzing chemical reactions. However, the lack of general and efficient approaches for producing high&#8208;density single atoms on suitably tailored supporting matrixes hinders their industrial applications. Here, we report a rapid melt&#8208;quenching strategy with high throughput to synthesize single atoms with high metal&#8208;atom loadings of up to 9.7 wt% or 2.6 at.% on nanoporous metal compounds, representing several&#8208;fold improvements compared to benchmarks in the literature. Mechanism characterizations reveal that the high temperature melting provides the essential liquid environment and activation energy to achieve the atomization of metals, while the following rapid&#8208;quenching pins the isolated metal atoms and stabilizes the coordination environment. In comparison with carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts, various collaboration combinations of single atoms and nanoporous metal compounds can be synthesized by using our strategy, thus achieving efficient hydrazine oxidation assisted H2 production. This synthesis protocol is highly compatible with automatic operation, which provides a feasible and general route to design and manufacture specific single&#8208;atom catalysts with tunable atomic metal components and supporting matrixes, thus promoting the deployment of single&#8208;atom catalysts for various energy technology applications.

Abstract
The morphology plays a key role in determining the charge generation and collection process, thus impacting the device performances of organic solar cells (OSCs). The limited selection pool of additives to optimize the morphology of OSCs, especially for the emerging layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) OSCs, impeding the further improvements of photovoltaic performances. Herein, we report a new method of using conjugated polymers as the additives to optimize the active layer morphology for improving the photovoltaic performances of LbL&#8208;OSCs. Four polymers of P&#8208;H, P&#8208;S, P&#8208;F and P&#8208;Cl were developed with different side chains. These polymers exhibited poor performances as donor materials and additives in the BHJ devices, due to the unsuitable energy level alignment and unfavorable molecular interactions. By contrast, they could be served as efficient additives to optimize the PM6 fibril matrix for facilitating the penetration of BTP&#8208;eC9 and forming intertwined D/A bicontinuous network with a favorable vertical segregation. Such morphology was further optimized by side chain engineering, which enabled to improve progressively the charge separation and collection. As a result, adding a small amount of P&#8208;Cl as the additive into the PM6 layer, the optimized morphology contributed to a champion PCE of 19.10% with a decent high FF of 80.5%.

         <title>Modulating the Site Density of Mo Single Atoms to Catch Adventitious O Atoms for Efficient H2O2 Oxidation with Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Coordination environment and site density have great impacts on the catalytic performance for single atoms (SAs). Herein, we modulate the site density of Mo&#8208;SAs on red polymeric carbon nitrides (RPCN) via a local carbonization strategy to controllably catch adventitious O atoms from open environment. The addition of melamine derivants with hydrocarbyl chains induced local carbonization during RPCN pyrolysis. These local carbonization regions bring abundant graphitic N3C to anchor Mo&#8208;SAs, and most of Mo&#8208;SAs catch the O atoms in air, forming the O2&#8208;covered Mo&#8208;N3 coordination. The dopants of carbon source with different structure and amounts could modulate the site density of Mo&#8208;SAs, therefore controlling the amounts of coordinated O atoms. Furthermore, coordinated O atoms around Mo&#8208;SAs construct the catalytic environment with Lewis base and gather photo&#8208;generated electrons under light. Such O&#8208;covered Mo&#8208;SAs endow RPCN materials (Mo&#8208;RPCN) with a strong ability for hydrogen abstraction, leading to the 99.51% ratio (28.8 mmol&#183;min&#8722;1&#183;g&#8722;1) rate for thioanisole conversion with H2O2 assisted advance oxidation technology. This work brings a new sight on the coordinated atoms dominant oxidation process.

         <title>Composition&#8208;Controllable Syntheses and Property Modulations from 2D Ferromagnetic Fe5Se8 to Metallic Fe3Se4 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the composition&#8208;controllable syntheses of 2D non&#8208;layered iron selenide nanosheets (25% Fe&#8208;intercalated triclinic Fe5Se8 and 50% Fe&#8208;intercalated monoclinic Fe3Se4), via a robust chemical vapor deposition strategy is presented. Intriguingly, it has been revealed that the 2D Fe5Se8 exhibits intrinsic room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic property, and the ultrathin Fe3Se4 presents a novel metallic feature.








Abstract
Exploring new&#8208;type 2D magnetic materials with high magnetic transition temperature and robust air stability has attracted wide attention for developing innovative spintronic devices. Recently, intercalation of native metal atoms into the van der Waals gaps of 2D layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has been developed to form 2D non&#8208;layered magnetic TMDs, while only succeeded in limited systems (e.g., Cr2S3, Cr5Te8). Herein, composition&#8208;controllable syntheses of 2D non&#8208;layered iron selenide nanosheets (25% Fe&#8208;intercalated triclinic Fe5Se8 and 50% Fe&#8208;intercalated monoclinic Fe3Se4) are firstly reported, via a robust chemical vapor deposition strategy. Specifically, the 2D Fe5Se8 exhibits intrinsic room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic property, which is explained by the change of electron spin states from layered 1T'&#8208;FeSe2 to non&#8208;layered Fe&#8208;intercalated Fe5Se8 based on density functional theory calculations. In contrast, the ultrathin Fe3Se4 presents novel metallic features comparable with that of metallic TMDs. This work hereby sheds light on the composition&#8208;controllable synthesis and fundamental property exploration of 2D self&#8208;intercalation induced novel TMDs compounds, by propelling their application explorations in nanoelectronics and spintronics&#8208;related fields.

         <title>Colloidal Quantum Dot Infrared Lasers Featuring Sub&#8208;Single&#8208;Exciton Threshold and Very High Gain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heavily doped PbS/PbSSe core/alloyed&#8208;shell colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) lead to short&#8208;wave infrared lasers with sub&#8208;single&#8208;exciton pump threshold. These CQDs exhibit strong suppression of Auger recombination thanks to their compositional grading at the core/shell interface. Besides, they offer record high modal gain coefficient as well as long optical gain lifetime.








Abstract
The use of colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) as a gain medium in infrared laser devices has been underpinned by the need for high pumping intensities, very short gain lifetimes, and low gain coefficients. Here, PbS/PbSSe core/alloyed&#8208;shell CQDs are employed as an infrared gain medium that results in highly suppressed Auger recombination with a lifetime of 485&#160;ps, lowering the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold down to 300&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2, and showing a record high net modal gain coefficient of 2180&#160;cm&#8722;1. By doping these engineered core/shell CQDs up to nearly filling the first excited state, a significant reduction of optical gain threshold is demonstrated, measured by transient absorption, to an average&#8208;exciton population&#8208;per&#8208;dot &#12296;Nth&#12297;g of 0.45&#160;due to bleaching of the ground state absorption. This in turn have led to a fivefold reduction in ASE threshold at &#12296;Nth&#12297;ASE&#160;=&#160;0.70&#160;excitons&#8208;per&#8208;dot, associated with a gain lifetime of 280&#160;ps. Finally, these heterostructured QDs are used to achieve near&#8208;infrared lasing at 1670&#160;nm at a pump fluences corresponding to sub&#8208;single&#8208;exciton&#8208;per&#8208;dot threshold (&#12296;Nth&#12297;Las&#160;=&#160;0.87). This work brings infrared CQD lasing thresholds on par to their visible counterparts, and paves the way toward solution&#8208;processed infrared laser diodes.

         <title>From Nanoscopic to Macroscopic Materials by Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Nanoparticle Aggregation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoparticle (NP) aggregation plays an increasingly important role in regulating NP assembly into microscopic superstructures, macroscopic 2D and 3D functional materials. Diverse external stimuli have been widely used to adjust the aggregation of responsive NPs, such as light, temperature, pH, electric and magnetic fields. Many unique structures based on responsive NPs have been constructed including disordered aggregates, ordered superlattices, structural droplets, colloidosomes and bulk solids. In this review, we summarize the strategies for NP aggregation by external stimuli, and their recent progress ranging from nanoscale aggregates, microscale superstructures to macroscale bulk materials along the length scales as well as their applications. This review also discusses the future opportunities and challenges for designing functional materials through NP aggregation at different length scales.

         <title>Impermeable Atomic Layer Deposition for Sputtering Buffer Layer in Efficient Semi&#8208;Transparent and Tandem Solar Cells via Activating Unreactive Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) turns out to be particularly attractive technology for the sputtering buffer layer when preparing the semi&#8208;transparent (ST) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and the tandem solar cells. ALD process turns to be island growth when the substrate is unreactive with the ALD reactants, resulting in the pin&#8208;hole layer, which causes an adverse effect on anti&#8208;sputtering. Here, p&#8211;i&#8211;n structured PSCs with ALD SnOx as sputtering buffer layer are conducted. The commonly used electron transportation layer (ETL) PCBM in the p&#8211;i&#8211;n structured PVK solar cell is an unreactive substrate that prevents the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth for the ALD SnOx. We activate PCBM layer by introducing reaction sites to form impermeable ALD layers. By introducing reaction sites/ALD SnOx as sputtering buffer layer, we succeed to fabricate ST&#8208;PSCs and perovskite/silicon (double&#8208;side polished) tandem solar cells with PCE of 20.25% and 23.31%, respectively. Besides, the unencapsulated device with reaction sites maintains more than 99% of the initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after aging over 5100 hours. This work opens a promising avenue to prepare impermeable layer for stable PSCs, ST&#8208;PSCs, tandem solar cells and the related scale&#8208;up solar cells.

         <title>In situ Confinement of Ultrasmall Metal Nanoparticles in Short Mesochannels for Durable Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction with High Efficiency and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction is a sustainable approach for NO3&#8722; removal and high&#8208;value N&#8208;containing compounds manufacturing, however, which is strongly obstructed by sluggish kinetics, low selectivity and poor stability. Herein, we report the in situ confinement of ultrasmall CuPd alloy nanoparticles in mesochannels of conductive core&#8208;shell structured carbon nanotubes@mesoporous carbon substrates (CNTs@mesoC@CuPd) via a simple molecule&#8208;mediated interfacial assembly method. As a catalyst for electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction, the CNTs@mesoC@CuPd shows a splendid conversion efficiency (100%), N2 selectivity (98%), cycling stability (&gt;30 days), and removal capacity as high as 30000&#160;mg N/g CuPd, which are much superior to most of the prior reports. Notably, experimental (in situ testing and isotopic labeling) and theoretical results unveil that bimetallic and monometallic catalysts for electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction exhibit exclusive selectivity for N2 and NH3, respectively. This in situ confinement strategy is universal for synthesis of stable and highly accessible metallic catalysts, which opens an appealing way to synthesize advanced catalysts with high activity, selectivity and stability.

         <title>Identification of the Origin for Reconstructed Active Sites on Oxyhydroxide for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The regulation of atomic and electronic structures of active sites plays an important role upon rational design of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts toward electrocatalytic hydrogen generation. However, the precise identification of the active sites for surface reconstruction behavior during OER remains elusive for water&#8208;alkali electrolysis. Herein, we report irreversible reconstruction behavior accompanied by copper dynamic evolution for cobalt iron layered double hydroxide (CoFe LDH) precatalyst to form CoFeCuOOH active species with high&#8208;valent Co species, identifying the origin of reconstructed active sites through operando UV&#8208;Visible (UV&#8208;Vis), in&#8208;situ Raman and X&#8208;ray absorption fine&#8208;structure (XAFS) spectroscopies. Density functional theory analysis rationalizes this typical electronic structure evolution causes the transfer of intramolecular electron to form ligand holes, promoting reconstruction of active sites. Specifically, unambiguous identification of active sites for CoFeCuOOH is explored by in&#8208;situ 18O isotope&#8208;labeling differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and supported by theoretical calculation, confirming mechanism switch to oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;site mechanism (OVSM) pathway on lattice oxygen. This work enables us to elucidate the vital role of dynamic active&#8208;site generation and representative contribution of OVSM pathway for efficient OER performance.

         <title>Full&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Luminescence of CsPbX3 Nanocrystals Triggered by Chiral Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chiral carbon dots (Ch&#8208;CDs) trigger the full&#8208;color circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of CsPbX3 nanocrystals. Ch&#8208;CDs&#8208;CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (NCs) are successfully synthesized via simple ligand&#8208;assisted coprecipitation of Ch&#8208;CDs and metal halides precursors at room temperature. Ch&#8208;CDs&#8208;CsPbBr3 retains emission characteristics of the CsPbBr3 with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, and meanwhile has special CPL, with a maximum luminescence dissymmetric factor (glum) of &#8722;3.1 &#215; 10&#8722;3, which is induced by Ch&#8208;CDs. This is the first report of chiral perovskite which was induced by other chiral nanomaterials. By anion exchange, CPL can cover almost the entire visible light band. Surprisingly, the chiral signal of Ch&#8208;CDs&#8208;CsPbBr3 NCs is in&#8208;versed under excitation state, which could be induced by the charge transfers between Ch&#8208;CDs and perovskite nanocrystals. The combination of perovskites and Ch&#8208;CDs pave away for the design of new chiral perovskite on multifunctional applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral carbon dots (Ch-CDs) trigger the full-color circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of CsPbX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals. Ch-CDs-CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals (NCs) are successfully synthesized via simple ligand-assisted coprecipitation of Ch-CDs and metal halides precursors at room temperature. Ch-CDs-CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; retains emission characteristics of the CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield, and meanwhile has special CPL, with a maximum luminescence dissymmetric factor (g&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;) of &#8722;3.1 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which is induced by Ch-CDs.

         <title>Programmable Wavefront Control in the Visible Spectrum Using Low&#8208;Loss Chalcogenide Phase&#8208;Change Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work establishes antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3) as a good low&#8208;loss high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index dielectric phase&#8208;change material to form all&#8208;dielectric metasurfaces for programmable wavefront control in the visible spectrum. The metasurfaces experimentally demonstrate reversibly reconfigurable optical responses with large spectral shift and close to 2&#960; phase modulation, along with beam steering and reconfigurable bound state in the continuum.








Abstract
All&#8208;dielectric metasurfaces provide unique solutions for advanced wavefront manipulation of light with complete control of amplitude and phase at sub&#8208;wavelength scales. One limitation, however, for most of these devices is the lack of any post&#8208;fabrication tunability of their response. To break this limit, a promising approach is employing phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs), which provide fast, low energy, and non&#8208;volatile means to endow metasurfaces with a switching mechanism. In this regard, great advancements have been done in the mid&#8208;infrared and near&#8208;infrared spectrum using different chalcogenides. In the visible spectral range, however, very few devices have demonstrated full phase manipulation, high efficiencies, and reversible optical modulation. In this work, a programmable all&#8208;dielectric Huygens&#8217; metasurface made of antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) PCM is experimentally demonstrated, a low loss and high&#8208;index material in the visible spectral range with a large contrast (&#8776;0.5) between its amorphous and crystalline states. &#8776;2&#960; phase modulation is shown with high associated transmittance and it is used to create programmable beam&#8208;steering devices. These novel chalcogenide PCM metasurfaces have the potential to emerge as a platform for next&#8208;generation spatial light modulators and to impact application areas such as programmable and adaptive flat optics, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and many more.

         <title>Emergent Magnetic States and Tunable Exchange Bias at 3d Nitride Heterointerfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystalline ferromagnetic Fe3N thin films and heterostructures with precisely controlled thickness are fabricated. A strong in&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy and reversal of anomalous Hall resistance are observed when its thickness exceeds 5 unit&#8208;cells. Furthermore, the exchange bias effect strongly depends on mechanical bending, yielding to potential innovative applications.








Abstract
Interfacial magnetism stimulates the discovery of giant magnetoresistance (MR) and spin&#8211;orbital coupling across the heterointerfaces, facilitating the intimate correlation between spin transport and complex magnetic structures. Over decades, functional heterointerfaces composed of nitrides have seldom been explored due to the difficulty in synthesizing high&#8208;quality nitride films with correct compositions. Here, the fabrication of single&#8208;crystalline ferromagnetic Fe3N thin films with precisely controlled thicknesses is reported. As film thickness decreases, the magnetization dramatically deteriorates, and the electronic state changes from metallic to insulating. Strikingly, the high&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism is maintained in a Fe3N layer with a thickness down to 2&#160;u.c. (&#8776;8&#160;&#197;). The MR exhibits a strong in&#8208;plane anisotropy; meanwhile, the anomalous Hall resistivity&#160;reverses its sign when the Fe3N layer thickness exceeds 5&#160;u.c. Furthermore, a sizable exchange bias is observed at the interfaces between a ferromagnetic Fe3N and an antiferromagnetic CrN. The exchange bias field and saturation moment strongly depend on the controllable bending curvature using the cylinder diameter engineering technique, implying the tunable magnetic states under lattice deformation. This work provides a guideline for exploring functional nitride films and applying their interfacial phenomena for innovative perspectives toward practical applications.

         <title>Braiding Lateral Morphotropic Grain Boundaries in Homogenetic Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Morphotropic grain boundaries (GBs) in laterally interconnected cobaltite homostructures are achieved. Single&#8208;crystalline substrates and suspended freestanding membranes provide independent templates for coherent epitaxy and constraints on the growth orientation and strain, resulting in seamless and atomically sharp GBs. This work provides a feasible strategy for exploring potential device applications.








Abstract
Interfaces formed by correlated oxides offer a critical avenue for discovering emergent phenomena and quantum states. However, the fabrication of oxide interfaces with variable crystallographic orientations and strain states integrated along a film plane is extremely challenging&#160;by conventional layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking or self&#8208;assembling. Here, the creation of morphotropic grain boundaries (GBs) in laterally interconnected cobaltite homostructures is reported. Single&#8208;crystalline substrates and suspended ultrathin freestanding membranes provide independent templates for coherent epitaxy and constraint on the growth orientation, resulting in seamless and atomically sharp GBs. Electronic states and magnetic behavior in hybrid structures are laterally modulated and isolated by GBs, enabling artificially engineered functionalities in the planar matrix. This work offers a simple and scalable method for fabricating unprecedented innovative interfaces through controlled synthesis routes as well as providing a platform for exploring potential applications in neuromorphics, solid&#8208;state batteries, and catalysis.

         <title>Amorphous Carbon Films for Electronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces various synthetic approaches and physical properties of amorphous carbon (a&#8208;C) thin films and discusses the potential applications including hardmasks, EUV pellicles, diffusion barriers, deformable electrodes and interconnections, sensors, active layers, electrodes for energy, micro&#8208;supercapacitors, batteries, nanogenerators, EMI shielding, and nanomembranes.








Abstract
While various crystalline carbon allotropes, including graphene, have been actively investigated, amorphous carbon (a&#8208;C) thin films have received relatively little attention. The a&#8208;C is a disordered form of carbon bonding with a broad range of the C&#63743;C bond length and bond angle. Although accurate structural analysis and theoretical approaches are still insufficient, reproducible structure&#8211;property relationships have been accumulated. As the a&#8208;C thin film is now adapted as a hardmask in the semiconductor industry and new properties are reported continuously, expectations are growing that it can be practically used as active materials beyond as a simple sacrificial layer. In this perspective review article, after a brief introduction to the synthesis and properties of the a&#8208;C thin films, their potential practical applications are proposed, including hardmasks, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) pellicles, diffusion barriers, deformable electrodes and interconnects, sensors, active layers, electrodes for energy, micro&#8208;supercapacitors, batteries, nanogenerators, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, and nanomembranes. The article ends with a discussion on the technological challenges in a&#8208;C thin films.

         <title>Liquid Crystalline Systems from Nature and Interaction of Living Organisms with Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomaterials have been extensively explored to understand living organisms and obtain scientific inspiration. However, many aspects are not still fully understood. Because liquid crystalline phases are ubiquitous, therefore, a wide range of research has made attempts to approach unresolved issues with the concept of liquid crystals (LCs). This review presents these studies addressing the interactive correlation between biomaterials and LCs.








Abstract
Biomaterials, which are substances interacting with biological systems, have been extensively explored to understand living organisms and obtain scientific inspiration (such as biomimetics). However, many aspects of biomaterials have yet to be fully understood. Because liquid crystalline phases are ubiquitously found in biomaterials (e.g., cholesterol, amphiphile, DNA, cellulose, bacteria), therefore, a wide range of research has made attempts to approach unresolved issues with the concept of liquid crystals (LCs). This review presents these studies that address the interactive correlation between biomaterials and LCs. Specifically, intrinsic LC behavior of various biomaterials such as DNA, cellulose nanocrystals, and bacteriaare first introduced. Second, the dynamics of bacteria in LC media are addressed, with focus on how bacteria interact with LCs, and how dynamics of bacteria can be controlled by exploiting the characteristics of LCs. Lastly, how the strong correlation between LCs and biomaterials has been leveraged to design a new class of biosensors with additional functionalities (e.g., self&#8208;regulated drug release) that are not available in previous systems is reviewed. Examples addressed in this review convey the message that the intersection between biomaterials and LCs offers deep insights into fundamental understanding of biomaterials, and provides resources for development of transformative technologies.

Abstract
Eutectic gallium&#8211;indium (EGaIn), a liquid metal with a melting point close to or below room temperature, has attracted extensive attention in recent years due to its excellent properties such as fluidity, high conductivity, thermal conductivity, stretchability, self&#8208;healing capability, biocompatibility, and recyclability. These features of EGaIn can be adjusted by changing the experimental condition, and various composite materials with extended properties can be further obtained by mixing EGaIn with other materials. In this review, not only the are unique properties of EGaIn introduced, but also the working principles for the EGaIn&#8208;based devices are illustrated and the developments of EGaIn&#8208;related techniques are summarized. The applications of EGaIn in various fields, such as flexible electronics (sensors, antennas, electronic circuits), molecular electronics (molecular memory, opto&#8208;electronic switches, or reconfigurable junctions), energy catalysis (heat management, motors, generators, batteries), biomedical science (drug delivery, tumor therapy, bioimaging and neural interfaces) are reviewed. Finally, a critical discussion of the main challenges for the development of EGaIn&#8208;based techniques are discussed, and the potential applications in new fields are prospected.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research progress and prospects of tungsten&#8208;based nanomaterials in biomedical field are analyzed by bibliometrics. First, general bibliometric distributions of the dataset by year/country/institute/referenced source/research hotspots are recognized. Next, to provide a comprehensive review of the subjectively recognized research hotspots in biomedical fields (including biological sensing, anticancer treatments, antibacterials, and toxicity evaluation). Finally, prospects and challenges are discussed.








Abstract
Tungsten&#8208;based nanomaterials (TNMs) with diverse nanostructures and unique physicochemical properties have been widely applied in the biomedical field. Although various reviews have described the application of TNMs in specific biomedical fields, there are still no comprehensive studies that summarize and analyze research trends of the field as a whole. To identify and further promote the development of biomedical TNMs, a bibliometric analysis method is used to analyze all relevant literature on this topic. First, general bibliometric distributions of the dataset by year, country, institute, referenced source, and research hotspots are recognized. Next, a comprehensive review of the subjectively recognized research hotspots in various biomedical fields, including biological sensing, anticancer treatments, antibacterials, and toxicity evaluation, is provided. Finally, the prospects and challenges of TNMs are discussed to provide a new perspective for further promoting their development in biomedical research.

         <title>Enhanced Flexible Mold Lifetime for Roll&#8208;to&#8208;Roll Scaled&#8208;Up Manufacturing of Adhesive Complex Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step curing technique, including an incomplete curing process and a post&#8208;curing process, is presented as a strategy to enhance the flexible mold lifetime in UV&#8208;curing&#8208;based roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufacturing systems. By utilizing the technique, silicone molds patterned with complex adhesive microstructures are replicated over 1000 cycles by highly adhesive polyurethane acrylate materials.








Abstract
Various functional complex 3D patterned surfaces with micro&#8208; or nanostructures have been developed and their superior performances over non&#8208;patterned smooth surfaces proven. However, it is challenging to mass&#8208;produce such complex micro&#8208;/nanopatterned surfaces, which limits their commercialization drastically. Although roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) manufacturing using flexible molds has been implemented for mass&#8208;production of such functional surfaces, the poor mold repeatability issue has not been resolved yet. Here, a strategy to significantly improve the repeatability of the micropatterned flexible silicone molds over 1000 cycles against highly adhesive polyurethane acrylates (PUAs) in UV light curing based R2R systems by using a two&#8208;step curing process is reported. The mold repeatability is drastically increased from 10s of cycles to over 1000 cycles through the proposed strategy in spite of the complicated 3D undercut geometry and high tackiness of the microstructure. This two&#8208;step process would enable scaled&#8208;up production of micro&#8208;/nanostructured adhesives, such as gecko&#8208;inspired microfiber adhesives as demonstrated in this study, as well as various other functional micro&#8208;/nanostructured surfaces by enhancing the flexible mold lifetime.

         <title>Reversal of Anomalous Hall Effect and Octahedral Tilting in SrRuO3 Thin Films via Hydrogen Spillover</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perovskite SrRuO3 is a prototypical itinerant ferromagnet that has drawn considerable attention due to its strongly correlated physical properties. In this work, a new concept is demonstrated to induce octahedral distortions, magnetism, and reversal of the anomalous Hall effect in SrRuO3 thin films via hydrogen spillover, revealed by comprehensive in situ experiments and density functional theory calculations.








Abstract
The perovskite SrRuO3 (SRO) is a strongly correlated oxide whose physical and structural properties are strongly intertwined. Notably, SRO is an itinerant ferromagnet that exhibits a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) whose sign can be readily modified. Here, a hydrogen spillover method is used to tailor the properties of SRO thin films via hydrogen incorporation. It is found that the magnetization and Curie temperature of the films are strongly reduced and, at the same time, the structure evolves from an orthorhombic to a tetragonal phase as the hydrogen content is increased up to &#8776;0.9 H per SRO formula unit. The structural phase transition is shown, via in situ crystal truncation rod measurements, to be related to tilting of the RuO6 octahedral units. The significant changes observed in magnetization are shown, via density functional theory (DFT), to be a consequence of shifts in the Fermi level. The reported findings provide new insights into the physical properties of SRO via tailoring its lattice symmetry and emergent physical phenomena via the hydrogen spillover technique.

         <title>Stable zn anodes with triple gradients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are highly desirable for sustainable energy storage, but the undesired Zn dendrites growth severely shorts the cycle life. Herein, a triple&#8208;gradient electrode that simultaneously integrates gradient conductivity, zincophilicity and porosity is facilely constructed for dendrite&#8208;free Zn anode. The simple mechanical rolling induced triple&#8208;gradient design effectively optimizes the electric field distribution, Zn2+ ion flux and Zn deposition paths in the Zn anode, thus synergistically achieving a bottom&#8208;up deposition behavior for Zn metals and preventing the short circuit from top dendrite growth. As a result, the electrode with triple gradients delivers a low overpotential of 35&#160;mV and operates steadily over 400&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/2.5 mAh cm&#8722;2 and 250&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2, far surpassing the none&#8208;gradient, single&#8208;gradient and dual&#8208;gradient counterparts. The well&#8208;tunable materials and structures with the facile fabrication method of the triple&#8208;gradient strategy would bring inspiration for high performance energy storage devices.

The simple mechanical rolling induced triple-gradient design effectively optimizes the electric field distribution, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion flux and Zn deposition paths in the Zn anode, thus synergistically achieving a bottom-up deposition behavior for Zn metals and preventing the short circuit from top dendrite growth. As a result, the electrode with triple gradients delivers a low overpotential of 35&#160;mV and operates steadily over 400&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2.5 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 250&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;/1 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, far surpassing the none-gradient, single-gradient and dual-gradient counterparts. The well-tunable materials and structures with the facile fabrication method of the triple-gradient strategy would bring inspiration for high performance energy storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Embedded 3D printing of multimaterial polymer lattices via graph&#8208;based print path planning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recent advances in computational design and 3D printing enable fabrication of polymer lattices with high strength&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio and tailored mechanics. To date, 3D lattices composed of monolithic materials have primarily been constructed due to limitations associated with most commercial 3D printing platforms. Here, we demonstrate freeform fabrication of multi&#8208;material polymer lattices via embedded three&#8208;dimensional (EMB3D) printing. We first developed an algorithm that generates print paths for each target lattice based on graph theory. We then investigated the effects of ink rheology on filamentary printing and effects of the print path on resultant mechanical properties. By co&#8208;printing multiple materials with different mechanical properties, a broad range of periodic and stochastic lattices with tailored mechanical responses can be realized opening new avenues for constructing architected matter.

         <title>Planar Optical Cavities Hybridized with Low&#8208;Dimensional Light&#8208;Emitting Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;dimensional light&#8208;emitting materials have presented peculiar optical and optoelectronic properties, unlike their bulk form. The light&#8211;matter interaction of these emitters can be engineered by integrating with various planar optical cavities, which is a planar nano&#8208; and microstructure that tightly confines light. These integrations provide opportunities for realizing nanophotonic devices based on the new physics allowed by low&#8208;dimensional emitters.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional light&#8208;emitting materials have been actively investigated due to their unprecedented optical and optoelectronic properties that are not observed in their bulk forms. However, the emission from low&#8208;dimensional light&#8208;emitting materials is generally weak and difficult to use in nanophotonic devices without being amplified and engineered by optical cavities. Along with studies on various planar optical cavities over the last decade, the physics of cavity&#8211;emitter interactions as well as various integration methods are investigated deeply. These integrations not only enhance the light&#8211;matter interaction of the emitters, but also provide opportunities for realizing nanophotonic devices based on the new physics allowed by low&#8208;dimensional emitters. In this review, the fundamentals, strengths and weaknesses of various planar optical resonators are first provided. Then, commonly used low&#8208;dimensional light&#8208;emitting materials such as 0D emitters (quantum dots and upconversion nanoparticles) and 2D emitters (transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenide and hexagonal boron nitride) are discussed. The integration of these emitters and cavities and the expect interplay between them are explained in the following chapters. Finally, a comprehensive discussion and outlook of nanoscale cavity&#8208;emitter integrated systems is provided.

         <title>Chiral Rashba Ferroelectrics for Circularly Polarized Light Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of 2D chiral perovskite Rashba ferroelectric semiconductors is reported. The fabricated single&#8208;crystal device responds to circularly polarized light (CPL) under 430&#160;nm with an anisotropy factor of 0.20 for the left&#8208; and right&#8208;CPL differentiation, about two times of reported pure chiral counterparts. The enhanced performance is ascribed to the Rashba&#8211;Dresselhaus effect with a large Rashba coefficient of 0.93&#160;eV&#160;&#197;.








Abstract
Direct detection of circularly polarized light (CPL) is a challenging task due to limited materials and ambiguous structure&#8211;property relationships that lead to low distinguishability of the light helicities. Perovskite ferroelectric semiconductors incorporating chirality provide new opportunities in dealing with this issue. Herein, a pair of 2D chiral perovskite ferroelectrics is reported, which have&#160;enhanced CPL detection performance due to interplays among lattice, photon, charge, spin, and orbit. The chirality&#8208;transfer&#8208;induced chiral&amp;polar ferroelectric phase enhances the asymmetric nature of the photoactive sublattice and achieves a switchable self&#8208;powered detection via the bulk photovoltaic effect. The single&#8208;crystal&#8208;based device exhibits a CPL&#8208;sensitive detection performance under 430&#160;nm with an asymmetric factor of 0.20 for left&#8208; and right&#8208;CPL differentiation, about two times that of the pure chiral counterparts. The enhanced CPL detection performance is ascribed to the Rashba&#8211;Dresselhaus effect that originates from the bulk inversion asymmetry and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, shown with a large Rashba coefficient, which is demonstrated by density functional theory calculation and circularly polarized light excited photoluminescence measurement. These results provide new perspectives on chiral Rashba ferroelectric semiconductors for direct CPL detection and ferroelectrics&#8208;based chiroptics and spintronics.

         <title>Dimensional Control of Highly Anisotropic and Transparent Conductive Coordination Polymers for Solution&#8208;Processable Large&#8208;Scale 2D Sheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The material dimension of copper&#8208;halide coordination polymers can be controlled for 1D, 2D, and 3D via solution&#8208;based strategies. The coordination polymer exhibits a highly anisotropic electronic conductivity of up to &#8776;1000 differences through polaron&#8208;mediated electron transfer. The dimensional control and intrinsic anisotropy add a new degree of freedom to the excitation, detection, and control of electrons and photons.








Abstract
Controlling the dimensional aspect of conductive coordination polymers is currently a key scientific interest. Herein, solution&#8208;based dimension control strategies are proposed for copper chloride thiourea (CuCl&#8208;TU) coordination polymers that enable centimeter&#8208;scale, 2D nanosheet formation for use as transparent electrodes. Despite the wide bandgap of CuCl&#8208;TU polymers (4.33&#160;eV), through polaron&#8208;mediated electron transfer, the electrical conductivity of the 2D sheet at room temperature is able to reach 4.45 S cm&#8722;1 without intentional doping. This leads to a highly anisotropic electronic conductivity of up to the order of &#8776;103 differences, depending on the material orientation. Furthermore, by substituting alternative thiourea candidates, it is demonstrated that it is possible to predesign CuCl&#8208;TU&#160;structures with the desired functionality, stability, and porosity through dimensional control. These findings provide a blueprint to design next&#8208;generation transparent conducting materials that can operate at room temperature, thereby expanding their applicability to different fields.

         <title>Ultrathin Hydrogel Films toward Breathable Skin&#8208;Integrated Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin hydrogel films are fabricated by a facile cold&#8208;lamination method and demonstrated as the skin&#8211;electronics interface. The hydrogels comply with glyphic lines and subtle minutiae on the skin surface, allowing unimpeded transepidermal water loss and breathing of the skin underneath. Multitype organic thin&#8208;film (opto)electronics can attach to the skin interfaced with the ultrathin hydrogel, realizing seamless integration and long&#8208;term applications.








Abstract
On&#8208;skin electronics that offer revolutionary capabilities in personalized diagnosis, therapeutics, and human&#8211;machine interfaces require seamless integration between the skin and electronics. A common question remains whether an ideal interface can be introduced to directly bridge thin&#8208;film electronics with the soft skin, allowing the skin to breathe freely and the skin&#8208;integrated electronics to function stably. Here, an ever&#8208;thinnest hydrogel is reported that is compliant to the glyphic lines and subtle minutiae on the skin without forming air gaps, produced by a facile cold&#8208;lamination method. The hydrogels exhibit high water&#8208;vapor permeability, allowing nearly unimpeded transepidermal water loss and free breathing of the skin underneath. Hydrogel&#8208;interfaced flexible (opto)electronics without causing skin irritation or accelerated device performance deterioration are demonstrated. The long&#8208;term applicability is recorded for over one week. With combined features of extreme mechanical compliance, high permeability, and biocompatibility, the ultrathin hydrogel interface promotes the general applicability of skin&#8208;integrated electronics.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Aerogels: A New Platform for Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique high&#8208;entropy alloy aerogels (HEAAs) with strong metal interactions and abundant unsaturated sites are constructed. Particularly, PdCuAuAgBiIn HEAAs achieve almost 100% of Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C1 products from &#8722;0.7 to &#8722;1.1&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a maximum FE for formic acid of 98.1% at &#8722;1.1&#160;VRHE, showing a new class of electrocatalysts for CO2 electroreduction with potential practical applications.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloy aerogels (HEAAs) combined with the advantages of high&#8208;entropy alloys and aerogels are prospective new platforms in catalytic reactions. However, due to the differences in reduction potentials and miscibility behavior of different metals, the realization of HEAAs with a single phase is still a great challenge. Herein, a series of HEAAs is fabricated via the freeze&#8211;thaw method as highly active and durable electrocatalysts for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). Especially, the PdCuAuAgBiIn HEAAs can achieve Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C1 products almost 100% from &#8722;0.7 to &#8722;1.1&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE), and a maximum FE for formic acid (FEHCOOH) of 98.1% at &#8722;1.1&#160;VRHE, outperforming PdCuAuAgBiIn high&#8208;entropy alloy particles (HEAPs) and Pd metallic aerogels (MAs). Specifically, the current density and FEHCOOH are almost 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 87% in a flow cell. The impressive CO2RR performance of the PdCuAuAgBiIn HEAAs is attributed to the strong interactions between the different metals and the surface unsaturated sites, which can regulate the electronic structures of different metals and allow the optimal HCOO* intermediate adsorption and desorption onto the catalysts surface to enhance HCOOH production. The work not only provides a facile synthetic strategy to fabricate HEAAs, but also opens the avenue for development of efficient catalysts and beyond.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Synthetic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Efficient Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are a rising class of promising proton&#8208;conducting materials. However, they always suffer from the inherent contradiction between chemical stability and proton conduction. Herein, inspired by the self&#8208;assembly of lipid bilayer membranes, we successfully develop a series of aminomethylphosphonic acid&#8208;derived single&#8208;component HOFs with different substituents attached to the phosphonate oxygen group. They remain highly stable in strong acid or alkaline water solutions for one month owing to the presence of charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds. Interestingly, in the absence of external proton carriers, the methyl&#8208;substituted phosphonate&#8208;based HOF exhibits a very high proton conductivity of up to 4.2&#215;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 under 80&#176;C and 98% relative humidity (RH). This value is not only comparable to that of HOFs consisting of mixed ligands but also is the highest reported in single&#8208;component HOFs. A combination of single&#8208;crystal structure analysis and density functional theory calculations (DFT) reveals that the high conductivity is attributed to the strengthened H&#8208;bonding interactions between positively charged amines and negatively charged phosphonate groups in the channel of bio&#8208;inspired HOFs. This finding demonstrates that the well&#8208;defined molecular structure of proton conductors is of great importance in the precise understanding of the relationship between structure and property.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;fast non&#8208;equilibrium synthesis of cathode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Synthesis of cathode materials plays an important role in determining the production efficiency, cost and performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the conventional synthesis methods always experience a slow heating rate and involve a complicated multi&#8208;step reaction process and sluggish reaction dynamics, leading to high energy and long time consuming. Herein, we report a high&#8208;temperature shock (HTS) strategy for the ultra&#8208;fast synthesis of cathode materials in seconds. The HTS process experiences an ultra&#8208;high heating rate, leading to a non&#8208;equilibrium reaction and fast reaction kinetics and avoiding high energy and long time consuming. Mainstream cathode materials (such as LiMn2O4, LiCoO2, LiFePO4, and Li&#8208;rich layered oxide/NiO heterostructured material) are successfully synthesized with pure phases, oxygen vacancies, ultra&#8208;small particle sizes and good electrochemical performance. The HTS process not only provides an efficient synthesis approach for cathode materials but also can be extended beyond lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Formation and Stabilization of NiOOH by Introducing &#945;&#8208;FeOOH in LDH: Composite Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution and Urea Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
NiOOH has been considered as the most active intermediate during electrochemical oxidation reaction, however, it is hard to directly synthesize due to high oxidation energy. Herein, theoretical calculations predict that &#945;&#8208;FeOOH enables a decline in formation energy and an improvement in stabilization of NiOOH in NiFe&#8208;based layered double hydroxide (LDH). Inspiringly, a composite composed of &#945;&#8208;FeOOH and LDH is well&#8208;designed and successfully fabricated in hydrothermal treatment by adding extra Fe3+ resource, and stable NiOOH is obtained by the following electro&#8208;oxidation method. Benefiting from strong electron&#8208;capturing capability of &#945;&#8208;FeOOH, it efficiently promotes charge redistribution around the Ni/Fe sites and activates Ni atoms of LDH, verified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and X&#8208;ray absorption spectra (XAS). The d&#8208;band center is optimized that balances the absorption and desorption energy, and thus Gibbs free energy barrier is lowered dramatically toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR), and finally showing an outstanding overpotential of 195&#160;mV and a potential of 1.35&#160;V at 10&#160;mA/cm2, respectively. This study provides a novel strategy to construct highly efficient catalysts via the introduction of a new phase for complex multiple&#8208;electron reactions.

         <title>Rational Design of all&#8208;inorganic Assemblies with Bright Circularly Polarized luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Materials with exceptional circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) are important in multi&#8208;field applications such as three&#8208;dimensional display, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensing, spin electronics, etc. Although CPL properties have been widely investigated ranging from the traditional chiral organic molecules to the emerging chiral inorganic nanomaterials and their assemblies, a trade&#8208;off between the luminescence efficiency (quantum yield, &#981;) and the luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) is always the bottleneck for all the chiral luminescent materials, which hinders their practical application. Herein, we report a new route to overcoming the paradox through rationally assembling quantum nanorods and ultrathin inorganic nanowires into ordered multilayer structures, achieving both high &#981; and glum. In these assembled structures, the aligned quantum nanorods emit linearly polarized light that is then transformed to CPL by the aligned ultrathin nanowire assemblies with precisely controlled phase retardation. This method is universal and readily extended to versatile one&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials, paving the way for the practical applications of CPL active materials.

         <title>A Full&#8208;Device Autonomous Self&#8208;Healing Stretchable Soft Battery from Self&#8208;Bonded Eutectogels</title>

Abstract
Next&#8208;generation energy storage devices should be soft, stretchable and self&#8208;healable. Previously reported self&#8208;healable batteries mostly possess limited stretchability and rely on healable electrodes or electrolytes rather than achieving full&#8208;device self&#8208;healability. Herein, we report an all&#8208;component self&#8208;bonding strategy to obtain an all&#8208;eutectogel soft battery (AESB) that simultaneously achieves full&#8208;cell autonomous self&#8208;healability and omnidirectional intrinsic stretchability (&gt;1000% areal strain) over a broad temperature range (&#8211;20 to 60&#176;C). Without requiring any external stimulus, the five&#8208;layered soft battery can efficiently recover both its mechanical and electrochemical performance at full&#8208;cell level. The developed AESB can be easily configured into various three&#8208;dimensional architectures with highly interfacial compatible eutectogel electrodes, electrolyte and substrate, presenting an excellent opportunity for the development of embodied energy technologies. The present work provides a general and user&#8208;friendly soft electronic material platform for fabricating a variety of intrinsic self&#8208;healing stretchable multi&#8208;layered electronics, which are promising beyond the field of energy storage, such as displays, sensors, circuits and soft robots.

         <title>Piezoelectric 1T Phase MoSe2 Nanoflowers and Crystallographically Textured Electrodes for Enhanced Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc&#8208;Ion Storage</title>

Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are regarded as promising cathode materials for zinc&#8208;ion storage owing to their large interlayer spacings. However, their capabilities are still limited by sluggish kinetics and inferior conductivities. In this study, a facile one&#8208;pot solvothermal method is exploited to vertically plant piezoelectric 1T MoSe2 nanoflowers on carbon cloth (CC) to fabricate crystallographically textured electrodes. The self&#8208;built&#8208;in electric field owing to the intrinsic piezoelectricity during the intercalation/deintercalation processes could serve as an additional piezo&#8208;electrochemical coupling accelerator to enhance the migration of Zn2+. Moreover, the expanded interlayer distance (9&#8211;10 &#197;), overall high hydrophilicity and conductivity of the 1T phase MoSe2 also promoted the kinetics. These advantages endow the tailored 1T MoSe2/CC nanopiezocomposite with feasible Zn2+ diffusion and desirable electrochemical performances at room and low temperatures. Moreover, 1T MoSe2/CC&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;ion batteries were constructed to evaluate the potential of the proposed material in low&#8208;temperature flexible energy storage devices. This work expounds the positive effect of intrinsic piezoelectricity of TMDs on Zn2+ migration and further explores the availabilities of TMDs in low&#8208;temperature wearable energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>MoS2&#8208;Mediated Epitaxial Plating of Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal&#8208;based anodes (Li, Zn, etc.) are regarded as promising solutions for next&#8208;generation advanced batteries due to their high theoretical specific capacities. However, most of these metal anodes suffer from dendrite growth, which severely restricts their practical applications. Recently, epitaxial anode metal deposition by choosing a suitable substrate has received tremendous attention as an effective strategy to suppress dendrites. However, the epitaxial relationship between plated metal and the substrate has been a subject of debate. Herein, large&#8208;area, mono&#8208;orientated 2D material (MoS2) is used, for the first time, to electrodeposit truly epitaxial Zn anodes. The continuous (without edges) mono&#8208;orientated MoS2 films are shown to be an effective strategy for suppressing metal dendrites. In addition, the epitaxial nature of the electrodeposited Zn anode is proven by pole figure analysis, which provides the first demonstration of truly epitaxial Zn anode growth over large area as metal anode protection strategy through epitaxy.

         <title>BSA&#8208;AIE nanoparticles with boosted ROS generation for immunogenic cell death immunotherapy of multiple myeloma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The main obstacle of multiple myeloma (MM) therapy is the compromised immune microenvironment, which leads to MM relapses and extramedullary disease progression. In this study, we report a novel strategy of enhanced immunogenic cell death (ICD) immunotherapy with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer&#8208;loaded BSA nanoparticles (referred as BSA/TPA&#8208;Erdn), which could activate T cells, convert the cold tumor to hot, and reverse T cell senescence to restore the immune microenvironment for MM treatment. Loading AIE photosensitizer into the hydrophobic domain of BSA proteins significantly immobilizes the molecular geometry, which massively increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and elicit a promising ICD immune response. Employing a NOD&#8208;SCID IL&#8208;2receptor gamma null mice model with MM patients&#8217; monocytes, we show that BSA/TPA&#8208;Erdn could simulate human DC maturation, activate functional T lymphocytes, and increase additional polarization and differentiation signals to deliver a promising immunotherapy performance. Intriguingly, we show for the first time that BSA/TPA&#8208;Erdn could greatly reverse T cell senescence, a main challenge in treating MM. Additionally, BSA/TPA&#8208;Erdn could effectively recruit more functional T lymphocytes into MM tumor. As a consequence, BSA/TPA&#8208;Erdn restored MM immune microenvironment and shows the best MM tumor eradication performance, which shall pave new insights for MM treatment in clinical practices.

         <title>Photolithography&#8208;Based Microfabrication of Biodegradable Flexible and Stretchable Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biodegradable sensors based on integrating conductive layers with polymeric materials in flexible and stretchable forms have been established. However, the lack of a generalized microfabrication method resulted in large&#8208;sized, low spatial density, and low device yield compared to the silicon&#8208;based devices manufactured via batch&#8208;compatible microfabrication processes. Here, we present a batch fabrication&#8208;compatible photolithography&#8208;based microfabrication approach for biodegradable and highly miniaturized essential sensor components on flexible and stretchable substrates. We fabricated up to 1600 devices within a 1 cm2 footprint and then demonstrated the functionality of various biodegradable passive electrical components, mechanical sensors, and chemical sensors on flexible and stretchable substrates. The results were highly repeatable and consistent, proving the proposed method's high device yield and high&#8208;density potential. This simple, innovative, and robust fabrication recipe allows complete freedom over the applicability of various biodegradable materials with different properties toward the unique application of interests. Our process offers a route to utilize standard micro&#8208;fabrication procedures toward scalable fabrication of highly miniaturized flexible and stretchable transient sensors and electronics.

         <title>Pushing the Limit of Open&#8208;circuit Voltage Deficit Via modifying Buried Interface in CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Although CsPbI3 perovskites have shown tremendous potential in the photovoltaic field owing to their excellent thermal stability, the device performance is seriously restricted by severe photovoltage loss. The buried titanium oxide/perovskite interface plays a critical role in interfacial charge transport and perovskite crystallization, which is closely related to open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit stemming from nonradiative recombination. Herein, we deliberately employ target molecules named 3&#8208;sulphonatopropyl acrylate potassium salts with special functional groups for modifying buried interface, giving rise to favorable functions in terms of passivating interfacial defects, optimizing energetic alignment, and facilitating perovskite crystallization. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the buried interface modification inhibits the electron transfer barrier and simultaneously improves perovskite crystal quality, thereby reducing trap&#8208;assisted charge recombination and interfacial energetic loss. Consequently, the omnibearing modification regarding the buried interface endows the devices with an impressive efficiency of 20.98%, achieving a record&#8208;low VOC deficit of 0.451&#160;V. The as&#8208;proposed buried interface modification strategy renders with a universal prescription to push the limit of VOC deficit, showing a promising future in developing high&#8208;performance all&#8208;inorganic perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Radiative recombination processes in halide perovskites observed by light emission voltage modulated spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The kinetics of light emission in halide perovskite LEDs and solar cells is composed of a radiative recombination of voltage&#8208;injected carriers mediated by additional steps such as carrier trapping, redistribution of injected carriers, and photon recycling that affect the observed luminescence decays. We investigate these processes in high performance halide perovskite LEDs, with external quantum efficiency (EQE) and luminance values higher than 20% and 80000 Cd&#183;m&#8722;2, by measuring the frequency&#8208;resolved emitted light with respect to modulated voltage, through a new methodology termed light emission voltage modulated spectroscopy (LEVS). We show that the spectra provide detailed information on at least three different characteristic times. Essentially, new information is obtained with respect to the electrical method of impedance spectroscopy (IS), and overall, LEVS shows promise to capture internal kinetics that are difficult to be discerned by other techniques.

         <title>Dynamic Surface Evolution of Metal Oxides for Autonomous Adaptation to Catalytic Reaction Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic self&#8208;reorganization of as&#8208;prepared materials during catalytic reactions brings about novel catalytic properties. Here, a thorough overview of how the surfaces of metal oxides are reorganized in nanoscale under diverse (electro)chemical reaction conditions is presented. Also, how the surface changes influence catalytic functionality is discussed from experimental and theoretical standpoints, presenting valuable design guidelines for future energy materials.








Abstract
Metal oxides possessing distinctive physical/chemical properties due to different crystal structures and stoichiometries play a pivotal role in numerous current technologies, especially heterogeneous catalysis for production/conversion of high&#8208;valued chemicals and energy. To date, many researchers have investigated the effect of the structure and composition of these materials on their reactivity to various chemical and electrochemical reactions. However, metal oxide surfaces evolve from their initial form under dynamic reaction conditions due to the autonomous behaviors of the constituent atoms to adapt to the surrounding environment. Such nanoscale surface phenomena complicate reaction mechanisms and material properties, interrupting the clarification of the origin of functionality variations in reaction environments. In this review, the current findings on the spontaneous surface reorganization of metal oxides during reactions are categorized into three types: 1) the appearance of nano&#8208;sized second phase from oxides, 2) the (partial) encapsulation of oxide atoms toward supported metal surfaces, and 3) the oxide surface reconstruction with selective cation leaching in aqueous solution. Then their effects on each reaction are summarized in terms of activity and stability, providing novel insight for those who design metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;based catalytic materials.

         <title>Merging the Interfaces of Different Shape&#8208;Shifting Polymers Using Hybrid Exchange Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid exchange reactions (among ester, urethane, thiourethane, boronic&#8211;ester, and oxime&#8211;ester linkages) enable stable seamless bonding of covalently cross&#8208;linked networks made by different chemistry, as well as to produce new materials by cross&#8208;fusion. Distinctive multimaterial 3D shape&#8208;shifting structures are demonstrated since this strategy facilitates flexible design in morphology and integration of diverse properties in a monolithic recyclable and potentially healable system.








Abstract
Sophisticated shape&#8208;shifting structures and integration of advanced functions often call for different&#8208;chemistry&#8208;based polymers (such as epoxy and polyurethane) in a unified system. However, permanent cross&#8208;links pose crucial obstacles to be seamless. Here, merging interfaces via hybrid exchange reactions among different dynamic covalent bonds (including ester, urethane, thiourethane, boronic&#8211;ester, and oxime&#8211;ester linkages) is proposed, breaking the long&#8208;lasting restriction that these widely used bonds only undergo self&#8208;exchange reactions. Model compound studies are conducted to verify that hybrid exchange reactions occur. As demonstrations, different liquid crystal elastomers are tenaciously joined into coherent assemblies, with the desired biomimetic structures (e.g., flying fish containing stiff and flexible parts) and rare deformation modes (e.g., flower blooming upon both heating and cooling). Besides connecting polymers, hybrid exchange reactions also facilitate the creation of new materials through cross&#8208;fusion of different polymers. In addition to the polymers used in this work, hybrid exchange reactions can be adapted to other polymers based on similar mechanisms and beyond. Besides shape&#8208;shifting&#8208;related areas (e.g., soft robots, flexible electronics, and biomedical devices), it may also foster innovation in other fields involving general polymers, as well as promote deeper understanding of dynamic covalent chemistry.

         <title>Synergistic Reinforcing of Immunogenic Cell Death and Transforming Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages Via a Multifunctional Cascade Bioreactor for Optimizing Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CaO2@CuS&#8211;MnO2@HA (CCMH) nanocomposite is developed to achieve the two&#8208;way enhancement of Ca2+ overload and photodynamic therapy related immunogenic cell death, by disrupting the mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering capacity and allaying hypoxia. Moreover, the subsequently escaped oxidatively damaged mitochondrial DNA is able to activate M1 polarization of tumor associated macrophages. Combining CCMH with aPD&#8208;L1 significantly improves immunotherapy efficacy.








Abstract
Immunogenic cell death (ICD) has aroused widespread attention because it can reconstruct a tumor microenvironment and activate antitumor immunity. This study proposes a two&#8208;way enhancement of ICD based on a CaO2@CuS&#8211;MnO2@HA (CCMH) nanocomposite to overcome the insufficient damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) of conventional ICD&#8208;inducers. The near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation (1064&#160;nm) of CuS nanoparticles generates 1O2 through photodynamic therapy (PDT) to trigger ICD, and it also damages the Ca2+ buffer function of mitochondria. Additionally, CaO2 nanoparticles react with H2O to produce a large amount of O2 and Ca2+, which respectively lead to enhanced PDT and Ca2+ overload during mitochondrial damage, thereby triggering a robust ICD activation. Moreover, oxidative&#8208;damaged mitochondrial DNA, induced by PDT and released from tumor cells, reprograms the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by transforming tumor&#8208;associated macrophages to the M1 subphenotype. This study shows that CCMH with NIR&#8208;II irradiation can elicit adequate DAMPs and an active tumor&#8208;immune microenvironment for both 4T1 and CT26 tumor models. Combining this method with an immune checkpoint blockade can realize an improved immunotherapy efficacy and long&#8208;term protection effect for body.

         <title>Porous Covalent Organic Polymer Coordinated Single Co Site Nanofibers for Efficient Oxygen&#8208;Reduction Cathodes in Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid processable COP&#8208;based material is directly used in fuel cell devices via a pyrolysis&#8208;free strategy. The nanofibers can be facilely organized into a free&#8208;standing large&#8208;area film with a hierarchical porous texture and the full dispersion of the atomic Co active sites. Resultingly, both the power density and durability are significantly improved compared with the traditional conventional spraying methods.








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;cobalt&#8208;atom electrocatalysts, particularly ones derived from high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis of cobalt&#8208;based zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), have emerged as a new frontier in the design of oxygen reduction cathodes in polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) due to their enhanced durability and smaller Fenton effects related to the degradation of membranes and ionomers compared with emphasized iron&#8208;based electrocatalysts. However, pyrolysis techniques lead to obscure active&#8208;site configurations, undesirably defined porosity and morphology, and fewer exposed active sites. Herein, a highly stable cross&#8208;linked nanofiber electrode is directly prepared by electrospinning using a liquid processability cobalt&#8208;based covalent organic polymer (Co&#8208;COP) obtained via pyrolysis&#8208;free strategy. The resultant fibers can be facilely organized into a free&#8208;standing large&#8208;area film with a uniform hierarchical porous texture and a full dispersion of atomic Co active sites on the catalyst surface. Focused ion beam&#8208;field emission scanning electron microscopy and computational fluid dynamics experiments confirm that the relative diffusion coefficient is enhanced by 3.5 times, which can provide an efficient route both for reactants to enter the active sites, and drain away the produced water efficiently. Resultingly, the peak power density of the integrated Co&#8208;COP nanofiber electrode is remarkably enhanced by 1.72 times along with significantly higher durability compared with conventional spraying methods. Notably, this nanofabrication technique also maintains excellent scalability and uniformity.

         <title>Tailoring Poly(Styrene&#8208;co&#8208;maleic anhydride) Networks for All&#8208;Polymer Dielectrics Exhibiting Ultrahigh Energy Density and Charge&#8211;Discharge Efficiency at Elevated Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrahigh discharged energy densities at elevated temperatures are achieved in all&#8208;organic crosslinked polymer dielectrics by tailoring polymer networks at the molecular level. This work provides new insights into the polymer structures that control electrical conduction at high&#8208;temperatures and high&#8208;fields, which will propel the development of scalable capacitive dielectrics for harsh&#8208;environment applications.








Abstract
Polymer film capacitors have been widely used in electronics and electrical power systems due to their advantages of high power densities, fast charge&#8211;discharge speed, and great stability. However, the exponential increase of electrical conduction with temperature and applied electric field substantially degrades the capacitive performance of dielectric polymers at elevated temperatures. Here, the first example of controlling the energy level of charge traps in all&#8208;organic crosslinked polymers by tailoring molecular structures that significantly inhibit high&#8208;field high&#8208;temperature conduction loss, which largely differs from current approaches based on the introduction of inorganic fillers, is reported. The polymer network with optimized crosslinking structures exhibits an ultrahigh discharged energy density of 7.02&#8201;J&#8201;cm&#8722;3 with charge/discharge efficiencies of &gt;90% at 150&#160;&#176;C, far outperforming current dielectric polymers and composites. The charge&#8208;trapping effects in different crosslinked structures, as the origins of the marked improvements in the high&#8208;temperature capacitive performance, are comprehensively investigated experimentally and confirmed computationally. Moreover, excellent cyclability and self&#8208;healing features are demonstrated in the polymer film capacitors. This work offers a promising pathway of molecular structure design to scalable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density polymer dielectrics capable of operating under harsh environments.

         <title>Enhancing Electron Correlation at a 3D Ferromagnetic Surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Does adatom adsorption on the surface of a 3D ferromagnet influence electron correlation? A far from trivial question! Using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art theoretical and experimental methods, it is found that an iron surface in contact with oxygen represents a moderately correlated system with some features in between metallic Fe and the Mott insulator FeO.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;resolved momentum microscopy and theoretical calculations are combined beyond the one&#8208;electron approximation to unveil the spin&#8208;dependent electronic structure of the interface formed between iron (Fe) and an ordered oxygen (O) atomic layer, and an adsorbate&#8208;induced enhancement of electronic correlations is found. It is demonstrated that this enhancement is responsible for a drastic narrowing of the Fe d&#8208;bands close to the Fermi energy (EF) and a reduction of the exchange splitting, which is not accounted for in the Stoner picture of ferromagnetism. In addition, correlation leads to a significant spin&#8208;dependent broadening of the electronic bands at higher binding energies and their merging with satellite features, which are manifestations of a pure many&#8208;electron behavior. Overall, adatom adsorption can be used to vary the material parameters of transition metal surfaces to access different intermediate electronic correlated regimes, which will otherwise not be accessible. The results show that the concepts developed to understand the physics and chemistry of adsorbate&#8211;metal interfaces, relevant for a variety of research areas, from spintronics to catalysis, need to be reconsidered with many&#8208;particle effects being of utmost importance. These may affect chemisorption energy, spin transport, magnetic order, and even play a key role in the emergence of ferromagnetism at interfaces between non&#8208;magnetic systems.

         <title>N &#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl) Acetamide Additive Enables Phase&#8208;Pure and Stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 for Efficient Self&#8208;Powered Photodetectors</title>

         <dc:description>
A facile strategy to obtain phase&#8208;pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films by introducing N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl) acetamide into perovskite precursors is reported. The additive reduces the potential barrier in the phase transition process, passivates the defects of the film, and leads to a high&#8208;quality and phase&#8208;pure&#160;&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite. The resultant self&#8208;powered photodetector based on the as&#8208;fabricated FAPbI3 film exhibits superior performance.








Abstract
Formamidinium&#8211;lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite is considered as one of the most promising perovskite materials for high&#8208;performance photodetectors because of its narrow bandgap and superior thermal stability. Nevertheless, to realize efficient carrier transport and highly performing photodetectors, it imposes the requirement of fabricating &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 with pure phase, preferred crystal orientation, large grain size, and passivated interface, which still remains challenging. Here, a facile strategy based on additive engineering to obtain pure&#8208;phase FAPbI3 perovskite films by introducing N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl) acetamide into perovskite precursors is reported. The formation of chemical bond and hydrogen bond between N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl) acetamide and perovskite reduces the potential barrier in the phase&#8208;transition process from an intermediate yellow phase to a final black phase, passivates the defects of the film, and leads to a high&#8208;quality and phase&#8208;pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite. A self&#8208;powered photodetector based on the as&#8208;fabricated FAPbI3 film exhibits a maximum responsivity of 0.48 A W&#8722;1 at 700&#160;nm with a peak external quantum efficiency&#160;of 95% at 440&#160;nm. Moreover, the optimized device remains 83% of the initial performance after 576&#160;h storage at ambient condition. This work provides a simple and feasible scheme for the preparation of high&#8208;quality phase&#8208;pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite and associated devices.

         <title>Ultrastable Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Fuel Cell Electrocatalysts by Eliminating Non&#8208;Coordinating Nitrogen and Regulating Coordination Structures at High Temperatures</title>

Abstract
Pyrolyzed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C materials have attracted considerable interests as one of the most active noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Despite significant progress has been made in improving their catalytic activity during past decades, the Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts still suffer from fairly poor electrochemical and storage stability, which greatly hurdles their practical application. Here, we develop an effective strategy to greatly improve their catalytic stability in PEMFCs and storage stability by virtue of previously&#8208;unexplored high&#8208;temperature synthetic chemistry between 1100&#8211;1200&#176;C. Pyrolysis at this rarely adopted temperature range not only enables the elimination of less active nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon sites that generate detrimental peroxide byproducts but also regulates the coordination structure of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C from less stable D1 (O&#8211;FeN4C12) to a more stable D2 structure (FeN4C10). The optimized Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits excellent stability in PEMFCs (&gt; 80% performance retention after 30 hours under H2/O2 condition) and no activity loss after 35&#8208;day storage while maintaining a competitive ORR activity and PEMFC performance.

         <title>Key Factors Affecting the Stability of CsPbI3 Perovskite Quantum Dot Solar Cells: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review intensively discusses the stability issues and strategies to overcome in CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dot solar (PQD) cells. The detailed degradation mechanisms of CsPbI3 PQDs are provided from the material and device architectural viewpoints. Furthermore, related design strategies for stable CsPbI3 PQD solar cells along with possible future perspectives are proposed.








Abstract
The power conversion efficiency of CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dot (PQD) solar cells shows increase from 10.77% to 16.2% in a short period owing to advances in material and device design for solar cells. However, the device stability of CsPbI3 PQD solar cells remains poor in ambient conditions, which requires an in&#8208;depth understanding of the degradation mechanisms of CsPbI3 PQDs solar cells in terms of both inherent material properties and device characteristics. Along with this analysis, advanced strategies to overcome poor device stability must be conceived. In this review, fundamental mechanisms that cause the degradation of CsPbI3 PQD solar cells are discussed from the material property and device viewpoints.

     alt="Key Factors Affecting the Stability of CsPbI3 Perovskite Quantum Dot Solar Cells: A Comprehensive Review"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review intensively discusses the stability issues and strategies to overcome in CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite quantum dot solar (PQD) cells. The detailed degradation mechanisms of CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PQDs are provided from the material and device architectural viewpoints. Furthermore, related design strategies for stable CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PQD solar cells along with possible future perspectives are proposed.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power conversion efficiency of CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite quantum dot (PQD) solar cells shows increase from 10.77% to 16.2% in a short period owing to advances in material and device design for solar cells. However, the device stability of CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PQD solar cells remains poor in ambient conditions, which requires an in-depth understanding of the degradation mechanisms of CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PQDs solar cells in terms of both inherent material properties and device characteristics. Along with this analysis, advanced strategies to overcome poor device stability must be conceived. In this review, fundamental mechanisms that cause the degradation of CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PQD solar cells are discussed from the material property and device viewpoints. In addition, based on detailed insights into degradation mechanisms in CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PQD solar cells, various strategies are introduced to improve the stability of CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PQD solar cells. Finally, future perspectives and challenges are presented to achieve highly durable CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PQD solar cells. The investigation of the degradation mechanisms and the stability enhancement strategies can pave the way for the commercialization of CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PQD solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>New Approaches to Produce Large&#8208;Area Single Crystal Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces novel synthetic strategies to produce large&#8208;area single crystal thin films of various materials and discusses the technological challenges of dealing with the isostructured crystals (3D materials such as metals, III&#8208;V semiconductors, oxide perovskites, halide perovskites, organic semiconductors) and the anisotropic crystals (2D materials such as graphene, hBN, and metal chalcogenides).








Abstract
Wafer&#8208;scale growth of single crystal thin films of metals, semiconductors, and insulators is crucial for manufacturing high&#8208;performance electronic and optical devices, but still challenging from both scientific and industrial perspectives. Recently, unconventional advanced synthetic approaches have been attempted and have made remarkable progress in diversifying the species of producible single crystal thin films. This review introduces several new synthetic approaches to produce large&#8208;area single crystal thin films of various materials according to the concepts and principles.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Powered Dielectrophoretic Microparticle Manipulation Platform Based on a Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;powered DEP microparticle manipulation platform based on a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is proposed, which performs high&#8208;efficiency cell separation. This work provides an ideal scheme for improving the portability of microfluidic chips and is beneficial to the commercialization of lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems.








Abstract
Lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems aim to integrate laboratory operations on a miniaturized device with broad application prospects in the field of point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing. However, bulky peripheral power resources, such as high&#8208;voltage supplies, function generators, and amplifiers, hamper the commercialization of the system. In this work, a portable, self&#8208;powered microparticle manipulation platform based on triboelectrically driven dielectrophoresis (DEP) is reported. A rotary freestanding triboelectric nanogenerator (RF&#8208;TENG) and rectifier/filter circuit supply a high&#8208;voltage direct&#8208;current signal to form a non&#8208;uniform electric field within the microchannel, realizing controllable actuation of the microparticles through DEP. The operating mechanism of this platform and the control performance of the moving particles are systematically studied and analyzed. Randomly distributed particles converge in a row after passing through the serpentine channel and various particles are separated owing to the different DEP forces. Ultimately, the high&#8208;efficiency separation of live and dead yeast cells is achieved using this platform. RF&#8208;TENG as the power source for lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip exhibits better safety and portability than traditional high&#8208;voltage power sources. This study presents a promising solution for the commercialization of lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip.

         <title>Pt Single Atoms on CrN Nanoparticles Deliver Outstanding Activity and CO Tolerance in the Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts with novel and small&#8208;sized CrN nanoparticles as potential support is successfully prepared by atomic layer deposition method and exhibit superior activity and CO&#8208;tolerance toward hydrogen oxidation reaction, which is of great significance for the full utilization of low&#8208;cost H2 with impurity CO in proton exchange membrane fuel cells.








Abstract
The large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane fuel cells is currently hampered by high cost of commercial Pt catalysts and their susceptibility to poisoning by CO impurities in H2 feed. In this context, the development of CO&#8208;tolerant electrocatalysts with high Pt atom utilization efficiency for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is of critical importance. Herein, Pt single atoms are successfully immobilized on chromium nitride nanoparticles by atomic layer deposition method, denoted as Pt SACs/CrN. Electrochemical tests establish Pt SACs/CrN to be a very efficient HOR catalyst, with a mass activity that is 5.7 times higher than commercial PtRu/C. Strikingly, the excellent performance of Pt SACs/CrN is maintained after introducing 1000&#160;ppm of CO in H2 feed. The excellent CO&#8208;tolerance of Pt SACs/CrN is related to weaker CO adsorption on Pt single atoms. This work provides guidelines for the design and construction of active and CO&#8208;tolerant catalysts for HOR.

         <title>Emergent, Non&#8208;Aging, Extendable, and Rechargeable Exchange Bias in 2D Fe3GeTe2 Homostructures Induced by Moderate Pressuring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon moderate pressuring, Fe3GeTe2 as a prototypical layered magnet transits into a ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic coexisting state, and the homostructure with an atomically smooth interface exhibits unprecedented exchange bias (ExB) without gradual aging before collapsing via avalanching. The very existence of the non&#8208;aging nature further allows achieving, striking and technologically significant extendability and rechargeability of the ExB.








Abstract
As a crucial concept in magnetism and spintronics, exchange bias (ExB) measures the asymmetry in the hysteresis loop of a pinned ferromagnet (FM)/antiferromagnet (AFM) interface. Previous studies are mainly focused on FM/AFM heterostructures composed of conventional bulk materials, whose complex interfaces prohibit precise control and full understanding of the phenomenon. Here, the enabling power of 2D magnets is exploited to demonstrate the emergence, non&#8208;aging, extendability, and rechargeability of ExB in van der Waals Fe3GeTe2 homostructures, upon moderate pressuring. The emergence of the ExB is attributed to a local stress&#8208;induced FM&#8208;to&#8208;AFM transition, as validated using first&#8208;principles calculations, and confirmed in magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect and second harmonic generation measurements. It is also observed that, negligible ExB aging before the training effect suddenly takes place through avalanching, pronounced delay of the avalanche via timed pressure repetition (extendability), ExB recovery in the post&#8208;training sample upon refreshed pressuring (rechargeability), and demonstrate its versatile tunability. These striking findings offer unprecedented insights into the underlying principles of ExB and its training, with immense technological applications in sight.

         <title>Understanding of Oxygen Redox in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive understanding of oxygen redox in lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM)&#8208;based electrocatalysts and all documented and possible characterization techniques that can be used to identify the oxygen redox are reviewed. Meanwhile, the underlying science of LOM&#8208;induced surface reconstruction on metal oxides is interpreted and perspectives on the future development of LOM&#8208;based electrocatalysts are provided.








Abstract
The electron&#8208;transfer process during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) often either proceeds solely via a metal redox chemistry (adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), with metal bands around the Fermi level) or an oxygen redox chemistry (lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), with oxygen bands around the Fermi level). Unlike the AEM, the LOM involves oxygen redox chemistry instead of metal redox, which leads to the formation of a direct oxygen&#8211;oxygen (O&#63743;O) bond. As a result, such a process is able to bypass the rate&#8208;determining step, that is, O&#63743;O bonding, in AEM, which highlights the critical advantage of LOM as compared to the conventional AEM. Thus, it has been well reported that LOM&#8208;based catalysts are able to demonstrate higher OER activities as compared to AEM&#8208;based catalysts. Here, a comprehensive understanding of the oxygen redox in LOM and all documented and possible characterization techniques that can be used to identify the oxygen redox are reviewed. This review will interpret the origins of oxygen redox in the reported LOM&#8208;based electrocatalysts and the underlying science of LOM&#8208;induced surface reconstruction in transition metal oxides. Finally, perspectives on the future development of LOM electrocatalysts are also provided.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electron-transfer process during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) often either proceeds solely via a metal redox chemistry (adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), with metal bands around the Fermi level) or an oxygen redox chemistry (lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), with oxygen bands around the Fermi level). Unlike the AEM, the LOM involves oxygen redox chemistry instead of metal redox, which leads to the formation of a direct oxygen&#8211;oxygen (O&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O) bond. As a result, such a process is able to bypass the rate-determining step, that is, O&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O bonding, in AEM, which highlights the critical advantage of LOM as compared to the conventional AEM. Thus, it has been well reported that LOM-based catalysts are able to demonstrate higher OER activities as compared to AEM-based catalysts. Here, a comprehensive understanding of the oxygen redox in LOM and all documented and possible characterization techniques that can be used to identify the oxygen redox are reviewed. This review will interpret the origins of oxygen redox in the reported LOM-based electrocatalysts and the underlying science of LOM-induced surface reconstruction in transition metal oxides. Finally, perspectives on the future development of LOM electrocatalysts are also provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanoscale TEM Imaging of Hydrogel Network Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct observation of the nanoscale polymer network of hydrogels is essential in understanding its properties. Herein, for the first time, a novel staining and structure fixation method is developed for transmission electron microscopy&#160;observation to visualize the hydrogel network architecture in its unperturbed conformation. The revealed molecular structures provide important insights for the friction, adhesion, and fracture of hydrogels.








Abstract
In this work, the authors succeed in direct visualization of the network structure of synthetic hydrogels with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) by developing a novel staining and network fixation method. Such a direct visualization is not carried out because sample preparation and obtaining sufficient contrast are challenging for these soft materials. TEM images reveal robust heterogeneous network architectures at mesh size scale and defects at micro&#8208;scale. TEM images also reveal the presence of abundant dangling chains on the surface of the hydrogel network. The real space structural information provides a comprehensive perspective that links bulk properties with a nanoscale network structure, including fracture, adhesion, sliding friction, and lubrication. The presented method has the potential to advance the field.

         <title>Core&#8211;Shell Engineering of Conductive Fillers toward Enhanced Dielectric Properties: A Universal Polarization Mechanism in Polymer Conductor Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polarization mechanism based on electron displacement across a filler&#8208;cluster is developed, which can quantitatively explain dielectric behaviors of percolative polymer composites. With the guidance, a novel design principle, via the manipulation of filler structure and composite morphology, to achieve desirable dielectric properties is demonstrated. The composite design is fundamentally different from traditional approaches based on filler&#8211;polymer interfaces.








Abstract
Flexible dielectric and electronic materials with high dielectric constant (k) and low loss are constantly pursued. Encapsulation of conductive fillers with insulating shells represents a promising approach, and has attracted substantial research efforts. However, progress is greatly impeded due to the lack of a fundamental understanding of the polarization mechanism. In this work, a series of core&#8211;shell polymer composites is studied, and the correlation between macroscopic dielectric properties (across entire composites) and microscopic polarization (around single fillers) is investigated. It is revealed that the polarization in polymer conductor composites is determined by electron transport across multiple neighboring conductive fillers&#8212;a domain&#8208;type polarization. The formation of a core&#8211;shell filler structure affects the dielectric properties of tpolymer composites by essentially modifying the filler&#8208;cluster size. Based on this understanding, a novel percolative composite is prepared with higher&#8208;than&#8208;normal filler concentration and optimized shell's electrical resistivity. The developed composite shows both high&#8208;k due to enlarged cluster size and low loss due to restrained charge transport simultaneously, which cannot be achieved in traditional percolative composites or via simple core&#8211;shell filler design. The revealed polarization mechanism and the optimization strategy for core&#8211;shell fillers provide critical guidance and a new paradigm, for developing advanced polymer dielectrics with promising property sets.

         <title>In Situ Nucleation&#8208;Decoupled and Site&#8208;Specific Incorporation of &#197;&#8208;Scale Pores in Graphene Via Epoxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanosized epoxy clusters form on graphene surface upon exposure to ozone near room temperature. When sufficient energy is supplied, clusters gasify forming nanopores. The energy barrier is measured for cluster formation as 0.42&#160;eV and for cluster gasification in the pore as 1.3&#160;eV. The approach allows decoupling of pore nucleation (pore density) and expansion (pore size).








Abstract
Generating pores in graphene by decoupled nucleation and expansion is desired to achieve a fine control over the porosity, and is desired to advance several applications. Herein, epoxidation is introduced, which is the formation of nanosized epoxy clusters on the graphitic lattice as nucleation sites without forming pores. In&#160;situ gasification of clusters inside a transmission electron microscope shows that pores are generated precisely at the site of the clusters by surpassing an energy barrier of 1.3&#160;eV. Binding energy predictions using ab initio calculations combined with the cluster nucleation theory reveal the structure of the epoxy clusters and indicate that the critical cluster is an epoxy dimer. Finally, it is shown that the cluster gasification can be manipulated to form &#197;&#8208;scale pores which then effectively sieve gas molecules based on their size. This decoupled cluster nucleation and pore formation will likely pave the way for an independent control of pore size and density.

         <title>An Effective Sneak&#8208;Path Solution Based on a Transient&#8208;Relaxation Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy in which&#160;the transient relaxation in a type of dynamic selector made from unipolar volatile memristors is harnessed to effectively address&#160;the sneak&#8208;path problem in memristor arrays is demonstrated.








Abstract
An efficient strategy for addressing individual devices is required to unveil the full potential of memristors for high&#8208;density memory and computing applications. Existing strategies using two&#8208;terminal selectors that are preferable for compact integration have trade&#8208;offs in reduced generality or functional window. A strategy that applies to broad memristors and maintains their full&#8208;range functional window is proposed. This strategy uses a type of unipolar switch featuring a transient relaxation or retention as the selector. The unidirectional current flow in the switch suppresses the sneak&#8208;path current, whereas the transient&#8208;relaxation window is exploited for bidirectional programming. A unipolar volatile memristor with ultralow switching voltage (e.g., &lt;100&#160;mV), constructed from a protein nanowire dielectric harvested from Geobacter sulfurreducens, is specifically employed as the example switch to highlight the advantages and scalability in the strategy for array integration.

         <title>Activating Organic Phosphorescence via Heavy Metal&#8211;&#960; Interaction Induced Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cocrystallization strategy is developed to enable efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence confined in the organic dye with a remarkable photoluminescence quantum yield of 25.1 &#177; 1%. This strategy to brighten the triplet state of organic chromophores may be quite general and open up a new avenue for designing innovative phosphorescent materials.








Abstract
Heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;containing clusters, nanocrystals, and other semiconductors can sensitize the triplet states of their surface&#8208;bonded chromophores, but the energy loss, such as nonradiative deactivation, often prevents the synergistic light emission in their solid&#8208;state coassemblies. Cocrystallization allows new combinations of molecules with complementary properties for achieving functionalities not available in single components. Here, the cocrystal formation that employs platinum(II) acetylacetonate (Pt(acac)2) as a triplet sensitizer and electron&#8208;deficient 1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalene&#160;diimides (NDIs) as organic phosphors is reported. The hybrid cocrystals exhibit room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence confined in the low&#8208;lying, long&#8208;lived triplet state of NDIs with photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (&#934;PL) exceeding 25% and a phosphorescence lifetime (&#964;Ph) of 156 &#181;s. This remarkable PL property benefits from the noncovalent electronic and spin&#8211;orbital coupling between the constituents.

         <title>A Template Editing Strategy to Create Interlayer&#8208;Confined Active Species for Efficient and Durable Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

Abstract
Substantial overpotentials and insufficient and unstable active sites of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts limit their efficiency and stability in OER&#8208;related energy conversion and storage technologies. Here, we proposed a template editing strategy to graft highly active catalytic species onto highly conductive rigid frameworks to tackle this challenge. As a successful attempt, we selectively edited two types of NiO6 units of layered Ni BDC (BDC stands for 1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylic acid) metal organic frameworks by chemical etching&#8208;assisted electroxidation to create layered &#947;&#8208;NiOOH with intercalated Ni&#8208;O species. In such an interlayer&#8208;confined intercalated architecture, the large interlayer space with high ion permeability offers an ideal reaction region to sufficiently expose the OER active sites comprising high&#8208;density intercalated Ni&#8208;O species, which also suppress the undesirable &#947; to &#946; phase transformation, thus exhibiting efficient and durable OER activity. As a result, water oxidation can occur at an extremely low overpotential of 130 mV and affords 1000 h stability at 100 mA cm&#8722;2. Our strategy conceptually shows the possibility of achieving stable homogeneous&#8208;like catalysis in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Microdomain Interlocking Polymer Electrolytes for Advanced All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Battery Chemistries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational concept of high&#8208;entropy microdomain interlocking all&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes is designed by introducing newly polymerized multifunctional ABC miktoarm star terpolymers into polyethylene oxide. The tailor&#8208;made electrolyte shows advanced mechanical, electrochemical, and thermodynamic performances, stably enabling all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal symmetrical cell cycles over 4000&#160;h.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (ASPEs) with excellent processivity are considered one of the most forward&#8208;looking materials for large&#8208;scale industrialization. However, the contradiction between improving the mechanical strength and accelerating the ionic migration of ASPEs has always been difficult to reconcile. Herein, a rational concept is raised of high&#8208;entropy microdomain interlocking ASPEs (HEMI&#8208;ASPEs), inspired by entropic elasticity well&#8208;known in polymer and biochemical sciences, by introducing newly designed multifunctional ABC miktoarm star terpolymers into polyethylene oxide for the first time. The tailor&#8208;made HEMI&#8208;ASPEs possess multifunctional polymer chains, which induce themselves to assemble into micro&#8208; and nanoscale dynamic interlocking networks with high topological structure entropy. HEMI&#8208;ASPEs achieve excellent toughness, considerable ionic conductivity, an appreciable lithium transference number (0.63), and desirable thermal stability (Td&#160;&gt; 400&#160;&#176;C) for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. The Li|HEMI&#8208;ASPE&#8208;Li|Li symmetrical cell shows a stable Li plating/stripping performance over 4000&#160;h, and a LiFePO4|HEMI&#8208;ASPE&#8208;Li|Li full cell exhibits a high capacity retention (&#8776;96%) after 300 cycles. This work contributes an innovative design concept introducing high&#8208;entropy supramolecular dynamic networks for ASPEs.

         <title>Unravelling the Interfacial Dynamics of Bandgap Funneling in Bismuth&#8208;Based Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial dynamics and electrochemical interactions of hybrid perovskites prepared by an anion&#8208;exchange process in the photoelectrochemical system is investigated through computational simulation, experimental photophysical, and (photo)electrochemical analysis. The synergically interfacial dynamics and electrochemical analysis help to discover the intrinsic and interfacial properties of semiconductor materials.








Abstract
An environmentally friendly mixed&#8208;halide perovskite MA3Bi2Cl9&#8722;xIx with a bandgap funnel structure has been developed. However, the dynamic interfacial interactions of bandgap funneling in MA3Bi2Cl9&#8722;xIx perovskites in the photoelectrochemical (PEC) system remain ambiguous. In light of this, single&#8208; and mixed&#8208;halide lead&#8208;free bismuth&#8208;based hybrid perovskites&#8212;MA3Bi2Cl9&#8722;yIy and MA3Bi2I9 (named MBCl&#8208;I and MBI)&#8212;in the presence and absence of the bandgap funnel structure, respectively, are prepared. Using temperature&#8208;dependent transient photoluminescence and electrochemical voltammetric techniques, the photophysical and (photo)electrochemical phenomena of solid&#8211;solid and solid&#8211;liquid interfaces for MBCl&#8208;I and MBI halide perovskites are therefore confirmed. Concerning the mixed&#8208;halide hybrid perovskites MBCl&#8208;I with a bandgap funnel structure, stronger electronic coupling arising from an enhanced overlap of electronic wavefunctions results in more efficient exciton transport. Besides, MBCl&#8208;I's effective diffusion coefficient and electron&#8208;transfer rate demonstrate efficient heterogeneous charge transfer at the solid&#8211;liquid interface, generating improved photoelectrochemical hydrogen production. Consequently, this combination of photophysical and electrochemical techniques opens up an avenue to explore the intrinsic and interfacial properties of semiconductor materials for elucidating the correlation between material characterization and device performance.

         <title>Large Harvested Energy by Self&#8208;excited Liquid Suspension Triboelectric Nanogenerator with Optimized Charge Transportation Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
To enhance the durability of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), liquid lubrication has been used to reduce mechanical abrasion. However, as the charge transportation behavior in dielectric liquid is not clearly understood, the output energy is still low although some improvements have been reported. Herein, we systematically investigate the charge transportation behaviors in dielectric liquid by self&#8208;excited liquid suspension triboelectric nanogenerator (LS&#8208;TENG). We find the important role of solid&#8208;liquid triboelectrification effect, charge&#8208;liquid transmission and dissipation effect, and the homogeneous dielectric induction effect in promoting its output performance. The LS&#8208;TENG with a dual dielectric tribolayer has advantages of slight driving force and long lifetime for harvesting micro energy. The output of LS&#8208;TENG remains almost constant for more than 234 k operating cycles. A high charge density of 704 &#956;C m&#8722;2 is obtained, 2.7 times as much as that of current highest record in non&#8208;contact TENG. Additionally, the rotary LS&#8208;TENG lights up 4,200 LEDs and continuously powers a variety of wireless sensors by harvesting wind energy at low wind speed. This work provides an important insight towards the charge transportation mechanism in dielectric liquid, and a prospective strategy for achieving high robust TENG in micro energy harvesting for practical applications.

         <title>A Highly Crystalline Single Layer Two&#8208;dimensional Polymer for Low Variability and Excellent Scalability Molecular Memristors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Large&#8208;scale growth of highly crystalline single layer two&#8208;dimensional polymers (SL&#8208;2DPs) and their subsequent integration into memristors is key to advancing the development of high&#8208;density data storage devices. However, leakage problems resulting from the porous structure of 2DPs continue to make such advances extremely challenging. Herein, we overcome this issue by incorporating long alkoxy chains into key molecular building blocks to obtain a highly crystalline 2DP, as visualized by scanning tunnelling microscopy, and prevent metal permeation in the subsequent device fabrication process. SL&#8208;2DP memristors constructed via direct evaporation of the top electrodes exhibit low variability (&#963;Vset = 0.14) due to the single&#8208;monomer&#8208;thick feature together with the high regular structure and coordination ability which minimizes the stochastic spatial distribution of conductive filaments (CFs) in both vertical and lateral dimensions. The variability was further decreased to 0.04 by confining the formation and fracture of CFs to the interface through the utilization of bilayer junctions. Using peak force tunnelling atomic force microscopy, we demonstrate the nanometre scalability (&lt; 50 nm2) and low power consumption of these molecular memristor devices.

         <title>Functional MXene&#8208;Based Materials for Next&#8208;Generation Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategies that developed to functionalize MXene&#8208;based materials, including tailoring their microstructure by ions/molecules/polymers&#8208;initiated interaction or self&#8208;assembly, surface/interface engineering with dopants or functional groups, constructing heterostructures from MXenes with various materials, and transforming them into a series of derivatives inheriting the merits of the MXene precursors, are highlighted.








Abstract
MXenes are seen as an exceptional candidate to reshape the future of energy with their viable surface chemistry, ultrathin 2D structure, and excellent electronic conductivity. The extensive research efforts bring about rapid expansion of the MXene families with enriched functionalities, which significantly boost performance of the existing energy&#8208;storage devices. In this review, the strategies that are developed to functionalize the MXene&#8208;based materials, including tailoring their microstructure by ions/molecules/polymers&#8208;initiated interaction or self&#8208;assembly, surface/interface engineering with dopants or functional groups, constructing heterostructures from MXenes with various materials, and transforming them into a series of derivatives inheriting the merits of the MXene precursors are highlighted. Their applications in emerging battery technologies are demonstrated and discussed. With delicate functionalization and structural engineering, MXene&#8208;based electrode materials exhibit improved specific capacity and rate capability, and their presence further suppresses and even eliminates dendrite formation on the metal anodes, which lengthens the lifespan of the rechargeable batteries. Meanwhile, MXenes serve as additives for electrolytes, separators, and current collectors. Finally, some future directions worth of exploration to address the remaining challenging issues of MXene&#8208;based materials and achieve the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;power and low&#8208;cost rechargeable batteries are proposed.

Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) have piqued global research interest because of their unprecedented safety and high energy density. Significant advances have been made in achieving high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity and good air stability of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs), mitigating the challenges at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, and developing feasible manufacturing processes. Along with the advances in fundamental study, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells using inorganic SSEs have been widely demonstrated, revealing their immense potential for industrialization. This Review provides an overview of inorganic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells, focusing on ultrathin solid&#8208;state electrolyte membranes, sheet&#8208;type thick solid&#8208;state electrodes, and bipolar stacking. Moreover, several critical parameters directly influencing the energy density of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;ion and Li&#8208;S pouch cells are outlined. Finally, perspectives on all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells are provided and specific metrics to meet certain energy density targets are specified. With this Review, we look to facilitate the development of inorganic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells with high energy density and excellent safety.

         <title>Chiral&#8208;Selective Antigen&#8208;Presentation by Supramolecular Chiral Polymer Micelles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chirality is ubiquitous in biological systems, which is closely related to biological functions, life process, and even pathogenesis of diseases. However, the interface between the chirality of synthetic materials and organisms, particularly the immune system, remains poorly understood. Here, supramolecular chiral polymer micelles (SCPMs) are prepared by complexing antigenic proteins with chiral amino acid modified polyethyleneimine. The introduction of chirality not only reduces the toxicity of cationic polymer, but also benefits cell uptake and antigen presentation. Especially, D&#8208;chirality presents the lowest cytotoxicity, while promotes the highest expression level of costimulatory molecules on dendritic cells compared to L&#8208;chirality and achirality. The superiority of D&#8208;chirality to stimulate dendritic cell maturation is supported by immunization with D&#8208;SCPMs, which achieves significant antigen&#8208;specific proliferation of T cells in the spleen, lymph nodes and tumor of mice. Chirality&#8208;mediated antigen processing and presentation is demonstrated by D&#8208;SCPMs self&#8208;assembled from chiral alkaline histidine or neutral phenylalanine modified polyethyleneimine and tumor associated ovalbumin or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike 1 antigenic protein. Immunoactivation enabled by D&#8208;chirality opens a window to prepare potent nanotherapeutics for disease prevention and treatment.

         <title>Functional Coating from Amyloid Superwetting Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloid fibrils are used as scaffolds for multifunctional films for different applications, including oil/water separation, antifouling, and antifogging materials. Enzyme immobilization on amyloid&#8208;modified surfaces further enables biocatalytic oxidation and degradation of target compounds, extending use to bio&#8208;based applications.








Abstract
Tailoring the hydrophilicity of solid surfaces with a strong affinity to water has been extensively explored in the last 20 years, but studies have been limited to the single function of wettability. Here, the multifunctional properties of tailored surface films are extended from exhibiting superwettability to facilitating biological activities. It is shown that amyloid fibrils can be universally coated onto various substrates, such as fabrics (non&#8208;woven organic masks), metal meshes, polyethersulfone (PES), glass, and more, endowing the resulting surfaces with excellent performance in oil/water mixture and emulsion separation, antifouling, and antifogging. Moreover, the biocompatible crosslinked amyloid fibril coatings can serve as a platform for biocatalytic activities by immobilizing enzymes, as shown in the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azino&#8208;bis (3&#8208;ethylbenzothiazoline&#8208;6&#8208;sulphonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) oxidation and Reactive Black 5 (RB5)&#160;degradation by laccase from Trametes versicolor. The study provides a universal approach to modifying surface morphology and chemical properties via fibrous protein templates, opening the way to unexplored bio&#8208;based applications and functionalities.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetic Skyrmions and Large Topological Hall Effect in Chromium Telluride Engineered by Self&#8208;Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic skyrmions and large topological Hall effect are demonstrated in chromium telluride. The Curie temperature and magnetic anisotropy in Cr1+xTe2 can be controlled by the self&#8208;intercalate concentration x. In Cr1.53Te2, which has a Curie temperature of 295&#160;K and a relatively weak perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, room&#8208;temperature skyrmions and topological Hall resistivity as large as &#8776;106&#160;n&#937;&#160;cm are observed.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature magnetic skyrmion materials exhibiting robust topological Hall effect (THE) are crucial for novel nano&#8208;spintronic devices. However, such skyrmion&#8208;hosting materials are rare in nature. In this study, a self&#8208;intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide Cr1+xTe2 with a layered crystal structure that hosts room&#8208;temperature skyrmions and exhibits large THE is reported. By tuning the self&#8208;intercalate concentration, a monotonic control of Curie temperature from 169 to 333&#160;K and a magnetic anisotropy transition from out&#8208;of&#8208;plane to the in&#8208;plane configuration are achieved. Based on the intercalation engineering, room&#8208;temperature skyrmions are successfully created in Cr1.53Te2 with a Curie temperature of 295&#160;K and a relatively weak perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Remarkably, a skyrmion&#8208;induced topological Hall resistivity as large as &#8776;106&#160;n&#937; cm is observed at 290&#160;K. Moreover, a sign reversal of THE is also found at low temperatures, which can be ascribed to other topological spin textures having an opposite topological charge to that of the skyrmions. Therefore, chromium telluride can be a new paradigm of the skyrmion material family with promising prospects for future device applications.

         <title>Extraordinary Solidification Mechanism of Liquid Alloys Under Acoustic Levitation State</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acoustic levitation is an advanced containerless processing technique for simulating a space environment, and provides an effective approach to modulate the fluid dynamics and solidification mechanisms of liquid materials. The physical characteristics of liquid flow, undercooling capability, phase separation, crystal nucleation, and dendritic and eutectic growth within acoustically levitated droplets are demonstrated comprehensively to reveal the extraordinary solidification kinetics of liquid alloys.








Abstract
The acoustic levitation of various materials can be realized by highly intensive ultrasound, which provides a free surface and containerless state for materials processing under space simulation conditions. The nonlinear effects such as acoustic radiation pressure, acoustic streaming, and ultrasonic cavitation open up special access to modulate the fluid dynamics and solidification mechanisms of liquid materials. Here, the physical characteristics of liquid flow, undercooling capability, phase separation, and crystal nucleation and growth within acoustically levitated droplets are explored comprehensively to reveal the extraordinary solidification kinetics of liquid alloys. The sectorial shape oscillations of the 2nd to 10th order modes accompanying internal potential flow are observed for water droplets with modulated ultrasound amplitudes, while the enhanced ultrasound intensity promotes ice nucleation and thus reduces water undercooling. The migration of Sn&#8208;rich globules during phase separation of immiscible Al&#8211;Cu&#8211;Sn alloy is dominated by the droplet deformation and rotation related to acoustic levitation. The high undercooling states of liquid Ag&#8211;Cu&#8211;Ge and Ni&#8211;Sn alloys during acoustic levitation result in the refinement of (Ag) dendrites and the formation of anomalous (Ni+Ni3Sn) eutectics. The ultrasound&#8211;liquid interaction also induces surface waves during the containerless solidification of Ag&#8211;Cu and Ni&#8211;Sn eutectic alloys.

         <title>Coexistence of Urbach&#8208;Tail&#8208;Like Localized States and Metallic Conduction Channels in Nitrogen&#8208;Doped 3D Curved Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen doping on 3D curved graphene leads to the coexistence of an Urbach&#8208;tail&#8208;like localized state and a metallic state. The dual nature of the electronic states can be the electronic origin of the high electrocatalysis, enhanced molecular adsorption, and light absorption of N&#8208;doped 3D graphene.








Abstract
Nitrogen (N) doping is one of the most effective approaches to tailor the chemical and physical properties of graphene. By the interplay between N dopants and 3D curvature of graphene lattices, N&#8208;doped 3D graphene displays superior performance in electrocatalysis and solar&#8208;energy harvesting for energy and environmental applications. However, the electrical transport properties and the electronic states, which are the key factors to understand the origins of the N&#8208;doping effect in 3D graphene, are still missing. The electronic properties of N&#8208;doped 3D graphene are systematically investigated by an electric&#8208;double&#8208;layer transistor method. It is demonstrated that Urbach&#8208;tail&#8208;like localized states are located around the neutral point of N&#8208;doped 3D graphene with the background metallic transport channels. The dual nature of electronic states, generated by the synergistic effect of N dopants and 3D curvature of graphene, can be the electronic origin of the high electrocatalysis, enhanced molecular adsorption, and light absorption of N&#8208;doped 3D graphene.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Responsive Upconversion Nanoprobe with Simultaneously Enhanced Single&#8208;Band Red Luminescence and Phase/Size Control for Bioimaging and Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lanthanide based upconversion (UC) nanoprobes are emerged as promising agents for biological applications. And, extending the excitation light to the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) instead of the traditional 980/808&#8201;nm light and realizing NIR&#8208;II responsive single band red UC emission is highly demanded for bioimaging application, which has not yet been explored. Here, a new type of NIR&#8208;II (1532&#160;nm) light responsive UC nanoparticles (UCNPs) with enhanced single band red UC emission and controllable phase and size is designed by introducing Er3+ as sensitizer and utilizing Mn2+ as energy manipulator. Through tuning the content of Mn2+ in NaLnF4:Er/Mn, the crystal phase, size and emitting color are readily controlled, and the red&#8208;to&#8208;green (R/G) ratio is significantly increased from &#8764;25 to &#8764;300, leading to NIR&#8208;II responsive single band red emission via efficient energy transfer between Er3+ and Mn2+. In addition, the single band red emitting intensity can be further improved by shell coating to avoid the surface quenching effect. More importantly, NIR&#8208;II light activated red UC bioimaging and NIR&#8208;II light responsive photodynamic therapy (PDT) through loading photosensitizer of zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) were successfully achieved for the first time. These findings provide a new strategy of designing NIR&#8208;II light responsive single band red emissive UCNPs for biomedical applications.

         <title>Engineering Electrodes with Robust Conducting Hydrogel Coating for Neural Recording and Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Coating conventional metallic electrodes with conducting polymers has enabled the essential characteristics required for bioelectronics, such as biocompatibility, electrical conductivity, mechanical compliance and the capacity for structural and chemical functionalization of the bioelectrodes. However, the fragile interface between the conducting polymer and the electrode in wet physiological environment has greatly limited their utility and reliability. Here, we&#160;established a general yet reliable strategy to seamlessly interface conventional electrodes with conducting hydrogel coatings, featuring tissue&#8208;like modulus, highly&#8208;desirable electrochemical properties, robust interface and long&#8208;term reliability. Numerical modelling reveals the role of toughening mechanism, synergy of covalent anchorage of long&#8208;chain polymers and chemical crosslinking, in improving the long&#8208;term robustness of the interface. Through in vivo implantation in freely&#8208;moving mouse models, we&#160;show that stable electrophysiological recording could be achieved, while the conducting hydrogel/electrode interface remained robust during the long&#8208;term low&#8208;voltage electrical stimulation. This simple yet versatile design strategy addresses the long&#8208;standing technical challenges in functional bioelectrode engineering, and opens up new avenues for the next&#8208;generation diagnostic brain&#8208;machine&#160;interfaces.

         <title>A Gate Programmable van der Waals Metal&#8208;Ferroelectric&#8208;Semiconductor Vertical Heterojunction Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ferroelectricity, one of the keys to realize non&#8208;volatile memories owing to the remanent electric polarization, has been an emerging phenomenon in the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) limit. Yet the demonstrations of van der Waals (vdW) memories using 2D ferroelectric materials as an ingredient are very limited. Especially, gate&#8208;tunable ferroelectric vdW memristive device, which holds promises in future multi&#8208;bit data storage applications, remains challenging. Here, we&#160;show a gate&#8208;programmable multi&#8208;state memory by vertically assembling graphite, CuInP2S6, and MoS2 layers into a metal(M)&#8208;ferroelectric(FE)&#8208;semiconductor(S) architecture. The resulted devices seamlessly integrate the functionality of both FE&#8208;memristor (with ON&#8208;OFF ratios exceeding 105 and long&#8208;term retention) and metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor field effect transistor (MOS&#8208;FET). It thus yields a prototype of gate tunable giant electroresistance with multi&#8208;levelled ON&#8208;states in the FE&#8208;memristor in the vertical vdW assembly.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroelectricity, one of the keys to realize non-volatile memories owing to the remanent electric polarization, has been an emerging phenomenon in the two-dimensional (2D) limit. Yet the demonstrations of van der Waals (vdW) memories using 2D ferroelectric materials as an ingredient are very limited. Especially, gate-tunable ferroelectric vdW memristive device, which holds promises in future multi-bit data storage applications, remains challenging. Here, we&#160;show a gate-programmable multi-state memory by vertically assembling graphite, CuInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, and MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers into a metal(M)-ferroelectric(FE)-semiconductor(S) architecture. The resulted devices seamlessly integrate the functionality of both FE-memristor (with ON-OFF ratios exceeding 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; and long-term retention) and metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOS-FET). It thus yields a prototype of gate tunable giant electroresistance with multi-levelled ON-states in the FE-memristor in the vertical vdW assembly. First-principles calculations further reveal that such behaviors originate from the specific band alignment between the FE-S interface. Our&#160;findings pave the way for the engineering of ferroelectricity-mediated memories in future implementations of 2D&#160;nanoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Zwitterions Narrow Distribution of Perovskite Quantum Wells for Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Efficiency Exceeding 15%</title>

Abstract
While quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) perovskites have emerged as promising semiconductors for light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), the broad&#8208;width distribution of quantum wells hinders their efficient energy transfer and electroluminescence performance in blue emission. In particular, the underlying mechanism is closely related to the crystallization kinetics and has yet to be understood. Here for the first time, we systematically investigated the influence of bifunctional zwitterions with different coordination affinity on the crystallization kinetics of quasi&#8208;2D perovskites. The zwitterions could coordinate with Pb2+ and also act as co&#8208;spacer organic species in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites, which collectively inhibit the aggregation of colloidal precursors and shorten the distance of quantum wells. Consequently, restricted nucleation of high&#8208;n phases and promoted growth of low&#8208;n phases are achieved with moderately coordinated zwitterions, leading to the final film with a more concentrated n distribution and improved energy transfer efficiency. It thus enables high&#8208;efficiency blue LEDs with a recorded external quantum efficiency of 15.6% at 490&#160;nm, and the operation stability has also been prolonged to 55.3&#160;min. Our results provide useful directions for tuning the crystallization kinetics of quasi&#8208;2D perovskites, which is expected to lead to high&#8208;performance perovskite LEDs.

Abstract
Prompt on&#8208;site diagnosis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with other respiratory infections would have minimized the global impact of the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic through rapid, effective management. However, no such multiplex point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) chip has satisfied a suitable sensitivity of gold&#8208;standard nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Here, we present a rapid multiplexed ultrasensitive sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer LAMP (MUSAL) chip operated by simple LED&#8208;driven photothermal amplification to detect six targets from single&#8208;swab sampling. First, our MUSAL chip allows ultrafast on&#8208;chip sample preparation with &#8764;500&#8208;fold preconcentration at a rate of 1.2&#160;mL min&#8722;1. Second, our chip enables contamination&#8208;free amplification using autonomous target elution into on&#8208;chip reagents by photothermal activation. Finally, our chip accomplishes multiplexed on&#8208;chip diagnostics of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and influenza viruses with a limit of detection (LoD) of 0.5 copies &#956;L&#8722;1. Our rapid, ultra&#8208;sensitive, cost&#8208;effective sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer chip with a multiplex capability will allow timely management of various pandemics situations we may face shortly.

         <title>Chiral Seeded Growth of Gold Nanorods Into Fourfold Twisted Nanoparticles with Plasmonic Optical Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fourfold twisted Au nanorods can be prepared via chiral seeded growth, using cysteine as a chiral inducer. A high dissymmetry factor is obtained and electromagnetic simulations show chiral plasmon modes with largely asymmetric near&#8208;field enhancement. The mechanism involved in chiral growth is related with cysteine&#8208;induced enantioselective development of chiral facets.








Abstract
A robust and reproducible methodology to prepare stable inorganic nanoparticles with chiral morphology may hold the key to the practical utilization of these materials. An optimized chiral growth method to prepare fourfold twisted gold nanorods is described herein, where the amino acid cysteine is used as a dissymmetry inducer. Four tilted ridges are found to develop on the surface of single&#8208;crystal nanorods upon repeated reduction of HAuCl4, in the presence of cysteine as the chiral inducer and ascorbic acid as a reducing agent. From detailed electron microscopy analysis of the crystallographic structures, it is proposed that the dissymmetry results from the development of chiral facets in the form of protrusions (tilted ridges) on the initial nanorods, eventually leading to a twisted shape. The role of cysteine is attributed to assisting enantioselective facet evolution, which is supported by density functional theory simulations of the surface energies, modified upon adsorption of the chiral molecule. The development of R&#8208;type and S&#8208;type chiral structures (small facets, terraces, or kinks) would thus be non&#8208;equal, removing the mirror symmetry of the Au NR and in turn resulting in a markedly chiral morphology with high plasmonic optical activity.

         <title>Probabilistic Neural Computing with Stochastic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modern computing assumes that materials, devices, and circuits will be operated in a fully deterministic manner, providing predictable and reliable outputs, with any desired random behavior re&#8208;introduced in software. This perspective describes how the integration of tunable stochastic devices into neuromorphic computing architectures can allow future microelectronics to enable more efficient probabilistic computing calculations for scientific computing and artificial&#8208;intelligence applications.








Abstract
The brain has effectively proven a powerful inspiration for the development of computing architectures in which processing is tightly integrated with memory, communication is event&#8208;driven, and analog computation can be performed at scale. These neuromorphic systems increasingly show an ability to improve the efficiency and speed of scientific computing and artificial intelligence applications. Herein, it is proposed that the brain's ubiquitous stochasticity represents an additional source of inspiration for expanding the reach of neuromorphic computing to probabilistic applications. To date, many efforts exploring probabilistic computing have focused primarily on one scale of the microelectronics stack, such as implementing probabilistic algorithms on deterministic hardware or developing probabilistic devices and circuits with the expectation that they will be leveraged by eventual probabilistic architectures. A co&#8208;design vision is described by which large numbers of devices, such as magnetic tunnel junctions and tunnel diodes, can be operated in a stochastic regime and incorporated into a scalable neuromorphic architecture that can impact a number of probabilistic computing applications, such as Monte Carlo simulations and Bayesian neural networks. Finally, a framework is presented to categorize increasingly advanced hardware&#8208;based probabilistic computing technologies.

         <title>Cancer&#8208;Cell&#8208;Biomimetic Nanoparticles for Targeted Therapy of Multiple Myeloma Based on Bone Marrow Homing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The insufficient delivery of drug limits the therapeutic effect of multiple myeloma. A myeloma cell&#8208;mimicking nanocarrier, which can enter bone marrow based on bone marrow homing and target tumor cells through homologous targeting, is developed. Thus, the amount of drug available at the myeloma site in the bone marrow is increased and an enhanced therapeutic effect is achieved.








Abstract
Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological malignancy. It is characterized by abnormal transformation and uncontrolled clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM), which can destroy bone structure and inhibit hematopoiesis. Although there are new therapeutic methods, they are not curative, mainly because it is difficult to deliver an effective amount of drug to BM, leading to a failure to eradicate MM cells inside the BM. BM homing is an important and unique characteristic of MM cells and it is mainly affected by surface molecules on the tumor cell membrane. Inspired by this mechanism, an MM&#8208;mimicking nanocarrier is developed by coating bortezomib (BTZ)&#8208;loaded poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone)&#8211;poly(ethylene glycol)&#8211;poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCEC) nanoparticles with the MM cell membrane. The MM&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles can enter the BM based on BM homing as a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; and target the tumor cells through homologous targeting. In this way, drug availability at the myeloma site is enhanced so as to inhibit MM growth. In addition, these MM&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles can escape phagocytosis by the MPS and have a long circulation effect.

&lt;p&gt;The insufficient delivery of drug limits the therapeutic effect of multiple myeloma. A myeloma cell-mimicking nanocarrier, which can enter bone marrow based on bone marrow homing and target tumor cells through homologous targeting, is developed. Thus, the amount of drug available at the myeloma site in the bone marrow is increased and an enhanced therapeutic effect is achieved.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological malignancy. It is characterized by abnormal transformation and uncontrolled clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM), which can destroy bone structure and inhibit hematopoiesis. Although there are new therapeutic methods, they are not curative, mainly because it is difficult to deliver an effective amount of drug to BM, leading to a failure to eradicate MM cells inside the BM. BM homing is an important and unique characteristic of MM cells and it is mainly affected by surface molecules on the tumor cell membrane. Inspired by this mechanism, an MM-mimicking nanocarrier is developed by coating bortezomib (BTZ)-loaded poly(&#949;-caprolactone)&#8211;poly(ethylene glycol)&#8211;poly(&#949;-caprolactone) (PCEC) nanoparticles with the MM cell membrane. The MM-mimicking nanoparticles can enter the BM based on BM homing as a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; and target the tumor cells through homologous targeting. In this way, drug availability at the myeloma site is enhanced so as to inhibit MM growth. In addition, these MM-mimicking nanoparticles can escape phagocytosis by the MPS and have a long circulation effect. The in vivo therapeutic results demonstrate an excellent treatment efficacy for MM. Accordingly, this strategy may be a promising platform for the treatment of MM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Polyethylene Lamellar&#8208;Thin Framework on Square Meter Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new member of low&#8208;dimensional structures with square meter lateral size by commodity polymer is introduced. This macroscopic low&#8208;dimensional material is highly transparent optically and electronically, sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;porous, and self&#8208;standing with Young's modulus of gigapascal level. Its potential applications include separation process and flexible electronics.








Abstract
A new member of low&#8208;dimensional structures with a high aspect ratio (LDHA) is introduced. For the first time, commodity polymer is processed into LDHA, which has long been stagnated by the lack of suitable processing techniques. The key to solve the current bottleneck is to overcome the trade&#8208;off between kinetic processability and thermodynamic stability. These two factors are both highly determined by intermolecular interaction level (IIL). Thus with a wide tuning range of IIL, ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is selected and investigated to break through the trade&#8208;off. Polymeric LDHA preparation needs both thinning and stiffening. By focusing on one then the other sequentially, they are realized simultaneously. Thus the over sixty&#8208;year&#8208;old material is finally thinned down by seven orders of magnitude into a 65.5&#160;nm thick and 0.64 m2 large lamellar&#8208;thin framework (LTF). LTF exhibits a series of exceptional properties such as over&#8208;95% transparency, and seven times higher specific strength referred to steel. For the first time, cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;EM) is utilized to observe commodity polymers directly. This new LDHA material is promising to expand the scale boundaries of both fundamental research and practical applications, not only for UHMWPE, but also for more commodity polymers to come.

         <dc:description>
Catalase&#8208;mimetic artificial biocatalysts with Ru catalytic centers are constructed for reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination. The activity merits and structure diversities of different Ru catalytic sites are systematically disclosed. Notably, the biocatalysts with Ru clusters present exceptional ROS&#8208;elimination activity, thus providing efficient rescue ability for the survival, adhesion, and differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells in high ROS conditions.








Abstract
Exploring high&#8208;efficiency reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;elimination materials is of great importance for combating oxidative stress in diverse diseases, especially stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based biotherapeutics. By mimicking the Fe&#63743;N active centers of natural catalase, here, an innovative concept to design ROS&#8208;elimination artificial biocatalysts with Ru catalytic centers for stem&#8208;cell protection is reported. The experimental studies and theoretical calculations have systematically disclosed the activity merits and structure diversities of different Ru sites when serving as ROS&#8208;elimination artificial biocatalysts. Benefiting from the metallic electronic structures and synergetic effects of multiple sites, the artificial biocatalysts with Ru cluster centers present exceptional ROS&#8208;elimination activity; notably, it shows much higher catalytic efficiency per Ru atom on decomposing H2O2 when compared to the isolated single&#8208;atom Ru sites, which is more efficient than that of the natural antioxidants and recently reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ROS&#8208;scavenging biocatalysts. The systematic stem&#8208;cell protection studies reveal that the catalase&#8208;like artificial biocatalysts can provide efficient rescue ability for survival, adhesion, and differentiation functions of human mesenchymal stem cells in high ROS level conditions. It is suggested that applying these artificial biocatalysts with Ru cluster centers will offer a new pathway for engineering high&#8208;performance ROS&#8208;scavenging materials in stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based therapeutics and many other ROS&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>A Lysosome&#8208;Activated Tetrahedral Nanobox for Encapsulated siRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetrahedral nanobox, a kind of dynamic framework nucleic acid nanocarrier, is fabricated to completely encapsulate target siRNA and realize controllable delivery of cargo strands upon a pH&#8208;responsive switch. Based on the protective encapsulation against degradation and detachment during delivery and final active release in cells, excellent gene&#8208;silencing effects are achieved for in vitro and in vivo experiments.








Abstract
Tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) have attracted extensive attention as drug nanocarriers because of their excellent cellular uptake. However, for oligonucleotide cargos, tFNA mainly acts as a static delivery platform generated via sticky&#8208;ended ligation. Here, inspired by the original stable space inside the tetrahedral scaffold, a dynamic lysosome&#8208;activated tFNA nanobox is fabricated for completely encapsulating a short interfering RNA (siRNA) of interest. The closed tetrahedral structure endows cargo siRNA with greater resistance against RNase and serum and enables solid integration with the vehicle during delivery. Moreover, the pH&#8208;responsive switch of nanobox allows the controlled release of siRNA upon entry into lysosomes at cell culture temperature. Based on protective loading and active unloading, an excellent silencing effect on the target tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;) gene is achieved in in vitro and in vivo experiments. Conclusively, the nanobox offers a dynamic pH&#8208;sensitive confinement delivery system for siRNA and can be an extendable strategy for other small RNA.

         <title>Water&#8208;Triggered Stiffening of Shape&#8208;Memory Polyurethanes Composed of Hard Backbone Dangling PEG Soft Segments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the thermally triggered phase transformation process and &#8220;soft&#8208;to&#8208;stiff&#8221; transition achieved by lattice distortion of shape&#8208;memory alloys, a series of water&#8208;triggered stiffening shape&#8208;memory polyurethanes is developed. They can achieve &#8220;soft&#8208;to&#8208;stiff&#8221; transition by forming more continuous hard domains upon hydration.








Abstract
Shape&#8208;memory polymers (SMPs) induced by heat or water are commonly used candidates for biomedical applications. Shape recovery inevitably leads to a dramatic decrease of Young's modulus due to the enhanced flexibility of polymer chains at the transition temperature. Herein, the principle of phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced stiffening of shape&#8208;memory metallic alloys (SMAs) is introduced to the design of molecular structures for shape&#8208;memory polyurethane (SMPUs), featuring all&#8208;hard segments composed of main chains that are attached with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) dangling side chains. Different from conventional SMPs, they achieve a soft&#8208;to&#8208;stiff transition when shape recovers. The stiffening process is driven by water&#8208;triggered segmental rearrangement due to the incompatibility between the hard segments and the soft PEG segments. Upon hydration, the extent of microphase separation is enhanced and the hard domains are transformed to a more continuous morphology to realize more effective stress transfer. Meanwhile, such segmental rearrangement facilitates the shape&#8208;recovery process in the hydrated state despite the final increased glass transition temperature (Tg). This work represents a novel paradigm of simultaneously integrating balanced mechanics, shape&#8208;memory property, and biocompatibility for SMPUs as materials for minimally invasive surgery such as endoluminal stents.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Type SrVO3 as High&#8208;Performance Anode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite SrVO3 is investigated as a Li&#8208;ion battery anode material. Thanks to the high intrinsic electronic and ionic conductivities, commercial thick and conducting additive&#8208;free perovskite SrVO3 electrodes are constructed and electrochemical performance with high gravimetric/areal/volumetric capacities, high&#8208;rate capability, and high cycling stability is delivered.








Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;type oxides, characterized by excellent multifunctional physical and chemical properties, are widely used in ferroelectric, piezoelectric, energy conversion, and storage applications. It is shown here that the perovskite&#8208;type SrVO3 can achieve excellent electrochemical performance as lithium&#8208;ion battery anodes thanks to its high electrically and ionically conductivity. Conducting additive&#8208;free SrVO3 electrodes can deliver a high specific capacity of 324 mAh g&#8722;1 at a safe and low average working potential of &#8776;0.9 V vs Li/Li+ together with excellent high&#8208;rate performance. A high areal capacity of &#8776;5.4 mAh cm&#8722;2 is obtained using an ultrathick (&#8776;120 &#956;m) electrode. Moreover, the fully lithiated SrVO3 electrode exhibits only 2.3% volume expansion that is explained by a simple solid&#8208;solution Li+&#8208;storage mechanism, resulting in good cycling stability of the electrode. This study highlights the perovskite&#8208;type SrVO3 as a promising Li+&#8208;storage anode and provides opportunities for exploring a variety of perovskite oxides as next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;ion battery anodes.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Pathway Model for the Evolution of Colloidal Compound Semiconductor Quantum Dots and Magic&#8208;Size Clusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;pathway model has been proposed for the evolution of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). One unique intermediate called &#8220;precursor compound&#8221; (PC) is discovered to transform to its magic&#8208;size cluster (MSC) counterpart via intramolecular reorganization. PCs can be engineered to selectively produce either ultrasmall QDs with enhanced particle yield or various MSCs, with an unprecedented high degree of control.








Abstract
A fundamental understanding of formation pathways is critical to the controlled synthesis of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals. As ultrasmall&#8208;size quantum dots (QDs) sometimes emerge in reactions along with magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs), distinguishing their individual pathway of evolution is important, but has proven difficult. To decouple the evolution of QDs and MSCs, an unconventional, selective approach has been developed, along with a two&#8208;pathway model that provides a fundamental understanding of production selectivity. For on&#8208;demand production of either ultrasmall QDs or MSCs, the key enabler is in how to allow a reaction to proceed in the time prior to nucleation and growth of QDs. In this prenucleation stage, an intermediate compound forms, which is the precursor compound (PC) to the MSC. Here, the two&#8208;pathway model and the manipulation of such PCs to synthesize either ultrasmall QDs or binary and ternary MSCs are highlighted. The two&#8208;pathway model will assist the development of nucleation theory as well as provide a basis for a mechanism&#8208;enabled design and predictive synthesis of functional nanomaterials.

         <title>A Tetrahedral Framework DNA&#8208;Based Bioswitchable miRNA Inhibitor Delivery System: Application to Skin Anti&#8208;Aging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioswitchable miR inhibitor delivery system (BiRDS) is designed. BiRDS maximizes miR inhibitors&#8217; loading capacity while retaining the characteristics of small&#8208;sized tFNA. Superior skin penetration ability and RNA delivery are observed with significant anti&#8208;aging effects. The excellent editability of the BiRDS confers it the potential to significantly improve the stability and delivery efficiency of miR inhibitors.








Abstract
MicroRNA (miR)&#8208;based therapy shows strong potential; however, structural limitations pose a challenge in fully exploiting its biomedical functionality. Tetrahedral framework DNA (tFNA) has proven to be an ideal vehicle for miR therapy. Inspired by the ancient Chinese myth &#8220;Sun and Immortal Birds,&#8221; a novel bioswitchable miR inhibitor delivery system (BiRDS) is designed with three miR inhibitors (the three immortal birds) and a nucleic acid core (the central sun). The BiRDS fuses miR inhibitors within the framework, maximizing their loading capacity, while allowing the system to retain the characteristics of small&#8208;sized tFNA and avoiding uncertainty associated with RNA exposure in traditional loading protocols. The RNase H&#8208;responsive sequence at the tail of each &#8220;immortal bird&#8221; enables the BiRDS to transform from a 3D to a 2D structure upon entering cells, promoting the delivery of miR inhibitors. To confirm the application potential, the BiRDS is used to deliver the miR&#8208;31 inhibitor, with antiaging effects on hair follicle stem cells, into a skin aging model. Superior skin penetration ability and RNA delivery are observed with significant anti&#8208;aging effects. These findings demonstrate the capability and editability of the BiRDS to improve the stability and delivery efficacy of miRs for future innovations.

         <title>Mucosa&#8208;Like Conformal Hydrogel Coating for Aqueous Lubrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ingenious yet feasible method of creating a mucosa&#8208;like conformal hydrogel coating, which is soft, lubricative, hydrophilic, antifouling, biocompatible, and stable, is reported. This coating effectively reduces intubation&#8208;related complications. This work represents a breakthrough to endow interventional medical devices with required surface properties, showing promising prospects for clinical translation.








Abstract
Mucosa is a protective and lubricating barrier in biological tissue, which has a great clinical inspiration because of its slippery, soft, and hydrophilic surface. However, mimicking mucosal traits on complex surface remains an enormous challenge. Herein, a novel approach to create mucosa&#8208;like conformal hydrogel coating is developed. A thin conformal hydrogel layer mimicking the epithelial layer is obtained by first absorbing micelles, followed by forming covalent interlinks with the polymer substrate via interface&#8208;initiated hydrogel polymerization. The resulting coating exhibits uniform thickness (&#8776;15&#160;&#181;m), mucosa&#8208;matched compliance (Young's modulus = 1.1&#160;&#177; 0.1&#160;kPa) and lubrication (coefficients of friction = 0.018&#160;&#177; 0.003), robust interfacial bonding against peeling (peeling strength = 1218.0&#160;&#177; 187.9 J m&#8211;2), as well as high water absorption capacity. It effectively resists adhesion of proteins and bacteria without compromising biocompatibility. As demonstrated by an in vivo cynomolgus monkey model and clinical trial, applications of the mucosa&#8208;like conformal hydrogel coating on the endotracheal tube significantly reduce intubation&#8208;related complications, such as invasive stimuli, mucosal lesions, laryngeal edema, inflammation, and postoperative pain. This work offers a promising prototype for surface decoration of biomedical devices and holds great prospects for clinical translation to enable interventional operations with minimally invasive impacts.

         <title>Biomimetic Nanoerythrosome&#8208;Coated Aptamer&#8211;DNA Tetrahedron/Maytansine Conjugates: pH&#8208;Responsive and Targeted Cytotoxicity for HER2&#8208;Positive Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PEOz&#8208;erythrosome vesicle loaded with HER2 aptamer&#8208;DNA tetrahedron/maytansine conjugates (HApt&#8208;tFNA@DM1, HTD) is developed for targeted delivery of the HApDCs to HER2&#8208;positive cancer. The PEOz&#8208;erythrosome@HTD prolongs the blood circulation of HTD, protects it from the early blood clearance, and then delivers and releases it into the tumor microenvironment, further improving the antitumor activity of HApDC.








Abstract
DNA materials have emerged as potential nanocarriers for targeted cancer therapy to precisely deliver cargos with specific purposes. The short half&#8208;life and low bioavailability of DNA materials due to their interception by the reticuloendothelial system and blood clearance further limit their clinical translation. This study employs an HER2&#8208;targeted DNA&#8208;aptamer&#8208;modified DNA tetrahedron (HApt&#8208;tFNA) as a drug delivery system, and combines maytansine (DM1) to develop the HApt&#8208;DNA tetrahedron/DM1 conjugate (HApt&#8208;tFNA@DM1, HTD, HApDC) for targeted therapy of HER2&#8208;positive cancer. To optimize the pharmacokinetics and tumor&#8208;aggregation of HTD, a biomimetic camouflage is applied to embed HTD. The biomimetic camouflage is constructed by merging the erythrocyte membrane with pH&#8208;responsive functionalized synthetic liposomes, thus with excellent performance of drug delivery and tumor&#8208;stimulated drug release. The hybrid erythrosome&#8208;based nanoparticles show better inhibition of HER2&#8208;positive cancer than other drug formulations and exhibit superior biosafety. With the strengths of precise delivery, increased drug loading, sensitive tumor probing, and prolonged circulation time, the HApDC represents a promising nanomedicine to treat HER2&#8208;positive tumors. Notably, this study developsa dual&#8208;targeting nanoparticle by combining pH&#8208;sensitive camouflage and HApDC, initiating an important step toward the development and application of DNA&#8208;based medicine and biomimetic cell membrane materials in cancer treatment and other potential biological applications.

&lt;p&gt;A PEOz-erythrosome vesicle loaded with HER2 aptamer-DNA tetrahedron/maytansine conjugates (HApt-tFNA@DM1, HTD) is developed for targeted delivery of the HApDCs to HER2-positive cancer. The PEOz-erythrosome@HTD prolongs the blood circulation of HTD, protects it from the early blood clearance, and then delivers and releases it into the tumor microenvironment, further improving the antitumor activity of HApDC.

         <title>Modulation of the Crosstalk between Schwann Cells and Macrophages for Nerve Regeneration: A Therapeutic Strategy Based on a Multifunctional Tetrahedral Framework Nucleic Acids System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) system, denoted as MiDs, is reported, which integrates the nerve regenerative potential of microRNA&#8208;22 and tFNAs to enhance the peripheral nerve regeneration by improving the communication between Schwann cells (SCs) and macrophages. MiDs can rapidly initiate the repair procedures of SCs and facilitate the polarization of macrophages into M2 macrophages to reconstruct the post&#8208;injury microenvironment.








Abstract
Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is currently recognized as one of the most significant public health issues and affects the general well&#8208;being of millions of individuals worldwide. Despite advances in nerve tissue engineering, nerve repair still cannot guarantee complete functional recovery. In the present study, an innovative approach is adopted to establish a multifunctional tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) system, denoted as MiDs, which can integrate the powerful programmability, permeability, and structural stability of tFNAs, with the nerve regeneration potential of microRNA&#8208;22 to enhance the communication between Schwann cells (SCs) and macrophages for more effective functional rehabilitation of peripheral nerves. Relevant results demonstrate that MiDs can amplify the ability of SCs to recruit macrophages and facilitate their polarization into the pro&#8208;healing M2 phenotype to reconstruct the post&#8208;injury microenvironment. Furthermore, MiDs can initiate the adaptive intracellular reprogramming of SCs within a short period to further promote axon regeneration and remyelination. MiDs represent a new possibility for enhancing nerve repair and may have critical clinical applications in the future.

Axon Regeneration
In article number 2202513, Sirong Shi, Yungfeng Lin, and co&#8208;workers report a multifunctional tetrahedral&#8208;framework nucleic acids system, denoted as MiDs. The peripheral nervous system is like a vibrant rainforest. As flexible in conformation as cats, the powerful MiDs enhance the role of macrophages (represented by the fireflies) and Schwann cells (butterflies) on damaged peripheral nerves, allowing them to grow freely like newborn vines.

Lamellar Frameworks
In article number 2107941, Runlai Li, Qiang Fu, and co&#8208;workers propose a method to thin down commodity polymers into lamellar thin frameworks (LTF) with a square&#8208;meter large area. Interactions between molecules are regulated by multistep processing for ordered molecular alignment. The prepared new structures (LTF and shish&#8208;network), properties (ultrahigh transparency and specific stiffness), and measurements may promote fundamental research and novel practical applications of commodity polymers.

         <title>Mechanistically Scoping Cell&#8208;Free and Cell&#8208;Dependent Artificial Scaffolds in Rebuilding Skeletal and Dental Hard Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>

Rebuilding mineralized structures in tooth and bone is always the supreme goal in fields of regenerative dentistry and orthopedics. Mechanistic understandings of artificial scaffolds in rebuilding skeletal and dental hard tissues are reviewed, by which better clinical choices and research directions may be approached.








Abstract
Rebuilding mineralized tissues in skeletal and dental systems remains costly and challenging. Despite numerous demands and heavy clinical burden over the world, sources of autografts, allografts, and xenografts are far limited, along with massive risks including viral infections, ethic crisis, and so on. Per such dilemma, artificial scaffolds have emerged to provide efficient alternatives. To date, cell&#8208;free biomimetic mineralization (BM) and cell&#8208;dependent scaffolds have both demonstrated promising capabilities of regenerating mineralized tissues. However, BM and cell&#8208;dependent scaffolds have distinctive mechanisms for mineral genesis, which makes them methodically, synthetically, and functionally disparate. Herein, these two strategies in regenerative dentistry and orthopedics are systematically summarized at the level of mechanisms. For BM, methodological and theoretical advances are focused upon; and meanwhile, for cell&#8208;dependent scaffolds, it is demonstrated how scaffolds orchestrate osteogenic cell fate. The summary of the experimental advances and clinical progress will endow researchers with mechanistic understandings of artificial scaffolds in rebuilding hard tissues, by which better clinical choices and research directions may be approached.

         <title>Multifunctional Biomedical Materials Derived from Biological Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure&#8211;function relationship of some important biological membranes, such as various cell membranes, extracellular vesicles, and membranes from bacteria and organelles are reviewed, and selected literature examples of multifunctional biomaterials derived from biological membranes for biomedical applications are also highlighted. Finally, perspectives and challenges associated with the clinical applications of biological&#8208;membrane&#8208;derived materials are discussed.








Abstract
The delicate structure and fantastic functions of biological membranes are the successful evolutionary results of a long&#8208;term natural selection process. Their excellent biocompatibility and biofunctionality are widely utilized to construct multifunctional biomedical materials mainly by directly camouflaging materials with single or mixed biological membranes, decorating or incorporating materials with membrane&#8208;derived vesicles&#160;(e.g., exosomes), and designing multifunctional materials with the structure/functions of biological membranes. Here, the structure&#8211;function relationship of some important biological membranes and biomimetic membranes are discussed, such as various cell membranes, extracellular vesicles, and membranes from bacteria and organelles. Selected literature examples of multifunctional biomaterials derived from biological membranes for biomedical applications, such as drug&#8208; and gene&#8208;delivery systems, tissue&#8208;repair scaffolds, bioimaging, biosensors, and biological detection, are also highlighted. These designed materials show excellent properties, such as long circulation time, disease&#8208;targeted therapy, excellent biocompatibility, and selective recognition. Finally, perspectives and challenges associated with the clinical applications of biological&#8208;membrane&#8208;derived materials are discussed.

         <title>Recent Advances in Delivery Systems for Genetic and Other Novel Vaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New vaccines such as genetic and subunit vaccines create the potential for improving the protective for improving challenged diseases. Owing to their nature, vaccine&#8208;delivery systems are important for their development. Recent advances are assessed and their features are discussed based on their research emphasis on functional design or administration route optimization, providing an overview of this field.








Abstract
Vaccination is one of the most successful and cost&#8208;effective prophylactic measures against diseases, especially infectious diseases including smallpox and polio. However, the development of effective prophylactic or therapeutic vaccines for other diseases such as cancer remains challenging. This is often due to the imprecise control of vaccine activity in vivo which leads to insufficient/inappropriate immune responses or short immune memory. The development of new vaccine types in recent decades has created the potential for improving the protective potency against these diseases. Genetic and subunit vaccines are two major categories of these emerging vaccines. Owing to their nature, they rely heavily on delivery systems with various functions, such as effective cargo protection, immunogenicity enhancement, targeted delivery, sustained release of antigens, selective activation of humoral and/or cellular immune responses against specific antigens, and reduced adverse effects. Therefore, vaccine delivery systems may significantly affect the final outcome of genetic and other novel vaccines and are vital for their development. This review introduces these studies based on their research emphasis on functional design or administration route optimization, presents recent progress, and discusses features of new vaccine delivery systems, providing an overview of this field.

         <title>Functionalizing Framework Nucleic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Based Nanostructures for Biomedical Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In addition to promising biocompatibility and biodegradability, tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) possess four key merits, including enhanced endocytosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, drug loading alternatives, and preferred biodistribution. These merits afford functionalization of static and dynamic tFNAs, such as oligonucleotide&#8208;modified tFNA, drug&#8208;loaded tFNA, and stimuli&#8208;responsive tFNA, for diverse biological applications in tissue engineering, target therapy, and antibacterial and anticancer treatments.








Abstract
Strategies for functionalizing diverse tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) have been extensively explored since the first successful fabrication of tFNA by Turberfield. One&#8208;pot annealing of at least four DNA single strands is the most common method to prepare tFNA, as it optimizes the cost, yield, and speed of assembly. Herein, the focus is on four key merits of tFNAs and their potential for biomedical applications. The natural ability of tFNA to scavenge reactive oxygen species, along with remarkable enhancement in cellular endocytosis and tissue permeability based on its appropriate size and geometry, promotes cell&#8211;material interactions to direct or probe cell behavior, especially to treat inflammatory and degenerative diseases. Moreover, the structural programmability of tFNA enables the development of static tFNA&#8208;based nanomaterials via engineering of functional oligonucleotides or therapeutic molecules, and dynamic tFNAs via attachment of stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA apparatuses, leading to potential applications in targeted therapies, tissue regeneration, antitumor strategies, and antibacterial treatment. Although there are impressive performance and significant progress, the challenges and prospects of functionalizing tFNA&#8208;based nanostructures are still indicated in this review.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collagen fibers (CFs), the structural proteins ubiquitously existing in animal skins, feature unique hierarchically fibrous structure, amphiphilicity&#8208;enabled surface wetting behaviors, and versatile reactivity. Owing to the intrinsic merits of CFs, progressive successes have been achieved in developing CFs&#8208;based advanced separation materials. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the recent development of CFs&#8208;based separation materials and their future perspectives.








Abstract
Separation plays a critical role in a broad range of industrial applications. Developing advanced separation materials is of great significance for the future development of separation technology. Collagen fibers (CFs), the typical structural proteins, exhibit unique structural hierarchy, amphiphilic wettability, and versatile chemical reactivity. These distinctive properties provide infinite possibilities for the rational design of advanced separation materials. During the past 2 decades, many progressive achievements in the development of CFs&#8208;derived advanced separation materials have been witnessed already. Herein, the CFs&#8208;based separation materials are focused on and the recent progresses in this topic are reviewed. CFs widely existing in animal skins display unique hierarchically fibrous structure, amphiphilicity&#8208;enabled surface wetting behaviors, multi&#8208;functionality guaranteed covalent/non&#8208;covalent reaction versatility. These outstanding merits of CFs bring great opportunities for realizing rational design of a variety of advanced separation materials that were&#160;capable of achieving high&#8208;performance separations to diverse specific targets, including oily pollutants, natural products, metal ions, anionic contaminants and proteins, etc. Besides, the important issues for the further development of CFs&#8208;based advanced separation materials are also discussed.

         <title>Ternary Blend Organic Solar Cells: Understanding the Morphology from Recent Progress</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review briefly introduces the solubility and miscibility parameters that affect the morphology of ternary blends and then summarizes the recent processes of morphology study on ternary blends from the aspects of molecular crystallinity, molecular packing orientation, domain size and purity, vertical phase separation, direct observation of the morphology as well as morphological stability.








Abstract
Ternary blend organic solar cells (TB&#8208;OSCs) incorporating multiple donor and/or acceptor materials into the active layer have emerged as a promising strategy to simultaneously improve the overall device parameters for realizing higher performances than binary devices. Whereas introducing multiple materials also results in a more complicated morphology than their binary blend counterparts. Understanding the morphology is crucially important for further improving the device performance of TB&#8208;OSC. This review introduces the solubility and miscibility parameters that affect the morphology of ternary blends. Then, this review summarizes the recent processes of morphology study on ternary blends from the aspects of molecular crystallinity, molecular packing orientation, domain size and purity, directly observation of morphology, vertical phase separation as well as morphological stability. Finally, summary and prospects of TB&#8208;OSCs are concluded.

         <title>A Review on Mechanochemistry: Approaching Advanced Energy Materials with Greener Force</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry as a powerful tool to prepare advanced energy materials is reviewed, covering specific aspects of energy transformations from mechanical/optical/chemical energy to electrical energy. This review intends to comprehensively clarify mechanism, features, and methods of mechanochemistry and summarize the latest advances and progress in this field to inspire interdisciplinary research for developing novel energy materials with greener mechanical force.








Abstract
Mechanochemistry with solvent&#8208;free and environmentally friendly characteristics is one of the most promising alternatives to traditional liquid&#8208;phase&#8208;based reactions, demonstrating epoch&#8208;making significance in the realization of different types of chemistry. Mechanochemistry utilizes mechanical energy to promote physical and chemical transformations to design complex molecules and nanostructured materials, encourage dispersion and recombination of multiphase components, and accelerate reaction rates and efficiencies via highly reactive surfaces. In particular, mechanochemistry deserves special attention because it is capable of endowing energy materials with unique characteristics and properties. Herein, the latest advances and progress in mechanochemistry for the preparation and modification of energy materials are reviewed. An outline of the basic knowledge, methods, and characteristics of different mechanochemical strategies is presented, distinguishing this review from most mechanochemistry reviews that only focus on ball&#8208;milling. Next, this outline is followed by a detailed and insightful discussion of mechanochemistry&#8208;involved energy conversion and storage applications. The discussion comprehensively covers aspects of energy transformations from mechanical/optical/chemical energy to electrical energy. Finally, next&#8208;generation advanced energy materials are proposed. This review is intended to bring mechanochemistry to the frontline and guide this burgeoning field of interdisciplinary research for developing advanced energy materials with greener mechanical force.

         <title>Advanced Flame&#8208;Retardant Methods for Polymeric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flame&#8208;retardant methods for polymeric materials are reviewed with particular focus on advanced flame&#8208;retardant methods developed in recent years. Both the advantages and drawbacks of these methods are discussed, and prospects for the future development of flame&#8208;retardant methods are presented. It is hoped that this review will guide the development of flame&#8208;retardant polymeric materials.








Abstract
Most organic polymeric materials have high flammability, for which the large amounts of smoke, toxic gases, heat, and melt drips produced during their burning cause immeasurable damages to human life and property every year. Despite some desirable results having been achieved by conventional flame&#8208;retardant methods, their application is encountering more and more difficulties with the ever&#8208;increasing high flame&#8208;retardant requirements such as high flame&#8208;retardant efficiency, great persistence, low release of heat, smoke, and toxic gases, and more importantly not deteriorating or even enhancing the overall properties of polymers. Under such condition, some advanced flame&#8208;retardant methods have been developed in the past years based on &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; intumescence, nanotechnology, in situ reinforcement, intrinsic char formation, plasma treatment, biomimetic coatings, etc., which have provided potential solutions to the dilemma of conventional flame&#8208;retardant methods. This review briefly outlines the development, application, and problems of conventional flame&#8208;retardant methods, including bulk&#8208;additive, bulk&#8208;copolymerization, and surface treatment, and focuses on the raise, development, and potential application of advanced flame&#8208;retardant methods. The future development of flame&#8208;retardant methods is further discussed.

         <title>Impact&#8208;Resistant Hydrogels by Harnessing 2D Hierarchical Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired hydrogels with lobster&#8208;underbelly&#8208;like properties are reported. By engineering the hierarchical structures, synthetic hydrogel materials can be enabled with the lobster&#8208;underbelly&#8208;like combinational properties, including high ballistic resistance, toughness, strength, water content, and superior softness.








Abstract
With the strengthening capacity through harnessing multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale structural hierarchy, synthetic hydrogels hold tremendous promise as a low&#8208;cost and abundant material for applications demanding unprecedented mechanical robustness. However, integrating high impact resistance and high water content, yet superior softness, in a single hydrogel material still remains a grand challenge. Here, a simple, yet effective, strategy involving bidirectional freeze&#8208;casting and compression&#8208;annealing is reported, leading to a hierarchically structured hydrogel material. Rational engineering of the distinct 2D&#160;lamellar structures, well&#8208;defined nanocrystalline domains and robust interfacial interaction among the lamellae, synergistically contributes to a record&#8208;high ballistic energy absorption capability (i.e., 2.1 kJ m&#8722;1), without sacrificing their high water content (i.e., 85 wt%) and superior softness. Together with its low&#8208;cost and extraordinary energy dissipation capacity, the hydrogel materials present a durable alternative to conventional hydrogel materials for armor&#8208;like protection&#160;circumstances.

         <title>Targeting Theranostics of Atherosclerosis by Dual&#8208;Responsive Nanoplatform via Photoacoustic Imaging and Three&#8208;In&#8208;One Integrated Lipid Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Atherosclerosis, as a life&#8208;threatening cardiovascular disease with chronic inflammation and abnormal lipid enrichment, is often difficult to treat timely due to the lack of obvious symptoms. In this work, a theranostic nanoplatform is constructed for the noninvasive in vivo diagnosis, plaque&#8208;formation inhibition and the lesion reversal of atherosclerosis. A three&#8208;in&#8208;one therapeutic complex is constructed and packaged along with a polymeric photoacoustic probe into nanoparticles named as PLCDP@PMH, which indicates an atherosclerosis&#8208;targeting accumulation and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) dual&#8208;responsive degradation. The photoacoustic probe suggests a lesion specific imaging on atherosclerotic mice with accurate and distinct recognition of plaques. At the same time, the three&#8208;in&#8208;one complex performs an integrated lipid management through the inhibition of macrophages M1&#8208;polarization, liver X receptor (LXR)&#8208;mediated up&#8208;regulation of ATP&#8208;binding cassette transporter A1/G1 (ABCA1/G1) and the cyclodextrin&#8208;assisted lipid dissolution, which lead to the reduced lipid uptake, enhanced lipid efflux, and actuated lipid removal. The in vivo evaluations reveal that PLCDP@PMH can suppress the lesion progression and further reverse the formed plaques under a diet without high&#8208;fat. Hence, PLCDP@PMH provides a candidate for the theranostics of early&#8208;stage atherosclerosis and delivers an impressive potential on the reversal of formed atherosclerotic lesions.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal nanozyme&#8208;based microneedle patch FGO@MN is fabricated for eliminating refractory bacterial biofilm infections. FGO@MN disrupts the bacterial biofilm heat&#8208;shock response and induces ferroptosis&#8208;like death in bacterial biofilm. Simultaneously, the suppressed neutrophils in biofilm microenvironment acquire iron nutrition to reactivate antibiofilm immune response. This dual&#8208;modulation of iron metabolism by FGO@MN is referred to as a novel iron&#8208;actuated Janus ion therapy.








Abstract
Owing to high antibiotic resistance and thermotolerance, bacterial biofilm infections (BBIs) are refractory to elimination. Iron is essential for bacterial growth and metabolism, and bacteria can thus accumulate iron from surrounding cells to maintain biofilm formation and survival. Consequently, iron deficiency in the biofilm microenvironment (BME) leads to the functional failure of innate immune cells. Herein, a novel antibiofilm strategy of iron&#8208;actuated Janus ion therapy (IJIT) is proposed to regulate iron metabolism in both bacterial biofilm and immune cells. A BME&#8208;responsive photothermal microneedle patch (FGO@MN) is synthesized by the growth of Fe3O4&#160;nanoparticles on graphene oxide nanosheets and then encapsulated in methacrylated hyaluronic acid needle tips. The catalytic product of &#183;OH by FGO@MN in BME disrupts the bacterial heat&#8208;shock proteins, coercing biofilm thermal sensitization. As synergistic mild photothermal treatment triggers iron uptake, the intracellular iron overload further induces ferroptosis&#8208;like death. Moreover, iron&#8208;nourished neutrophils around BME can be rejuvenated for reactivating the suppressed antibiofilm function. Thus, more than 95% BBIs elimination can be achieved by combining heat stress&#8208;triggered iron interference with iron&#8208;nutrient immune reactivation. Furthermore, in vivo experiments validate the scavenging of refractory BBI after 15&#160;days, suggesting the promising perspective of IJIT in future clinical application.

         <title>Natural Shaping of Acellular Dermal Matrices for Implant&#8208;based Breast Reconstruction via Expansile Kirigami</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
To complete a successful and aesthetic breast reconstruction for breast cancer survivors, tissue reinforcing acellular dermal matrices (ADMs) are widely utilized to create slings/pockets to keep breast implants or autologous tissue transfer secured against the chest wall in the desired location. However, ADM sheets are two&#8208;dimensional, and cannot completely cover the entire implant without wrinkles. Here, guided by finite element modeling, we present a kirigami strategy to cut the ADM sheets with locally and precisely controlled stretchability, curvature, and elasticity. Upon expansion, a single kirigami ADM sheet can conformally wrap the implant regardless of the shape and size, forming a natural teardrop shape; contour cuts prescribe the topographical height and fractal cuts in the center ensures horizontal expandability and thus conformability. Our kirigami ADM could provide support to the reconstructed breast in the desired regions, potentially offering optimal outcomes and patient&#8208;specific reconstruction, while minimizing operative time and cost.

         <title>Entropy stabilization strategy for enhancing the local structural adaptability of Li&#8208;rich cathode materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Layered Li&#8208;rich cathode materials with high reversible energy densities are becoming prevalent. However, owing to the activation of low&#8208;potential redox couples and the progressively irreversible structural transformation caused by the local adjustment of transition&#8208;metal ions in the intra/interlayer driven by anionic redox, continuous capacity degradation and voltage decay emerge, thus greatly reducing the energy density and increasing the difficulty of battery system management. Herein, layered Li&#8208;rich cathode materials with higher intralayer configuration entropy have more local structural diversity and higher distortion energy, resulting in superior local structural adaptability with no drastic redox couple evolution, major local structural adjustment, or obvious layered&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase transition. Consequently, the energy retention of the entropy&#8208;stabilization&#8208;strategy&#8208;enhanced Li&#8208;rich cathode materials is almost twice that of a typical Li&#8208;rich cathode material (Li1.20Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2, T&#8208;LRM) after 3 months of cyclic testing. Moreover, when cycled at 1C, the voltage degradation per cycle is less than 0.02%, i.e., it results in a voltage loss of only 0.8&#160;mV per cycle, which is excellent performance. This study paves the way for the development of Li&#8208;rich cathode materials with stabilized intralayer atomic arrangements and high local structural adaptability.

         <title>A highly Efficacious Electrical Biofilm Treatment System for Combating Chronic Wound Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biofilm infection has a high prevalence in chronic wounds and can delay wound healing. Current treatments using repeated debridement and long&#8208;term antibiotic administration impose a significant burden on patients and healthcare systems. To address their limitations, we describe a highly efficacious electrical anti&#8208;biofilm system in this paper. Our system uses high&#8208;intensity current (75&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) to completely debride biofilm above the wound surface and enhance antibiotic delivery and penetration into biofilm&#8208;infected wounds simultaneously. Combining these two effects, our system uses short treatments (&#8804; 2&#160;h) to reduce bacterial count of MRSA biofilm&#8208;infected ex vivo skin wounds from over 1010 CFU g&#8722;1 to 105.2 CFU g&#8722;1. Taking advantage of the hydrogel ionic circuit design, our system enhances the in vivo safety of high&#8208;intensity current application compared to conventional devices. The in vivo anti&#8208;biofilm efficacy of our system is tested using a diabetic mouse&#8208;based wound infection model. MRSA biofilm bacterial count decreases from 109.0 CFU g&#8722;1 to 104.6 CFU g&#8722;1 at 1&#8208;day post&#8208;treatment and to 103.3 g&#8722;1 at 7&#8208;day post&#8208;treatment, both of which are below the clinical threshold for infection. Overall, our novel technology provides a quick, safe, yet highly efficacious treatment to chronic wound biofilm infection and will facilitate wound healing process.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Functionalized Germananes: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In the realm of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered materials, the monoelemental group 14 Xene, germanene, as the germanium analog of graphene, has emerged as the next prospective candidate. Preceded by silicon, germanium is widely used in the semiconductor industry; thus, germanene is deemed compatible with existing semiconductor technologies. Germanene consists of mixed sp2&#8722;sp3&#8208;hybridized networks in a buckled hexagonal honeycomb structure. Chemical exfoliation of Zintl phases, such as CaGe2, specifically the topotactical deintercalation in acidic media, removes the alkaline earth metal ions Ca2+, giving rise to layered germanane (germanene with the Ge centers covalently saturated with terminal hydrogen atoms). Diverse variants of functionalized germananes (with covalent group(s) termination) can be obtained by varying the topotactical deintercalation precursors, elevating the game with limitless functionalization possibilities for customizable properties or new functionalities. We comprehensively cover the preparation of Zintl phases to the details of functionalized and modified germananes and their properties, and the additional exfoliation step to achieve mono&#8208; or few&#8208;layer germananes. We review the progress and challenges of 2D functionalized germananes in optoelectronics, catalysis, energy conversion and storage, sensors, and biomedical areas. This review provides insight into designing and exploring this class of atomically thin semiconductors in realizing future nanoarchitectonics.

         <title>Optical Signal Modulation in Photonic Waveguiding Heteroarchitectures with Continuously Variable Visible&#8208;To&#8208;Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Color</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An input&#8208;to&#8208;output photonic logic gate is fabricated based on supramolecular heterostructures by phosphorescent Pt, Pd, Au, and Cu organometallic complexes. It is based on the optical waveguiding effect and efficient energy transfer among different blocks. The photonic logic gates show high emission anisotropy, low optical waveguiding loss, and continuously varied emission colors in the visible&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared spectral region.








Abstract
Photonic circuit systems based on optical waveguiding heteroarchitectures have attracted considerable interest owing to their potential to overcome the speed limitation in electronic circuits by modulating the optical signal at the micro&#8208; or nanoscale. However, controlling the parameters, including the wavelength and polarization of the light outcoupling, as well as the sequence among different building blocks, remains a key issue. Herein, supramolecular heteroarchitectures made by phosphorescent organometallic complexes of Pt, Pd, Cu, and Au are applied as photonic logic gates that show continuously variable emission colors from 475 to 810&#160;nm, low waveguide losses down to 0.0077&#160;dB&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1, and remarkable excitation&#8208;light polarization&#8208;dependent photoluminescence with anisotropy ratios up to 0.68. The sequences among Pt, Pd, Au, and Cu building blocks in the heteroarchitectures are controlled by living supramolecular polymerization or crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly synthetic approaches. The results indicate the prospects for using organometallic complexes and supramolecular synthetic approaches to prepare photonic circuit systems with tunable emission color and controllable sequences among different blocks that achieve modulation of the optical signal in the visible&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared spectral region.

&lt;p&gt;An input-to-output photonic logic gate is fabricated based on supramolecular heterostructures by phosphorescent Pt, Pd, Au, and Cu organometallic complexes. It is based on the optical waveguiding effect and efficient energy transfer among different blocks. The photonic logic gates show high emission anisotropy, low optical waveguiding loss, and continuously varied emission colors in the visible-to-near-infrared spectral region.

         <title>Confinement&#8208;Driven Inverse Domain Scaling in Polycrystalline ErMnO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycrystalline ErMnO3 displays an anomalous domain size/grain size scaling behavior in comparison to classical ferroelectric materials, such as BaTiO3 or Pb(Zr,Ti)O3. The fundamental difference is due to the formation of topologically protected vortex/anti&#8208;vortex pairs in polycrystalline ErMnO3 and their interaction with elastic strain fields.








Abstract
The research on topological phenomena in ferroelectric materials has revolutionized the way people understand polar order. Intriguing examples are polar skyrmions, vortex/anti&#8208;vortex structures, and ferroelectric incommensurabilties, which promote emergent physical properties ranging from electric&#8208;field&#8208;controllable chirality to negative capacitance effects. Here, the impact of topologically protected vortices on the domain formation in improper ferroelectric ErMnO3 polycrystals is studied, demonstrating inverted domain scaling behavior compared to classical ferroelectrics. It is observed that as the grain size increases, smaller domains are formed. Phase field simulations reveal that elastic strain fields drive the annihilation of vortex/anti&#8208;vortex pairs within the grains and individual vortices at the grain boundaries. The inversion of the domain scaling behavior has far&#8208;reaching implications, providing fundamentally new opportunities for topology&#8208;based domain engineering and the tuning of the electromechanical and dielectric performance of ferroelectrics in general.

         <title>Etching Bulk Covalent Organic Frameworks into Nanoparticles of Uniform and Controllable Size by the Molecular Exchange Etching Method for Sonodynamic and Immune Combination Antitumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new preparation strategy for nanoscale covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is reported, and this strategy only needs to slightly extend the commonly used COF preparation process to prepare COF nanoparticles, which is suitable for different types of imine COFs. The nanoscale COF sonosensitizer is applied for enhanced sonodynamic therapy and immunotherapy.








Abstract
To improve the therapeutic effect of sonodynamic therapy (SDT), more effective and stable sonosensitizers and therapeutic strategies are still required. A covalent organic framework (COF) sonosensitizer is developed by using a new nanoscale COF preparation strategy. This strategy uses molecular etching based on the imine exchange reaction to etch the bulk COF into nanoparticles and has universal applicability to imine&#8208;bond&#8208;based COF. The regular COF structure can prevent the loss of sonodynamic performance caused by the aggregation of porphyrin molecules and improve the chemical stability of the porphyrin unit. In addition, the coordination of Fe3+ to COF endows the nanoparticle with chemodynamic therapy performance and glutathione consumption ability. The combination of enhanced SDT and &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody achieves a good antitumor effect. The innovative nanoscale COF sonosensitizer preparation strategy provides a new avenue for clinical antitumor therapy.

         <title>Observation of H2 Evolution and Electrolyte Diffusion on MoS2 Monolayer by In Situ Liquid&#8208;Phase Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ electrochemical liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM) facilitates real&#8208;time observation of the H2 evolution reaction (HER) on MoS2 monolayer. Time&#8208;series LPTEM shows sequential activation, H2 bubble formation, and electrolyte flow on different types of catalytic active sites. Directionality of H2 bubbling and competitive wetting between the bubbles and electrolyte on catalyst surface significantly affect the HER activity of the&#160;active sites.








Abstract
Unit&#8208;cell&#8208;thick MoS2 is a promising electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) owing to its tunable catalytic activity, which is determined based on the energetics and molecular interactions of different types of HER active sites. Kinetic responses of MoS2 active sites, including the reaction onset, diffusion of the electrolyte and H2 bubbles, and continuation of these processes, are important factors affecting the catalytic activity of MoS2. Investigating these factors requires a direct real&#8208;time analysis of the HER occurring on spatially independent active sites. Herein, the H2 evolution and electrolyte diffusion on the surface of MoS2 are observed in real time by in situ electrochemical liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM). Time&#8208;dependent LPTEM observations reveal that different types of active sites are sequentially activated under the same conditions. Furthermore, the electrolyte flow to these sites is influenced by the reduction potential and site geometry, which affects the bubble detachment and overall HER activity of MoS2.

         <title>Bioactive Iridium Nanoclusters with Glutathione Depletion Ability for Enhanced Sonodynamic&#8208;Triggered Ferroptosis&#8208;Like Cancer Cell Death</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioactive HCIr nanocluster is reported for triggering effective ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cell death via triggering GPX4 inhibition and concurrent dual sonodynamic effect by iridium oxide nanoclusters and chlorin e6 (Ce6). These HCIr nanoclusters hold a great promise as a ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agent for treating intrinsic apoptotic resistance of tumors, and the findings provide a promising strategy for future studies exploring nanoclusters as anticancer agents.








Abstract
Ferroptosis is a regulated form of necrotic cell death that involves the accumulation of lipid peroxide (LPO) species in an iron&#8208; and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;dependent manner. Previous investigations have reported&#160;that ferroptosis&#8208;based cancer therapy can overcome the limitations of traditional therapeutics targeting the apoptosis pathway. However, it is still challenging to enhance the antitumor efficacy of ferroptosis due to intrinsic cellular regulation. In this study, a ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agent, i.e., chlorin e6 (Ce6)&#8208;conjugated human serum albumin&#8211;iridium oxide (HSA&#8208;Ce6&#8208;IrO2, HCIr) nanoclusters, is developed to achieve sonodynamic therapy (SDT)&#8208;triggered ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cell death. The sonosensitizing role of both Ce6 and IrO2 within the HCIr nanoclusters exhibits highly efficient 1O2 generation capacity upon ultrasound&#160;stimulation, which promotes the accumulation of LPO and subsequently induces ferroptosis. Meanwhile, the HCIr can deplete glutathione (GSH) by accelerating Ir (IV)&#8211;Ir (III) transition, which further suppresses the activity of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) to enhance the ferroptosis efficacy. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, it is demonstrated that HCIr possesses tremendous capacity to reduce the intracellular GSH content, which enhances SDT&#8208;triggered ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cell death. Thus, an iridium&#8208;nanoclusters&#8208;based ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agent is developed, providing a promising strategy for inducing ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cell death.

&#8220;Label&#8208;free sINgle&#8208;cell tracKing of 2D matErials by mass cytometry and MIBI&#8208;TOF Design&#8221; (LINKED) is a multiplexed label&#8208;free single&#8208;cell detection strategy enabling nanomaterial tracking and simultaneous measurement of multiple cell and tissue features. MXenes are designed to be detected within the mass cytometry range. Their detection and quantification are demonstrated in 15 human immune cell subpopulations and in different organs.








Abstract
There is a critical unmet need to detect and image 2D&#160;materials within single cells and tissues while surveying a high degree of information from single cells. Here, a versatile multiplexed label&#8208;free single&#8208;cell detection strategy is proposed based on single&#8208;cell mass cytometry by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (CyTOF) and ion&#8208;beam imaging by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (MIBI&#8208;TOF). This strategy, &#8220;Label&#8208;free sINgle&#8208;cell tracKing of 2D matErials by mass cytometry and MIBI&#8208;TOF Design&#8221; (LINKED), enables nanomaterial detection and simultaneous measurement of multiple cell and tissue features. As a proof of concept, a set of 2D materials, transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides (MXenes), is selected to ensure mass detection within the cytometry range while avoiding overlap with more than 70 currently available tags, each able to survey multiple biological parameters. First, their detection and quantification in 15 primary human immune cell subpopulations are demonstrated. Together with the detection, mass cytometry is used to capture several biological aspects of MXenes, such as their biocompatibility and cytokine production after their uptake. Through enzymatic labeling, MXenes&#8217; mediation of cell&#8211;cell interactions is simultaneously evaluated. In vivo biodistribution experiments using a mixture of MXenes in mice confirm the versatility of the detection strategy and reveal MXene accumulation in the liver, blood, spleen, lungs, and relative immune cell subtypes. Finally, MIBI&#8208;TOF is applied to detect MXenes in different organs revealing their spatial distribution. The label&#8208;free detection of 2D materials by mass cytometry at the single&#8208;cell level, on multiple cell subpopulations and in multiple organs simultaneously, will enable exciting new opportunities in biomedicine.

         <title>Novel (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) Nonbonding Active Structures on Defective Carbon from Oxygen&#8208;Rich Coal Tar Pitch for Efficient HER and ORR</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel atomic&#8208;scale (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active structure is designed and constructed by anchoring Pt single atoms and Co atomic clusters in defective carbon supports derived from oxygen&#8208;rich coal tar pitch. The (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active sites exhibit excellent catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction. The mass activity is far superior to commercial 20% Pt/C.








Abstract
Atomic&#8208;scale utilization and coordination structure of Pt electrocatalyst is extremely crucial to decrease loading mass and maximize activity for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs). A novel atomic&#8208;scale (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active structure is designed and constructed by anchoring Pt single atoms and Co atomic clusters on the defective carbon derived from oxygen&#8208;rich coal tar pitch (CTP). The Pt loading mass is extremely low and only 0.56&#160;wt%. A new nonbonding interaction phenomenon between Pt&#8208;Ox and Co&#8208;Oy is found and confirmed based on X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Based on the (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active structure, surface chemical field coupling with electrocatalysis for the HER and ORR is confirmed. It is found that the (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active structure exhibits high mass activities of 64.4 A cm&#8722;2 mgPt&#8722;1 (at an overpotential of 100&#160;mV) and 7.2 A cm&#8722;2 mgPt&#8722;1 (at 0.8&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) for the HER and ORR, respectively. The values are 6.5 and 11.6 times as much as those of commercial 20% Pt/C. The work provides innovative insight to design and understand efficient active sites of atomic&#8208;scale Pt on oxygen&#8208;rich CTP&#8208;derived carbon supports for electrocatalysis.

         <title>Readily Accessible Metallic Micro&#8208;Island Arrays for High&#8208;Performance Metal Oxide Thin&#8208;Film Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IGZO) TFT performance can be substantially enhanced by placing aluminum micro&#8208;island arrays (Al&#8208;MIAs) directly on top of the IGZO back channel. The MIA channel coverages/dimensions can be readily optimized by vapor depositing Al through tailored honeycomb cinnamate&#8208;cellulose film shadow masks, demonstrating the great versatility of this route to enhance metal oxide thin&#8208;film&#8208;transistor performance.








Abstract
Thin&#8208;film transistors using metal oxide semiconductors are essential in many unconventional electronic devices. Nevertheless, further advances will be necessary to broaden their technological appeal. Here, a new strategy is reported to achieve high&#8208;performance solution&#8208;processed metal oxide thin&#8208;film transistors (MOTFTs) by introducing a metallic micro&#8208;island array (M&#8208;MIA) on top of the MO back channel, where the MO is a&#8208;IGZO (amorphous indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide). Here Al&#8208;MIAs are fabricated using honeycomb cinnamate cellulose films, created by a scalable breath&#8208;figure method, as a shadow mask. For IGZO TFTs, the electron mobility (&#181;e) increases from &#8776;3.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 to near 15.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for optimal Al&#8208;MIA dimension/coverage of 1.25 &#181;m/51%. The Al&#8208;MIA IGZO TFT performance is superior to that of controls using compact/planar Al layers (Al&#8208;PL TFTs) and Au&#8208;MIAs with the same channel coverage. Kelvin probe force microscopy and technology computer&#8208;aided design simulations reveal that charge transfer occurs between the Al and the IGZO channel which is optimized for specific Al&#8208;MIA dimensions/surface channel coverages. Furthermore, such Al&#8208;MIA IGZO TFTs with a high&#8208;k fluoride&#8208;doped alumina dielectric exhibit a maximum &#181;e of &gt;50.2 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 . This is the first demonstration of a micro&#8208;structured MO semiconductor heterojunction with submicrometer resolution metallic arrays for enhanced transistor performance and broad applicability to other devices.

         <title>Magnetic Ordering in a High&#8208;Spin Donor&#8211;Acceptor Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of organic materials that magnetically order at room temperature remains a grand challenge central to integrating spin, magnetic, and quantum mechanical effects within emerging technologies. This work demonstrates that long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;correlations within a high&#8208;spin conjugated polymer provide a viable path toward spin&#8208;center generation, robust intermolecular exchange interactions, anisotropic spin ordering at elevated temperatures, and high chemical stability.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;The development of organic materials that magnetically order at room temperature remains a grand challenge central to integrating spin, magnetic, and quantum mechanical effects within emerging technologies. This work demonstrates that long-range &#960;-correlations within a high-spin conjugated polymer provide a viable path toward spin-center generation, robust intermolecular exchange interactions, anisotropic spin ordering at elevated temperatures, and high chemical stability.

         <title>Synthetic Nanoarchitectonics of Functional Organic&#8211;Inorganic 2D Germanane Heterostructures via Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; synthetic approach is devised for covalently anchoring thiol&#8208;rich organic nanomaterials (i.e., carbon dots) onto commercially available 2D allyl germanane via the thiol&#8211;ene click reaction. Remarkably, the implanted characteristics provide new physicochemical features to the resulting 0D/2D heterostructure, making possible its implementation in yet unexplored optoelectronic tasks that are inaccessible to the pristine 2D germanane counterpart.








Abstract
Succeeding graphene, 2D inorganic materials made of reactive van der Waals layers, like 2D germanane (2D&#8208;Ge) derivatives, have attracted great attention because their physicochemical characteristics can be entirely tuned by modulating the nature of the surface substituent. Although very interesting from a scientific point of view, almost all the reported works involving 2D&#8208;Ge derivatives are focused on computational studies. Herein, a first prototype of organic&#8211;inorganic 2D&#8208;Ge heterostructure has been synthesized by covalently anchoring thiol&#8208;rich carbon dots (CD&#8211;SH) onto 2D allyl germanane (2D&#8208;aGe) via a simple and green &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; click chemistry approach. Remarkably, the implanted characteristics of the carbon nanomaterial provide new physicochemical features to the resulting 0D/2D heterostructure, making possible its implementation in yet unexplored optoelectronic tasks&#8212;e.g., as a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensing system triggered by supramolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions&#8212;that are inaccessible for the pristine 2D&#8208;aGe counterpart. Consequently, this work builds a foundation toward the robust achievement of functional organic&#8211;inorganic 2D&#8208;Ge nanoarchitectonics through covalently assembling thiol&#8208;rich carbon nanoallotropes on commercially available 2D&#8208;aGe.

         <title>Ethylene&#8208;Carbonate&#8208;Free Electrolytes for Rechargeable Li&#8208;Ion Pouch Cells at Sub&#8208;Freezing Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of ethylene carbonate (EC)&#8208;free electrolytes, based on methyl acetate and fluorinated ethers, is proposed for Li&#8208;ion batteries operating at sub&#8208;freezing temperatures. The EC&#8208;free electrolyte demonstrates all&#8208;round performance advantages over the traditional EC&#8208;based electrolyte and presents a viable solution to improve the capacity retention and rechargeability of metal&#8208;ion batteries in cold climates.








Abstract
Sub&#8208;freezing temperature presents a significant challenge to the survival of current Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) as it leads to low capacity retention and poor cell rechargeability. The electrolyte in commercial LIBs relies too heavily on ethylene carbonate (EC) to produce a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite (Gr) anodes, but its high melting point (36.4&#160;&#176;C) severely restricts ion transport below 0&#160;&#176;C, causing energy loss and Li plating. Here, a class of EC&#8208;free electrolytes that exhibits remarkable low&#8208;temperature performance without compromising cell lifespan is reported. It is found that at sub&#8208;zero temperatures, EC forms highly resistive SEI that seriously impedes electrode kinetics, whereas EC&#8208;free electrolytes create a highly stable, low&#8208;impedance SEI through anion decomposition, which boosts capacity retention and eliminates Li plating during charging. Pouch&#8208;type LiCoO2 (LCO)|Gr cells with EC&#8208;free electrolytes sustain 900 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C with 1 C charge/discharge, and LiNi0.85Co0.10Al0.05O2 (NCA)|Gr cells last 300 cycles at &#8722;15&#160;&#176;C with 0.3&#160;C charge, both among the best&#8208;performing in the literature under comparable conditions. Even at &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C, the NCA|Gr cell with EC&#8208;free electrolytes still delivers 76% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity, outperforming EC&#8208;based electrolytes.

         <title>Spintronic Physical Unclonable Functions Based on Field&#8208;Free Spin&#8211;Orbit&#8208;Torque Switching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly reliable spintronic physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are demonstrated by exploiting field&#8208;free spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque switching in IrMn/CoFeB/Ta/CoFeB structures. The stochastic switching polarity of the top CoFeB is achieved by manipulating the exchange bias directions of the bottom IrMn/CoFeB. The spintronic PUF is characterized by high entropy, uniqueness, reconfigurability, digital output, a zero bit&#8208;error&#8208;rate under repetitive operations, and robustness against magnetic tempering.








Abstract
Physical unclonable function&#160;(PUFs) utilize inherent random physical variations of solid&#8208;state devices and are a core ingredient of hardware security primitives. PUFs promise more robust information security than that provided by the conventional software&#8208;based approaches. While silicon&#8208; and memristor&#8208;based PUFs are advancing, their reliability and scalability require further improvements. These are currently limited by output fluctuations and associated additional peripherals. Here, highly reliable spintronic PUFs that exploit field&#8208;free spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque switching in IrMn/CoFeB/Ta/CoFeB structures are demonstrated. It is shown that the stochastic switching polarity of the perpendicular magnetization of the top CoFeB can be achieved by manipulating the exchange bias directions of the bottom IrMn/CoFeB. This serves as an entropy source for the spintronic PUF, which is characterized by high entropy, uniqueness, reconfigurability, and digital output. Furthermore, the device ensures a zero bit&#8208;error&#8208;rate under repetitive operations and robustness against external magnetic fields, and offers scalable and energy&#8208;efficient device implementations.

         <title>Filamented Light (FLight) Biofabrication of Highly Aligned Tissue&#8208;Engineered Constructs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Filamented Light (FLight) biofabrication is a new technology for the rapid biofabrication of highly aligned tissue&#8208;engineered constructs, like muscle and tendon. The filamentation of a light beam into a cell&#8208;laden photoresin results in a material composed of micrometer&#8208;scale hydrogel filaments acting as cell guiding cues. Cell migration into ultrahigh aspect ratio (&gt;700:1) voids induces alignment of cells and deposition of extracellular matrix.








Abstract
Cell&#8208;laden hydrogels used in tissue engineering generally lack sufficient 3D&#160;topographical guidance for cells to mature into aligned tissues. A new strategy called filamented light (FLight) biofabrication rapidly creates hydrogels composed of unidirectional microfilament networks, with diameters on the length scale of single cells. Due to optical modulation instability, a light beam is divided optically into FLight beams. Local polymerization of a photoactive resin is triggered, leading to local increase in refractive index, which itself creates self&#8208;focusing waveguides and further polymerization of photoresin into long hydrogel microfilaments. Diameter and spacing of the microfilaments can be tuned from 2 to 30&#160;&#181;m by changing the coherence length of the light beam. Microfilaments show outstanding cell instructive properties with fibroblasts, tenocytes, endothelial cells, and myoblasts, influencing cell alignment, nuclear deformation, and extracellular matrix deposition. FLight is compatible with multiple types of photoresins and allows for biofabrication of centimeter&#8208;scale hydrogel constructs with excellent cell viability within seconds (&lt;10 s per construct). Multidirectional microfilaments are achievable within a single hydrogel construct by changing the direction of FLight projection, and complex multimaterial/multicellular tissue&#8208;engineered constructs are possible by sequentially exchanging the cell&#8208;laden photoresin.

     alt="Filamented Light (FLight) Biofabrication of Highly Aligned Tissue-Engineered Constructs"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filamented Light (FLight) biofabrication is a new technology for the rapid biofabrication of highly aligned tissue-engineered constructs, like muscle and tendon. The filamentation of a light beam into a cell-laden photoresin results in a material composed of micrometer-scale hydrogel filaments acting as cell guiding cues. Cell migration into ultrahigh aspect ratio (&amp;gt;700:1) voids induces alignment of cells and deposition of extracellular matrix.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cell-laden hydrogels used in tissue engineering generally lack sufficient 3D&#160;topographical guidance for cells to mature into aligned tissues. A new strategy called filamented light (FLight) biofabrication rapidly creates hydrogels composed of unidirectional microfilament networks, with diameters on the length scale of single cells. Due to optical modulation instability, a light beam is divided optically into FLight beams. Local polymerization of a photoactive resin is triggered, leading to local increase in refractive index, which itself creates self-focusing waveguides and further polymerization of photoresin into long hydrogel microfilaments. Diameter and spacing of the microfilaments can be tuned from 2 to 30&#160;&#181;m by changing the coherence length of the light beam. Microfilaments show outstanding cell instructive properties with fibroblasts, tenocytes, endothelial cells, and myoblasts, influencing cell alignment, nuclear deformation, and extracellular matrix deposition. FLight is compatible with multiple types of photoresins and allows for biofabrication of centimeter-scale hydrogel constructs with excellent cell viability within seconds (&amp;lt;10 s per construct). Multidirectional microfilaments are achievable within a single hydrogel construct by changing the direction of FLight projection, and complex multimaterial/multicellular tissue-engineered constructs are possible by sequentially exchanging the cell-laden photoresin. FLight offers a transformational approach to developing anisotropic tissues using photo-crosslinkable biomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Heavy&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>

Efficient In(Zn)As&#8211;In(Zn)P&#8211;GaP&#8211;ZnS colloidal quantum dot (CQD) light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) that operate with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 13.3% at 1006 nm are reported. The implementation of a thin hole&#8208;transporting poly(vinylcarbazole) (PVK) layer at the electron&#8208;injecting side of the device gives rise to improved charge balance and luminescence efficiencies.








Abstract
Short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) light emission is important for a diverse range of modern applications, such as eye&#8208;safe depth sensing, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), facial recognition, eye tracking, optical communication, and health&#8208;monitoring technologies. However, there are a very limited number of known semiconductors that can emit efficiently in the SWIR spectral range. Presently, SWIR light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on colloidal quantum dots (CQD) are dominated by lead chalcogenide systems, despite the presence of heavy metal and modest efficiencies. Here, a highly efficient SWIR LED based on heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free indium arsenide (InAs) core&#8211;shell CQDs is presented. In the LED design, the implementation of an otherwise hole&#8208;transporting poly(vinylcarbazole) (PVK) layer on the electron&#8208;injecting side of the device stack leads to a surprising enhancement in device performance, giving remarkably high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 13.3% at 1006 nm. Single&#8208;carrier device and optical investigations reveal the origins of enhancement to be the electronic decoupling of the CQD layer with the electron&#8208;injecting zinc oxide (ZnO) layer, which mitigates luminescence quenching and improves charge balance. This work marks one of the highest efficiencies reported for heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free solution&#8208;processed LEDs in the SWIR spectral region, and can find significant applications in emerging consumer electronic technologies.

         <title>Bimetallic Rechargeable Al/Zn Hybrid Aqueous Batteries Based on Al&#8211;Zn Alloys with Composite Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 5&#160;m Al(OTF)3&#160;+ 1&#160;m HOTF + 1&#160;m Zn(OTF)2 mixed electrolyte is designed in Al/Zn&#8211;MnO batteries. During charging&#8208;discharging, a topological transformation of MnO at the cathode avoids the collapse of the structure, the Al&#8211;Zn regional alloy at the anode avoids the corrosion of metal aluminum, and the intercalation of Zn ions makes it exhibit good electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Aluminum is abundant and exhibits a high theoretical capacity and volumetric energy density. Additionally, the high safety of aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries makes them strong candidates for large&#8208;scale energystorage systems. However, the frequent collapse of the cathode material and passive oxide film results in the difficult development of aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries. This work provides a novel battery system, namely, Al&#8211;Zn/Al(OTF)3+HOTF+Zn(OTF)2/AlxZnyMnO2&#183;nH2O, with a mixed electrolyte. The cathode applies MnO topology transformation to ensure that the cathode forms AlxMnO2&#183;nH2O. Topology transformation alters the structure of the cathode material so that Zn2+ can be intercalated into the AlxMnO2&#183;nH2O spinel structure to provide support for the material structure. Regarding the anode, Zn2+ in the electrolyte is deposited onto Al of the anode to produce a regional Al&#8211;Zn alloy. Zn2+ is reduced to Zn metal during discharging, which adds a platform for secondary discharge beneficial for battery capacity enhancement. This system can provide a 1.6&#160;V discharge platform, while the first cycle discharge can reach 554 mAh&#160;g&#8208;1, thereby maintaining a high capacity of 313 mAh&#160;g&#8208;1 after 100 cycles. This study provides a new idea for the further development of aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AAIBs).

         <title>Biomimetic Bacteriophage&#8208;Like Particles Formed from Probiotic Extracts and NO Donors for Eradicating Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Staphylococcus aureus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitric oxide (NO) donors are combined with probiotic extracts to form biomimetic phage&#8208;like microparticles, which are used to construct a dual&#8208;mode antibacterial hydrogel (DMAH) to meet different conditions. The DMAH can treat bacterial wounds through phage&#8208;like therapy in the dark. Meanwhile, DMAH can perform rapid disinfection through the synergistic photothermal/NO therapy under near&#8208;infrared light to cure infected wounds.








Abstract
Effectively clearing multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria through nonantibiotic treatments is crucial for the recovery of infected tissues in favorable biological environments. Herein, a thermally responsive donor of cell&#8208;messenger nitric oxide (NO) is combined with extracts of food&#8208;grade Lactobacillus casei to form biomimetic phage&#8208;like microparticles with a tailspike structure. These particles can invade bacterial membranes and release NO to disrupt nitrogen and respiratory metabolisms, which initiates the programmed death of multidrug&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) for inducing lysis, like the bacterial virus. Experiments suggest that these microparticles can also weaken bacterial toxicity and provide favorable conditions for cell proliferation because of the continuously released NO. By encapsulating these microparticles into graphene&#8208;oxide&#8208;doped polymers, a dual&#8208;mode antibacterial hydrogel (DMAH) can be constructed. In vivo results reveal that the DMAH achieves a long&#8208;time sterilization of MRSA with 99.84 &#177; 0.13% antibacterial rate in the dark because of the phage&#8208;like performance of the biomimetic microparticles. In its other antibacterial mode, DMAH subjected to 20&#160;min of near&#8208;infrared irradiation release NO, which, together with the photothermal effect, synergistically damages bacterial cell membranes to achieve very fast disinfection (97.13 &#177; 0.41% bactericidal rate). This multifunctional hydrogel can also significantly accelerate wound healing due to the phage&#8208;like particles.

         <title>Weakening the Solvating Power of Solvents to Encapsulate Lithium Polysulfides Enables Long&#8208;Cycling Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>

The large steric hindrance of its fluorohydrocarbon chains and the electron&#8208;withdrawing &#63743;CF2&#63743; segments endow 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether with prominently weak solvating power and high reduction stability. The weakening solvating power of fluorohydrocarbon solvent leads the formation of encapsulating&#8208;lithium polysulfide electrolyte for lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cells with long cycling lifespan.








Abstract
Long cycling lifespan is a prerequisite for practical lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries yet is restricted by side reactions between soluble polysulfides and the lithium&#8208;metal anode. The regulation on solvation structure of polysulfides renders encapsulating polysulfides electrolytes (EPSE) as a promising solution to suppress the parasitic reactions. The solvating power of the solvents in the outer solvent shell of lithium polysulfides is critical for the encapsulation effect of EPSE. Herein, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether&#160;(HFE) is demonstrated as a superior outer&#8208;shell solvent to construct EPSE.

The HFE&#8208;EPSE improves the lifespan from 54 to 135 cycles for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with an ultrathin lithium&#8208;metal anode (50&#160;&#181;m) and high&#8208;areal&#8208;loading sulfur cathode (4.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, a 334&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cell (2.4 Ah level) with HFE&#8208;EPSE stably undergoes 25 cycles.

&lt;p&gt;The large steric hindrance of its fluorohydrocarbon chains and the electron-withdrawing &lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt; segments endow 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl-2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl ether with prominently weak solvating power and high reduction stability. The weakening solvating power of fluorohydrocarbon solvent leads the formation of encapsulating-lithium polysulfide electrolyte for lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cells with long cycling lifespan.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long cycling lifespan is a prerequisite for practical lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries yet is restricted by side reactions between soluble polysulfides and the lithium-metal anode. The regulation on solvation structure of polysulfides renders encapsulating polysulfides electrolytes (EPSE) as a promising solution to suppress the parasitic reactions. The solvating power of the solvents in the outer solvent shell of lithium polysulfides is critical for the encapsulation effect of EPSE. Herein, 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl-2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl ether&#160;(HFE) is demonstrated as a superior outer-shell solvent to construct EPSE. Based on the&#160;large steric hindrance of the fluorohydrocarbon chains, the electron-withdrawing perfluoro segment (&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt; further endows HFE with prominently weak solvating power. The HFE-EPSE improves the lifespan from 54 to 135 cycles for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with an ultrathin lithium-metal anode (50&#160;&#181;m) and high-areal-loading sulfur cathode (4.4&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Furthermore, a 334&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cell (2.4 Ah level) with HFE-EPSE stably undergoes 25 cycles. This work demonstrates the role of weakening solvating power of outer-shell solvents to construct superior EPSE and inspires the significance of the solvation chemistry of polysulfides to achieve practical lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Active Protein Materials: Manipulation on Morphology of Salmon Calcitonin Assemblies with Enhanced Bone Regeneration Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to improve the relatively low stability and fast degradation of protein drugs is proposed. &#8220;Active protein materials&#8221; can be constructed by regulating the self&#8208;assembly property of the protein drug itself via a small&#8208;molecular regulator, that is, the protein drug is not only the active drug, but also the drug carrier, which greatly increases the drug&#8208;loading efficiency of the biomaterial.








Abstract
The effect of protein drugs is always limited by their relatively low stability and fast degradation property; thus, various elegant efforts have been made to improve the bioactivity and biocompatibility of the protein drugs. Here, an alternative way is proposed to solve this problem. By simply adding a limited amount of small&#8208;molecular regulator, which tunes the subtle balance of protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) and disulfide bond formation, the self&#8208;assembly property of the protein drug can be regulated, forming an &#8220;active protein material&#8221; itself. This means that, the resulting biomaterial is dominated by the protein drug and water, with significantly enhanced bone regeneration effect compared to the virgin protein in vitro and in vivo, through multivalent effect between the protein and receptor and the retarded degradation of the assembled proteins. In this active protein material, the protein drug is not only the active drug, but also the drug carrier, which greatly increases the drug&#8208;loading efficiency of the biomaterial, indicating the advantages of the easy preparation, high efficiency, and low cost of the active protein material with a bright future in biomedical applications.

An activity&#8208;based photosensitizer for targeting histone deacetylases (HDACs) is designed based on a quinoxalinone scaffold through a pharmacophore migration strategy. The developed activity&#8208;based photosensitizer can inhibit HDACs, and overcome hypoxia and intracellular oxidative resistance, realizing its full potential for malignant tumor treatment.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been a well&#8208;accepted clinical treatment for malignant tumors owing to its noninvasiveness and high spatiotemporal selectivity. However, the treatment outcome of current PDT applications is hindered by hypoxia and intracellular oxidative resistance of solid tumors. Recent studies have shown that inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) can induce cell ferroptosis, reverse hypoxia, and elevate oxidative status. Theoretically, the design and synthesis of activity&#8208;based photosensitizers that target HDACs can address the bottlenecks of PDT. Herein, the concept of an activity&#8208;based photosensitizer is presented for targeting HDACs, which is designed based on a quinoxalinone scaffold through a pharmacophore migration strategy. The developed activity&#8208;based photosensitizer can inhibit HDACs, and overcome hypoxia and intracellular oxidative resistance, realizing the full potential of photosensitizers for malignant tumor treatment. The molecular design strategy proposed in this project should provide theoretical guidance for the development of ideal photosensitizers for practical applications.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Graded Electrodes Mitigate the Mismatch between Mechanical Reliability and Energy Density for Foldable Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechano&#8208;graded electrodes with gradient&#8208;distributed maximum allowable strain are proposed to mitigate the mismatch between mechanical reliability and energy density for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The up&#8208;graded&#8208;electrode&#8208;based LIBs enable a remarkable figure of merit (FOM) value of 121.3 mWh cm&#8722;3, proving the brilliant comprehensive performance of flexible high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs.








Abstract
Flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy density are highly desirable for wearable electronics. However, difficult to achieve excellent flexibility and high energy density simultaneously via the current approaches for designing flexible LIBs. To mitigate the mismatch, mechano&#8208;graded electrodes with gradient&#8208;distributed maximum allowable strain are proposed to endow high&#8208;loading&#8208;mass slurry&#8208;coating electrodes with brilliant intrinsic flexibility without sacrificing energy density. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the up&#8208;graded LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 cathodes (&#8776;15&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, &#8776;70&#160;&#181;m) and graphite anodes (&#8776;8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, &#8776;105&#160;&#181;m) can tolerate an extremely low bending radius of 400 and 600&#160;&#181;m, respectively. Finite element analysis (FEA) reveals that, compared with conventionally homogeneous electrodes, the flexibility of the up&#8208;graded electrodes is enhanced by specifically strengthening the upper layer and avoiding crack initiation. Benefiting from this, the foldable pouch cell (required bending radius of &#8776;600&#160;&#181;m) successfully realizes a remarkable figure of merit (FOM, energy density vs bending radius) of 121.3 mWh cm&#8722;3. Moreover, the up&#8208;graded&#8208;electrodes&#8208;based pouch cells can deliver a stable power supply, even under various deformation modes, such as twisting, folding, and knotting. This work proposes new insights for harmonizing the mechanics and electrochemistry of energy storage devices to achieve high energy density under flexible extremes.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Unparalleled Strength and Supertoughness of Poly(urea&#8208;urethane) with Shape Memory and Clusterization&#8208;Triggered Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecularly engineered poly(urea&#8208;urethane) with unparalleled strength (&#8776;84.2&#160;MPa) and supertoughness (&#8776;322.8&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3) that&#160;simultaneously features shape&#8208;memory effects, fatigue resistance, and clusterization&#8208;triggered emission properties,&#160;by regulating the reversible microphase&#8208;separation structure composed of the rigid unit and multiple hydrogen bonds and molecular weight of soft segment, is reported.








Abstract
To address the challenge of realizing multifunctional polymers simultaneously exhibiting high strength and high toughness through molecular engineering, ultrastrong and supertough shape&#8208;memory poly(urea&#8208;urethane) (PUU) is fabricated by regulating: i) the reversible cross&#8208;links composed of rigid units and multiple hydrogen bonds, and ii) the molecular weight of soft segments. The optimal material exhibits an unparalleled strength of 84.2&#160;MPa at a large elongation at a break of 925.6%, a superior toughness of 322.8&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, and remarkable fatigue resistance without fracture. The repeated stretching of this material induces an irreversible deformation, which, however, can be rapidly recovered by heating. Moreover, all samples are capable of temporary shape fixation at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C (recovering the original shape at 30&#160;&#176;C) and exhibit blue fluorescence when excited at the optimum wavelength, which is ascribed to clusterization&#8208;triggered emission (CTE) due to the formation of microphase&#8208;separation structures. Thus, the adopted approach provides a solution to a long&#8208;standing problem and paves the way to the realization of intrinsically luminescent shape&#8208;memory materials exhibiting both ultrahigh strength and ultrahigh toughness.

     alt="Molecularly Engineered Unparalleled Strength and Supertoughness of Poly(urea-urethane) with Shape Memory and Clusterization-Triggered Emission"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A molecularly engineered poly(urea-urethane) with unparalleled strength (&#8776;84.2&#160;MPa) and supertoughness (&#8776;322.8&#160;MJ&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;) that&#160;simultaneously features shape-memory effects, fatigue resistance, and clusterization-triggered emission properties,&#160;by regulating the reversible microphase-separation structure composed of the rigid unit and multiple hydrogen bonds and molecular weight of soft segment, is reported.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address the challenge of realizing multifunctional polymers simultaneously exhibiting high strength and high toughness through molecular engineering, ultrastrong and supertough shape-memory poly(urea-urethane) (PUU) is fabricated by regulating: i) the reversible cross-links composed of rigid units and multiple hydrogen bonds, and ii) the molecular weight of soft segments. The optimal material exhibits an unparalleled strength of 84.2&#160;MPa at a large elongation at a break of 925.6%, a superior toughness of 322.8&#160;MJ&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and remarkable fatigue resistance without fracture. The repeated stretching of this material induces an irreversible deformation, which, however, can be rapidly recovered by heating. Moreover, all samples are capable of temporary shape fixation at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C (recovering the original shape at 30&#160;&#176;C) and exhibit blue fluorescence when excited at the optimum wavelength, which is ascribed to clusterization-triggered emission (CTE) due to the formation of microphase-separation structures. Thus, the adopted approach provides a solution to a long-standing problem and paves the way to the realization of intrinsically luminescent shape-memory materials exhibiting both ultrahigh strength and ultrahigh toughness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polarization Topology at the Nominally Charged Domain Walls in Uniaxial Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polarization domains in uniaxial ferroelectrics acquire a remarkable topological configuration of branching and crisscrossing domains. The domains are separated by the united domain wall spreading all over the sample and containing saddle&#8208;like singular nodes.








Abstract
Ferroelectric domain walls provide a fertile environment for novel materials physics. If a polarization discontinuity arises, it can drive a redistribution of electronic carriers and changes in band structure, which often result in emergent 2D conductivity. If such a discontinuity is not tolerated, then its amelioration usually involves the formation of complex topological patterns, such as flux&#8208;closure domains, dipolar vortices, skyrmions, merons, or Hopfions. The degrees of freedom required for the development of such patterns, in which dipolar rotation is a hallmark, are readily found in multiaxial ferroelectrics. In uniaxial ferroelectrics, where only two opposite polar orientations are possible, it has been assumed that discontinuities are unavoidable when antiparallel components of polarization meet. This perception has been borne out by the appearance of charged conducting domain walls in systems such as hexagonal manganites and lithium niobate. Here, experimental and theoretical investigations on lead germanate (Pb5Ge3O11) reveal that polar discontinuities can be obviated at head&#8208;to&#8208;head and tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail domain walls by mutual domain bifurcation along two different axes, creating a characteristic saddle&#8208;point domain wall morphology and associated novel dipolar topology, removing the need for screening charge accumulation and associated conductivity enhancement.

         <title>A Versatile Molten&#8208;Salt Induction Strategy to Achieve Efficient CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells with a High Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage &gt;1.2 V</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature molten salt dimethylamine acetate is developed as the solvent for precursor solutions, which also regulates the phase conversion process of the CsPbI3 film. Consequently, 1.25 V of the open&#8208;circuit voltage and &gt;21% power conversion efficiency are achieved, which is the record highest for CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells reported so far.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite has emerged as an important photovoltaic material due to its high thermal stability and suitable bandgap for tandem devices. Currently, the cell performance of CsPbI3 solar cells is mainly subject to a large open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit. Herein, a multifunctional room&#8208;temperature molten salt, dimethylamine acetate (DMAAc) is demonstrated, which not only directly acts as a solvent for precursor solutions, but also regulates the phase conversion process of the CsPbI3 film for high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaics. DMAAc can stabilize the DMAPbI3 structure and eliminate the Cs4PbI6 intermediate phase, which is easily spatially segregated. Meanwhile, a new homogeneous intermediate phase DMAPb(I,Ac)3 is formed, which finally affords high&#8208;quality CsPbI3 films. With this approach, the charge capture activity of defects in the CsPbI3 film is significantly suppressed. Consequently, a VOC of 1.25&#160;V and &gt;21% power conversion efficiency are achieved, which is the record highest reported thus far. This intermediate phase&#8208;regulation strategy is believed to be applicable to other perovskite material systems.

         <title>Understanding H2 Evolution Electrochemistry to Minimize Solvated Water Impact on Zinc&#8208;Anode Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a combined gas chromatography experiment and computation, it is demonstrated that H2 evolution primarily originates from solvated water, rather than free water without interaction with Zn2+. Using linear sweep voltammetry in salt electrolytes, H2 evolution is evidenced to occur at a more negative potential than zinc reduction because of the high overpotential against H2 evolution on Zn metal. The hypothesis is tested and using glycine additive to reduce solvated water, and it is confirmed that H2 evolution and &#8220;parasitic&#8221; side reactions are suppressed on the Zn anode.








Abstract
H2 evolution is the reason for poor reversibility and limited cycle stability with Zn&#8208;metal anodes, and impedes practical application in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Here, using a combined gas chromatography experiment and computation, it is demonstrated that H2 evolution primarily originates from solvated water, rather than free water without interaction with Zn2+. Using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in salt electrolytes, H2 evolution is evidenced to occur at a more negative potential than zinc reduction because of the high overpotential against H2 evolution on Zn metal. The hypothesis is tested and, using a glycine additive to reduce solvated water, it is confirmed that H2 evolution and &#8220;parasitic&#8221; side reactions are suppressed on the Zn anode. This electrolyte additive is evidenced to suppress H2 evolution, reduce corrosion, and give a uniform Zn deposition in Zn|Zn and Zn|Cu cells. It is demonstrated that Zn|PANI (highly conductive polyaniline) full cells exhibit boosted electrochemical performance in 1&#160;M ZnSO4&#8211;3&#160;M glycine electrolyte. It is concluded that this new understanding of electrochemistry of H2 evolution can be used for design of relatively low&#8208;cost and safe AZIBs for practical large&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>Multiphase Morphology with Enhanced Carrier Lifetime via Quaternary Strategy Enables High&#8208;Efficiency, Thick&#8208;Film, and Large&#8208;Area Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quaternary strategy is used to achieve desirable carrier behaviors and optimized multiphase morphology; thus, the device shows an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.32% (certified 19.35%). Furthermore, the device with &#8776;300&#160;nm&#8208;thick film shows a high efficiency of 17.55%, and the large&#8208;area devices (1.05 and 72.25 cm2) deliver encouraging PCEs of 18.25% and 12.20%, which are among the highest values reported so far.








Abstract
With the continuous breakthrough of the efficiency of&#160;organic photovoltaics (OPVs), their practical applications are on the agenda. However, the thickness tolerance and upscaling in recently reported high&#8208;efficiency devices remains challenging. In this work, the multiphase morphology and desired carrier behaviors are realized by utilizing a quaternary strategy. Notably, the exciton separation, carrier mobility, and carrier lifetime are enhanced significantly, the carrier recombination and the energy loss (Eloss) are reduced, thus beneficial for a higher short&#8208;circuit density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of the quaternary system. Moreover, the intermixing&#8208;phase size is optimized, which is favorable for constructing the thick&#8208;film and large&#8208;area devices. Finally, the device with a 110&#160;nm&#8208;thick active layer shows an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.32% (certified 19.35%). Furthermore, the large&#8208;area (1.05 and 72.25 cm2) devices with 110&#160;nm thickness present PCEs of 18.25% and 12.20%, and the device with a 305&#160;nm&#8208;thick film (0.0473 cm2) delivers a PCE of 17.55%, which are among the highest values reported. The work demonstrates the potential of the quaternary strategy for large&#8208;area and thick&#8208;film OPVs and promotes the practical application of OPVs in the future.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the continuous breakthrough of the efficiency of&#160;organic photovoltaics (OPVs), their practical applications are on the agenda. However, the thickness tolerance and upscaling in recently reported high-efficiency devices remains challenging. In this work, the multiphase morphology and desired carrier behaviors are realized by utilizing a quaternary strategy. Notably, the exciton separation, carrier mobility, and carrier lifetime are enhanced significantly, the carrier recombination and the energy loss (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;loss&lt;/sub&gt;) are reduced, thus beneficial for a higher short-circuit density (&lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;), fill factor (FF), and open-circuit voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;) of the quaternary system. Moreover, the intermixing-phase size is optimized, which is favorable for constructing the thick-film and large-area devices. Finally, the device with a 110&#160;nm-thick active layer shows an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.32% (certified 19.35%). Furthermore, the large-area (1.05 and 72.25 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) devices with 110&#160;nm thickness present PCEs of 18.25% and 12.20%, and the device with a 305&#160;nm-thick film (0.0473 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) delivers a PCE of 17.55%, which are among the highest values reported. The work demonstrates the potential of the quaternary strategy for large-area and thick-film OPVs and promotes the practical application of OPVs in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Biofabrication
In article number 2204301, Marcy Zenobi&#8208;Wong and co&#8208;workers use Filamented Light (FLight) biofabrication to create hydrogel constructs containing ultrahigh&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio microfilaments. FLight biofabrication is both fast and biocompatible. Microfilaments and associated microchannels provide effective topological guidance cues to instruct cell migration, alignment, and extracellular matrix deposition of resident cells.

Nanomedicine
The &#8220;Label&#8208;free sINgle&#8208;cell tracKing of 2D matErials by mass cytometry and MIBI&#8208;TOF Design&#8221; (LINKED) strategy enables MXene detection and simultaneous measurement of multiple cell and tissue features by single&#8208;cell mass cytometry and high&#8208;dimensional imaging. As demonstrated in article number 2205154, Yury Gogotsi, Lucia Gemma Delogu, and co&#8208;workers, LINKED allows a deep immune profiling of MXenes and can be extended to other 2D materials, enabling exciting new opportunities in biomedicine.

Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries
In article number 2205284, Xue&#8208;Qiang Zhang, Qiang Zhang, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that by weakening the solvating power of the solvents, lithium polysulfides can be encapsulated to inhibit the parasitic reactions on lithium&#8208;metal anodes. The large steric hindrance of the fluorohydrocarbon chains and the electron&#8208;withdrawing&#8211;CF2&#8211;segments endow 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether with prominently weak solvating power, similar to a submarine, to tightly encapsulate lithium polysulfides and achieve long&#8208;cycling lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.

Magnetic Ordering
In article number 2206161, Jason D. Azoulay and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;correlations within a solution&#8208;processed high&#8208;spin conjugated polymer provide robust spin&#8208;centers, intermolecular ferromagnetic exchange interactions, and anisotropic spin ordering. This new approach toward practically applicable metal&#8208;free magnetism opens new opportunities for emerging technologies that integrate spin, magnetic, and quantum mechanical effects and operate at room temperature.

This new approach toward practically applicable metal-free magnetism opens new opportunities for emerging technologies that integrate spin, magnetic, and quantum mechanical effects and operate at room temperature.

Photonic Logic Gates
In article number 2204839, Chi&#8208;Ming Che and co&#8208;workers describe a photonic logic gate device based on supramolecular heterostructures made by phosphorescent Au, Cu, Pt, and Pd complexes. The photonic logic gate operation is realized by an optical waveguiding effect and energy transfer among the different building blocks. These photonic logic gates have high emission anisotropy, low optical waveguiding loss, and continuously varied emission colors ranging from blue to near&#8208;infrared spectral regions.

         <title>Recent Progress of Metal Sulfide Photocatalysts for Solar Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging unique properties of metal sulfide photocatalysts, including abundant active sites, light&#8208;harvesting ability, and expedited charge separation, endow them promising candidates for solar light conversion. This review aims to offer a full&#8208;scale lens to discuss the recent advances of metal sulfides photocatalysts, propose their challenges, and envision the prospects of the development of metal sulfides for photocatalytic redox reactions.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthetic solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical cycles enable an entire environment to operate in a more complex, yet effective, way to perform natural photosynthesis. However, such artificial systems suffer from a lack of well&#8208;established photocatalysts with the ability to harvest the solar spectrum and rich catalytic active&#8208;site density. Benefiting from extensive experimental and theoretical investigations, this bottleneck may be overcome by devising a photocatalytic platform based on metal sulfides with predominant electronic, physical, and chemical properties. These tunable properties can endow them with abundant active sites, favorable light utilization, and expedited charge transportation for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion. Here, it is described how some vital lessons extracted from previous investigations are employed to promote the further development of metal sulfides for artificial photosynthesis, including water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 reduction, and pollutant removal. Their functions, properties, synthetic strategies, emerging issues, design principles, and intrinsic functional mechanisms for photocatalytic redox reactions are discussed in detail. Finally, the associated challenges and prospects for the utilization of metal sulfides are highlighted and future development trends in photocatalysis are envisioned.

         <title>Organic Neuroelectronics: From Neural Interfaces to Neuroprosthetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic neuroelectronics have been researched to treat and diagnose neurological diseases. The organic materials provide large advantages for neural interfaces. Also, organic nervetronics provides efficient data processing by emulating functional behavior of neural systems. Recent progress in organic neural interfaces and neuroprosthetics, with aspects of materials, devices, and systems, and finally suggests future directions, is presented.








Abstract
Requirements and recent advances in research on organic neuroelectronics are outlined herein. Neuroelectronics such as neural interfaces and neuroprosthetics provide a promising approach to diagnose and treat neurological diseases. However, the current neural interfaces are rigid and not biocompatible, so they induce an immune response and deterioration of neural signal transmission. Organic materials are promising candidates for neural interfaces, due to their mechanical softness, excellent electrochemical properties, and biocompatibility. Also, organic nervetronics, which mimics functional properties of the biological nerve system, is being developed to overcome the limitations of the complex and energy&#8208;consuming conventional neuroprosthetics that limit long&#8208;term implantation and daily&#8208;life usage. Examples of organic materials for neural interfaces and neural signal recordings are reviewed, recent advances of organic nervetronics that use organic artificial synapses are highlighted, and then further requirements for neuroprosthetics are discussed. Finally, the future challenges that must be overcome to achieve ideal organic neuroelectronics for next&#8208;generation neuroprosthetics are discussed.

         <title>Wet&#8208;Adhesive On&#8208;Skin Sensors Based on Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Wireless Monitoring of Metabolites in Sweat</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Materials and techniques are demonstrated to achieve wearable and breathable sensing devices by integrating conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks with a flexible nanocellulose membrane. This robust sensor can self&#8208;adhere to sweaty skin for the wireless and in situ monitoring of vitamin C in human sweat.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with well&#8208;defined porous structures and tailored functionalities have been widely used in chemical sensing. However, the integration of MOFs with flexible electronic devices for wearable sensing is challenging because of their low electrical conductivity and fragile mechanical properties. Herein, a wearable sweat sensor for metabolite detection is presented by integrating an electrically conductive Ni&#8208;MOF with a flexible nanocellulose substrate. The MOF&#8208;based layered film sensor with inherent conductivity, highly porous structure, and active catalytic properties enables the selective and accurate detection of vitamin C and uric acid. More importantly, the lightweight sensor can conformably self&#8208;adhere to sweaty skin and exhibits high water&#8208;vapor permeability. Furthermore, a wireless epidermal nutrition tracking system for the in situ monitoring of the dynamics of sweat vitamin C is demonstrated, the results of which are comparable to those tested by high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography. This study opens a new avenue for integrating MOFs as the active layer in wearable electronic devices and holds promise for the future development of high&#8208;performance electronics with enhanced sensing, energy production, and catalytic capabilities through the implementation of multifunctional MOFs.

         <title>Morphology&#8208;Control Growth of Graphene Islands by Nonlinear Carbon Supply</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional nonlinear&#8208;carbon&#8208;supply growth strategy for synthesizing hexagonal graphene with specific sizes is presented. The dynamic adjustment of the carbon supply and precise control of the growth and etching processes result in the direct growth of graphene&#8208;based tunnel&#8208;junction structures and small&#8208;gapped quasi&#8208;monolayer films. This study provides a foundation for directly synthesizing 2D materials for applications in highly integrated electronics.








Abstract
Controlling the morphology of graphene and other 2D materials in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth is crucial because the morphology reflects the crystal quality of as&#8208;synthesized nanomaterials in a certain way, and consequently it indirectly represents the physical properties of 2D materials such as bandgap, selective ion transportation, and impermeability. However, precise control of the morphology is limited by the complex formation mechanism and sensitive growth&#8208;environment factors of graphene. Therefore, the CVD synthesis of single&#8208;crystal hexagonal&#8208;shaped graphene islands with specific sizes is challenging. Herein, an unconventional nonlinear&#8208;carbon&#8208;supply growth strategy is proposed to realize controllable CVD growth of desired hexagonal graphene islands with specific sizes on Cu substrates. Large&#8208;area graphene films of isolated islands with desired densities, sizes, and distances between the islands are&#160;successfully synthesized. Subsequently, the direct growth of a planar&#8208;tunnel&#8208;junction structure based on two parallel gapped graphene islands is&#160;achieved by specific adjustment of the growth and etching processes of graphene CVD synthesis. It is therefore demonstrated that the nonlinear&#8208;carbon&#8208;supply growth strategy is a reliable method for the synthesis of high&#8208;quality graphene and can facilitate the direct growth of graphene&#8208;based nanodevices in the future.

Large-area graphene films of isolated islands with desired densities, sizes, and distances between the islands are&#160;successfully synthesized. Subsequently, the direct growth of a planar-tunnel-junction structure based on two parallel gapped graphene islands is&#160;achieved by specific adjustment of the growth and etching processes of graphene CVD synthesis. It is therefore demonstrated that the nonlinear-carbon-supply growth strategy is a reliable method for the synthesis of high-quality graphene and can facilitate the direct growth of graphene-based nanodevices in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multifunctionality of Li2SrNb2O7: Memristivity, Tunable Rectification, Ferroelasticity, and Ferroelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered perovskite Li2SrNb2O7&#160;bulk single crystals are synthesized. At room temperature, Li ions show significant intralayer activities, which creates a giant memristivity and a rectification effect combining with a relaxation upon time. At low temperature, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity and in&#8208;plane antiferroelectricity develop, and the rectification state becomes robust. The results demonstrate a selectively controlling of the ferroic orders and ionic migration.








Abstract
Layered Li2SrNb2O7, an inorganic oxide in its bulk single&#8208;crystalline form, is experimentally demonstrated to exhibit multiple structural facets such as ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, and antiferroelectricity. The transition from a room temperature (RT) centrosymmetric structure to a low&#8208;temperature out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric and in&#8208;plane antiferroelectric structure and the low&#8208;temperature (LT) ferroelectric domain configuration are unveiled in TEM, piezoresponse force microscopy, and polarization loop studies. Li2SrNb2O7&#160;also exhibits highly tunable ferroelasticity and excellent Li+ in&#8208;plane conduction, which leads to a giant in&#8208;plane memristor behavior and an in&#8208;plane electronic conductivity increase by three orders of magnitude by electric poling at room RT). The accumulation of Li+ vacancies at the crystal&#8211;electrode interface is visualized using in&#160;situ optical microscopy. The Li&#8208;ionic biased state shows a clear in&#8208;plane rectification effect combined with a significant relaxation upon time at RT. Relaxation can be fully suppressed at LTs such as 200&#160;K, and utilizing an electric field cooling, a stable rectification can be achieved at 200&#160;K. The results shed light on the selective control of multifunctionalities such as ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, and ionic&#8208;migration&#8208;mediated effects (a memristor effect and rectification) in a single&#8208;phase bulk material utilizing, for example, different directions, temperatures, frequencies, and magnitudes of electric field.

         <title>Janus Helical Ribbon Structure of Ordered Nanowire Films for Flexible Solar Thermoelectric Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solar thermoelectric generator is fabricated with outstanding temperature difference and the property of synergistic utilization of solar energy and waste heat by in situ redox reaction to construct n&#8208;type, p&#8208;type, and photothermal sides in one nanowire film that is the reverse side of passive radiative cooling film. The ordered nanowire film also imparts the solar thermoelectric generator with better thermoelectrical performance.








Abstract
Solar thermoelectric devices play a significant role in addressing the problem of global warming, owing to their unique features of converting both waste heat and solar energy directly into electricity. Herein, a flexible 3D Janus helical ribbon architecture is designed, starting from well&#8208;aligned tellurium (Te) nanowire film, using an in situ redox process reacting with Ag+ and Cu2+ resulting in n&#8208;type, p&#8208;type, and photothermal sides in one film. Remarkably, the device shows all&#8208;day electricity generation and large temperature gradient by coupling the cold side with a passive radiative cooling technique and the hot side with a selective solar absorption technique, showing a temperature gradient of 29.5 K, which is much higher than previously reported devices under a low solar radiation of only 614 W m&#8722;2. Especially, the device can still generate electricity even at night. The present strategy offers a new way for heat management by efficiently utilizing solar energy and the cold of the universe.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Socketed Sub&#8208;3&#160;nm Copper for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to C2+</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing perovskite&#8211;Cu heteronanostructures through in situ socketing sub&#8208;3&#160;nm Cu onto perovskite backbones provides a favorable platform for efficient and stable CO2 electroreduction (CER) to C2+ products. Within such heteronanostructures, the significant strong metal&#8211;support interactions, which modulate electronic structure of active Cu and strengthen perovskite&#8211;Cu adhesion, play key roles in simultaneously enhancing CER activity, selectivity for C2+ products, and stability.








Abstract
In situ socketing metal nanoparticles onto perovskite oxides has shown great potential in heterogeneous catalysis, but its employment in boosting ambient CO2 electroreduction (CER) is unexplored. Here, a CER catalyst of perovskite&#8208;socketed sub&#8208;3&#160;nm Cu equipped with strong metal&#8211;support interactions (SMSIs) is constructed to promote efficient and stable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion. For such a catalyst, plentiful sub&#8208;3&#160;nm ellipsoid Cu particles are homogeneously and epitaxially anchored on the perovskite backbones, with concomitant creation of significant SMSIs. These SMSIs are able to not only modulate electronic structure of active Cu and facilitate adsorption/activation of key intermediates, but also to strengthen perovskite&#8211;Cu adhesion and intensify resistance to structural degradation. Beneficial from these advantageous merits, when evaluated in CER, it performs comparably to or better than most reported Cu&#8208;based heteronanostructures. Relative to a physical&#8208;mixture counterpart, it features marked improvements (up to 6.2 folds) in activity and selectivity for C2+, together with greatly boosted stability (&gt;80&#160;h). This work gives a new avenue to rationally design more advanced Cu&#8208;based heteronanostructures for CER.

         <title>Continuous Color&#8208;Tunable Light&#8208;Emitting Devices Based on Compositionally Graded Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting diode is realized using compositionally graded monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide alloys. By controlling the light&#8208;emitting positions in the alloys, the composition gradient of the bandgap enables continuous and reversible light emission with energies ranging from 2.1 to 1.7&#160;eV. The results provide a new approach for exploring monolayer&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;alloy&#8208;based broadband optoelectronic device applications.








Abstract
The diverse series of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials has been employed in various optoelectronic applications, such as photodetectors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and lasers. Typically, the detection or emission range of optoelectronic devices is unique to the bandgap of the active material. Therefore, to improve the capability of these devices, extensive efforts have been devoted to tune the bandgap, such as gating, strain, and dielectric engineering. However, the controllability of these methods is severely limited (typically &#8776;0.1&#160;eV). In contrast, alloying TMDCs is an effective approach that yields a composition&#8208;dependent bandgap and enables light emissions over a wide range. In this study, a color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting device using compositionally graded TMDC alloys is fabricated. The monolayer WS2/WSe2 alloy grown by chemical vapor deposition shows a spatial gradient in the light&#8208;emission energy, which varies from 2.1 to 1.7&#160;eV. This alloy is incorporated in an electrolyte&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting device structure that can tune the recombination zone laterally. Thus, a continuous and reversible color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting device is successfully fabricated by controlling the light&#8208;emitting positions. The results provide a new approach for exploring monolayer semiconductor&#8208;based broadband optical applications.

It is proved&#160;that a bilayer nanostructure array is sufficient to completely control amplitudes, polarizations, and phases of coherent light transmission. Universal metasurfaces with such full control are realized with silicon nanostructures. A new kind of 3D&#160;vector hologram and a general platform for arbitrary optical transformation are demonstrated. This work provides another degree of freedom in light transmission control.








Recent advances in metasurfaces and optical nanostructures have enabled complex control of incident light with optically thin devices. However, it has thus far been unclear whether it is possible to achieve complete linear control of coherent light transmission, that is, independent control of polarization, amplitude, and phase for both input polarization states, with just a single, thin nanostructure array. Here, it is proved possible, and a universal metasurface is proposed, a bilayer array of high&#8208;index elliptic cylinders&#160;that possesses a complete degree of optical freedom with fully designable chirality and anisotropy. The completeness of achievable light control is mathematically shown with corresponding Jones matrices, new types of 3D&#160;holographic schemes that&#160;were&#160;formerly impossible are experimentally demonstrated, and a systematic way of realizing any input&#8208;state&#8208;sensitive vector linear optical device is presented. The results unlock previously inaccessible degrees of freedom in light transmission control.

         <title>Enhanced Competition at the Nano&#8211;Bio Interface Enables Comprehensive Characterization of Protein Corona Dynamics and Deep Coverage of Proteomes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By increasing competition at the nano&#8211;bio interface, protein corona diversity and detection of low&#8208;abundance proteins such as cytokines and chemokines are significantly improved. Quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) data captures corona dynamics for 3000 individual proteins and provides a crucial resource for in&#8208;depth modeling of nano&#8211;bio interactions and the Vroman effect for in vitro and in vivo applications of nanomaterials.








Abstract
Introducing engineered nanoparticles (NPs) into a biofluid such as blood plasma leads to the formation of a selective and reproducible protein corona at the particle&#8211;protein interface, driven by the relationship between protein&#8211;NP affinity and protein abundance. This enables&#160;scalable systems that leverage protein&#8211;nano interactions to&#160;overcome current limitations of deep plasma proteomics in large cohorts. Here the importance of the protein to NP&#8208;surface ratio (P/NP) is demonstrated and protein corona formation dynamics are modeled, which determine the competition between proteins for binding. Tuning the P/NP ratio significantly modulates the protein corona composition, enhancing depth and precision of a fully automated NP&#8208;based deep proteomic workflow (Proteograph). By increasing the binding competition on engineered NPs, 1.2&#8211;1.7&#215; more proteins with 1% false discovery rate are identified on the surface of each NP, and up to 3&#215; more proteins compared to a standard plasma proteomics workflow. Moreover, the data suggest P/NP plays a significant role in determining the in vivo fate of nanomaterials in biomedical applications. Together, the study showcases the importance of P/NP as a key design element for biomaterials and nanomedicine in vivo and as a powerful tuning strategy for accurate, large&#8208;scale NP&#8208;based deep proteomic studies.

         <title>Metal Confined in 2D Membranes for Molecular Recognition and Sieving towards Ethylene/Ethane Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By rationally confining metal into 2D&#160;sub&#8208;nanometer channels, a graphene oxide (GO) interlayer with size&#8208;sieving property and molecular recognition effect can efficiently discriminate ethylene over ethane. The GO membrane exhibits outstanding separation performance far exceeding the ethylene/ethane upper&#8208;bound. The metal confined in the 2D nanostructure will be of interest in other fields such as single&#8208;atom catalysis, sensors, and energy conversion.








Abstract
Membranes with nanochannels have exhibited great potential in molecular separations, while it remains a great challenge to separate molecules with very close physical properties and kinetic diameters (e.g., ethylene/ethane) owing to the lack of size&#8208;sieving property and specific affinity. Herein, a metal confined 2D&#160;sub&#8208;nanometer channel is reported to successfully discriminate ethylene over ethane via molecular recognition and sieving. Transition metal cations are paired with polyelectrolyte anions to achieve high dissociation activity, forming reversible complexation with ethylene. Aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy observes that the metals with size of &#8776;2&#160;nm are uniformly confined in graphene oxide (GO) interlayer channels with average height of &#8776;0.44&#160;nm, thereby cooperating the size&#8208;sieving effect with a molecular recognition ability toward ethylene and stimulating its selective transport over ethane. The resulting ultrathin (&#8776;60&#160;nm) membrane exhibits superior ethylene/ethane separation performance far beyond the polymeric upper&#8208;bound. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the metal@2D interlayer channel provides a molecular recognition pathway for selective gas transport. The proposed metal confined in 2D channel with molecular recognition and sieving properties would have broad application in other related fields such as single&#8208;atom catalysis, sensor and energy conversion.

         <title>Regulating the Coordination Environment of Mesopore&#8208;Confined Single Atoms from Metalloprotein&#8208;MOFs for Highly Efficient Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalized strategy to construct highly active ferric&#8208;centered SACs (Fe&#8208;SACs) via a biomineralization strategy that enables the homogeneous encapsulation of metalloproteins within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) followed by pyrolysis is developed. The enhanced catalytic activity of the Fe&#8208;SACs benefits from the highly dispersed atoms, mesopores, as well as the regulated coordination environment of single&#8208;atom active sites induced by metalloproteins.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit unparalleled atomic utilization and catalytic efficiency, yet it is challenging to modulate SACs with highly dispersed single&#8208;atoms, mesopores, and well&#8208;regulated coordination environment simultaneously&#160;and ultimately maximize their catalytic efficiency. Here, a generalized strategy to construct highly active ferric&#8208;centered SACs (Fe&#8208;SACs) is developed successfully via a biomineralization strategy that enables the homogeneous encapsulation of metalloproteins within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) followed by pyrolysis. The results demonstrate that the constructed metalloprotein&#8208;MOF&#8208;templated Fe&#8208;SACs achieve up to 23&#8208;fold and 47&#8208;fold higher activity compared to those using metal ions as the single&#8208;atom source and those with large mesopores induced by Zn evaporation, respectively, as well as up to a 25&#8208;fold and 1900&#8208;fold higher catalytic efficiency compared to natural enzymes and natural&#8208;enzyme&#8208;immobilized MOFs. Furthermore, this strategy can be generalized to a variety of metal&#8208;containing metalloproteins and enzymes. The enhanced catalytic activity of Fe&#8208;SACs benefits from the highly dispersed atoms, mesopores, as well as the regulated coordination environment of single&#8208;atom active sites induced by metalloproteins. Furthermore, the developed Fe&#8208;SACs act as an excellent and effective therapeutic platform for suppressing tumor cell growth. This work advances the development of highly efficient SACs using metalloproteins&#8208;MOFs as a template with diverse biotechnological applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile surface modification method for fibrous materials is developed to fabricate artificial sweating skin, based on an integrated 3D hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity design. With the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity contrast in both the lateral and vertical directions, the constructed &#8220;skin&#8221; can transport &#8220;sweat&#8221; directionally without trapping undesired excess water and attain uniform &#8220;secretion&#8221; of sweat droplets on the top, decently mimicking human skin perspiration situation.








Abstract
Artificial skins reproducing properties of human skin are emerging and significant for study in various areas, such as robotics, medicine, and textiles. Perspiration, as one of the most imperative thermoregulation functions of human skin, is gaining increasing attention, but how to realize ideal artificial skin for perspiration simulation remains challenging. Here, an integrated 3D hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity design is proposed for artificial sweating skin (i&#8208;TRANS). Based on normal fibrous wicking materials, the selective surface modification with gradient of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) creates hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity contrast in both lateral and vertical directions. With the additional help of bottom hydrophilic Nylon 6 nanofibers, the constructed i&#8208;TRANS is able to transport &#8220;sweat&#8221; directionally without trapping undesired excess water and attain uniform &#8220;secretion&#8221; of sweat droplets on the top surface, decently mimicking human skin perspiration situation. This fairly comparable simulation not only presents new insights for replicating skin properties, but also provides proper in vitro testing platforms for perspiration&#8208;relevant research, greatly avoiding unwanted interference from the &#8220;skin&#8221; layer. In addition, the facile, fast, and cost&#8208;effective fabrication approach and versatile usage of i&#8208;TRANS can further facilitate its application.

         <title>A Smart Photothermal Nanosystem with an Intrinsic Temperature&#8208;Control Mechanism for Thermostatic Treatment of Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart photothermal nanosystem with an intrinsic temperature&#8208;control mechanism is established for thermostatic treatment of bacterial infections. In contrast to conventional photothermal therapy with severe thermal damage, the reported smart photothermal nanosystem provides an internal protection mechanism on healthy tissues and/or organs, which remarkably accelerates the recovery of bacteria&#8208;infected wounds.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted extensive attention in disease treatments. However, conventional photothermal systems do not possess a temperature&#8208;control mechanism, which poses a serious risk to healthy tissues and/or organs due to inevitable thermal damage. Herein, a smart photothermal nanosystem with an intrinsic temperature&#8208;control mechanism for thermostatic treatment of bacterial infections is reported. The smart photothermal nanosystem is constructed by loading a thermochromic material into a hollow&#8208;structured silica nanocarrier, in which the thermochromic material is composed of naturally occurring phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs), a proton&#8208;responsive spirolactone, and a proton source. The resulting nanosystem shows strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption and efficient photothermal conversion in solid PCMs but becomes NIR&#8208;transparent when PCMs are melted upon NIR irradiation. Such an attractive feature can precisely regulate the photothermal equilibrium temperature to the melting point of PCMs, regardless of the variation in external experimental parameters. In contrast to conventional PTT with severe thermal damage, the reported smart photothermal nanosystem provides an internal protection mechanism on healthy tissues and/or organs, which remarkably accelerates the recovery of bacteria&#8208;infected wounds. The smart photothermal nanosystem is a versatile PTT platform, holding great promise in the safe and efficient treatment of bacterial infections and multimodality synergistic therapy.

         <title>Chemical Welding of the Electrode&#8211;Electrolyte Interface by Zn&#8208;Metal&#8208;Initiated In Situ Gelation for Ultralong&#8208;Life Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ gel electrolyte initiated by Zn metal produces chemical welding between the anode and the electrolyte, enabling a well&#8208;bonded and water&#8208;poor electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface that suppresses the growth of Zn dendrites and side reactions while improving the Zn utilization up to 87%. The as&#8208;prepared cells showcase superior cycling stability, with an ultralong life of over 212&#160;days.








Abstract
A compatible and robust electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface is favorable in resolving the severe dendritic growth and side reactions of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries toward commercial&#8208;standard lifespan and charging&#8211;discharging rate. Herein, a chemical welding strategy through in&#160;situ construction of a gel electrolyte that enables Zn&#8208;ion batteries to achieve ultralong life and reversibility is reported. The gel electrolyte is spontaneously formed on the Zn anode surface by redox polymerization with the initiation of Zn metal. The direct participation of the Zn anode in the chemical synthesis of the gel electrolyte brings a well&#8208;bonded and water&#8208;poor electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, which not only alleviates side reactions but also enables preferential (002) Zn deposition. The in&#160;situ symmetric cell thus prepared delivers an ultralong lifespan of 5100&#160;h (&gt;212&#160;days), and a hybrid capacitor with the in&#160;situ electrolyte runs smoothly over 40&#160;000&#160;cycles at 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Even at an ultrahigh current density of 40&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;and capacity of 40&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, the cell still operates stably for 240&#160;h, alongside a high Zn utilization with 87% depth of discharge. The in&#160;situ gel electrolyte integrating robust interface and preparation of all&#8208;in&#8208;one cells demonstrate a commercializable path for aqueous Zn&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Triple&#8208;Function Electrolyte Regulation toward Advanced Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn&#8208;battery issues in aqueous media are fundamentally studied, revealing that besides the well&#8208;known H2 evolution and dendrite growth, Zn electrodes also face an O2&#8208;involving corrosion reaction. Thus, a one&#8208;off electrolyte regulation is proposed by introducing the triple&#8208;function C3H7Na2O6P additive, which can take effects to suppress the O2&#8208;involving corrosion reaction, water decomposition, and dendritic deposition during the shelf time.








Abstract
The poor Zn reversibility has been criticized for limiting applications of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs); however, its behavior in aqueous media is not fully uncovered yet. Here, this knowledge gap is addressed, indicating that Zn electrodes face a O2&#8208;involving corrosion, besides H2 evolution and dendrite growth. Differing from aqueous Li/Na batteries, removing O2 cannot enhance ZIB performance because of the aggravated competing H2 evolution. To address Zn issues, a one&#8208;off electrolyte strategy is reported by introducing the triple&#8208;function C3H7Na2O6P, which can take effects during the shelf time of battery. It regulates H+ concentration and reduces free&#8208;water activity, inhibiting H2 evolution. A self&#8208;healing solid/electrolyte interphase (SEI) can be triggered before battery operation, which suppresses O2 adsorption corrosion and dendritic deposition. Consequently, a high Zn reversibility of 99.6% is achieved under a high discharge depth of 85%. The pouch full&#8208;cell with a lean electrolyte displays a record lifespan with capacity retention of 95.5% after 500 cycles. This study not only looks deeply into Zn behavior in aqueous media but also underscores rules for the design of active metal anodes, including Zn and Li metals, during shelf time toward real applications.

A flexible and robust quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (QSSE) with a &#8220;tree&#8208;trunk&#8221; structure is designed for ultralong&#8208;life lithium&#8208;metal batteries, in which an in&#8208;situ&#8208;grown metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer covers the cellulose&#8208;based framework to form hierarchical ion&#8208;channels, enabling rapid ionic transfer kinetics and excellent durability.








Abstract
The construction of robust (quasi)&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) for flexible lithium&#8208;metal batteries is desirable but extremely challenging. Herein, a novel, flexible, and robust quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (QSSE) with a &#8220;tree&#8208;trunk&#8221; design is reported for ultralong&#8208;life lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). An in&#8208;situ&#8208;grown metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer covers the cellulose&#8208;based framework to form hierarchical ion&#8208;channels, enabling rapid ionic transfer kinetics and excellent durability. A conductivity of 1.36&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, a transference number of 0.72, an electrochemical window of 5.26&#160;V, and a good rate performance are achieved. The flexible LMBs fabricated with as&#8208;designed QSSEs deliver areal capacity of up to 3.1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 at the initial cycle with high mass loading of 14.8&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 in Li&#8208;NCM811 cells and can retain &#8776;80% capacity retention after 300 cycles. An ultralong&#8208;life of 3000 cycles (6000&#160;h) is also achieved in Li&#8208;LiFePO4 cells. This work presents a promising route in constructing a flexible QSSE toward ultralong&#8208;life LMBs, and also provides a design rationale for material and structure development in the area of energy storage and conversion.

         <title>A Honeycomb&#8208;Like Porous Crystalline Hetero&#8208;Electrocatalyst for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of honeycomb&#8208;like metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)@covalent organic framework (COF) heterostructures with integrated porous MOF template and ultrathin COF coating are synthesized and successfully applied in efficient CO2 electroreduction to CH4.








Abstract
Porous heterostructured electrocatalysts with multifunctionality and synergistic effect have much benefit for efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), yet it still remains a daunting challenge to explore heterostructures based on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) in this field. Here, a series of honeycomb&#8208;like porous crystalline hetero&#8208;electrocatalysts (MCH&#8208;X, X&#160;= 1&#8211;4, X stands for the numbered sample obtained from different MOF doses in the synthesis of the MCH) are synthesized, and these are successfully applied in electrocatalytic CO2RR. The specially designed heterostructures with integrated porous MOF&#8208;template and ultrathin COF&#8208;coating enable efficient CO2 adsorption/activation and conversion into CH4. The best of them, MCH&#8208;3, shows greatly inhibited H2 evolution, excellent current density (&#8722;398.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), and superior FECH4${\rm{F}}{{\rm{E}}_{{\rm{C}}{{\rm{H}}_4}}}$ (76.7%) to the physical mixture (38.0%), the MOF@COF without the honeycomb&#8208;like morphology (47.7%), and the bare COF (37.5%) and MOF (15.9%) at &#8722;1.0&#160;V. Based on the density functional theory calculations and various characterizations, the vital roles of the MOF in facilitating CO2 adsorption/activation, stabilizing intermediates, and conquering the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step are intensively studied.

An adaptive robotic skin with augmented pressure sensing ability is introduced. Integrated tunable pressure sensors built with uniform gallium microgranules provide high sensitivity and bandwidth and excellent sensor&#8208;to&#8208;sensor uniformity, enabling a large&#8208;scale robotic skin with sensing performance superior to human skin. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstrations show its unique sensing capability and versatility covering a broad range of pressure.








Robotic skin with human&#8208;skin&#8208;like sensing ability holds immense potential in various fields such as robotics, prosthetics, healthcare, and industries. To catch up with human skin, numerous studies are underway on pressure sensors integrated on robotic skin to improve the sensitivity and detection range. However, due to the trade&#8208;off between them, existing pressure sensors have achieved only a single aspect, either high sensitivity or wide bandwidth. Here, an adaptive robotic skin is proposed that has both high sensitivity and broad bandwidth with an augmented pressure sensing ability beyond the human skin. A key for the adaptive robotic skin is a tunable pressure sensor built with uniform gallium microgranules embedded in an elastomer, which provides large tuning of the sensitivity and the bandwidth, excellent sensor&#8208;to&#8208;sensor uniformity, and high reliability. Through the mode conversion based on the solid&#8211;liquid phase transition of gallium microgranules, the sensor provides 97% higher sensitivity (16.97 kPa&#8722;1) in the soft mode and 262.5% wider bandwidth (&#8776;1.45&#160;MPa) in the rigid mode compared to the human skin. Successful demonstration of the adaptive robotic skin verifies its capabilities in sensing a wide spectrum of pressures ranging from subtle blood pulsation to body weight, suggesting broad use for various applications.

         <title>Nonequilibrium Lattice Dynamics in Photoexcited 2D Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonequilibrium structures of 2D perovskites are studied using ultrafast X&#8208;ray diffraction. Diffraction peaks post&#8208;photoexcitation increase in intensity and narrow over 1 ns, suggesting an increase in long&#8208;range order within the lead iodide octahedra. These results are corroborated using ultrafast photoluminescence, which shows redshifting and narrowing of photoluminescence peaks on the same timescale as transient X&#8208;ray diffraction.








Abstract
Interplay between structural and photophysical properties of metal halide perovskites is critical to their utility in optoelectronics, but there is limited understanding of lattice response upon photoexcitation. Here, 2D perovskites butylammonium lead iodide, (BA)2PbI4, and phenethylammonium lead iodide, (PEA)2PbI4, are investigated using ultrafast transient X&#8208;ray diffraction as a function of optical excitation fluence to discern structural dynamics. Both powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence linewidths narrow over 1 ns following optical excitation for the fluence range studied, concurrent with slight redshifting of the optical bandgaps. These observations are attributed to transient relaxation and ordering of distorted lead iodide octahedra stimulated mainly by electron&#8211;hole pair creation. The c axis expands up to 0.37% over hundreds of picoseconds; reflections sampling the a and b axes undergo one tenth of this expansion with the same timescale. Post&#8208;photoexcitation appearance of the (110) reflection in (BA)2PbI4 would suggest a transient phase transition,&#160;however, through new single&#8208;crystal XRD, reflections are found that violate glide plane conditions in the reported Pbca structure. The static structure space group is reassigned as P212121. With this, a nonequilibrium phase transition is ruled out. These findings offer increased understanding of remarkable lattice response in 2D perovskites upon excitation.

         <title>Strong Electronic Metal&#8211;Support Interaction between Iridium Single Atoms and a WO3 Support Promotes Highly Efficient and Robust CO2 Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir single atoms are stably anchored on the WO3 support via a strong electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI). The catalyst demonstrates an excellent activity and stability for the CO2 cycloaddition of styrene oxide to styrene carbonate at relatively low temperatures, superior to most other heterogeneous competitors. Such a great performance is understood as a direct result of the strong EMSI effect.








Abstract
The carbon dioxide (CO2) cycloaddition of epoxides to cyclic carbonates is of great industrial importance owing to the high economical values of its products. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have great potential in CO2 cycloaddition by virtue of their high atom utilization efficiency and desired activity, but they generally suffer from poor reaction stability and catalytic activity arising from the weak interaction between the active centers and the supports. In this work, Ir single atoms stably anchored on the WO3 support (Ir1&#8211;WO3) are developed with a strong electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI). Superior CO2 cycloaddition is realized in the Ir1&#8211;WO3 catalyst via the EMSI effect: 100% conversion efficiency for the CO2 cycloaddition of styrene oxide to styrene carbonate after 15&#160;h at 40 &#176;C and excellent stability with no degradation even after ten reaction cycles for a total of more than 150&#160;h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the EMSI effect results in significant charge redistribution between the Ir single atoms and the WO3 support, and consequently lowers the energy barrier associated with epoxide ring opening. This work furnishes new insights into the catalytic mechanism of CO2 cycloaddition and would guide the design of stable SACs for efficient CO2 cycloaddition reactions.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Robust Full&#8208;Color Organic Afterglow through 2D Superlattices Embedment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and universal strategy is proposed to prepare high&#8208;performance and robust organic afterglow with high figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit by 2D&#160;hydrogen&#8208;bonded superlattices embedment of phosphors. Deep&#8208;blue organic afterglow with high efficiency up to 65%, ultralong lifetime over 1300 ms, and robust emission that can resist the quenching effects from oxygen, solvent, stress, and heat is achieved.








Abstract
Purely organic afterglow (POA) originating from the slow radiative decay of stabilized triplet excited states has shown amazing potential in many fields. However, achieving highly stable POA with high phosphorescent quantum yield (PhQY) and long lifetime is still a formidable challenge owing to the intrinsically active and sensitive nature of triplet excitons. Here, triplet excitons of phosphors are protected and stabilized by embedding in tricomponent trihapto self&#8208;assembled 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded superlattices, which not only enables deep&#8208;blue POA with high PhQY (up to 65%), ultralong lifetime (over 1300&#160;ms) and the highest figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit at room temperature, but also achieves excellent stability capable of resisting quenching effects of oxygen, solvent, pressure, light, and heat. In addition, the POA color is tuned from deep&#8208;blue to red via efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the deep&#8208;blue POA emitters to the fluorophores. Moreover, with the high&#8208;performance, robust, and full&#8208;color POA materials, flexible anti&#8208;counterfeit displays and direct&#8208;current (DC)&#8208;driven lifetime&#8208;encrypted color Morse Code applications are facilely realized.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing of Prussian Blue Analogues with Electrochemically Driven Morphological Rejuvenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phenomenon of self&#8208;healing can be determined through kinetic dynamics under an electric field in terms of an &#8220;electrochemically driven dissolution&#8211;recrystallization process&#8221; for the periodic morphology variations in Prussian blue analogue electrodes.








Abstract
Maintaining the morphology of electrode materials with high invertibility contributes to the prolonged cyclic stability of battery systems. However, the majority of electrode materials tend to degrade during the charge&#8211;discharge process owing to the inevitable increase in entropy. Herein, a self&#8208;healing strategy is designed to promote morphology rejuvenation in Prussian blue analogue (PBA) cathodes by cobalt doping. Experimental characterization and theoretical calculations demonstrate that a trace amount of cobalt can decelerate the crystallization process and restore the cracked areas to ensure perfect cubic structures of PBA cathodes. The electric field controls the kinetic dynamics, rather than the conventional thermodynamics, to realize the &#8220;electrochemically driven dissolution&#8211;recrystallization process&#8221; for the periodic self&#8208;healing phenomenon. The properties of electron transportation and ion diffusion in bulk PBA are also improved by the doping strategy, thus boosting the cyclability with 4000 cycles in a diluent electrolyte. This discovery provides a new paradigm for the construction of self&#8208;healing electrodes for cathodes.

         <title>Ultrathin Covalent Organic Framework Membranes Prepared by Rapid Electrophoretic Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel two&#8208;cell electrophoretic deposition strategy to assemble covalent organic frameworks (COFs) nanosheets into ultrathin COF membranes with homogenous structures within several minutes is reported. The constructed COF membranes exhibit outstanding separation performance toward the negatively charged probe molecules with a dimension larger than 1&#160;nm due to their uniform architecture and unique chemical composition.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a disruptive material platform for various novel applications including nanofiltration for water purification due to their excellent physicochemical features. Nevertheless, the currently available approaches for preparing COF membranes need stringent synthesis conditions, prolonged fabrication time, and tedious post&#8208;processing, leading to poor productivity. Herein, a simple and efficient layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking assembly strategy is developed based on electrophoretic deposition (EPD) to rapidly generate ionic COF membranes due to the uniform driving force for nanosheet assembly. A new two&#8208;cell EPD design avoids the usual EPD problems such as bubbles and acidic/alkaline microenvironments in the near&#8208;electrode region in aqueous EPD processes. Ultrathin COF membranes with homogenous structures can be produced within several minutes. Consequently, the prepared COF membranes exhibit outstanding permselectivity and possess good stability and anti&#8208;pressure ability due to their uniform architecture and unique chemical composition.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Design of Molybdenum&#8211;Selenium Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The critical role of the synergy between nonmetallic single atoms and transition&#8208;metal single atoms for the promotion of electrochemical CO2 reduction performance is highlighted. This is similar to the synergy of nonmetallic elements and metal active centers in enzymes. More importantly, the distance effect between nonmetallic single atoms and transition&#8208;metal single atoms is clarified.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) is becoming an increasingly important technology for achieving carbon neutrality. Inspired by the structure of naturally occurring Mo&#8208;dependent enzymes capable of activating CO2, a heteronuclear Mo&#8211;Se dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom electrocatalyst (MoSA&#8211;SeSA) for ECR into CO with a Faradaic efficiency of above 90% over a broad potential window from &#8722;0.4 to &#8722;1.0&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode is demonstrated here. Both operando characterization and theoretical simulation results verify that MoSA acts as central atoms that directly interact with the ECR feedstock and intermediates, whereas the SeSA adjacent to MoSA modulates the electronic structure of MoSA through long&#8208;range electron delocalization for inhibiting MoSA poisoning caused by strong CO adsorption. In addition, the SeSAs far from MoSA help suppress the competing hydrogen evolution side reaction and accelerate the CO2 transport by repelling H2O. This work provides new insight into the precise regulation and in&#8208;depth understanding of multisite synergistic catalysis at the atomic scale.

In addition, the SeSAs far from MoSA help suppress the competing hydrogen evolution side reaction and accelerate the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transport by repelling H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. This work provides new insight into the precise regulation and in-depth understanding of multisite synergistic catalysis at the atomic scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrathin Piezoelectric Resonators Based on Graphene and Free&#8208;Standing Single&#8208;Crystal BaTiO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric resonators are ubiquitous elements for frequency filtering in telecom devices. A piezoelectric resonator consisting of a suspended van der Waals heterostructure of ultrathin single&#8208;crystal free&#8208;standing BaTiO3 sandwiched between graphene sheets is reported. The heterostructure is piezoelectrically driven into a flexural motion and the resulting mechanics shows ferroelectric switching. The bulk&#8208;mode resonance at 233 GHz is the highest reported.








Abstract
Suspended piezoelectric thin films are key elements enabling high&#8208;frequency filtering in telecommunication devices. To meet the requirements of next&#8208;generation electronics, it is essential to reduce device thickness for reaching higher resonance frequencies. Here, the high&#8208;quality mechanical and electrical properties of graphene electrodes are combined with the strong piezoelectric performance of the free&#8208;standing complex oxide, BaTiO3 (BTO), to create ultrathin piezoelectric resonators. It is demonstrated that the device can be brought into mechanical resonance by piezoelectric actuation. By sweeping the DC bias voltage on the top graphene electrode, the BTO membrane is switched between the two poled ferroelectric states. Remarkably, ferroelectric hysteresis is also observed in the resonance frequency, magnitude and Q&#8208;factor of the first membrane mode. In the bulk acoustic mode, the device vibrates at 233 GHz. This work demonstrates the potential of combining van der Waals materials with complex oxides for next&#8208;generation electronics, which not only opens up opportunities for increasing filter frequencies, but also enables reconfiguration by poling, via ferroelectric memory effect.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Bioactive Nanomicelle&#8208;Based &#8220;One Stone for Multiple Birds&#8221; Strategy for Precision Therapy of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;one stone for multiple birds&#8221; strategy is proposed for therapy of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Three engineered conjugates can assemble into nanomicelles capable of inhibiting migration/activation of inflammatory cells and protecting smooth muscle cells from oxidative stress, calcification, and apoptosis. Intravenously delivered nanomicelles efficiently accumulate in aneurysms of rats and distribute in multiple pathological cells, thereby alleviating AAA progression.








Abstract
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains a lethal aortic disease in the elderly. Currently, no effective drugs can be clinically applied to prevent the development of AAA. Herein, a &#8220;one stone for multiple birds&#8221; strategy for AAA therapy is reported. As a proof of concept, three bioactive conjugates are designed and synthesized, which can assemble into nanomicelles. Cellularly, these nanomicelles significantly inhibit migration and activation of inflammatory cells as well as protect vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from induced oxidative stress, calcification and apoptosis, with the best effect for nanomicelles (TPTN) derived from a conjugate defined as TPT. After intravenous delivery, TPTN efficiently accumulates in the aneurysmal tissue of AAA rats, showing notable distribution in neutrophils, macrophages and VSMCs, all relevant to AAA pathogenesis. Whereas three examined nanomicelles effectively delay expansion of AAA in rats, TPTN most potently prevents AAA growth by simultaneously normalizing the pro&#8208;inflammatory microenvironment and regulating multiple pathological cells. TPTN is effective even at 0.2&#160;mg&#160;kg&#8722;1. Besides, TPTN can function as a bioactive nanoplatform for site&#8208;specifically delivering and triggerably releasing anti&#8208;aneurysmal drugs, affording synergistic therapeutic effects. Consequently, TPTN is a promising multi&#8208;bioactive nanotherapy and bioresponsive targeting delivery nanocarrier for effective therapy of AAA and other inflammatory vascular diseases.

         <title>Local Diverse Polarization Optimized Comprehensive Energy&#8208;Storage Performance in Lead&#8208;Free Superparaelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excellent energy&#8208;storage properties with an ultrahigh recoverable energy storage density &#8776;10.59 J cm&#8722;3 and a large efficiency &#8776;87.6% are realized in lead&#8208;free relaxor ferroelectrics, which is responsible by the local diverse polarization design, leading to the ultrasmall polar nanoregions, reduced heat loss, substantially enhanced polarization, and breakdown electric field compared to single polarization configuration.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free dielectric ceramics with ultrahigh energy&#8208;storage performance are the core components used in next&#8208;generation advanced pulse power capacitors. However, the low energy storage density largely hinders their development towards miniaturization, lightweight, and integration. Here, an effective strategy of constructing local diverse polarization is designed in superparaelectrics to realize an ultrahigh energy storage density of &#8776;10.59 J cm&#8722;3 as well as a large efficiency of &#8776;87.6%. The excellent comprehensive energy&#8208;storage performance is mainly attributed to the design of ultrasmall polar nanoregions with local diverse polarization configuration, confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy, leading to the reduced heat loss, substantially enhanced polarization, and breakdown electric field compared to ceramics with single polarization configuration. Benefiting from these features, outstanding temperature/frequency/cycling stability and superior charge/discharge performance (power density &#8776;187.5 MW cm&#8722;3, discharge energy density &#8776;3.52 J cm&#8722;3, discharge rate &#8776;77&#160;ns) are also achieved. This work demonstrates that local diverse polarization is a super strategy to design new dielectric materials with high energy&#8208;storage performance.

Robotic Skin
In article number 2204805, Jae&#8208;Woong Jeong and co&#8208;workers report an adaptive robotic skin with an augmented pressure&#8208;sensing capability beyond that of human skin. The robotic skin is composed of gallium microgranules fabricated uniformly using a T&#8208;junction microfluidic system. Through the phase transition of gallium microgranules, it achieves a higher sensitivity in the soft mode and a broader dynamic range in the rigid mode compared to human skin.

Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts
In article number 2205674, Kang Liang and co&#8208;workers develop a generalized strategy to construct highly active ferric&#8208;centered single&#8208;atom catalysts via a biomineralization strategy that enables the homogeneous encapsulation of metalloproteins within metal&#8208;organic frameworks followed by pyrolysis. The enhanced activity of the obtained catalysts benefits from the highly dispersed atoms, the mesopores, and the regulated coordination environment of the single&#8208;atom active sites induced by the metalloproteins.

Confined 2D Channels
2D&#8208;material membranes have demonstrated great potential in molecular separation. In article number 2206349, Gongping Liu and co&#8208;workers rationally confine metal into sub&#8208;nanometer GO galleries, endowing 2D channels with molecular recognition and sieving properties for discriminating ethylene over ethane. The metal confined in a 2D nanostructure would be of interest in other fields such as single&#8208;atom catalysis, sensors, and energy conversion.

Light&#8208;Emitting Devices
A color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting diode is realized by Jiang Pu, Yasumitsu Miyata, Taishi Takenobu, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2203250 using compositionally graded monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide alloys. By controlling the light&#8208;emitting positions in the alloys, the composition gradient of the bandgap enables continuous and reversible light emission with energies ranging from 2.1 to 1.7 eV. The results provide a new approach for exploring monolayer semiconductor alloy based broadband optoelectronic device applications.

Proteomics
In article number 2206008, Omid C. Farokhzad, Daniel Hornburg, and co&#8208;workers show how the Vroman effect can be leveraged to capture the complexity of human proteomes using engineered nanoparticles. Protein corona formation dynamics demonstrate how nanoparticle functionalization and nano&#8211;bio binding competition enable deep and quantitative interrogation of biosamples. This facilitates increased capture of low&#8208;abundance proteins, including cytokines and chemokines, enabling new strategies for biomarker discovery and personalized nanomedicine.

         <title>Organic Hole&#8208;Transport Layers for Efficient, Stable, and Scalable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) attract great attention due to their low&#8208;temperature processing, negligible hysteresis, and superior stability. For these devices, hole&#8208;transport layers play a decisive role in carrier extraction, transport, and perovskite crystallization. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the structural engineering of organic hole&#8208;transport layers utilized in inverted PSCs including conductive polymers, small molecules, and emerging self&#8208;assembled monolayers.








Abstract
Hole&#8208;transporting layers (HTLs) are an essential component in inverted, p&#8211;i&#8211;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs) where they play a decisive role in extraction and transport of holes, surface passivation, perovskite crystallization, device stability, and cost. Currently, the exploration of efficient, stable, highly transparent and low&#8208;cost HTLs is of vital importance for propelling p&#8211;i&#8211;n PSCs toward commercialization. Compared to their inorganic counterparts, organic HTLs offer multiple advantages such as a tunable bandgap and energy level, easy synthesis and purification, solution processability, and overall low cost. Here, recent progress of organic HTLs, including conductive polymers, small molecules, and self&#8208;assembled monolayers, as utilized in inverted PSCs is systematically reviewed and summarized. Their molecular structure, hole&#8208;transport properties, energy levels, and relevant device properties and resulting performances are presented and analyzed. A summary of design principles and a future outlook toward highly efficient organic HTLs in inverted PSCs is proposed. This review aims to inspire further innovative development of novel organic HTLs for more efficient, stable, and scalable inverted PSCs.

         <title>Tailoring Materials for Epilepsy Imaging: From Biomarkers to Imaging Probes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A framework for understanding potential biomarkers of epilepsy is provided and they are classified them into three categories: functional, molecular, and structural aberrances during epileptogenesis. Then, the materials used to fabricate the imaging probes and their performances in defining the epileptic foci are highlighted. Imaging strategies overcoming the heterogenous nature of epilepsy are thoroughly discussed.








Abstract
Excising epileptic foci (EF) is the most efficient approach for treating drug&#8208;resistant epilepsy (DRE). However, owing to the vast heterogeneity of epilepsies, EF in one&#8208;third of patients cannot be accurately located, even after exhausting all current diagnostic strategies. Therefore, identifying biomarkers that truly represent the status of epilepsy and fabricating probes with high targeting specificity are prerequisites for identifying the &#8220;concealed&#8221; EF. However, no systematic summary of this topic has been published. Herein, the potential biomarkers of EF are first summarized and classified into three categories: functional, molecular, and structural aberrances during epileptogenesis, a procedure of nonepileptic brain biasing toward epileptic tissue. The materials used to fabricate these imaging probes and their performance in defining the EF in preclinical and clinical studies are highlighted. Finally, perspectives for developing the next generation of probes and their challenges in clinical translation are discussed. In general, this review can be helpful in guiding the development of imaging probes defining EF with improved accuracy and holds promise for increasing the number of DRE patients who are eligible for surgical intervention.

&lt;p&gt;A framework for understanding potential biomarkers of epilepsy is provided and they are classified them into three categories: functional, molecular, and structural aberrances during epileptogenesis. Then, the materials used to fabricate the imaging probes and their performances in defining the epileptic foci are highlighted. Imaging strategies overcoming the heterogenous nature of epilepsy are thoroughly discussed.
