         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Air electrodes serve as a vital ingredient of zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) and hydrogen fuel cells (HFCs), which determines the output power density and stability of the devices. The recent progress regarding air electrode architectures in rechargeable ZABs and HFCs is summarized. Moreover, the remaining challenges and prospects for air electrodes in future are indicated.








Abstract
The air electrode is an essential component of air&#8208;demanding energy storage/conversion devices, such as zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) and hydrogen fuel cells (HFCs), which determines the output power and stability of the devices. Despite atom&#8208;level modulation in catalyst design being recently achieved, the air electrodes have received much less attention, causing a stagnation in the development of air&#8208;demanding equipment. Herein, the evolution of air electrodes for ZABs and HFCs from the early stages to current requirements is reviewed. In addition, the operation mechanism and the corresponding electrocatalytic mechanisms of ZABs are summarized. In particular, by clarifying the air electrode interfaces of ZABs at different scales, several approaches to improve the air electrode in rechargeable ZABs are reviewed, including innovative electrode structures and bifunctional oxygen catalysts. Afterward, the operating mechanisms of proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are explained. Subsequently, the strategies employed to enhance the efficiency of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) in PEMFCs and AEMFCs, respectively, are highlighted and discussed in detail. Last, the prospects for air electrodes in ZABs and HFCs are considered by discussing the main challenges. The aim of this review is to facilitate the industrialization of ZABs and HFCs.

         <title>Establishing Multiple&#8208;Order Built&#8208;In Electric Fields Within Heterojunctions to Achieve Photocarrier Spatial Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the multiple&#8208;order electric fields are designed and constructed with a larger range of action in ZnO/ZnS heterojunctions to promote the smooth transport of photogenerated holes from ZnS NPs to ZnO NDs, thereby elevating CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoconversion to be 3811.7&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1&#160;g&#8722;1, and offering a prototype for tuning the distribution of the built&#8208;in electric fields in heterojunctions.








Abstract
Hybridizing two heterocomponents to construct a built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) at the interface represents a significant strategy for facilitating charge separation in carbon dioxide (CO2)&#8208;photoreduction. However, the unidirectional nature of BIEFs formed by various low&#8208;dimensional materials poses challenges in adequately segregating the photogenerated carriers produced in bulk. In this study, leveraging zinc oxide (ZnO) nanodisks, a sulfurization reaction is employed to fabricate Z&#8208;scheme ZnO/zinc sulfide (ZnS) heterojunctions featuring a multiple&#8208;order BIEF. These heterojunctions reveal distinctive interfacial structures characterized by two semicoherent phase boundaries. The cathodoluminescence 2D maps and density functional theory calculation results demonstrate that the direction of the multiple&#8208;order BIEF spans from ZnS to ZnO. This directional alignment significantly fosters the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes within ZnS nanoparticles and enhances CO2&#8208;to&#8208;carbon monoxide photoreduction performance (3811.7&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1&#160;g&#8722;1). The findings present a novel pathway for structurally designing BIEFs within heterojunctions, while providing fresh insights into the migratory behavior of photogenerated carriers across interfaces.

         <title>Ultraclean Interface of Metal Chalcogenides with Metal through Confined Interfacial Chalcogenization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel confined interfacial chalcogenization (CIC) method to develop robust transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) possessing an ultraclean interface with a metal presents a promising alternative to conventional chemical vapor deposition (CVD). CIC&#8208;TMDs overcome limitations associated with CVD such as defects, doping impurities, and degradation, thus proving to be versatile for the development of memristors for electronic devices.








Abstract
Acquisition of defect&#8208;free transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) channels with clean heterojunctions is a critical issue in the production of TMD&#8208;based functional electronic devices. Conventional approaches have transferred TMD onto a target substrate, and then apply the typical device fabrication processes. Unfortunately, those processes cause physical and chemical defects in the TMD channels. Here, a novel synthetic process of TMD thin films, named confined interfacial chalcogenization (CIC) is proposed. In the proposed synthesis, a uniform TMDlayer is created at the Au/transition metal (TM) interface by diffusion of chalcogen through the upper&#160;Au layer and the reaction of chalcogen with the underlying TM. CIC allows for ultraclean heterojunctions with the metals, synthesis of various homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;structured TMDs, and in situ TMD channel formation in the last stage of device fabrication. The mechanism of TMD growth is revealed by the TM&#8208;accelerated chalcogen diffusion, epitaxial growth of TMD on Au(111). We demonstrated a wafer&#8208;scale TMD&#8208;based vertical memristors which exhibit excellent statistical concordance in device performance enabled by the ultraclean heterojunctions and superior uniformity in thickness. CIC proposed in this study represents a breakthrough in in TMD&#8208;based electronic device fabrication and marking a substantial step toward practical next&#8208;generation integrated electronics.

         <title>Designable Photo&#8208;Responsive Micron&#8208;Scale Ultrathin Peptoid Nanobelts for Enhanced Performance on Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D photo&#8208;responsive ultrathin peptoid nanobelts (UTPNBs) with a thickness of &#8776;2.2&#160;nm and a length in micrometers are generated through the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic azobenzene&#8208;containing ternary alternating peptoids, undergoing a reversible transition from UTPNBs to nanospheres. Structural superiorities of UTPNBs enable them to serve as favorable scaffolds for the potential on electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions, whose overpotential is 28 mV.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;reactive single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) based on long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered ultrathin organic nanomaterials (UTONMs) (i.e., below 3&#160;nm) provides a significant tactic for the advancement in hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) but remains challenging. Herein, photo&#8208;responsive ultrathin peptoid nanobelts (UTPNBs) with a thickness of &#8776;2.2&#160;nm and micron&#8208;scaled length are generated using the self&#8208;assembly of azobenzene&#8208;containing amphiphilic ternary alternating peptoids. The pendants hydrophobic conjugate stacking mechanism reveals the formation of 1D ultralong UTPNBs, whose thickness is dictated by the length of side groups that are linked to peptoid backbones. The photo&#8208;responsive feature is demonstrated by a reversible morphological transformation from UTPNBs to nanospheres (21.5&#160;nm) upon alternative irradiation with UV and visible lights. Furthermore, the electrocatalyst performance of these aggregates co&#8208;decorated with nitrogen&#8208;rich ligand of terpyridine (TE) and uniformly&#8208;distributed atomic platinum (Pt) is evaluated toward HER, with a photo&#8208;controllable electrocatalyst activity that highly depended on both the presence of Pt element and structural characteristic of substrates. The Pt&#8208;based SACs using TE&#8208;modified UTPNBs as support exhibit a favorable electrocatalytic capacity with an overpotential of &#8776;28&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This work presents a promising strategy to fabricate stimuli&#8208;responsive UTONMs&#8208;based catalysts with controllable HER catalytic performance.

The PAM hydrogel electrolyte with slippage&#8208;free electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface and superior moisture maintaining ability is designed to ensure the operating stability of biocompatible zinc&#8208;based batteries. The impacts from batteries on body are evaluated with human cell lines and battery implantations, which demonstrate the high biosecurity.








Abstract
Wearable and implantable electronics are standing at the frontiers of science and technology, driven by the increasing demands from modernized lifestyles. Zinc&#8208;based batteries (ZBs) are regarded as ideal energy suppliers for these biocompatible electronics, but the corresponding biocompatibility validation is still in the initial stage. Meanwhile, complicated working conditions and some extreme electrolyte environments raise strict challenges, leaving less choices for safe ZBs. Toward higher operating stability and biocompatibility, this work proposes a hydrogel electrolyte featuring the moisture maintaining ability and a robust interface, which could further provide a milder environment for Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries and Zn&#8208;air batteries. The cytotoxicity and tissue injury of batteries are evaluated with human cell lines and battery implantations on the animal models, which demonstrate the high biocompatibility&#160;of ZBs, while preliminary wearable devices implementation further verifies their operating stability. This work may provide a pathway for developing and validating biocompatible ZBs, contributing to their future practical employment in relevant fields.

         <title>Zeolitic Imidazolate&#8208;Framework&#8208;Engineered Heterointerface Catalysis for the Construction of Plant&#8208;Wearable Sensors</title>

         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;shelled upconversion&#8208;nanoparticles@zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate&#8208;framework@polydopamine (UCNPs@ZIF@PDA) architecture with well&#8208;defined heterointerface is obtained via coordination&#8211;dissociation&#8211;polymerization mechanism. UCNPs@ZIF@PDA&#8208;based plant&#8208;wearble sensor can establish an adhesive and conformal interface on hairy plants, achieving on&#8208;site monitoring of 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenoxyacetic acid dynamic degradation in a noninvasive manner.








Abstract
Plant&#8208;wearable sensors provide real&#8208;time information that enables pesticide inputs to be finely tuned and play critical roles in precision agriculture. However, tracking pesticide information in living plants remains a formidable challenge owing to inadequate shape adaptabilities and low in&#8208;field sensor sensitivities. In this study, plant&#8208;wearable hydrogel discs are designed by embedding a dual&#8208;shelled upconversion&#8208;nanoparticles@zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate&#8208;framework@polydopamine (UCNPs@ZIF@PDA) composite in double&#8208;network hydrogels to deliver on&#8208;site pesticide&#8208;residue information. Benefiting from the enzyme&#8208;mimetic catalytic activity of ZIFs and enzyme triggered&#8208;responsive property of PDA shell, the hydrogel discs are endowed with high sensing sensitivity toward 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenoxyacetic acid pesticide at the nanogram per milliliter level via boosting fluorescence quenching efficiency. Notably, hydrogel discs mounted on tomato plants exhibit sufficient adaptability to profile dynamic pesticide degradation when used in conjunction with an ImageJ processing algorithm, which is practically applicable. Such hydrogel discs form a noninvasive and low&#8208;cost toolkit for the on&#8208;site acquisition of pesticide information, thereby contributing to the precise management of the health status of a plant and the judicious development of precision agriculture.

         <title>Flexible Cages Enable Robust Supramolecular Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a pioneering flexible cage&#8208;reinforced supramolecular elastomer (CSE) is reported that exhibits superb robustness, tear resistance, anti&#8208;fatigue, and shape memory properties, achieved by innovatively introducing organic imide cages (OICs) into supramolecular networks. Intriguingly, extremely small amounts of OICs make the elastomer stronger, significantly improving mechanical strength (&#8776;10&#8208;fold increase) and toughness (&#8776;7&#8208;fold increase).








Abstract
Advances in modern industrial technology continue to place stricter demands on engineering polymeric materials, but simultaneously possessing superior strength and toughness remains a daunting challenge. Herein, a pioneering flexible cage&#8208;reinforced supramolecular elastomer (CSE) is reported that exhibits superb robustness, tear resistance, anti&#8208;fatigue, and shape memory properties, achieved by innovatively introducing organic imide cages (OICs) into supramolecular networks. Intriguingly, extremely small amounts of OICs make the elastomer stronger, significantly improving mechanical strength (85.0&#160;MPa; &#8776;10&#8208;fold increase) and toughness (418.4&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3; &#8776;7&#8208;fold increase). Significantly, the cooperative effect of gradient hydrogen bonds and OICs is experimentally and theoretically demonstrated as flexible nodes, enabling more robust supramolecular networks. In short, the proposed strengthening strategy of adding flexible cages effectively balances the inherent conflict between material strength and toughness, and the prepared CSEs are anticipated to be served in large&#8208;scale devices such as TBMs in the future.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Sign Inversion of Circularly Polarized Luminescence Enabled by Dichroism Modulation in Cholesteric Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;driven circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) material with the sign inversion character is constructed by incorporating photosensitive negative dichroic dye and an appropriate ratio of the opposite dichroic achiral dye into the cholesteric liquid crystals. The CPL signals invert without helical superstructure change. These results provide valuable avenues for developing stimuli&#8208;responsive CPL tools for information security and anticounterfeiting applications.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials show great promise in applying information encryption and anticounterfeiting. Herein, light&#8208;driven CPL sign inversion is achieved by combining a photoresponsive achiral negative dichroic dye (KG) and a static achiral positive dichroic dye (NR) as dopants at the 0.5:0.5 weight ratio into the cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) host. The side chains of KG undergo trans/cis isomerization after 365&#160;nm UV light irradiation, leading to the dichroism (SF) decrease. The |glum| value of CLC doping with KG (CLC&#8208;KG) weakens from 0.67 to 0.28 in response to the order degree change. Taking advantage of its unique CPL response property, the light&#8208;driven CPL sign inversion is achieved (from &#8722;0.20/0.14 to 0.02/&#8722;0.04) by incorporating NR (0.5:0.5) into the CLC&#8208;KG with helical superstructure static. Based on the synergistic use of circular polarization and responsiveness state as cryptographic primitives, the multidimensional information encryption CLC system can be realized.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Alloys Materials for CO2 and CH4 Catalytic Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines the challenges of CH4 and CO2 catalytic conversion and benefits offered by single&#8208;atom alloy (SAAs). It details synthesis strategies and characterization methods and examines research on SAAs in CO2 and CH4 conversion, focusing on the intricate mechanisms affecting activity and product selectivity. Future prospects and challenges of SAAs in CH4 and CO2 conversion are also presented.








Abstract
The catalytic conversion of greenhouse gases CH4 and CO2 constitutes an effective approach for alleviating the greenhouse effect and generating valuable chemical products. However, the intricate molecular characteristics characterized by high symmetry and bond energies, coupled with the complexity of associated reactions, pose challenges for conventional catalysts to attain high activity, product selectivity, and enduring stability. Single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs) materials, distinguished by their tunable composition and unique electronic structures, confer versatile physicochemical properties and modulable functionalities. In recent years, SAAs materials demonstrate pronounced advantages and expansive prospects in catalytic conversion of CH4 and CO2. This review begins by introducing the challenges entailed in catalytic conversion of CH4 and CO2 and the advantages offered by SAAs. Subsequently, the intricacies of synthesis strategies employed for SAAs are presented and characterization techniques and methodologies are introduced. The subsequent section furnishes a meticulous and inclusive overview of research endeavors concerning SAAs in CO2 catalytic conversion, CH4 conversion, and synergy CH4 and CO2 conversion. The particular emphasis is directed toward scrutinizing the intricate mechanisms underlying the influence of SAAs on reaction activity and product selectivity. Finally, insights are presented on the development and future challenges of SAAs in CH4 and CO2 conversion reactions.

         <title>Highly Ordered Eutectic Mesostructures via Template&#8208;Directed Solidification within Thermally Engineered Templates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Template thermal engineering greatly enhances long&#8208;range order of mesostructures formed by template&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly. Employing porous Si rods as a template (thermal conductivity &#8776;0.28 Wm&#8208;1K&#8208;1, thermal diffusivity &#8776;0.89 mm2/s) nearly perfect periodic microstructures with optical properties matching simulations result. In distinct contrast, when the thermal diffusivity of the template is much greater, only disordered structures are formed.








Abstract
Template&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly of solidifying eutectics results in emergence of unique microstructures due to diffusion constraints and thermal gradients imposed by the template. Here, the importance of selecting the template material based on its conductivity to control heat transfer between the template and the solidifying eutectic, and thus the thermal gradients near the solidification front, is demonstrated. Simulations elucidate the relationship between the thermal properties of the eutectic and template and the resultant microstructure. The overarching finding is that templates with low thermal conductivities are generally advantageous for forming highly organized microstructures. When electrochemically porosified silicon pillars (thermal conductivity &lt; 0.3 Wm&#8722;1K&#8722;1) are used as the template into which an AgCl&#8208;KCl eutectic is solidified, 99% of the unit cells in the solidified structure exhibit the same pattern. In contrast, when higher thermal conductivity crystalline silicon pillars (&#8776;100 Wm&#8722;1K&#8722;1) are utilized, the expected pattern is only present in 50% of the unit cells. The thermally engineered template results in mesostructures with tunable optical properties and reflectances nearly identical to the simulated reflectances of perfect structures, indicating highly ordered patterns are formed over large areas. This work highlights the importance of controlling heat flows in template&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly of eutectics.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Strategies in the Discovery of Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the high&#8208;throughput (HTP) strategies in the discovery of thermoelectric (TE) materials, including performance descriptor, HTP calculation, HTP experiment, and machine learning are systematically summarized. The applications and progress of the four HTP strategies in TEs are reviewed. In addition, the challenges and possible directions in future research are also discussed.








Abstract
Searching for new high&#8208;performance thermoelectric (TE) materials that are economical and environmentally friendly is an urgent task for TE society, but the advancements are greatly limited by the time&#8208;consuming and high cost of the traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error method. The significant progress achieved in the computing hardware, efficient computing methods, advance artificial intelligence algorithms, and rapidly growing material data have brought a paradigm shift in the investigation of TE materials. Many electrical and thermal performance descriptors are proposed and efficient high&#8208;throughput (HTP) calculation methods are developed with the purpose to quickly screen new potential TE materials from the material databases. Some HTP experiment methods are also developed which can increase the density of information obtained in a single experiment with less time and lower cost. In addition, machine learning (ML) methods are also introduced in thermoelectrics. In this review, the HTP strategies in the discovery of TE materials are systematically summarized. The applications of performance descriptor, HTP calculation, HTP experiment, and ML in the discovery of new TE materials are reviewed. In addition, the challenges and possible directions in future research are also discussed.

         <title>Solid Interfaces for the Garnet Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solid state electrolytes (SSEs) have attracted extensive interests due to the advantages in developing secondary batteries with high energy density and outstanding safety. Possessing high ionic conductivity and the lowest reduction potential among the state of art SSEs, the garnet type SSEs is one of the most promising candidates to achieve high performance solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs). However, the elastic modulus of the garnet electrolyte leads to deteriorated interfacial contacts, and the increasing in electronic conduction at either anode/garnet interface or grain boundary results in Li dendrite growth. In this review, recent development of the solid interfaces for the garnet electrolytes, including the strategies of Li dendrite suppression and interfacial chemical/electrochemical/mechanical stabilizations are presented. A new viewpoint of the double edges of interfacial lithiophobicity is proposed, and the rational design of the interphases, as well as effective stacking methods of the garnet based SSLBs are summarized. Moreover, practical roles of the garnet electrolyte in SSLBs industry are also discussed. This work delivers insights into the solid interfaces for the garnet electrolytes, which provides not only the promotion of the garnet based SSLBs, but also a comprehensive understanding of the interfacial stabilization for the whole SSEs family.

         <title>Low&#8208;temperature Adaptive Single&#8208;Atom Iron Nanozymes Against Viruses in The Cold Chain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Outbreaks of viral infectious diseases, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) and influenza A virus (IAV), pose a great threat to human health. Viral spread has been accelerated worldwide by the development of cold chain logistics, therefore, an effective antiviral approach is required. In this study, we aimed to develop a distinct antiviral strategy using nanozymes with low&#8208;temperature adaptability, suitable for cold chain logistics. Phosphorus (P) atoms were added to the remote counter position of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C center to prepare FeN4P2&#8208;single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes), exhibiting lipid oxidase (OXD)&#8208;like activity at cold chain temperatures (&#8722;20, and 4&#160;&#176;C). This feature enables FeN4P2&#8208;SAzymes to disrupt multiple enveloped viruses (human, swine, and avian coronaviruses, and H1&#8208;H11 subtypes of IAV) by catalyzing lipid peroxidation of the viral lipid envelope. Under the simulated conditions of cold chain logistics, FeN4P2&#8208;SAzymes were successfully applied as antiviral coatings on outer packaging and personal protective equipment. Therefore, FeN4P2&#8208;SAzymes with low&#8208;temperature adaptability and broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral properties may serve as key materials for developing specific antiviral approaches to interrupt viral transmission through the cold chain.

         <title>Extracellular Matrix&#8208;Trapped Bioinspired Lipoprotein Prolongs Tumor Retention to Potentiate Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The immunomodulatory effects of many therapeutic agents are significantly challenged by their insufficient delivery efficiency and short retention time in tumors. Regarding the distinctively upregulated fibronectin (FN1) and tenascin C (TNC) in tumor stroma, we herein design a protease&#8208;activated FN1 and/or TNC binding peptide (FTF) and propose an extracellular matrix (ECM)&#8208;trapped bioinspired lipoprotein (BL) (FTF&#8208;BL&#8208;CP) that can be preferentially captured by the TNC and/or FN1 for tumor retention, and then be responsively dissociated from the matrix to potentiate the antitumor immunity. The FTF&#8208;BL&#8208;CP treatment produces a 6.96&#8208;, 9.24&#8208;, 6.72&#8208;, 7.32&#8208;, and 6.73&#8208;fold increase of CD3+CD8+ T cells and their interferon&#8208;&#947;&#8208;, granzyme B&#8208;, perforin&#8208;, and Ki67&#8208;expressing subtypes versus the negative control, thereby profoundly eliciting the antitumor immunity. In orthotopic and lung metastatic breast cancer models, FTF&#8208;BL&#8208;CP produced notable therapeutic benefits of retarding tumor growth, extending survivals, and inhibiting lung metastasis. Therefore, this ECM&#8208;trapping strategy provides an encouraging possibility of prolonging tumor retention to potentiate the antitumor immunity for anticancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Why The Synthesis Affect Performance of Layered Transition Metal Oxide Cathode Materials for Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The limited cyclability of high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy layered transition metal oxide (LiTMO2) cathode materials poses a significant challenge to the industrialization of batteries incorporating these materials. This limitation can be attributed to various factors, with the intrinsic behavior of the crystal structure during the cycle process being a key contributor. These factors include phase transition induced cracks, reduced Li active sites due to Li/Ni mixing, and slower Li+ migration.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limited cyclability of high-specific-energy layered transition metal oxide (LiTMO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) cathode materials poses a significant challenge to the industrialization of batteries incorporating these materials. This limitation can be attributed to various factors, with the intrinsic behavior of the crystal structure during the cycle process being a key contributor. These factors include phase transition induced cracks, reduced Li active sites due to Li/Ni mixing, and slower Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration. Additionally, the presence of synthesis-induced heterogeneous phases and lattice defects cannot be disregarded as they also contribute to the degradation in performance. Therefore, gaining a profound understanding of the intricate relationship between material synthesis, structure, and performance is imperative for the development of LiTMO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This paper highlights the pivotal role of structural play in LiTMO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; materials and provides a comprehensive overview of how various control factors influence the specific pathways of structural evolution during the synthesis process. Additionally, it summarizes the scientific challenges associated with diverse modification approaches currently employed to address the cyclic failure of materials. The overarching goal is to provide readers with profound insights into the study of LiTMO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Elastic Organic Crystals Exhibiting Amplified Spontaneous Emission Waveguides with Standard Red Chromaticity of The Rec.2020 Gamut</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The use of mechanically flexible molecular crystals as optical transuding media has been demonstrated for a plethora of applications; however, the spectral peaks of optical outputs located mainly in the range of 400&#8722;600&#160;nm are insufficient for practical telecommunication and full&#8208;color display applications. Herein, we report two elastically bendable organic crystals that show red emission of the rec.709 gamut under 365&#160;nm UV light irradiation yet generate rec.2020 gamut red optical waveguides and amplified spontaneous emissions when irradiated by a 355&#160;nm laser. Capitalizing on the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and donor&#8208;acceptor character, as well as mechanical elasticity, these organic crystals exhibit flexible optical waveguides with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.70, 0.29), nearly identical to the red chromaticity of the rec.2020 gamut required for ultrahigh&#8208;definition (UHD) displays. Notably, one of the elastic crystals functioned as a soft resonance cavity, resulting in amplified spontaneous emission waveguides with CIE coordinates of (0.71, 0.29) and the standard red chromaticity of the rec.2020 gamut, both in straight and bent states. This study presents a new avenue for the development of high&#8208;purity red&#8208;emissive crystalline materials to create all&#8208;organic, lightweight, and mechanically compliant optical telecommunication and UHD display devices.

         <title>Probing Electronic Band Structures of Dielectric Polymers via Pre&#8208;Breakdown Conduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electronic band structure, especially the defect states at the conduction band tail, dominates electron transport and electrical degradation of a dielectric material under an extremely high electric field, and the ability to probe such states provides insights into the mechanism of dielectric breakdown for better designs of new materials. However, the electronic band structure governing the charge transport in a dielectric is barely well studied due to experimental challenges in detecting the electrical conduction to an extremely high electric field, i.e., prebreakdown. In this work, we probe the electronic band structure of polymer dielectric films through a novel in&#8208;situ prebreakdown conduction measurement method in conjunction with a space&#8208;charge&#8208;limited&#8208;current spectroscopic analysis. An exponential distribution of defect states at the conduction band tail with varying trap levels is observed in accordance with the specific morphological disorder in the polymer dielectric, and the experimental defect states show also a favorable agreement with the calculated density of states from the density functional theory. The methodology demonstrated in this work bridges the molecule&#8208;structure&#8208;determined electronic band structure and the macro electrical conduction behavior, provides highly improved understanding of material properties that control the electrical breakdown, and paves a way for guiding the modification of existing material and the exploration of novel material for high electric field applications.

         <title>High Performance and Reprocessable in Situ Generated Nanofiber Reinforced Composites Based on Liquid Crystal Polyarylate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymers are playing important roles in the rapid development of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). However, most polymers cannot meet the high requirements of thermomechanical performance. Thus, various polymeric composites have been developed for triboelectric layer. These composites are hardly recycled since their reinforcements are unevenly distributed after reprocessing, which limits the sustainable development of TENGs. To solve above challenges, in situ generated nanofiber reinforced composites (NFRCs) based on single&#8208;component liquid crystal polyarylate (LCP) are designed and prepared via a one&#8208;step polycondensation. Nonlinear naphthalene (NDA) widened the processing window of LCP without destabilizing liquid crystal phase. The NDA&#8208;rich domains act as matrix while the NDA&#8208;poor domains with higher rigidity form oriented nanofibers to achieve self&#8208;reinforcement. The resultant NFRCs possess high glass transition temperature (Tg &gt; 220 &#176;C) and storage modulus (E&#8217; = 0.1&#160;GPa at 350 &#176;C), which are far beyond existing triboelectric polymers, typically Tg &lt; 110 &#176;C and E&#8217; &lt; 0.1&#160;MPa (flowable) at 350 &#176;C. Furthermore, NFRC based TENG exhibits superior electrical output performance and retention rate (&gt; 90%) after reprocessing. Overall, this work offers a new design principle to prepare self&#8208;reinforced composites, which paves a way to explore high performance materials.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Regulated Sulfur Conversion in High&#8208;Content Carbon Layer Confined Sulfur Cathode Maximizes Voltage and Rate Capability of K&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;molecule/covalent sulfur is confined in carbon layers (SMCS@C) with a record&#8208;high SMCS content of 74.1&#160;wt%. A novel FSI&#8722; regulated sulfur conversion chemistry is observed in K&#8211;S battery, leading to fast and more efficient S conversion. The SMCS@C//K full cells show energy/power densities of 72.8 Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and 873.2 W&#160;kg&#8722;1, respectively, at 3&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Potassium&#8211;sulfur (K&#8211;S) batteries have attracted attention in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. Small&#8208;molecule/covalent sulfur (SMCS) can help to avoid the shuttle effect of polysulfide ions via solid&#8211;solid sulfur conversion. However, the content of SMCS is relatively low (&#8804;40%), and solid&#8211;solid reactions cause sluggish kinetics and low discharge potentials. Herein, SMCS is confined in turbo carbon layers with a content of &#8776;74.1&#160;wt% via a C/S co&#8208;deposition process. In the K&#8211;S battery assembled by using as&#8208;fabricated SMCS@C as cathode and KFSI&#8208;EC/DEC as an electrolyte, anion&#8208;regulated two&#8208;plateau solid&#8208;state S conversion chemistry and a novel high discharge potential plateau at 2.5&#8211;2.0&#160;V with a remarkable reversible capacity of 384&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 3&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles are found. The SMCS@C||K full cell showed energy and power density of 72.8&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and 873.2&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1, respectively, at 3&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Mechanism&#160;studies&#160;reveal&#160;that the&#160;enlarged carbon layer space enables the diffusion of K+&#8208;FSI&#8208;&#160;ion pairs, and the coulombic attraction between them accelerates their diffusion in SMCS@C. In addition, FSI&#8722;&#160;regulates sulfur conversion in situ inside the&#160;carbon layers along a two&#8208;plateau solid&#8208;state reaction pathway, which lowers the free energy and weakens the S&#9472;S bond of intermediates, leading to faster and more efficient S conversion.

         <title>Tailoring Graphite into Subnanometer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphite is tailored into subnanometer graphene by an all&#8208;physical top&#8211;down method. Compared with graphene nanosheets and quantum sheets, subnanometer graphene demonstrates comprehensively and extremely enhanced performances in photoluminescence and nonlinear saturation absorption.








Abstract
Within the intersection of materials science and nanoscience/technology, extremely downsized (including quantum&#8208;sized and subnanometer&#8208;sized) materials attract increasing interest.

         <title>Vicious Cycle&#8208;Breaking Lipid Nanoparticles Remodeling Multicellular Crosstalk to Reverse Liver Fibrosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manuscript prompts a vicious cycle breaking therapy to terminate the endless malignant interplay among various pathological hepatic cells in liver fibrosis. Far beyond single cell&#8208;centric approaches, the precise regulation of cellular crosstalk of &#8220;hepatic stellate cells&#8208;liver sinusoidal endothelial cells&#8208;hepatocytes&#8221; shows synergetic effect in two animal models and reverses the vicious cycle back to the virtuous loop.








Abstract
During liver fibrogenesis, the reciprocal crosstalk among capillarized liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and dysfunctional hepatocytes constructs a self&#8208;amplifying vicious cycle, greatly exacerbating the disease condition and weakening therapeutic effect. Limited by the malignant cellular interactions, the previous single&#8208;cell centric treatment approaches show unsatisfactory efficacy and fail to meet clinical demand. Herein, a vicious cycle&#8208;breaking strategy is proposed to target and repair pathological cells separately to terminate the malignant progression of liver fibrosis. Chondroitin sulfate&#8208;modified and vismodegib&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (CS&#8208;NPs/VDG) are designed to efficiently normalize the fenestrae phenotype of LSECs and restore HSCs to quiescent state by inhibiting Hedgehog signaling pathway. In addition, glycyrrhetinic acid&#8208;modified and silybin&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (GA&#8208;NPs/SIB) are prepared to restore hepatocytes function by relieving oxidative stress. The results show successful interruption of vicious cycle as well as distinct fibrosis resolution in two animal models through multiregulation of the pathological cells. This work not only highlights the significance of modulating cellular crosstalk but also provides a promising avenue for developing antifibrotic regimens.

         <title>Spectral Engineering of Optical Microresonators in Anisotropic Lithium Niobate Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arbitrary spectral engineering of optical microresonators is demonstrated in the anisotropic lithium niobate platform using gradient&#8208;design photonic crystal rings (PhCR), and a &#8220;mirror&#8221; is constructed in the synthetic frequency dimension based on an actively&#8208;modulated gradient&#8208;PhCR. This work opens up new paths toward arbitrary control of electro&#8208;optic comb spectral shapes and exploration of novel physics in the frequency degree of freedom.








Abstract
On&#8208;chip optical microresonators are essential building blocks in integrated optics. The ability to arbitrarily engineer their resonant frequencies is crucial for exploring novel physics in synthetic frequency dimensions and practical applications like nonlinear optical parametric processes and dispersion&#8208;engineered frequency comb generation. Photonic crystal ring (PhCR) resonators are a versatile tool for such arbitrary frequency engineering, by controllably creating mode splitting at selected resonances. To date, these PhCRs have mostly been demonstrated in isotropic photonic materials, while such engineering can be significantly more complicated in anisotropic platforms that often offer more fruitful optical properties. Here, the spectral engineering of chip&#8208;scale optical microresonators is realized in the anisotropic lithium niobate (LN) crystal by a gradient design that precisely compensates for variations in both refractive index and perturbation strength. Controllable frequency splitting is experimentally demonstrated at single and multiple selected resonances in LN PhCR resonators with different sizes, while maintaining high quality&#8208;factors up to 1 &#215; 106. Moreover, a sharp boundary is experimentally constructed in the synthetic frequency dimension based on an actively modulated x&#8208;cut LN gradient&#8208;PhCR, opening up new paths toward the arbitrary control of electro&#8208;optic comb spectral shapes and exploration of novel physics in the frequency degree of freedom.

         <title>Crystallographic and Photophysical Analysis on Facet&#8208;Controlled Defect&#8208;Free Blue&#8208;Emitting Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The burgeoning demand for commercializing self&#8208;luminescing quantum dots (QD) light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) has stimulated extensive research into environmentally friendly and efficient QD materials. Hydrofluoric acid (HF) additive improves photoluminescence (PL) properties of blue&#8208;emitting ZnSeTe QDs, ultimately reaching a remarkable quantum yield (QY) of 97% with an ultra&#8208;narrow peak width of 14&#160;nm after sufficient HF addition. The improvement in optical properties of the QDs is accompanied by a morphology change of the particles, forming cubic&#8208;shaped defect&#8208;free ZnSeTe QDs characterized by a zinc&#8208;blende crystal structure. This treatment improves QD emitting properties by facilitating facet&#8208;specific growth, selectively exposing stabilized (100) facets, and reducing the lattice disorders. The facet&#8208;specific growth process gives rise to defect&#8208;free monodisperse cubic dots that exhibit remarkably narrow and homogeneous PL spectra. Meticulous time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic studies allow an understanding of the correlation between ZnSeTe QDs particle shape and performance following HF addition. These investigations shed light on the intricacies of the growth mechanism and the factors influencing the PL efficiency of the resulting QDs. The findings significantly contribute to understanding the role of HF treatment in tailoring the optical properties of ZnSeTe QDs, thereby bringing us closer to the realization of highly efficient and bright QD&#8208;LEDs for various practical applications.

         <title>Restructuring Electrolyte Solvation by a Versatile Diluent Toward Beyond 99.9% Coulombic Efficiency of Sodium Plating/Stripping at Ultralow Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvation structure of a conventional ether&#8208;based electrolyte (1 m NaPF6 in diglyme (G2)) is reconfigured by facile cyclic ether (1,3&#8208;dioxolane, DOL) dilution for a record&#8208;high Na plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency beyond 99.9% at &#8722;55 &#176;C. The DOL dilution not only increases Na+ ion conductivity and desolvation in the solvates but also alters the LUMO distribution toward preferential anion decomposition.








Abstract
The reversible and durable operation of sodium metal batteries at low temperatures (LT) is essential for cold&#8208;climate applications but is plagued by dendritic Na plating and unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). Current Coulombic efficiencies of sodium plating/stripping at LT fall far below 99.9%, representing a significant performance gap yet to be filled. Here, the solvation structure of the conventional 1&#160;m NaPF6 in diglyme electrolyte by facile cyclic ether (1,3&#8208;dioxolane, DOL) dilution is efficiently reconfigured. DOL diluents help shield the Na+&#8208;PF6&#8722; Coulombic interaction and intermolecular forces of diglyme, leading to anomalously high Na+&#8208;ion conductivity. Besides, DOL participates in the solvation sheath and weakens the chelation of Na+ by diglyme for facilitated desolvation. More importantly, it promotes concentrated electron cloud distribution around PF6&#8722; in the solvates and promotes their preferential decomposition. A desired inorganic&#8208;rich SEI is generated with compositional uniformity, high ionic conductivity, and high Young's modulus. Consequently, a record&#8208;high Coulombic efficiency over 99.9% is achieved at an ultralow temperature of &#8722;55&#160;&#176;C, and a 1 Ah capacity pouch cell of initial anode&#8208;free sodium metal battery retains 95% of the first discharge capacity over 100 cycles at &#8722;25&#160;&#176;C. This study thus provides new insights for formulating electrolytes toward increased Na reversibility at LT.

         <title>Single&#8208;Layer Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode with Trap&#8208;Free Host Beats Power Efficiency and Lifetime of Multilayer Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;layer organic light&#8208;emitting diodes offer many benefits compared to multilayer devices. However, in such single&#8208;layer devices, balanced charge transport is a prerequisite, which is uncommon in organic emitters. Here, a trap&#8208;free host is employed to achieve balanced charge transport in the emissive layer, resulting in lower operating voltage, higher power efficiency, and greatly extended lifetime compared to multilayer devices.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) employing a single active layer potentially offer a number of benefits compared to multilayer devices; reduced number of materials and deposition steps, potential for solution processing, and reduced operating voltage due to the absence of heterojunctions. However, for single&#8208;layer OLEDs to achieve efficiencies approaching those of multilayer devices, balanced charge transport is a prerequisite. This requirement excludes many efficient emitters based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) that exhibit electron trapping, such as the green&#8208;emitting bis(4&#8208;(9,9&#8208;dimethylacridin&#8208;10(9H)&#8208;yl)phenyl)methanone (DMAC&#8208;BP). By employing a recently developed trap&#8208;free large band gap material as a host for DMAC&#8208;BP, nearly balanced charge transport is achieved. The single&#8208;layer OLED reaches an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 19.6%, which is comparable to the reported EQEs of 18.9&#8211;21% for multilayer devices, but achieves a record power efficiency for DMAC&#8208;BP OLEDs of 82&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1, clearly surpassing the reported multilayer power efficiencies of 52.9&#8211;59&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1. In addition, the operational stability is greatly improved compared to multilayer devices and the use of conventional host materials in combination with DMAC&#8208;BP as an emitter. Next to the obvious reduction in production costs, single&#8208;layer OLEDs therefore also offer the advantage of reduced energy consumption and enhanced stability.

         <title>Optimizing Edge Active Sites via Intrinsic In&#8208;Plane Iridium Deficiency in Layered Iridium Oxides for Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase transition of a bulk layered iridate Na2IrO3 in acid and subsequent exfoliation produces iridium oxide nanosheets. The nanosheet material consists of robust honeycomb&#8208;type layers of edge&#8208;sharing IrO6 octahedral framework, creating a unique local environment of edge active sites&#8212;the edge iridium site adjacent to one intrinsic iridium vacancy&#8212;for effectively catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Improving catalytic activity of surface iridium sites without compromising catalytic stability is the core task of designing more efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid. This work presents phase transition of a bulk layered iridate Na2IrO3 in acid solution at room temperature, and subsequent exfoliation to produce 2D iridium oxide nanosheets with around 4&#160;nm thickness. The nanosheets consist of OH&#8208;terminated, honeycomb&#8208;type layers of edge&#8208;sharing IrO6 octahedral framework with intrinsic in&#8208;plane iridium deficiency. The nanosheet material is among the most active Ir&#8208;based catalysts reported for acidic OER and gives an iridium mass activity improvement up to a factor of 16.5 over rutile IrO2 nanoparticles. The material also exhibits good catalytic and structural stability and retains the catalytic activity for more than 1300 h. The combined experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that edge Ir sites of the layer are active centers for OER, with structural hydroxyl groups participating in the catalytic cycle of OER via a non&#8208;traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism. The existence of intrinsic in&#8208;plane iridium deficiency is the key to building a unique local environment of edge active sites that have optimal surface oxygen adsorption properties and thereby high catalytic activity.

         <title>Dual Polymerized Y&#8208;Acceptors of Distinct&#8208;Dimensionality Create Neuron&#8208;Like Interpenetrating Hierarchical Network towards Efficient and Stable All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A 3D Y&#8208;branched regio&#8208;regular polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptor PYBF is synthesized, which exhibits more crystalline and face&#8208;on&#8208;oriented domains. 1D PYIT is further introduced into the PM6:PYBF system for forming the interconnective neuron&#8208;like dual&#8208;acceptor domains. Consequently, the device realizes a best power conversion efficiency of &#8776;17% with simultaneously enhanced stabilities.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells have garnered particular attention thanks to their superior thermal, photo, and mechanical stabilities for large&#8208;scale manufacturing, yet the performance enhancement remains largely restrained by inherent morphological challenges of the bulk&#8208;heterojunction active layer. Herein, a 3D Y&#8208;branched polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptor named PYBF, characteristic of high molecular weight and glass transition temperature, is designed and synthesized by precisely linking C3h&#8208;symmetric benzotrifuran with Y6 acceptors. In comparison to the benchmark thiophene&#8208;bridged linear PYIT acceptor, an optical blue&#8208;shift absorption is observed for PYBF yet a slightly higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.7% (vs 15.14%) is obtained when paired with polymer donor PM6, which benefit from the more crystalline and face&#8208;on&#8208;oriented PYBF domains. However, the star&#8208;like bulky structure of PYBF results in the nucleation&#8208;growth dominant phase&#8208;separation in polymeric blends, which generates stumpy droplet&#8208;like acceptor fibrils and impairs the continuity of acceptor phases. This issue is however surprisingly resolved by incorporating a small amount of PYIT, which leads to the formation of the more interconnective neuron&#8208;like dual&#8208;acceptor domains by long&#8208;chain entanglements of linear acceptors and alleviates bimolecular recombination. Thus, the champion device realizes a respectable PCE of up to &#8776;17% and importantly exhibits thermal and storage stabilities superior to the linear counterpart.

         <title>Towards The Commercialization of Perovskite Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite photovoltaic devices are undergoing rapid development and have reached a certified power conversion efficiency of 26.1% at the cell level. Tremendous efforts in material and device engineering have also increased moisture, heat, and light&#8208;related stability. Moreover, the solution&#8208;process nature makes the fabrication process of perovskite photovoltaic devices feasible and compatible with some mature high&#8208;volume manufacturing techniques. All these features render perovskite solar modules suitable for terawatt&#8208;scale energy production with a low levelized cost of electricity. In this review, we first introduce the current status of perovskite solar cells and modules and their potential applications. Then we identify critical challenges in their commercialization and propose the corresponding solutions, including developing strategies to realize high&#8208;quality films over a large area to further improve power conversion efficiency and stability to meet the commercial demands. Finally, we put forward some potential development directions and issues requiring attention in the future, mainly focusing on further dealing with toxicity and recycling of the whole device, and the attainment of highly efficient perovskite&#8208;based tandem modules, which could reduce the environmental impact and accelerate the LCOE reduction.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Synthetic Rotary Motors in Lipid Membranes Induce Shape Changes Through Membrane Expansion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In biology, membranes are the key structures to separate and spatially organize cellular reaction systems. Their rich dynamics and transformations during the cell cycle are orchestrated by specific membrane&#8208;targeted molecular machineries many of which operate through energy dissipation. Likewise, man&#8208;made molecular rotary motors powered by light have previously shown drastic effects on cellular systems, but their physical roles on and within lipid membranes remain largely unexplored. Here we&#160;systematically investigate the impact of rotary molecular motors on well&#8208;defined biological membrane systems, focusing on supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) and giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Notably, we&#160;observe dramatic mechanical transformations of these systems upon motor irradiation, indicative of motor&#8208;induced membrane expansion. We&#160;systematically explore the influence of several factors on this phenomenon, such as motor concentration and membrane composition, and find that in particular, membrane fluidity plays a crucial role in motor&#8208;induced deformations. At the same time, only minor contributions from local heating and singlet oxygen generation are observed. Most remarkably, we&#160;find that membrane area expansion under the influence of the motors continues as long as irradiation is maintained, and the system stays out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium. Overall, this research contributes to a comprehensive understanding of how molecular motors interact with biological membranes, elucidating the multifaceted factors that govern membrane responses and shape transitions in the presence of these remarkable molecular machines, thereby supporting their future applications in chemical&#160;biology.

         <title>A Microphase&#8208;Separated Design toward an All&#8208;Round Ionic Hydrogel with Discriminable and Anti&#8208;Disturbance Multisensory Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;round elastic ionic hydrogel with microphase&#8208;separated structure is designed. This ionic hydrogel exhibits low Young's modulus, large stretchability, high resilience, unique strain&#8208;stiffening behavior, excellent fatigue tolerance, high ionic conductivity, and anti&#8208;freezing capability. These properties allow the ionic hydrogel to operate as a stretchable multimodal sensor that can detect and decouple multiple stimuli with high discriminability, sensitivity, and anti&#8208;disturbance ability.








Abstract
Stretchable ionic hydrogels with superior all&#8208;round properties that can detect multimodal sensations with excellent discriminability and robustness against external disturbances are highly required for artificial electronic skinapplications. However, some critical material parameters exhibit intrinsic tradeoffs with each other&#160;for most ionic hydrogels. Here, a microphase&#8208;separated hydrogel is demonstrated by combining three strategies: (1) using of a low crosslinker/monomer ratio to obtain highly entangled polymer chains as the first network; (2) the introduction of zwitterions into the first network; (3) the synthesis of an ultrasoft polyelectrolyte as the second network. This all&#8208;round elastic ionic hydrogel exhibits a low Young's modulus (&lt; 60&#160;kPa), large stretchability (&gt; 900%), high resilience (&gt; 95%), unique strain&#8208;stiffening behavior, excellent fatigue tolerance, high ionic conductivity (&gt; 2.0 S&#160;m&#8315;1), and anti&#8208;freezing capability, which have not been achieved before. These properties allow the ionic hydrogel to operate as a stretchable multimodal sensor that can detect and decouple multiple stimuli (temperature, pressure, and proximity) with excellent discriminability, high sensitivity, and strong sensing&#8208;robustness against strains or temperature perturbations. The ionic hydrogel sensor exhibits great potential for intelligent electronic skin applications such as reliable health monitoring and accurate object identification.

         <title>Ordered Mesoporous Crystalline Frameworks Toward Promising Energy Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous crystalline frameworks (MCFs) with functional frameworks, tailored porosity, and high surface areas garner significant attention. This review focuses on their rational synthesis, unique structures, and energy applications, emphasizes crystallization approaches and structural control, and provides MCF components (metals, metal oxides, sulfides, metal&#8211;organic frameworks) and applications in batteries, supercapacitors, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis.








Abstract
Ordered mesoporous crystalline frameworks (MCFs), which possess both functional frameworks and well&#8208;defined porosity, receive considerable attention because of their unique properties including high surface areas, large pore sizes, tailored porous structures, and compositions. Construction of novel crystalline mesoporous architectures that allows for rich accessible active sites and efficient mass transfer is envisaged to offer ample opportunities for potential energy&#8208;related applications. In this review, the rational synthesis, unique structures, and energy applications of MCFs are the main focus. After summarizing the synthetic approaches, an emphasis is placed on the delicate control of crystallites, mesophases, and nano&#8208;architectures by concluding basic principles and showing representative examples. Afterward, the currently fabricated components of MCFs such as metals, metal oxides, metal sulfides, and metal&#8211;organic frameworks are described in sequence. Further, typical applications of MCFs in rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis are highlighted. This review ends with the possible development and synthetic challenges of MCFs as well as a future prospect for high&#8208;efficiency energy applications, which underscores a pathway for developing advanced materials.

         <title>Revealing the Substrate Constraint Effect on the Thermodynamic Behaviour of the Pd&#8211;H through Capacitive&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Sorption Measurement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substrate constraint effect on the metal&#8211;hydrogen system can result in significant mechanical stress during hydrogenation&#8208;induced expansion. However, a quantitative study of this effect is challenging due to the limitations in measurement techniques. In this study, a capacitive&#8208;based measurement system is employed to reveal the influence of substrate constraint on the thermodynamic behavior of the Pd&#8211;H system.








Abstract
Mechanical constraints imposed on the Pd&#8211;H system can induce significant strain upon hydrogenation&#8208;induced expansion, potentially leading to changes in the thermodynamic behavior, such as the phase&#8208;transition pressure. However, the investigation of the constraint effect is often tricky due to the lack of simple experimental techniques for measuring hydrogenation&#8208;induced expansion. In this study, a capacitive&#8208;based measurement system is developed to monitor hydrogenation&#8208;induced areal expansion, which allows us to control and evaluate the magnitude of the substrate constraint. By using the measurement technique, the influence of substrate constraint intensity on the thermodynamic behavior of the Pd&#8211;H system is investigated. Through experiments with different constraint intensities, it is found that the diffefrence in the constraint intensity minimally affects the phase&#8208;transition pressure when the Pd&#8211;H system allows the release of constraint stress through plastic deformation. These experiments can improve the understanding of the substrate constraint behaviours of Pd&#8211;H systems allowing plastic deformation while demonstrating the potential of capacitive&#8208;based measurement systems to study the mechanical&#8211;thermodynamic coupling of M&#8211;H systems.

         <title>Regulation of Coordination Chemistry for Ultrastable Layered Oxide Cathode Materials of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrastable O3&#8208;Na0.898K0.058Ni0.396Fe0.098Mn0.396Ti0.092O2 is reported with rigid KO6 pillars and flexible TiO6 octahedra via multisite substitution to regulate its coordination chemistry. The enhanced hybridization of Ni(3deg*)&#8208;O(2p) and strong Coulombic repulsion between the interlayers effectively mitigate the undesired O3&#8211;O'3 phase transition and Ni/Fe migration for ultrastable electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Layered transition&#8208;metal (TM) oxide cathodes have attracted growing attention in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, their practical implementation is plagued by Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion and irreversible cation migration, leading to severe voltage decay and structure instability. Herein, O3&#8208;Na0.898K0.058Ni0.396Fe0.098Mn0.396Ti0.092O2 (KT&#8208;NFM) is reported as an ultrastable cathode material via multisite substitution with rigid KO6 pillars and flexible TiO6 octahedra. The K pillars induce contracted TMO2 slabs and their strong Coulombic repulsion to inhibit Ni/Fe migration; and Ti incorporation reinforces the hybridization of Ni(3deg*)&#8208;O(2p) to mitigate the undesired O3&#8211;O'3 phase transition. These enable the reversible redox of Ni2+&#8596;Ni3.20+ and Fe3+&#8596;Fe3.69+ for 138.6 mAh g&#8722;1 and ultrastable cycles with &gt;90% capacity retention after 2000 cycles in a pouch cell of KT&#8208;NFM||hard carbon. This will provide insights into the design of ultrastable layered cathode materials of sodium&#8208;ion batteries and beyond.

         <title>Engineering Semi&#8208;Reversed Quantum Well Photocatalysts for Highly&#8208;Efficient Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Fuels Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel strategy of quantum&#8208;confinement&#8208;enhanced charge&#8208;separation is proposed and demonstrated in the well&#8208;designed model photocatalyst of CdS/TiO2/CdS semi&#8208;reversed quantum&#8208;well. This kind of promising photocatalysts is capable of not only confining the photo&#8208;generated electrons nearby the hetero&#8208;interfacial active&#8208;sites, but also accelerating the electron injection to the adsorbed reactants on the interfacial active&#8208;sites, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity for solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuels conversion.








Abstract
Semiconductor quantum wells (QWs) exhibit high charge&#8208;utilization efficiency for light&#8208;emitting applications due to their strong charge confinement effect. Inspired by this effect, herein, this work proposes a new idea to significantly improve the photo&#8208;generated charge separation for attaining a highly&#8208;efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuels conversion process through &#8220;semi&#8208;reversing&#8221; the conventional QWs to confine only the photo&#8208;generated electrons. This electron confinement&#8208;improved charge separation is implemented in the well&#8208;designed model of the CdS/TiO2/CdS semi&#8208;reversed QW (SRQW) structure. The latter is fabricated by selectively assembling CdS quantum dots (QDs) onto the {101} facets (ultra&#8208;thin edge regions) of the TiO2 nanosheets (NSs). Upon light excitation, the photo&#8208;generated electrons of SRQW can be confined on the TiO2&#8208;{101} facets in the vicinity of the CdS/TiO2 hetero&#8208;interface. Thereby, the continuous multi&#8208;electron injection to the adsorbed reactants on the interfacial active&#8208;sites is significantly accelerated. Thus, the CdS/TiO2/CdS SRQW exhibits &#8776;35.7 and &#8776;56.0&#8208;fold enhancements on the photocatalytic activities for water and CO2 reduction, respectively, compared to those of pure TiO2. Correspondingly, its CH4&#8208;product selectivity is increased by &#8776;180%.

     alt="Engineering Semi-Reversed Quantum Well Photocatalysts for Highly-Efficient Solar-to-Fuels Conversion"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel strategy of quantum-confinement-enhanced charge-separation is proposed and demonstrated in the well-designed model photocatalyst of CdS/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CdS semi-reversed quantum-well. This kind of promising photocatalysts is capable of not only confining the photo-generated electrons nearby the hetero-interfacial active-sites, but also accelerating the electron injection to the adsorbed reactants on the interfacial active-sites, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity for solar-to-fuels conversion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semiconductor quantum wells (QWs) exhibit high charge-utilization efficiency for light-emitting applications due to their strong charge confinement effect. Inspired by this effect, herein, this work proposes a new idea to significantly improve the photo-generated charge separation for attaining a highly-efficient solar-to-fuels conversion process through &#8220;semi-reversing&#8221; the conventional QWs to confine only the photo-generated electrons. This electron confinement-improved charge separation is implemented in the well-designed model of the CdS/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CdS semi-reversed QW (SRQW) structure. The latter is fabricated by selectively assembling CdS quantum dots (QDs) onto the {101} facets (ultra-thin edge regions) of the TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets (NSs). Upon light excitation, the photo-generated electrons of SRQW can be confined on the TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-{101} facets in the vicinity of the CdS/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hetero-interface. Thereby, the continuous multi-electron injection to the adsorbed reactants on the interfacial active-sites is significantly accelerated. Thus, the CdS/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CdS SRQW exhibits &#8776;35.7 and &#8776;56.0-fold enhancements on the photocatalytic activities for water and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, respectively, compared to those of pure TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Correspondingly, its CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-product selectivity is increased by &#8776;180%. This work provides a novel charge separation mechanism, which is of great importance for the design of the next-generation quantum-sized photocatalysts for solar-to-fuels conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Analogous Design of a Microlayered Silicon Oxide&#8208;Based Electrode to the General Electrode Structure for Thin&#8208;Film Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film electrodes are designed similar to traditional lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) slurry formulations, including active material, conductive agent, and binder. Using mid&#8208;frequency sputtering with a hybrid target containing SiOx nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and polytetrafluoroethylene, a thin&#8208;film SiOx&#8208;based composite electrode is successfully fabricated within plasma&#8208;polymerized fluorocarbon (PPFC). The SiOx/PPFC composite thin&#8208;film exhibits improved electronic conductivity, elasticity, and hardness compared to pure SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film. The electrochemical performance of the SiOx/PPFC composite thin&#8208;film shows remarkable cycling stability.








Abstract
Development of miniaturized thin&#8208;film lithium&#8208;ion batteries (TF&#8208;LIBs) using vacuum deposition techniques is crucial for low&#8208;scale applications, but addressing low energy density remains a challenge. In this work, structures analogous to SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film electrodes are designed with close resemblance to traditional LIB slurry formulations including active material, conductive agent, and binder. The thin&#8208;film is produced using mid&#8208;frequency sputtering with a single hybrid target consisting of SiOx nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and polytetrafluoroethylene. The thin&#8208;film SiOx/PPFC (plasma&#8208;polymerized fluorocarbon) involves a combination of SiOx and conductive carbon within the PPFC matrix. This results in enhanced electronic conductivity and superior elasticity and hardness in comparison to a conventional pure SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film. The electrochemical performance of the half&#8208;cell consisting of thin&#8208;film SiOx/PPFC demonstrates remarkable cycling stability, with a capacity retention of 74.8% up to the 1000th cycle at 0.5 C. In addition, a full cell using the LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 thin&#8208;film as the cathode material exhibits an exceptional initial capacity of &#8776;120 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C and cycle performance, marked by a capacity retention of 90.8% from the first cycle to the 500th cycle at a 1 C rate. This work will be a stepping stone for the AM/CB/B composite electrodes in TF&#8208;LIBs.

         <title>Constructing Ultra&#8208;Shallow Near&#8208;Edge States for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient doping of hybrid perovskites holds the potential to further advance solar cell efficiency. This study presents a generic strategy for perovskite doping by constructing ultra&#8208;shallow near&#8208;edge states. These states can effectively prolong electron&#8208;hole recombination through efficient trap and de&#8208;trap processes, resulting in over 25% efficiency in inverted perovskite solar cells with superior long&#8208;term operational stability.








Abstract
Electronic band structure engineering of metal&#8208;halide perovskites (MHP) lies at the core of fundamental materials research and photovoltaic applications. However, reconfiguring the band structures in MHP for optimized electronic properties remains challenging. This article reports a generic strategy for constructing near&#8208;edge states to improve carrier properties, leading to enhanced device performances. The near&#8208;edge states are designed around the valence band edge using theoretical prediction and constructed through tailored material engineering. These states are experimentally revealed with activation energies of around 23 milli&#8208;electron volts by temperature&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy. Such small activation energies enable prolonged carrier lifetime with efficient carrier transition dynamics and low non&#8208;radiative recombination losses, as corroborated by the millisecond lifetimes of microwave conductivity. By constructing near&#8208;edge states in positive&#8208;intrinsic&#8208;negative inverted cells, a champion efficiency of 25.4% (25.0% certified) for a 0.07&#8208;cm2 cell and 23.6% (22.7% certified) for a 1&#8208;cm2 cell is achieved. The most stable encapsulated cell retains 90% of its initial efficiency after 1100 h of maximum power point tracking under one sun illumination (100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) at 65 &#176;C in ambient air.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Oligopeptoplex&#8208;Loaded Dissolving Microneedles for Adipocyte&#8208;Targeted Anti&#8208;Obesity Gene Therapy</title>

Dissolvable hyaluronic acid&#8208;based self&#8208;locking microneedle patch loaded with self&#8208;assembled oligopeptoplex optimized for targeted delivery of FABPs&#8208;silencing shRNA to obese adipocytes represents significant FABPs downregulation in adipose tissue, reduction in body weight, and amelioration of insulin resistance, potentiating it as a novel transdermal gene delivery platform for obesity and obesity&#8208;induced metabolic syndrome.








Abstract
Advancements in gene delivery systems are pivotal for gene&#8208;based therapeutics in oncological, inflammatory, and infectious diseases. This study delineates the design of a self&#8208;assembled oligopeptoplex (SA&#8208;OP) optimized for shRNA delivery to adipocytes, targeting obesity and associated metabolic syndromes. Conventional systems face challenges, including instability due to electrostatic interactions between genetic materials and cationic oligopeptides. Additionally, repeated injections induce discomfort and compromise patient well&#8208;being. To circumvent these issues, a dissolvable hyaluronic acid&#8208;based, self&#8208;locking microneedle (LMN) patch is developed, with improved micro&#8208;dose efficiency, for precise SA&#8208;OP delivery. This platform offers pain&#8208;free administration and improved SA&#8208;OP storage stability. In vitro studies in 3T3&#8208;L1 cells demonstrated improvements in SA&#8208;OP preservation and gene silencing efficacy. In vivo evaluation in a mice model of diet&#8208;induced type 2 diabetes yielded significant gene silencing in adipose tissue and a 21.92 &#177; 2.51% reduction in body weight with minimum relapse risk at 6&#8208;weeks post&#8208;treatment, representing a superior therapeutic efficacy in a truncated timeframe relative to the GLP&#8208;1 analogues currently available on the market. Additionally, SA&#8208;OP (LMN) mitigated insulin resistance, inflammation, and hepatic steatosis. These findings establish SA&#8208;OP (LMN) as a robust, minimally invasive transdermal gene delivery platform with prolonged storage stability for treating obesity and its metabolic comorbidities.

         <title>Mitochondrial Localized In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly Reprogramming Tumor Immune and Metabolic Microenvironment for Enhanced Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optimized mitochondrial localized in situ self&#8208;assembly system is constructed to trigger pro&#8208;death mitophagy, which ultimately simultaneously activates the innate and adaptive immunities of tumor cells to benefit various cancer therapies, including radiotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade therapy. This strategy highlights the spatiotemporal regulation of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly on subcellular organelles to determine cancer cell fate and enhance cancer therapy.








Abstract
The inherent immune and metabolic tumor microenvironment (TME) of most solid tumors adversely affect the antitumor efficacy of various treatments, which is an urgent issue to be solved in clinical cancer therapy. In this study, a mitochondrial localized in situ self&#8208;assembly system is constructed to remodel the TME by improving immunogenicity and disrupting the metabolic plasticity of cancer cells. The peptide&#8208;based drug delivery system can be pre&#8208;assembled into nanomicelles in vitro and form functional nanofibers on mitochondria through a cascade&#8208;responsive process involving reductive release, targeted enrichment, and in situ self&#8208;assembly. The organelle&#8208;specific in situ self&#8208;assemblyeffectively switches the role of mitophagy from pro&#8208;survival to pro&#8208;death, which finally induces intense endoplasmic reticulum stress and atypical type II immunogenic cell death. Disintegration of the mitochondrial ultrastructure also impedes the metabolic plasticity of tumor cells, which greatly promotes the immunosuppresive TME remodeling into an immunostimulatory TME. Ultimately, the mitochondrial localized in situ self&#8208;assembly system effectively suppresses tumor metastases, and converts cold tumors into hot tumors with enhanced sensitivity to radiotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade therapy.

     alt="Mitochondrial Localized In Situ Self-Assembly Reprogramming Tumor Immune and Metabolic Microenvironment for Enhanced Cancer Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An optimized mitochondrial localized in situ self-assembly system is constructed to trigger pro-death mitophagy, which ultimately simultaneously activates the innate and adaptive immunities of tumor cells to benefit various cancer therapies, including radiotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade therapy. This strategy highlights the spatiotemporal regulation of supramolecular self-assembly on subcellular organelles to determine cancer cell fate and enhance cancer therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inherent immune and metabolic tumor microenvironment (TME) of most solid tumors adversely affect the antitumor efficacy of various treatments, which is an urgent issue to be solved in clinical cancer therapy. In this study, a mitochondrial localized in situ self-assembly system is constructed to remodel the TME by improving immunogenicity and disrupting the metabolic plasticity of cancer cells. The peptide-based drug delivery system can be pre-assembled into nanomicelles in vitro and form functional nanofibers on mitochondria through a cascade-responsive process involving reductive release, targeted enrichment, and in situ self-assembly. The organelle-specific in situ self-assemblyeffectively switches the role of mitophagy from pro-survival to pro-death, which finally induces intense endoplasmic reticulum stress and atypical type II immunogenic cell death. Disintegration of the mitochondrial ultrastructure also impedes the metabolic plasticity of tumor cells, which greatly promotes the immunosuppresive TME remodeling into an immunostimulatory TME. Ultimately, the mitochondrial localized in situ self-assembly system effectively suppresses tumor metastases, and converts cold tumors into hot tumors with enhanced sensitivity to radiotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade therapy. This study offers a universal strategy for spatiotemporally controlling supramolecular self-assembly on sub-organelles to determine cancer cell fate and enhance cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Polymer Framework Strategy Enabling Printable and Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells by Mitigating &#8220;Coffee Ring&#8221; Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a 3D framework formed by spontaneous cross&#8208;linking is introduced in perovskite precursor to increase their viscosity and homogenize their heat diffusion coefficient. As a result, the Marangoni convection intensity during meniscus printing is properly controlled, thus ensuring the deposition of high&#8208;quality perovskite films and significantly enhancing the reproducibility in printing efficient photovoltaics by mitigating the coffee&#8208;ring effect.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites are considered ideal candidates for future photovoltaic applications due to their excellent photovoltaic properties. Although solution&#8208;printed manufacturing has shown inherent potential for the low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;throughput production of thin&#8208;film semiconductor electronics, the high&#8208;quality and high&#8208;reproducibility deposition of large&#8208;area perovskite remains a bottleneck that restricts their commercialization due to the droplet coffee&#8208;ring effect (CRE). In this study, these issues are addressed by introducing an in situ polymer framework. The 3D framework formed by spontaneous cross&#8208;linking improves the precursor viscosity and homogenizes its heat diffusion coefficient, counteracting the lateral capillary flow of the colloidal particles and anchoring their flocculent movement. Thus, the Marangoni convection intensity is properly controlled to ensure high&#8208;quality perovskite films, which significantly enhances reproducibility in printing efficient photovoltaics by mitigating the CRE. Subsequently, the perovskite solar cells and modules achieve power conversion efficiencies of 23.94 and 17.53%, and exhibit positive environmental stability, retaining over 90 and 78% efficiency after storage for 2500 and 1600&#160;h, respectively. This work may serves as a foundation for exploring precursor rheology to match the homogeneous deposition requirements of perovskite photovoltaics and facilitating the advancement of their printing manufacturing and commercialization transition.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Electrochemical Synthesis of Multiyolk&#8211;Shell Nanocoils for Exceptional Photocatalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study endeavors to devise a synthesis strategy for multiyolk&#8211;shell nanocoils (mYSNC) by capitalizing on the disparate behaviors exhibited by bimetallic alloys within electrochemically programmed mild solutions. The resulting Au&#8208;FePO4 mYSNC demonstrates broad&#8208;spectrum light absorption capabilities and exhibits enhanced photocatalytic efficiency.








Abstract
Multiyolk&#8211;shell (mYS)&#160;nanostructures have garnered significant interest in various photocatalysis applications such as water splitting and waste treatment. Nonetheless, the complexity and rigorous conditions for the synthesis have hindered their widespread implementation. This study presents a one&#8208;step electrochemical strategy for synthesizing multiyolk&#8211;shell nanocoils (mYSNC), wherein multiple cores of noble metal nanoparticles, such as Au, are embedded within the hollow coil&#8208;shaped FePO4 shell structures, mitigating the challenges posed by conventional methods. By capitalizing on the dissimilar dissolution rates of bimetallic alloy nanocoils in an electrochemically programmed solution, nanocoils of different shapes and materials, including two variations of mYSNCs are successfully fabricated. The resulting Au&#8208;FePO4 mYSNCs exhibit exceptional photocatalytic performance for environmental remediation, demonstrating up to 99% degradation of methylene blue molecules within 50&#160;min and 95% degradation of tetracycline within 100&#160;min under ultraviolet&#8211;visible (UV&#8208;vis) light source. This remarkable performance can be attributed to the abundant electrochemical active sites, internal voids facilitating efficient light harvesting with coil morphology, amplified localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) at the plasmonic nanoparticle&#8208;semiconductor interface, and effective band engineering. The innovative approach utilizing bimetallic alloys demonstrates precise geometric control and design of intricate multicomponent hybrid composites, showcasing the potential for developing versatile hollow nanomaterials for catalytic applications.

         <title>Ultraflexible Wireless Imager Integrated with Organic Circuits for Broadband Infrared Thermal Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flexible imagers are currently under intensive development as versatile optical sensor arrays, designed to capture images of surfaces and internals, irrespective of their shape. A significant challenge in developing flexible imagers is extending their detection capabilities to encompass a broad spectrum of infrared light, particularly terahertz (THz) light at room temperature. This advancement is crucial for thermal and biochemical applications. In this study, a flexible infrared imager is designed using uncooled carbon nanotube (CNT) sensors and organic circuits. The CNT sensors, fabricated on ultrathin 2.4&#160;&#956;m substrates, demonstrate enhanced sensitivity across a wide infrared range, spanning from near&#8208;infrared to THz wavelengths. Moreover, they retain their characteristics under bending and crumpling. The design incorporates light&#8208;shielded organic transistors and circuits, functioning reliably under light irradiation, and amplifies THz detection signals by a factor of 10. The integration of both CNT sensors and shielded organic transistors into an 8 &#215; 8 active&#8208;sensor matrix within the imager enables sequential infrared imaging and assessment of heat sources and in&#8208;liquid chemicals through wireless communication systems. The proposed imager, offering unique functionality, shows promise for applications in biochemical analysis and soft robotics.

         <title>Polymer Molecules Adsorption&#8208;Induced Zincophilic&#8208;Hydrophobic Protective Layer Enables Highly Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinctive molecular conformation of Tween&#8208;20 electrolyte additive with both zincophilic and hydrophobic units can not only inhibit the water&#8208;related side reactions, but also induce Zn (002) oriented growth, significantly improving the cycle life and Coulombic efficiency of Zn metal anodes.








Abstract
Zn metal, as one of the most promising anode materials for aqueous batteries, suffers from uncontrollable dendrite growth and water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions, which drastically compromise its cycle life and Coulombic efficiency (CE). Herein, a nonionic amphipathic additive Tween&#8208;20 (TW20) is proposed that bears both zincophilic and hydrophobic units. The zincophilic segment of TW20 preferentially adsorbs on the Zn anode, while the hydrophobic segment is exposed on the electrolyte side, forming an electrolyte&#8208;facing hydrophobic layer that shields the anode from active water molecules. Moreover, theoretical calculation and experimental results reveal that the TW20 additive can induce the preferential growth of (002) plane by adsorbing on other facets, enabling dendrite&#8208;free Zn anodes. Benefitting from these advantages, the stability and reversibility of Zn anodes are substantially improved, reflected by stable cycling for over 2500&#160;h at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 and 500&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/5 mAh cm&#8722;2 as well as an average CE of 99.4% at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2. The full cells paired with MnO2 demonstrate a long lifespan for more than 700 cycles at 500&#160;mA g&#8722;1. This work is expected to provide a new approach to modulate Zn electrode interface chemistry for highly stable Zn anodes.

Metal halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have been considered new&#8208;generation emitters for lightings and displays due to their high photoluminescence (PL) efficiency, tunable emission wavelength, and pure emission color. However, their commercialization process is currently hindered by the challenge of mass production in a quick and environmentally friendly manner. In this study, we propose a polymer&#8208;surface&#8208;mediated mechanochemical reaction (PMR) to prepare perovskite QDs using a high&#8208;speed multifunction grinder for the first time. PMR possesses two distinctive features: (i) the ultra&#8208;high rotating speed (&gt;15000&#160;rpm) of the grinder facilitates the rapid conversion of the precursor to perovskite; (ii) the surface&#8208;rich polymer particulate ensures perovskite QDs with high dispersity, avoiding QD aggregation&#8208;induced PL quenching. Therefore, PMR could successfully manufacture green perovskite QDs with a high PL quantum yield (PLQY) exceeding 90% in a highly material&#8208; (100% yield), time&#8208; (1&#160;kg/min), and effort&#8208; (solvent&#8208;free) efficient manner. Moreover, the PMR demonstrates remarkable versatility, including synthesizing by various polymers, and producing diverse colored and Pb&#8208;free phosphors. Importantly, these phosphors featuring a combination of polymer and perovskite, are facilely processed into various solid emitters for lightings. The proposed rapid, green, and scalable approach has great potential to accelerate the commercialization of perovskite QDs.

         <title>Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off in Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Understanding &#8220;efficiency roll&#8208;off&#8221; (i.e., the drop in emission efficiency with increasing current) is critical if efficient and bright emissive technologies are to be rationally designed. Emerging thin&#8208;film light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) can be cost&#8208; and energy&#8208;efficiently fabricated by ambient&#8208;air printing by the virtue of the in&#8208;situ formation of a p&#8208;n junction doping structure. However, this in&#8208;situ doping transformation renders a meaningful efficiency analysis challenging. Herein, a method for separation and quantification of major LEC loss factors, notably the outcoupling efficiency and exciton quenching, is presented. Specifically, the position of the emissive p&#8208;n junction in common singlet&#8208;exciton emitting LECs is measured to shift markedly with increasing current, and the influence of this shift on the outcoupling efficiency quantified. It is further verified that the LEC&#8208;characteristic high electrochemical&#8208;doping concentration renders singlet&#8208;polaron quenching (SPQ) significant already at low drive current density, but also that SPQ increases super&#8208;linearly with increasing current, because of increasing polaron density in the p&#8208;n junction region. This results in that SPQ dominates singlet&#8208;singlet quenching for relevant current densities, and significantly contributes to the efficiency roll&#8208;off. This method for deciphering the LEC efficiency roll&#8208;off can contribute to a rational realization of all&#8208;printed LEC devices that are efficient at bright luminance.

         <title>A Green Asymmetric Bicyclic Co&#8208;Solvent Molecule for High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Hybridizing aqueous electrolytes with organic co&#8208;solvents is regarded as an effective strategy that can expand the stable voltage window of aqueous electrolytes while reducing salt usage and enhancing wettability, but reported organic co&#8208;solvents are usually flammable and toxic, hardly achieving compatibility between safety and electrochemical performance. Here, we report a new non&#8208;flammable and non&#8208;toxic low&#8208;salt&#8208;concentration (1.85 m) aqueous electrolyte via hybridizing with a green and sustainable organic co&#8208;solvent of isosorbide dimethyl ether (IDE) with a special asymmetric bicyclic molecular structure. Owing to the unique three&#8208;dimensional (3D) spatial molecular structure of IDE, a five&#8208;membered ring structure can be formed by binding the Li ion with the O atoms of the endo&#8208;OCH3 and opposite cyclic ether in the same plane of IDE. Meanwhile, the steric hindrance effect induced by the 3D spatial bicyclic molecular structure of IDE weakens its solvation ability with Li ions, allowing more anions to participate in the primary solvation sheath of Li ion and thus generating a robust and uniform LiF&#8208;rich SEI layer while containing elastic IDE&#8208;derived organics. Moreover, the asymmetric bicyclic IDE molecules with multiple O atoms can effectively regulate the intermolecular hydrogen bonding networks, thus reducing H2O molecule activity and expanding the electrochemical window. Such unique solvation structures and optimized hydrogen bonding networks enabled by the asymmetric bicyclic molecular structure of IDE effectively suppress electrode/electrolyte interfacial side reactions, thus achieving a 4.3&#160;V voltage window. The as&#8208;developed Li4Ti5O12(LTO)||LiMn2O4(LMO) full cell delivers outstanding cycling performance with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.35% over 450 cycles at 2 C.

         <title>4D Printed Non&#8208;Euclidean&#8208;Plate Jellyfish Inspired Soft Robot in Diverse Organic Solvents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Soft robots have the potential to assist and complement human exploration of extreme and harsh environments (i.e., organic solvents). However, soft robots with stable performance in diverse organic solvents have not been developed yet. In the current research, we fabricate a non&#8208;Euclidean&#8208;plate under&#8208;liquid soft robot inspired by jellyfish (NEP&#8208;Jelly inspired soft robot) based on phototropic liquid crystal elastomers via a 4D&#8208;programmable strategy. Specifically, the robot employs a 3D&#8208;printed non&#8208;Euclidean&#8208;plate, designed with Archimedean orientation, which undergoes autonomous deformation to release internal stress when immersed in organic solvents. With the assistance of near&#8208;infrared light illumination, organic solvent inside the robot vaporizes and generates propulsion in the form of bubble streams. The developed NEP&#8208;Jelly inspired soft robot can swim with a high degree of freedom in various organic solvents, e.g., N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide, N, N&#8208;dimethylacetamide, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, and trichloromethane, which is not reported before. Besides bionic jellyfish, various aquatic invertebrate&#8208;inspired soft robots can potentially be prepared via a similar 4D&#8208;programmable strategy.

         <title>Facilitating Inter&#8208;Skin Communication in Artificial Polymer Systems through Liquid Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chemical communication is a ubiquitous process in nature, and it has sparked interest in the development of electric&#8208;sense&#8208;based robotic perception systems with chemical components. In this study, we introduce a novel liquid crystal polymer that combines the transferring, receiving, and sensing of chemical signals, providing a new principle to achieve chemical communication in robotic systems. Our approach allows for the transfer of cargo between two polymer coatings, and the transfer can be monitored through an electrical signal. Additionally, cascade transfer can be achieved through this approach, as the transfer of cargo is not limited to only two coatings, but can continue from the second to a third coating. Furthermore, the two coatings can be infused with different reagents, and upon exchange, a reaction takes place to generate the desired species. The novel method of chemical communication that we have developed presents a notable improvement in embodied perception. This advancement facilitates human&#8208;robot and robot&#8208;robot interactions and enhances the ability of robots to efficiently and accurately perform complex tasks in their environment.

         <title>Negative Photoconductivity of Fe3GeTe2 Crystal with Native Heterostructure for Ultraviolet to Terahertz Ultra&#8208;Broadband Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Gaining insight into the photoelectric behavior of ferromagnetic materials is significant for comprehensively grasping their intrinsic properties and broadening future application fields. Here, through a specially designed Fe3GeTe2/O&#8208;Fe3GeTe2 heterostructure, we first report the broad&#8208;spectrum negative photoconductivity phenomenon of ferromagnetic nodal line semimetal Fe3GeTe2 that covers ultraviolet&#8208;visible&#8208;infrared&#8208;terahertz bands (355&#160;nm &#8722; 3000&#160;&#956;m), promising to compensate for the inadequacies of traditional optoelectronic devices. The significant suppression of photoexcitation conductivity is revealed to arise from the semimetal/oxidation (sMO) interface&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;response mechanism, in which the electron excitation origins from the semiconductor photoconductivity effect in high&#8208;energy photon region, and semimetal topological band&#8208;transition in low&#8208;energy photon region. High responsivities ranging from 103 to 100&#160;mA W&#8722;1 are acquired within ultraviolet&#8208;terahertz bands under &#177;0.1&#160;V bias voltage at room temperature. Notably, the responsivity of 2.572 A W&#8722;1 at 3000&#160;&#956;m (0.1 THz) and the low noise equivalent power of 26 pW Hz&#8722;1/2 surpass most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art mainstream terahertz detectors. This research provides a new perspective for revealing the photoelectric conversion properties of Fe3GeTe2 crystal and paves the way for the development of spin&#8208;optoelectronic devices.

High responsivities ranging from 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;mA W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; are acquired within ultraviolet-terahertz bands under &#177;0.1&#160;V bias voltage at room temperature. Notably, the responsivity of 2.572 A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 3000&#160;&#956;m (0.1 THz) and the low noise equivalent power of 26 pW Hz&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; surpass most state-of-the-art mainstream terahertz detectors. This research provides a new perspective for revealing the photoelectric conversion properties of Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; crystal and paves the way for the development of spin-optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Upconversion 3d Bioprinting for Noninvasive In&#8208;Vivo Moulding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tissue engineered bracket materials provide essential support for the physiological protection and therapeutics of patients. Unfortunately, the implantation process of such devices poses the risk of surgical complications and infection. In this study, an upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)&#8208;assisted 3D bioprinting approach was developed to realise in&#8208;vivo moulding that is free from invasive surgery. Reasonably designed UCNPs, which convert near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photons that penetrate skin tissues into blue&#8208;violet emission (300&#8211;500 nm), induce a monomer polymerisation curing procedure in&#8208;vivo. Using a fused deposition modeling coordination framework, a precisely predetermined trajectory of the NIR laser enabled the manufacture of implantable medical devices with tailored shapes. A proof of the 3D bioprinting of a noninvasive fracture fixation scaffold was achieved successfully, thus demonstrating an entirely new method of in&#8208;vivo moulding for biomedical treatment.

         <title>High&#8208;toughness CO2&#8208;sourced Ionic Polyurea Adhesives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polyurea (PUa) adhesives are renowned for their exceptional adhesion to diverse substrates even in harsh environments. However, the presence of quadruple bidentate intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the polymer chains creates a trade&#8208;off between cohesive energy and interfacial adhesive energy. To overcome this challenge, a series of CO2&#8208;sourced ionic PUa adhesives with ultra&#8208;tough adhesion to various substrates were developed. The incorporated ionic segments within the adhesive serve to partially mitigate the intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions while conferring unique electrostatic interactions, leading to both high cohesive energy and interfacial adhesive energy. The maximum adhesive strength of 10.9&#160;MPa could be attained by ionizing the CO2&#8208;sourced PUa using bromopropane and subsequently exchanging the anion with lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide. Additionally, these ionic PUa adhesives demonstrate several desirable properties such as low&#8208;temperature stability (&#8208;80&#176;C), resistance to organic solvents and water, high flame retardancy, antibacterial activity, and UV&#8208;fluorescence, thereby expanding their potential applications. This study presents a general and effective approach for designing high&#8208;strength adhesives suitable for a wide array of uses.

         <title>Pillararene&#8208;Based Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Delivery Systems for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Cancer poses a significant challenge to global public health, seriously threatening human health and life. Although various therapeutic strategies, such as chemotherapy (CT), radiotherapy, phototherapy, and starvation therapy, have been applied to cancer treatment, their limited therapeutic effect, severe side effects, and unsatisfactory drug release behavior need to be carefully considered. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop efficient drug delivery strategies for improving cancer treatment efficacy and realizing on&#8208;demand drug delivery. Notably, pillararenes, as an emerging class of supramolecular macrocycles, possess unique properties of highly tunable structures, superior host&#8211;guest chemistry, facile modification, and good biocompatibility, which have been widely used in cancer therapy to achieve controllable drug release and reduce the toxic side effects on normal tissues under various internal/external stimuli conditions. This review summarizes the recent advance of stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular delivery systems (SDSs) based on pillararenes for tumor therapy from the perspectives of different assembly methods and hybrid materials, including molecular&#8208;scale SDSs, supramolecular nano self&#8208;assembly delivery systems, and nanohybrid SDSs. Moreover, the prospects and critical challenges of stimuli&#8208;responsive SDSs based on pillararenes for cancer therapy are also discussed.

         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic and Photovoltaic Performance Arising from Unconventionally Low Donor&#8211;Y6 Ratios</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Development of both organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and organic photocatalysts has focused on utilizing the bulk heterojunction (BHJ). The BHJ promotes charge separation and enhances the carrier lifetime, but may give rise to increased charge traps, hindering performance. Here, high photocatalytic and photovoltaic performance is displayed by electron donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) nanoparticles (NPs) and films, using the non&#8208;fullerene acceptor Y6 and polymer donor PIDT&#8208;T8BT. In contrast to conventional D&#8211;A systems, the charge generation in PIDT&#8208;T8BT:Y6 NPs is mainly driven by Y6, allowing a high performance even at a low D:A mass ratio of 1:50. The high performance at the low mass ratio is attributed to the amorphous behaviour of PIDT&#8208;T8BT. Low ratios have generally been thought to yield lower efficiency than the more conventional &#8764;1:1 ratio. However, the OPVs exhibit peak performance at a D:A ratio of 1:5. Similarly the NPs used for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution show peak performance at the 1:6.7 D:A ratio. Interestingly, for the PIDT&#8208;T8BT:Y6 system, as the polymer proportion increases, we observe a reduced photocatalytic and photovoltaic performance. The unconventional D:A ratios provide lower recombination losses and increased charge&#8208;carrier lifetime with undisrupted ambipolar charge transport in bulk Y6, enabling better performance than conventional ratios. This work reports novel light&#8208;harvesting materials in which performance is reduced due to unfavourable morphology as D:A ratios move towards conventional ratios of 1:1.2&#8211;1:1.

         <title>Sb&#8208;Doped Cs3TbCl6 Nanocrystals for Highly Efficient Narrow&#8208;Band Green Emission and X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent zero&#8208;dimensional Sb&#8208;doped lanthanide halide nanocrystals are reported. The origin of the narrower enhanced green PL emission is mainly attributed to highly localized exciton distribution, Cl&#8722;&#8208;Tb3+ charge transition process, and effective thermally activated exciton energy transfer. It indicates that the Sb&#8208;doped nanocrystals serve as a promising nanoscintillator, which has versatile application prospects for lighting and X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Metal halide nanocrystals (NCs) with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) are desirable for lighting, display, and X&#8208;ray detection. Herein, the novel lanthanide&#8208;based halide NCs are committed to designing and optimizing the optical and scintillating properties, so as to unravel the PL origin, exciton dynamics, and optoelectronic applications. Sb&#8208;doped zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) Cs3TbCl6 NCs exhibit a green emission with a narrow full width of half maximum of 8.6&#160;nm, and the best PLQY of 48.1% is about three times higher than that of undoped NCs. Experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that 0D crystalline and electronic structures make the exciton highly localized on [TbCl6]3&#8722; octahedron, which boosts the Cl&#8722;&#8208;Tb3+ charge transfer process, thus resulting in bright Tb3+ emission. More importantly, the introduction of Sb3+ not only facilitates the photon absorption transition, but also builds an effective thermally boosting energy transfer channel assisted by [SbCl6]3&#8722;&#8208;induced self&#8208;trapped state, which is responsible for the PL enhancement. The high luminescence efficiency and negligible self&#8208;absorption of the Cs3TbCl6: Sb nanoscintillator enable a more sensitive X&#8208;ray detection response compared with undoped sample. The study opens a new perspective to deeply understand the excited state dynamics of metal halide NCs, which helps to design high&#8208;performance luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based nanomaterials.

         <title>GSH/pH Dual Activatable Cross&#8208;linked and Fluorinated PEI for Cancer Gene Therapy Through Endogenous Iron De&#8208;Hijacking and in Situ ROS Amplification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The GSH/pH dual activatable fluorinated PEI system is used to transfect MTS&#8208;KR&#8208;SOD and Cas&#8208;CA IX plasmids into B16&#8208;F10 cancer cells in vitr and in vivo. Decreased intracellular pH caused by the knockdown of CA IX de&#8208;hijacked Fe2+ from ferritin, ignited H2O2 fuel triggered by laser irradiated MTS&#8208;KillerRed&#8208;SOD for enhanced ferroptosis. Thus, achieving cascade&#8208;amplify ROS cytotoxicity by photodynamic&#8208;assisted endogenous chemodynamic therapy.








Abstract
Ferroptosis&#8208;related cancer therapy is limited by insufficient Fe2+/Fe3+ redox pair and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for producing lethal hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH). Although exogenous iron or ROS&#8208;producing drugs can enhance ferroptosis, exploiting endogenous iron (labile iron pool, LIP) stored in ferritin and promoting ROS generation may be safer. Herein, a metal/drug&#8208;free nanomedicine is developed for responsive LIP release and H2O2 generation on the mitochondria membranes, amplifying hydroxyl radical production to enhance ferroptosis&#8208;mediated antitumor effects. A glutathione(GSH)/pH dual activatable fluorinated and cross&#8208;linked polyethyleneimine (PEI) with dialdehyde polyethylene glycol layer nanocomplex loaded with MTS&#8208;KR&#8208;SOD (Mitochondria&#8208;targeting&#8208;sequence&#8208;KillerRed&#8208;Superoxide Dismutase) and CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;CA IX (Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX)) plasmids (FP@MC) are developed for enhanced ferroptosis through endogenous iron de&#8208;hijacking and in situ ROS amplification. Two plasmids are constructed to knockdown CA IX and translate KillerRed&#8208;SOD recombinant protein specifically on mitochondria membranes, respectively. The CA IX knockdown acidifies the intracellular environment, leading the release of LIP from ferritin as a &#8220;flare&#8221; to initiate endogenous chemodynamic therapy. Meanwhile, MTS&#8208;KR&#8208;SOD generates H2O2 when irradiated by a 590&#160;nm laser to assist chemodynamic therapy, leading to ROS amplification for mitochondria damage and lipid peroxide accumulation. The combined therapeutic effects aggravate cancer ferroptosis and suppress tumor growth, providing a new paradigm for amplifying ROS and iron ions to promote ferroptosis&#8208;related cancer therapy.

         <title>Over 18% Efficiency Ternary Organic Solar Cells with 300&#160;nm Thick Active Layer Enabled by an Oligomeric Acceptor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) with high thickness tolerance are realized via introducing an oligomer DY&#8208;TF as third component. Upon addition of DY&#8208;TF, the crystallinity of the host blend is improved and a well&#8208;defined morphology with vertical phase separation is formed, yielding an efficiency of 18.23%, which represents the highest efficiency value for 300 nm&#8208;thick OSCs thus far.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;efficiency thickness&#8208;insensitive organic solar cells (OSCs) is crucially important for the mass production of solar panels. However, increasing the active layer thickness usually induces a substantial loss in efficiency. Herein, a ternary strategy in which an oligomer DY&#8208;TF is incorporated into PM6:L8&#8208;BO system as a guest component is adopted to break this dilemma. The S&#183;&#183;&#183;F intramolecular noncovalent interactions in the backbone endow DY&#8208;TF with a high planarity. Upon the addition of DY&#8208;TF, the crystallinity of the blend is effectively improved, leading to increased charge carrier mobility, which is highly desirable in the fabrication of thick&#8208;film devices. As a result, thin&#8208;film PM6:L8&#8208;BO:DY&#8208;TF&#8208;based device (110&#160;nm) shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.13%. Impressively, when the active layer thickness increases to 300&#160;nm, an efficiency of 18.23% (certified as 17.8%) is achieved, representing the highest efficiency reported for 300 nm thick OSCs thus far. Additionally, blade&#8208;coated thick device (300&#160;nm) delivers a promising PCE of 17.38%. This work brings new insights into the construction of efficient OSCs with high thickness tolerance, showing great potential for roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll printing of large&#8208;area solar cells.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Multi&#8208;Objective Optimization for Cu&#8211;Sb&#8211;S Photo&#8208;Electrocatalytic Materials&#8217; Discovery</title>

         <dc:description>
A closed&#8208;loop workflow combining synthesis, deposition, characterization is used to explore Cu&#8211;Sb&#8211;S oxide films for efficient water reduction. The workflow narrows down optimal conditions for high photo&#8208;electrocatalytic activity by optimizing for proxy objectives, including bandgap, Cu1+/Cu ratio, and film uniformity. This results in the successful identification of an optimal material composition through multi&#8208;objective constrained optimization techniques.








Abstract
Copper antimony sulfides are regarded as promising catalysts for photo&#8208;electrochemical water splitting because of their earth abundance and broad light absorption. The unique photoactivity of copper antimony sulfides is dependent on their various crystalline structures and atomic compositions. Here, a closed&#8208;loop workflow is built, which explores Cu&#8211;Sb&#8211;S compositional space to optimize its photo&#8208;electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water, by integrating a high&#8208;throughput robotic platform, characterization techniques, and machine learning (ML) optimization workflow. The multi&#8208;objective optimization model discovers optimum experimental conditions after only nine cycles of integrated experiments&#8211;machine learning loop. Photocurrent testing at 0&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) confirms the expected correlation between the materials&#8217; properties and photocurrent. An optimum photocurrent of &#8722;186&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2 is observed on Cu&#8211;Sb&#8211;S in the ratio of 9:45:46 in the form of single&#8208;layer coating on F&#8208;doped SnO2 (FTO) glass with a corresponding bandgap of 1.85&#160;eV and 63.2% Cu1+/Cu species content. The targeted intelligent search reveals a nonobvious CuSbS composition that exhibits 2.3 times greater activity than baseline results from random sampling.

         <title>Electrochemically Responsive 3D Nanoarchitectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel method using carbon nanotube&#8208;tin composites to develop electrochromic reconfigurable three&#8208;dimensional&#160;microstructures. These microstructures respond to external stimuli and can change the shape/color continuously with low&#8208;power electric input through an electrochemical process. The method enables parallel production of thousands of microstructures, while their design is optimized for large strokes and high cyclability using finite element analysis.








Abstract
Responsive nanomaterials are being developed to create new unique functionalities such as switchable colors and adhesive properties or other programmable features in response to external stimuli. While many existing examples rely on changes in temperature, humidity, or pH, this study aims to explore an alternative approach relying on simple electric input signals. More specifically, 3D electrochromic architected microstructures are developed using carbon nanotube&#8211;Tin (Sn) composites that can be reconfigured by lithiating Sn with low power electric input (&#8776;50 nanowatts). These microstructures have a continuous, regulated, and non&#8208;volatile actuation determined by the extent of the electrochemical lithiation process. In addition, this proposed fabrication process relies only on batch lithographic techniques, enabling the parallel production of thousands of 3D microstructures. Structures with a 30&#8211;97% change in open&#8208;end area upon actuation are demonstrated and the importance of geometric factors in the response and structural integrity of 3D architected microstructures during electrochemical actuation is highlighted.

         <title>A Wearable Touch&#8208;Activated Device Integrated with Hollow Microneedles for Continuous Sampling and Sensing of Dermal Interstitial Fluid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully&#8208;integrated touch&#8208;activated wearable device is developed for continuous sampling and electrochemical analysis of interstitial fluid. The elastic self&#8208;recovery of the vacuum generation system enables a wide range of negative pressures and extraction rates. The developed device can successfully detect glucose and pH levels and holds the potential for continuous sensing of multiple biomarkers in extracted interstitial fluid.








Abstract
Dermal interstitial fluid (ISF) is emerging as a rich source of biomarkers that complements conventional biofluids such as blood and urine. However, the impact of ISF sampling in clinical applications has been limited owing to the challenges associated with extraction. The implementation of microneedle&#8208;based wearable devices that can extract dermal ISF in a pain&#8208;free and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use manner has attracted growing attention in recent years. Here, a fully integrated touch&#8208;activated wearable device based on a laser&#8208;drilled hollow microneedle (HMN) patch for continuous sampling and sensing of dermal ISF is introduced. The developed platform can produce and maintain the required vacuum pressure (as low as &#8776; &#8722;53&#160;kPa) to collect adequate volumes of ISF (&#8776;2&#160;&#181;L needle&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) for medical applications. The vacuum system can be activated through a one&#8208;touch finger operation. A parametric study is performed to investigate the effect of microneedle array size, vacuum pressure, and extraction duration on collected ISF. The capability of the proposed platform for continuous health monitoring is further demonstrated by the electrochemical detection of glucose and pH levels of ISF in animal models. This HMN&#8208;based system provides an alternative tool to the existing invasive techniques for ISF collection and sensing for medical diagnosis and treatment.

         <title>Fiber&#8208;Integrated Force Sensor using 3D Printed Spring&#8208;Composed Fabry&#8208;Perot Cavities with a High Precision Down to Tens of Piconewton</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fiber&#8208;integrated force probe using a spring FP cavity for general&#8208;uses is proposed. The force&#8208;sensitivity and resolution reach (0.436 &#177; 0.007) nmnN&#8208;1 and (40.0 &#177; 0.7) pN, respectively, representing the highest precisions among all fiber&#8208;based nanomechanical probes. Typically, it uses the sensor to explore the micro&#8208;scale nonlinear problems in fluid mechanics. It anticipates the easy&#8208;to&#8208;use force probe will generate significant impacts for accurate force&#8208;detection.








Abstract
Developing microscale sensors capable of force measurements down to the scale of piconewtons is of fundamental importance for a wide range of applications. To date, advanced instrumentations such as atomic force microscopes and other specifically developed micro/nano&#8208;electromechanical systems face challenges such as high cost, complex detection systems and poor electromagnetic compatibility. Here, it presents the unprecedented design and 3D printing of general fiber&#8208;integrated force sensors using spring&#8208;composed Fabry&#8208;Perot cavities. It calibrates these microscale devices employing varied&#8208;diameter &#956;$\umu$ m&#8208;scale silica particles as standard weights. The force sensitivity and resolution reach values of (0.436 &#177; 0.007) nmnN&#8208;1 and (40.0 &#177; 0.7) pN, respectively, which are the best resolutions among all fiber&#8208;based nanomechanical probes so far. It also measured the non&#8208;linear airflow force distributions produced from a nozzle with an orifice of 2 &#956;$\umu$ m, which matches well with the full&#8208;sized simulations. With further customization of their geometries and materials, it anticipates the easy&#8208;to&#8208;use force probe can well extend to many other applications such as air/fluidic turbulences sensing, micro&#8208;manipulations, and biological sensing.

         <title>Buried&#8208;Metal&#8208;Grid Electrodes for Efficient Parallel&#8208;Connected Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unfavorable conductivity of existing transparent conducting oxide electrodes restricts the development of large&#8208;area perovskite solar cells. Herein, buried&#8208;metal&#8208;grid tin&#8208;doped indium oxide electrodes are developed based on a photolithography technique. Such electrodes with greatly enhanced conductivity and low&#8208;height metal steps help increase device performance and mitigate performance loss while upscaling cell area.








Abstract
The limited conductivity of existing transparent conducting oxide (TCO) greatly restricts the further performance improvement of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially for large&#8208;area devices. Herein, buried&#8208;metal&#8208;grid tin&#8208;doped indium oxide (BMG ITO) electrodes are developed to minimize the power loss caused by the undesirable high sheet resistance of TCOs. By burying 140&#8208;nm&#8208;thick metal grids into ITO using a photolithography technique, the sheet resistance of ITO is reduced from 15.0 to 2.7 &#937; sq&#8722;1. The metal step of BMG over ITO has a huge impact on the charge carrier transport in PSCs. The PSCs using BMG ITO with a low metal step deliver power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) significantly better than that of their counterparts with higher metal steps. Moreover, compared with the pristine ITO&#8208;based PSCs, the BMG ITO&#8208;based PSCs show a smaller PCE decrease when scaling up the active area of devices. The parallel&#8208;connected large&#8208;area PSCs with an active area of 102.8 mm2 reach a PCE of 22.5%. The BMG ITO electrodes are also compatible with the fabrication of inverted&#8208;structure PSCs and organic solar cells. The work demonstrates the great efficacy of improving the conductivity of TCO by BMG and opens up a promising avenue for constructing highly efficient large&#8208;area PSCs.

         <title>High&#8208;Strength Smart Microneedles with &#8220;Offensive and Defensive&#8221; Effects for Intervertebral Disc Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a new strategy for intervertebral disc repair. The high&#8208;strength smart microneedles are designed to extracellularly &#8220;offend&#8221; the inflammatory microenvironment and mitigate damage to cells, and intracellularly increase the level of cytoprotective heat shock proteins to enhance defense against the hostile microenvironment, achieving &#8220;offensive and defensive&#8221; effects, and ultimately promoting the repair of intervertebral disc.








Abstract
Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a global public health issue. The injury of annulus fibrosus (AF) caused by acupuncture or discectomy can trigger IVDD again. However, there is currently no suitable method for treating AF injury. In this study, the high&#8208;strength smart microneedles (MNs) which can penetrate the AF tissue through a local and minimally invasive method, and achieve remote control of speeded&#8208;up release of the drug and hyperthermia by the Near Infrared is developed. The PDA/GelMA composite MNs loaded with diclofenac sodium are designed to extracellularly &#8220;offend&#8221; the inflammatory microenvironment and mitigate damage to cells, and intracellularly increase the level of cytoprotective heat shock proteins to enhance the defense against the hostile microenvironment, achieving &#8220;offensive and defensive&#8221; effects. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the synergistic treatment of photothermal therapy and anti&#8208;inflammation effectively reduces inflammation, inhibits cell apoptosis, and promotes the synthesis of the extracellular matrix (ECM). In vivo experiments show that the MNs mitigate the inflammatory response, promote ECM deposition, reduce the level of apoptosis, and restore the biomechanical properties of the intervertebral disc (IVD) in rats. Overall, this high&#8208;strength smart MNs display promising &#8220;offensive and defensive&#8221; effects that can provide a new strategy for IVD repair.

         <title>Aramid Nanodielectrics for Ultraconformal Transparent Electronic Skins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aramid nanodielectrics (ANDs) with self&#8208;delaminated characteristics are developed, enabling any skin&#8208;like electronics easily exfoliated from the processing substrates after complicated nanofabrication. In addition, ANDs are mechanically strong, chemically and thermally stable, transparent and breathable, therefore are ideal substrates for soft electronics. Compliant epidermal electrodes and ultraconformal carbon nanotube transistors based on ANDs are further demonstrated with superior performance.








Abstract
On&#8208;skin electronics require minimal thicknesses and decent transparency for conformal contact, imperceptible wearing, and visual aesthetics. It is challenging to search for advanced ultrathin dielectrics capable of supporting the active components while maintaining bending softness, easy handling, and wafer&#8208;scale processability. Here, self&#8208;delaminated aramid nanodielectrics (ANDs) are demonstrated, enabling any skin&#8208;like electronics easily exfoliated from the processing substrates after complicated nanofabrication. In addition, ANDs are mechanically strong, chemically and thermally stable, transparent and breathable, therefore are ideal substrates for soft electronics. As demonstrated, compliant epidermal electrodes comprising silver nanowires and ANDs can successfully record high&#8208;quality electromyogram signals with low motion artifacts and satisfying sweat and water resistance. Furthermore, ANDs can serve as both substrates and dielectrics in single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) with a merely 160&#8208;nm thickness, which can be operated within 4&#160;V with on/off ratios of 1.4 &#177; 0.5 &#215; 105, mobilities of 39.9 &#177; 2.2 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, and negligible hysteresis. The ultraconformal FETs can function properly when wrapped around human hair without any degradation in performance.

         <title>Growth, Distribution, and Photosynthesis of Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii in 3D Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Studying spatiotemporal cell growth within engineered living materials is key to identifying shape parameters for improved material functionality. In photosynthetic microalgae&#8208;based living materials, both carbon source availability and light penetration&#160;are found to be limiting factors for cell growth. Taking advantage of location&#8208;specific growth patterns, photosynthetic living materials are designed and printed for increased CO2 consumption.








Abstract
Engineered living materials (ELMs) are a novel class of functional materials that typically feature spatial confinement of living components within an inert polymer matrix to recreate biological functions. Understanding the growth and spatial configuration of cellular populations within a matrix is crucial to predicting and improving their responsive potential and functionality. Here, this work investigates the growth, spatial distribution, and photosynthetic productivity of eukaryotic microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (C. reinhardtii) in three&#8208;dimensionally shaped hydrogels in dependence of geometry and size. The embedded C. reinhardtii cells photosynthesize and form confined cell clusters, which grow faster when located close to the ELM periphery due to favorable gas exchange and light conditions. Taking advantage of location&#8208;specific growth patterns, this work successfully designs and prints photosynthetic ELMs with increased CO2 capturing rate, featuring high surface to volume ratio. This strategy to control cell growth for higher productivity of ELMs resembles the already established adaptations found in multicellular plant leaves.

&#8216;Top&#8208;down&#8217; and &#8216;bottom&#8208;up&#8217; methods are combined to facilitate the fragment&#8208;based discovery of organic electronic materials. A dataset of 117K synthesized molecules is curated and used as a building block library. Statistical models are trained on this dataset, enabling accurate prediction of excited state properties. This approach allows for efficient screening of over a million molecular candidates for singlet fission.








Abstract
The high&#8208;throughput exploration and screening of molecules for organic electronics involves either a &#8216;top&#8208;down&#8217; curation and mining of existing repositories, or a &#8216;bottom&#8208;up&#8217; assembly of user&#8208;defined fragments based on known synthetic templates. Both are time&#8208;consuming approaches requiring significant resources to compute electronic properties accurately. Here, &#8216;top&#8208;down&#8216; is combined with &#8216;bottom&#8208;up&#8216; through automatic assembly and statistical models, thus providing a platform for the fragment&#8208;based discovery of organic electronic materials. This study generates a top&#8208;down set of 117K synthesized molecules containing structures, electronic and topological properties and chemical composition, and uses them as building blocks for bottom&#8208;up design. A tool is developed to automate the coupling of these building blocks at their C(sp2/sp)&#8208;H bonds, providing a fundamental link between the two dataset construction philosophies. Statistical models are trained on this dataset and a subset of resulting top&#8208;down/bottom&#8208;up compounds, enabling on&#8208;the&#8208;fly prediction of ground and excited state properties with high accuracy across organic compound space. With access to ab initio&#8208;quality optical properties, this bottom&#8208;up pipeline may be applied to any materials design campaign using existing compounds as building blocks. To illustrate this, over a million molecules are screened for singlet fission. tThe leading candidates provide insight into the features promoting this multiexciton&#8208;generating&#160;process.

         <title>Liquid Metal&#8208;Based Stable and Stretchable Zn&#8208;Ion Battery for Electronic Textiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable and stretchable fibrous Zn&#8208;ion battery is developed by utilizing a dendrite&#8208;free liquid metal@Zn anode, which can be well&#8208;integrated with a liquid metal&#8208;based fibrous sensor, Joule heater, and wireless charging device for smart multifunctional electronic textiles.








Abstract
Electronic textiles harmoniously interact with the human body and the surrounding environment, offering tremendous interest in smart wearable electronics. However, their wide application faces challenges due to the lack of stable and stretchable power electrodes/devices with multifunctional design. Herein, an intrinsically stretchable liquid metal&#8208;based fibrous anode for a stable Zn&#8208;ion battery (ZIB) is reported. Benefiting from the liquid feature and superior deformability of the liquid metal, optimized Zn ion concentration distribution and Zn (002) deposition behavior are observed, which result in dendrite&#8208;free performance even under stretching. With a strain of 50%, the ZIB maintains a high capacity of 139.8 mAh cm&#8722;3 (corresponding to 83.0% of the initial value) after 300 cycles, outperforming bare Zn fiber&#8208;based ZIB. The fibrous ZIB seamlessly integrates with the sensor, Joule heater, and wirelessly charging device, which provides a stable power supply for human signal monitoring and personal thermal management, holding promise for the application of wearable multifunctional electronic textiles.

         <title>Synergetic Sn Incorporation&#8208;Zn Substitution in Copper&#8208;Based Sulfides Enabling Superior Na&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synergetic Sn incorporation and Zn substitution strategy is proposed to develop a superior copper&#8208;based sulfide anode in Na&#8208;ion battery, which exhibits high Na&#8208;ion storage capacity, ultrastable cycling performance, superior rate capability, and ultrafast charging feature. Furthermore, the critical roles of Sn and Zn in synergistically promoting the Na&#8208;ion storage performance are clarified.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal sulfides have been regarded as perspective anode candidates for high&#8208;energy Na&#8208;ion batteries. Their application, however, is precluded severely by either low charge storage or huge volumetric change along with sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, an effective synergetic Sn incorporation&#8208;Zn substitution strategy is proposed based on copper&#8208;based sulfides. First, Na&#8208;ion storage capability of copper sulfide is significantly improved via incorporating an alloy&#8208;based Sn element. However, this process is accompanied by sacrifice of structural stability due to the high Na&#8208;ion uptake.

     alt="Synergetic Sn Incorporation-Zn Substitution in Copper-Based Sulfides Enabling Superior Na-Ion Storage"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel synergetic Sn incorporation and Zn substitution strategy is proposed to develop a superior copper-based sulfide anode in Na-ion battery, which exhibits high Na-ion storage capacity, ultrastable cycling performance, superior rate capability, and ultrafast charging feature. Furthermore, the critical roles of Sn and Zn in synergistically promoting the Na-ion storage performance are clarified.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition-metal sulfides have been regarded as perspective anode candidates for high-energy Na-ion batteries. Their application, however, is precluded severely by either low charge storage or huge volumetric change along with sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, an effective synergetic Sn incorporation-Zn substitution strategy is proposed based on copper-based sulfides. First, Na-ion storage capability of copper sulfide is significantly improved via incorporating an alloy-based Sn element. However, this process is accompanied by sacrifice of structural stability due to the high Na-ion uptake. Subsequently, to maintain the high Na-ion storage capacity, and concurrently improve cycling and rate capabilities, a Zn substitution strategy (taking partial Sn sites) is carried out, which could significantly promote Na-ion diffusion/reaction kinetics and relieve mechanical strain&#8211;stress within the crystal framework. The synergetic Sn incorporation and Zn substitution endow copper-based sulfides with high specific capacity (&#8776;560 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), ultrastable cyclability (80 k cycles with &#8776;100% capacity retention), superior rate capability up to 200 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and ultrafast charging feature (&#8776;4 s per charging with &#8776;190 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; input). This work provides in-depth insights for developing superior anode materials via synergetic multi-cation incorporation/substitution, aiming at solving their intrinsic issues of either low specific capacity or poor cyclability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ag Nanoparticle&#8208;Induced Surface Chloride Immobilization Strategy Enables Stable Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ formation of AgCl by the combination of free Cl&#8722; with oxidized Ag nanoparticles in the presence of an electric field effectively repel free Cl&#8722; through strong common&#8208;ion repulsive effect. As&#8208;prepared NiFe&#8208;LDH@Ag exhibits superior corrosion resistance and unprecedented stability at 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for more than 5000&#160;h in alkaline saline electrolyte.








Abstract
Although hydrogen gas (H2) storage might enable offshore renewable energy to be stored at scale, the commercialization of technology for H2 generation by seawater electrolysis depends upon the development of methods that avoid the severe corrosion of anodes by chloride (Cl&#8722;) ions. Here, it is revealed that the stability of an anode used for seawater splitting can be increased by more than an order of magnitude by loading Ag nanoparticles on the catalyst surface. In experiments, an optimized NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide (LDH)@Ag electrode displays stable operation at 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline saline electrolyte and seawater for over 5000 and 2500&#160;h, respectively. The impressive long&#8208;term durability is more than 20 times that of an unmodified NiFe&#8208;LDH anode. Meticulous characterization and simulation reveals that in the presence of an applied electric field, free Cl&#8722; ions react with oxidized Ag nanoparticles to form stable AgCl species, giving rise to the formation of a Cl&#8722;&#8208;free layer near the anode surface. Because of its simplicity and effectiveness, it is anticipated that the proposed strategy to immobilize chloride ions on the surface of an anode has the potential to become a crucial technology to control corrosion during large&#8208;scale electrolysis of seawater to produce hydrogen.

         <title>Fe Cluster Modified Co9S8 Heterojunction: Highly Efficient Photoelectrocatalyst for Overall Water Splitting and Flexible Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>

In this work, outstanding photo&#8208;assisted electrocatalysts are successfully synthesized by thermal annealing of polydopamine coated CdS and ZIF&#8208;67. Additionally, based on the spatial confinement of the N&#8208;doped carbon skeleton and the electronic structure regulation of the Fe cluster, the Co9S8&#8208;Fe heterojunction substantially facilitates the separation of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs and further enhances the photo&#8208;assisted electrocatalytic overall water splitting.








Abstract
Designing bifunctional low&#8208;cost photo&#8208;assisted electrocatalysts for converting solar and electric energy into hydrogen energy remains a huge challenge. Herein, a heterojunction (Fe cluster modified Co9S8 loaded on carbon nanotubes, Co9S8&#8208;Fe@CNT)&#160;for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is demonstrated. Benefiting from the good electronic conductivity and spatial confinement of the carbon skeleton, as well as the electronic structure regulation of the Fe cluster, Co9S8&#8208;Fe@CNT exhibits excellent catalytic performance with a low overpotential of 150&#160;mV for OER and 135&#160;mV for HER at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Upon light irradiation, holes and electrons are generated in the valence band and conduction band of the Co9S8, respectively. Part of the charges are transferred to the interface to facilitate the catalytic reaction, while the remaining are transferred by the electrode. When working as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting, the performance can reach 1.33&#160;V at under light conditions, which is significantly better than 1.52&#160;V in a dark environment. Theoretical calculations revealed lowered Gibbs free energy (&#8710;GH*) of the heterojunction with the effect of Fe modification of Co9S8. This work sheds a new light in designing novel photoelectrochemical materials to convert solar and electric energy into chemical energy.

         <title>Uracil Induced Simultaneously Strengthening Grain Boundaries and Interfaces Enables High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells with Superior Operational Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small molecular uracil additive is developed to passivate the defects of the perovskite film and enhance the interface binding force between perovskite film and substrate. The device delivers a champion efficiency of 24.23%. The device exhibits superior operational stability maintaining over 90% of its initial efficiency after tracking for 6000 h at the maximum power point.








Abstract
The operational stability is a huge obstacle to further commercialization of perovskite solar cells. To address this critical issue, in this work, uracil is introduced as a &#8220;binder&#8221; into the perovskite film to simultaneously improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational stability. Uracil can efficiently passivate defects and strengthen grain boundaries to enhance the stability of perovskite films. Moreover, the uracil also strengthens the interface between the perovskite and the Tin oxide (SnO2) electron transport layer to increase the binding force. The uracil&#8208;modified devices deliver a champion PCE of 24.23% (certificated 23.19%) with negligible hysteresis at active area of 0.0625 cm2. In particular, the optimal device exhibits over 90% of its initial PCE after tracking for &#8776;6000 h at its maximum power point under continuous light, indicating its superior operational stability. Moreover, the devices also show great reproducibility in both PCE and operational stability.

         <title>An Industrially Applicable Passivation Strategy for Significantly Improving Cyclability of Zinc Metal Anodes in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An industrially applicable passivation strategy of zinc plating by a simple dipping treatment is adopted to grow trivalent chromium conversion films (TCCF) as artificial interphases for Zn metal anodes. The facile preparation process and superior electrochemical performance of TCCF@Zn offer an exciting possibility for the practicability of metallic zinc anodes in aqueous zinc batteries.








Abstract
The cycling instability of metallic Zn anodes hinders the practicability of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries, though aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries may be the most credible alternative technology for future electrochemical energy storage applications. Commercially available trivalent chromium conversion films (TCCF) are successfully employed as robust artificial interphases on Zn metal anodes (ZMAs). Fabricated through a simple immersion method, the TCCF&#8208;protected Zn (TCCF@Zn) electrode enables a superlow nucleation overpotential for Zn plating of 6.9&#160;mV under 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outstanding Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% at 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 1600 cycles in Zn||Cu asymmetric cells and superior cyclability in symmetric Zn||Zn batteries at 0.2, 2, and 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 2500&#160;h and 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 1200&#160;h. More importantly, the TCCF@Zn||V2O5 full cell exhibits a specific capacity of 118.5 mAh g&#8722;1 with a retention of 53.4% at 3 A g&#8722;1 for 3000 cycles, which is considerably larger than that of the pristine Zn||V2O5 full cell (59.7 mAh g&#8722;1 with a retention of 25.7%). This study demonstrates a highly efficient and low&#8208;cost surface modification strategy derived from an industrially applicable trivalent chromium passivation technique aimed at obtaining dendrite&#8208;free ZMAs with high reversibility for practical Zn batteries in the near future.

     alt="An Industrially Applicable Passivation Strategy for Significantly Improving Cyclability of Zinc Metal Anodes in Aqueous Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An industrially applicable passivation strategy of zinc plating by a simple dipping treatment is adopted to grow trivalent chromium conversion films (TCCF) as artificial interphases for Zn metal anodes. The facile preparation process and superior electrochemical performance of TCCF@Zn offer an exciting possibility for the practicability of metallic zinc anodes in aqueous zinc batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cycling instability of metallic Zn anodes hinders the practicability of aqueous Zn-ion batteries, though aqueous Zn-ion batteries may be the most credible alternative technology for future electrochemical energy storage applications. Commercially available trivalent chromium conversion films (TCCF) are successfully employed as robust artificial interphases on Zn metal anodes (ZMAs). Fabricated through a simple immersion method, the TCCF-protected Zn (TCCF@Zn) electrode enables a superlow nucleation overpotential for Zn plating of 6.9&#160;mV under 1&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, outstanding Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% at 3&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 1600 cycles in Zn||Cu asymmetric cells and superior cyclability in symmetric Zn||Zn batteries at 0.2, 2, and 5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 2500&#160;h and 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 1200&#160;h. More importantly, the TCCF@Zn||V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; full cell exhibits a specific capacity of 118.5 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a retention of 53.4% at 3 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for 3000 cycles, which is considerably larger than that of the pristine Zn||V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; full cell (59.7 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a retention of 25.7%). This study demonstrates a highly efficient and low-cost surface modification strategy derived from an industrially applicable trivalent chromium passivation technique aimed at obtaining dendrite-free ZMAs with high reversibility for practical Zn batteries in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Energy Engineering of Buried Interface for Highly Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Over 25%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The abundant oxygen&#8208;related defects seriously impair the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. Here, a novel surface energy engineering (SEE) is developed by applying a surfactant HFSTA on the surface of the TiO2 substrate. By combining the passivation of TiO2, crystallization process modulation and stress relief, PCE of 25.03% is achieved on champion device along with improved stability.








Abstract
The abundant oxygen&#8208;related defects (e.g., O vacancies, O&#8211;H) in the TiO2 electron transport layer results in high surface energy, which is detrimental to effective carrier extraction and seriously impairs the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. Here, novel surface energy engineering (SEE) is developed by applying a surfactant of heptadecafluorooctanesulfonate tetraethylammonium (HFSTA) on the surface of the TiO2. Theoretical calculations show that the HFSTA&#8208;TiO2 is less prone to form O vacancies, leading to lower surface energy, thus improving the carrier&#8208;extraction efficiency. The experimental results show that superior perovskite film is obtained due to the reduced heterogeneous nucleation sites and improved crystallization process on the modified TiO2. Furthermore, the flexible long alkyl chains in HFSTA considerably relieve the compressive stresses at the buried interface. By combining the passivation of TiO2, crystallization process modulation, and stress relief, a champion PCE up to 25.03% is achieved. The device without encapsulation sustains 92.2% of its initial PCE after more than 2500&#160;h storage under air ambient with relative humidity of 25&#8211;30%. The SEE of a buried interface paves a new way toward high&#8208;efficiency, stable perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Impact of Anodic Oxidation Reactions in the Performance Evaluation of High&#8208;Rate CO2/CO Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this perspective, several impacts of anodic oxidation of liquid products in terms of performance evaluation, e.g., misestimation of the Faradaic efficiency, are elaborated. It is revealed that dynamic change of the anolyte (i.e., pH and composition) not only brings a shift of anodic potentials, but also affects the chemical stability of the anode catalyst.








Abstract
The membrane&#8208;electrode assembly (MEA) approach appears to be the most promising technique to realize the high&#8208;rate CO2/CO electrolysis, however there are major challenges related to the crossover of ions and liquid products from cathode to anode via the membrane and the concomitant anodic oxidation reactions (AORs). In this perspective, by combining experimental and theoretical analyses, several impacts of anodic oxidation of liquid products in terms of performance evaluation are investigated. First, the crossover behavior of several typical liquid products through an anion&#8208;exchange membrane is analyzed. Subsequently, two instructive examples (introducing formate or ethanol oxidation during electrolysis) reveals that the dynamic change of the anolyte (i.e., pH and composition) not only brings a slight shift of anodic potentials (i.e., change of competing reactions), but also affects the chemical stability of the anode catalyst. Anodic oxidation of liquid products can also cause either over&#8208; or under&#8208;estimation of the Faradaic efficiency, leading to an inaccurate assessment of overall performance. To comprehensively understand fundamentals of AORs, a theoretical guideline with hierarchical indicators is further developed to predict and regulate the possible AORs in an electrolyzer. The perspective concludes by giving some suggestions on rigorous performance evaluations for high&#8208;rate CO2/CO electrolysis in an MEA&#8208;based setup.

         <title>Lipid&#8208;Centric Design of Plasma Membrane&#8208;Mimicking Nanocarriers for Targeted Chemotherapeutic Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new lipid coating approach is reported in which the lipid composition is optimized through a combination of biomimetic and systematic variation approaches for the custom design of nanocarrier for precision drug delivery. Nanocarriers coated with the optimized lipids offer unique advantages in terms of bioavailability and efficiency in tumor targeting, tumor penetration, cellular uptake, and drug release.








Abstract
The plasma membranes (PM) of mammalian cells contain diverse lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates that are important for systemic recognition and communication in health and disease. Cell membrane coating technology that imparts unique properties of natural plasma membranes to the surface of encapsulated nanoparticles is thus becoming a powerful platform for drug delivery, immunomodulation, and vaccination. However, current coating methods fail to take full advantage of the natural systems because they disrupt the complex and functionally essential features of PMs, most notably the chemical diversity and compositional differences of lipids in two leaflets of the PM. Herein, a new lipid coating approach is reported in which the lipid composition is optimized through a combination of biomimetic and systematic variation approaches for the custom design of nanocarrier systems for precision drug delivery. Nanocarriers coated with the optimized lipids offer unique advantages in terms of bioavailability and efficiency in tumor targeting, tumor penetration, cellular uptake, and drug release. This pilot study provides new insight into the rational design and optimization of nanocarriers for cancer chemotherapeutic drugs and lays the foundation for further customization of cell membrane&#8208;mimicking nanocarriers through systematic incorporation of other components.

         <title>Biotoxicity of Halide Perovskites in Mice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the fast&#8208;paced development of perovskite solar cells as a potential silicon&#8208;based solar cell replacement, it is crucial to thoroughly evaluate the environmental and health safety. This work assesses the biotoxicity of heavy metals in perovskite materials, providing insights into understanding their potential risks and guiding further investigations in mammalian systems and environmental sustainability of perovskite photovoltaics.








Abstract
Halide perovskites are crystalline semiconductors with exceptional optoelectronic properties, rapidly developing toward large&#8208;scale applications. Lead (II) (Pb2+) is the core element used to prepare halide perovskites. Pb2+ can displace key 2+ elements, including calcium, zinc and iron, that regulate vital physiological functions. Sn2+ can replace Pb2+ within the perovskite structure and, if accidentally dispersed in the environment, it readily oxidizes to Sn4+, which is compatible with physiological functions and thus potentially safe. The 3+ salt bismuth (III) (Bi3+) is also potentially safe for the same reason and useful to prepare double perovskites. Here, this work studies the biotoxicity of Pb, Sn, and Bi perovskites in mice for the first time. This work analyses histopathology and growth of mice directly exposed to perovskites and investigate the development of their offspring generation. This study provides the screening of organs and key physiological functions targeted by perovskite exposure to design specific studies in mammalians.

         <title>High&#8208;Stroke, High&#8208;Output&#8208;Force, Fabric&#8208;Lattice Artificial Muscles for Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of fabric&#8208;lattice artificial muscles with large contraction ratios, high output forces, and diverse configurations is proposed by connecting a group of fabric chambers and layers into a lattice. This artificial muscle can be designed with desired performance and configuration to enable high&#8208;performance soft robots, including the powerful robotic elbow, the assistive shoulder exosuit, and the adaptive soft gripper.








Abstract
Artificial muscles, providing safe and close interaction between humans and machines, are essential in soft robotics. However, their insufficient deformation, output force, or configurability usually limits their applications. Herein, this work presents a class of lightweight fabric&#8208;lattice artificial muscles (FAMs) that are pneumatically actuated with large contraction ratios (up to 87.5%) and considerable output forces (up to a load of 20&#160;kg, force&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio of over 250). The developed FAMs consist of a group of active air chambers that are zigzag connected into a lattice through passive connecting layers. The geometry of these fabric components is programmable to convert the in&#8208;plane lattice of FAMs into out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configurations (e.g., arched and cylindrical) capable of linear/radial contraction. This work further demonstrates that FAMs can be configured for various soft robotic applications, including the powerful robotic elbow with large motion range and high load capability, the well&#8208;fitting assistive shoulder exosuit that can reduce muscle activity during abduction, and the adaptive soft gripper that can grasp irregular objects. These results show the unique features and broad potential of FAMs for high&#8208;performance soft robots.

         <title>High&#8208;Performing and Capacitive&#8208;Matched Triboelectric Implants Driven by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrasound&#8208;driven triboelectric nanogenerator using a high&#8208;dielectric composite not only improves the output of the device, but also improves the connectivity between the energy harvester and the circuit, enabling the semipermanent use and miniaturization of implantable medical devices. These triboelectric implants provide a significant step toward permanently implantable devices for controlling human organs and treating various diseases.








Abstract
In implantable bioelectronics, which aim for semipermanent use of devices, biosafe energy sources and packaging materials to protect devices are essential elements. However, research so far has been conducted in a direction where they cannot coexist. Here, the development of capacitance&#8208;matched triboelectric implants driven is reported by ultrasound under 500&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 safe intensity and realize a battery&#8208;free, miniatured, and wireless neurostimulator with full titanium (Ti) packaging. The triboelectric implant with high dielectric composite, which has ultralow output impedance, can efficiently deliver sufficient power to generate the stimulation pulse without an energy&#8208;storing battery, despite ultrasound attenuation due to the Ti, and has the highest energy transmission efficiency among those reported so far. In vivo study using a rat model demonstrated that the proposed device system is an effective solution for relieving urinary symptoms. These achievements provide a significant step toward permanently implantable devices for controlling human organs and treating various diseases.

         <title>Dendritic Nanomedicine with Boronate Bonds for Augmented Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy via Synergistic Modulation of Tumor Immune Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a feasible strategy of integrating epirubicin (Epi) and NLG919 within a target group&#8208;shieldable dendritic delivery system. Epi is served as a chemotherapeutic drug and a robust immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;inducing agent, and NLG919 inhibited IDO1 activity to downregulate the generation of kynurenine (Kyn), leading to a reduction in the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells and reeducation of the tumor immune microenvironment.








Abstract
Unsatisfied tumor accumulation of chemotherapeutic drugs and a complicated immunosuppressive microenvironment diminish the immune response rate and the therapeutic effect. Surface modification of these drugs with target ligands can promote their cellular internalization, but the modified drugs may be subjected to unexpected immune recognition and clearance. Herein, a phenylboronic acid (PBA) group&#8208;shieldable dendritic nanomedicine that integrates an immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;inducing agent (epirubicin, Epi) and an indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxgenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitor (NLG919) is reported for tumor chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. This NLG919&#8208;loaded Epi&#8208;conjugated PEGylated dendrimers bridged with boronate bonds (NLG919@Epi&#8208;DBP) maintains a stable nanostructure during circulation. Under a moderate acidic condition, the PBA group exposes to the sialic acid residue on the tumor cell membrane to enhance the internalization and penetration of NLG919@Epi&#8208;DBP. At pH 5.0, NLG919@Epi&#8208;DBP rapidly disassembles to release the incorporated Epi and NLG919. Epi triggers robust ICD of tumor cells that evokes strong immune response. In addition, inhibition of the IDO1 activity downregulates the metabolism of L&#8208;tryptophan to kynurenine, leading to a reduction in the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells and modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment. Collectively, this promising strategy has been demonstrated to evoke robust immune response as well as remodel the immunosuppressive microenvironment for an enhanced chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic effect.

         <title>Amphibious Polymer Materials with High Strength and Superb Toughness in Various Aquatic and Atmospheric Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A delicate nanostructure design with nanophase separation and crystalline domains leads to an amphibious polymer material with outstanding mechanical performance in both hydrated and dehydrated states, affording a hydrogel with a toughness of up to 214.2&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3 and a plastic with a toughness of up to 430.9&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3. In addition, the hydrogel exhibits excellent stability in acidic, alkaline, and saline aqueous environments.








Abstract
Herein, the fabrication of amphibious polymer materials with outstanding mechanical performances, both underwater and in the air is reported. A polyvinyl alcohol/poly(2&#8208;methoxyethylacrylate) (PVA/PMEA) composite with multiscale nanostructures is prepared by combining solvent exchange and thermal annealing strategies, which contributes to nanophase separation with rigid PVA&#8208;rich and soft PMEA&#8208;rich phases and high&#8208;density crystalline domains of PVA chains, respectively. Benefiting from the multiscale nanostructure, the PVA/PMEA hydrogel demonstrates excellent stability in harsh (such as acidic, alkaline, and saline) aqueous solutions, as well as superior mechanical behavior with a breaking strength of up to 34.8&#160;MPa and toughness of up to 214.2&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3. Dehydrating the PVA/PMEA hydrogel results in an extremely robust plastic with a breaking strength of 65.4&#160;MPa and toughness of 430.9&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3. This study provides a promising phase&#8211;structure engineering route for constructing high&#8208;performance polymer materials for complex load&#8208;bearing environments.

         <title>Photoinduced Nonvolatile Memory Transistor Based on Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Incorporating Fused &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Organic Ligands</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this manuscript, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites are synthesized by incorporating fused &#960;&#8208;conjugated pyrene&#8208;O&#8208;ethyl&#8208;ammonium (POE) ligands and a systematic study is conducted to obtain enhanced performance and reliable Transistors. The optimized (POE)2SnI4 transistors show remarkable photoresponse, stable storage&#8208;erase cycles and competitive retention performance. Importantly, a 2D perovskite&#8208;only transistor with a multi&#8208;level memory behavior is described.








Abstract
Perovskites field&#8208;effect transistors (PeFETs) have been intensively investigated for their application in detector and synapse. However, synapse based on PeFETs is still very difficult to integrate excellent charge carrier transporting ability, photosensitivity, and nonvolatile memory effects into one device, which is very important for developing bionic electronic devices and edge computing. Here, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites are synthesized by incorporating fused &#960;&#8209;conjugated pyrene&#8208;O&#8208;ethyl&#8208;ammonium (POE) ligands and a systematic study is conducted to obtain enhanced performance and reliable PeFETs. The optimized (POE)2SnI4 transistors display the hole mobility over 0.3&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, high repeatability, and operational stability. Meanwhile, the derived photo memory devices show remarkable photoresponse, with a switching ratio higher than 105, high visible light responsivity (&gt;4&#160;&#215;&#160;104&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1), and stable storage&#8208;erase cycles, as well as competitive retention performance (104&#160;s). The photoinduced memory behavior can be benefiting from the insulating nature of quantum&#8208;well in 2D perovskite under dark and its excellent light sensitivity. The excellent photo memory behaviors have been maintained after 40 days in a N2 atmosphere. Finally, a 2D perovskite&#8208;only transistors with a multi&#8208;level memory behavior (16 distinct states) is described by controlling incident light pulse. This work provides broader attention toward 2D perovskite and optoelectronic application.

         <title>Spectral Tuning of High&#8208;Harmonic Generation with Resonance&#8208;Gradient Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel resonance&#8208;gradient metasurfaces are designed and fabricated with varying geometrical parameters that translate into resonant frequencies dependence on one of the coordinates of the metasurface. This general concept is applied to observe the resonant enhancement of the third and fifth harmonics generated from the gradient metasurfaces being used in conjunction with a tunable excitation laser to provide a wide spectral coverage of resonantly&#8208;enhanced tunable generation of multiple optical harmonics.








Abstract
High&#8208;index dielectric subwavelength structures and metasurfaces are capable of enhancing light&#8208;matter interaction by orders of magnitude via geometry&#8208;dependent optical resonances. This enhancement, however, comes with a fundamental limitation of a narrow spectral range of operation in the vicinity of one or few resonant frequencies. Here, this limitation is tackled by introducing an innovative and practical approach to achieve spectrally tunable enhancement of light&#8208;matter interaction with resonant metasurfaces. Resonance&#8208;gradient metasurfaces are designed and fabricated with varying geometrical parameters that translate into resonant frequencies dependence on one of the coordinates of the metasurface. The metasurfaces are composed of bone&#8208;like nanoresonators, which are made of germanium and support high&#8208;quality optical resonances in the mid&#8208;IR spectral range. The concept is applied to observe the resonant enhancement of the third and fifth harmonics generated from the gradient metasurfaces being used in conjunction with a tunable excitation laser to provide a wide spectral coverage of resonantly&#8208;enhanced tunable generation of multiple optical&#160;harmonics.

The dual&#8208;functional sensory device exhibits efficient molecular packing and excellent free&#8208;charge generation yield by quantifying charge&#8208;carrier dynamics, resulting in a high output power density of over 94 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 for OPVs, under dim indoor illumination (LED 1000 lx). Moreover, it demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed device by developing a single&#8208;pixel image sensor for practical indoor operation in commercial settings.








Abstract
The development of organic&#8208;based optoelectronic technologies for the indoor Internet of Things market, which relies on ambient energy sources, has increased, with organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and photodetectors (OPDs) considered promising candidates for sustainable indoor electronic devices. However, the manufacturing processes of standalone OPVs and OPDs can be complex and costly, resulting in high production costs and limited scalability, thus limiting their use in a wide range of indoor applications. This study uses a multi&#8208;component photoactive structure to develop a self&#8208;powering dual&#8208;functional sensory device with effective energy harvesting and sensing capabilities. The optimized device demonstrates improved free&#8208;charge generation yield by quantifying charge carrier dynamics, with a high output power density of over 81 and 76 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 for rigid and flexible OPVs under indoor conditions (LED 1000&#160;lx (5200 K)). Furthermore, a single&#8208;pixel image sensor is demonstrated as a feasible prototype for practical indoor operating in commercial settings by leveraging the excellent OPD performance with a linear dynamic range of over 130&#160;dB in photovoltaic mode (no external bias). This apparatus with high&#8208;performance OPV&#8208;OPD characteristics provides a roadmap for further exploration of the potential, which can lead to synergistic effects for practical multifunctional applications in the real world by their mutual relevance.

         <title>Thermochromic Printable and Multicolor Polymeric Composite Based on Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative thermochromic composite consisting of a 2D perovskite and a nonionic block copolymer is developed. It exhibits excellent performance, allowing 80% transmittance modulation in the visible range, taking only a few seconds to switch from the bleached to the colored state (and vice versa) and providing a wide range of colors when heated at 70&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites (PVKs) are among the most promising materials for optoelectronic applications thanks to their outstanding photophysical properties and easy synthesis. Herein, a new PVK&#8208;based thermochromic composite is demonstrated. It can reversibly switch from a transparent state (transmittance &gt; 80%) at room temperature to a colored state (transmittance &lt; 10%) at high temperature, with very fast kinetics, taking only a few seconds to go from the bleached to the colored state (and vice versa). X&#8208;ray diffraction, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calometry, rheological, and optical measurements carried out during heating/cooling cycles reveal that thermochromism in the material is based on a reversible process of PVK disassembly/assembly mediated by intercalating polymeric chains, through the formation and breaking of hydrogen bonds between polymer and perovskite. Therefore, differently from other thermochromic perovskites, that generally work with the adsorption/desorption of volatile molecules, the system is able to perform several heating/cooling cycles regardless of environmental conditions. The color and transition temperature (from 70 to 120&#160;&#176;C) can be tuned depending on the type of perovskite. Moreover, this thermochromic material is printable and can be deposited by cheap techniques, paving the way for a new class of smart coatings with an unprecedented range of colors.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Enzyme Co&#8208;Expressed Nanomedicine for Anti&#8208;Metastasis Tumor Therapy by Up&#8208;Regulating Cellular Oxidative Stress and Depleting Cholesterol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor invasion and metastasis are the main causes of death in cancer patients. To overcome the limitations of current anti&#8208;tumor metastasis therapy, a novel multiple&#8208;enzymes co&#8208;expressed cholesterol oxidase loaded Co&#9472;PN3 single&#8208;atom nanozyme that can destroy the lipid raft structure and inhibiting lamellipodia formation through a cholesterol depletion and oxidative stress up&#8208;regulation strategy, effectively inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis, is constructed.








Abstract
Tumor cells movement and migration are inseparable from the integrity of lipid rafts and the formation of lamellipodia, and lipid rafts are also a prerequisite for the formation of lamellipodia. Therefore, destroying the lipid rafts is an effective strategy to inhibit tumor metastasis. Herein, a multi&#8208;enzyme co&#8208;expressed nanomedicine: cholesterol oxidase (CHO) loaded Co&#9472;PN3 single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Co&#9472;PN3 SA/CHO) that can up&#8208;regulate cellular oxidative stress, disrupt the integrity of lipid rafts, and inhibit lamellipodia formation to induce anti&#8208;metastasis tumor therapy, is developed. In this process, Co&#9472;PN3 SA can catalyze oxygen (O2)&#160;and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) via oxidase&#8208;like and Fenton&#8208;like properties. The doping of P atoms optimizes the adsorption process of the intermediate at the active site and enhances the ROS generation properties of nanomedicine. Meantime, O2 produced by catalase&#8208;like catalysis can combine with excess cholesterol to generate more H2O2 under CHO catalysis, achieving enhanced oxidative damage to tumor cells. Most importantly, cholesterol depletion in tumor cells also disrupts the integrity of lipid rafts and inhibits the formation of lamellipodia, greatly inhibiting the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells.

&lt;p&gt;Tumor invasion and metastasis are the main causes of death in cancer patients. To overcome the limitations of current anti-tumor metastasis therapy, a novel multiple-enzymes co-expressed cholesterol oxidase loaded Co&#9472;PN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; single-atom nanozyme that can destroy the lipid raft structure and inhibiting lamellipodia formation through a cholesterol depletion and oxidative stress up-regulation strategy, effectively inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis, is constructed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumor cells movement and migration are inseparable from the integrity of lipid rafts and the formation of lamellipodia, and lipid rafts are also a prerequisite for the formation of lamellipodia. Therefore, destroying the lipid rafts is an effective strategy to inhibit tumor metastasis. Herein, a multi-enzyme co-expressed nanomedicine: cholesterol oxidase (CHO) loaded Co&#9472;PN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; single-atom nanozyme (Co&#9472;PN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; SA/CHO) that can up-regulate cellular oxidative stress, disrupt the integrity of lipid rafts, and inhibit lamellipodia formation to induce anti-metastasis tumor therapy, is developed. In this process, Co&#9472;PN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; SA can catalyze oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&#160;and hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) via oxidase-like and Fenton-like properties. The doping of P atoms optimizes the adsorption process of the intermediate at the active site and enhances the ROS generation properties of nanomedicine. Meantime, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced by catalase-like catalysis can combine with excess cholesterol to generate more H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under CHO catalysis, achieving enhanced oxidative damage to tumor cells. Most importantly, cholesterol depletion in tumor cells also disrupts the integrity of lipid rafts and inhibits the formation of lamellipodia, greatly inhibiting the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells. This strategy by up-regulating cellular oxidative stress and depleting cellular cholesterol constructs a new idea for anti-metastasis&#8211;oriented cancer therapy strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoelectrons Sequentially Regulate Antibacterial Activity and Osseointegration of Titanium Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Au&#8208;RE/TiO2 coating of titanium implant can generate electron under near infrared light (NIR) illumination. In vivo and in vitro explorations prove the photoelectron&#8208;responsive titanium implants can sequentially regulate antibacterial activity and osseointegration through upconversion, providing a new solution for those patients with post&#8208;implantation infection and poor osseointegration.








Abstract
Titanium implants are widely used ; however, implantation occasionally fails due to infections during the surgery or poor osseointegration after the surgery. To solve the problem, an intelligent functional surface on titanium implant that can sequentially eradicate bacteria biofilm at the initial period and promote osseointegration at the late period of post&#8208;surgery time is designed. Such surfaces can be excited by near infrared light (NIR), with rare earth nanoparticles to upconvert the NIR light to visible range and adsorb by Au nanoparticles, supported by titanium oxide porous film on titanium implants. Under NIR irradiation, the implant converts the energy of phonon to hot electrons and lattice vibrations, while the former flows directly to the contact substance or partially reacts with the surrounding to generate reactive oxygen species, and the latter leads to the local temperature increase. The biofilm or microbes on the implant surface can be eradicated by NIR treatment in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, the surface exhibits superior biocompatibility for cell survival, adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation, which provides the foundation for osseointegration. In vivo implantation experiments demonstrate osseointegration is also promoted. This work thus demonstrates NIR&#8208;generated electrons can sequentially eradicate biofilms and regulate the osteogenic process, providing new solutions to fabricate efficient implant surfaces.

         <title>A Janus&#8208;ROS Healing System Promoting Infectious Bone Regeneration via Sono&#8208;Epigenetic Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Janus&#8208;reactive oxygen species healing system based on alendronate&#8208;mediated defective metal&#8211;organic framework sonosensitizer is developed, which can effectively clear Methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections and promote osteogenic differentiation under differential ultrasonic irradiation for infectious bone regeneration.








Abstract
Elimination of bacterial infections and simultaneously promoting osteogenic differentiation are highly required for infectious bone diseases. Massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) can damage cells, while low ROS concentrations as a molecular signal can regulate cellular fate. In this study, a Janus&#8208;ROS healing system is developed for infectious bone regeneration. An alendronate (ALN)&#8208;mediated defective metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) sonosensitizer is prepared, which can effectively clear Methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections and promote osteogenic differentiation under differential ultrasonic irradiation. In the presence of zirconium&#8211;phosphate coordination, the ALN&#8208;mediated porphyrin&#8208;based MOF (HN25) with a proper defect has great sonodynamic antibacterial efficiency (98.97%, 15&#160;min) and bone&#8208;targeting ability. Notably, under low&#8208;power ultrasound irradiation, HN25 can increase the chromatin accessibility of ossification&#8208;related genes and FOXO1 to promote bone repair through low ROS concentrations. Animal models of paravertebral infection, fracture with infection, and osteomyelitis demonstrate that HN25 successfully realizes the targeted and potent repair of various infectious bone tissues through rapid MRSA elimination, inhibiting osteoclast activity and promoting bone regeneration. The results show that high catalytic efficiency and bioactive MOF can be constructed using pharmaceutical&#8208;mediated defect engineering. The Janus&#8208;ROS treatment is also a promising therapeutic mode for infectious tissue regeneration.

         <title>Tandem Photon Avalanches for Various Nanoscale Emitters with Optical Nonlinearity up to 41st&#8208;Order through Interfacial Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tandem photon avalanches (TPA) strategy for various emitters with huge optical nonlinearity up to 41st&#8208;order through interfacial energy transfer is presented. The avalanched 800&#8208;nm Tm3+ emission non&#8208;radiatively pumps Er3+ to exhibit bright PA at a low threshold. Efficient avalanching behaviors are also observed for Ho3+, Ce3+, and blue emission of Tm3+ through the TPA mechanism.








Abstract
Photon avalanche has received continuous attention owing to its superior nonlinear dynamics and promising advanced applications. However, its impact is limited due to the intrinsic energy levels as well as the harsh requirements for the composites and sizes of doped materials. Here, with a universal mechanism named tandem photon avalanche (TPA), giant optical nonlinear response up to 41st&#8208;order in erbium ions, one of the most important lanthanide emitters, has been achieved on the nanoscale through interfacial energy transfer process. After capturing energy directly from the avalanched energy state 3H4 of Tm3+ (800&#8208;nm emission), erbium ions also exhibit bright green and red PA emissions with intensities comparable to that of Tm3+ at a low excitation threshold (7.1 kWcm&#8722;2). Using the same strategy, effective PA looping cycles are successfully activated in Ce3+ and Ho3+. Additionally, Yb3+&#8208;mediated networks are constructed to further propagate PA effects to lowly&#8208;doped Tm3+, enabling 475&#8208;nm PA emission. The newly proposed TPA strategy provides a facile route for generating photon avalanche not only from erbium ions but also from various emitters in multilayered core&#8211;shell nanoparticles.

         <title>Piezoionic High Performance Hydrogel Generator and Active Protein Absorber via Microscopic Porosity and Phase Blending</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potent piezoionic electricity is achieved in a porous and phase hybrid hydrogel, taking advantage of the engineered differences in flow velocities between sodium and chloride ions upon mechanical stimuli. Dynamic voltages up to 600&#160;mV and effective protein adsorptions are obtained. Potential application in nerve function adjustment, mimetic tactile sensors, hydrogel P/N heterojunction building, and enzyme immobilization are proposed.








Abstract
Generating electricity in hydrogel is very important but remains difficult. Hydrogel with electricity generation capability is more capable in bio&#8208;relevant tasks such as tissue engineering, artificial skin, or medical treatment, because electricity is indispensable in regulating physiological activities. Here, a porous and phase blending hydrogel structure for effective piezoionic electricity generation is developed. Dynamic electric field is generated taking advantage of the difference in streaming speeds of sodium and chloride in the material. Microscopic porosity and hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic phase blending are the two key factors for prominent piezoionic performance. Voltages as high as 600&#160;mV are first realized in hydrogels in response to medical ultrasound stimulation. The hydrogel structure is also subjective to effective substance exchange and can actively enrich proteins from surroundings under mechanical stimuli. Preliminary applications in neural stimulation, constructing complex spatial&#8208;temporal chemical and electric field distribution patterns, mimetic tactile sensor, sample pretreatment in fast detection, and enzyme immobilization are demonstrated.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Driven Non&#8208;Metallic Fenton&#8208;Active Center Construction for Extensive Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;metallic &#8220;Fenton&#8208;active&#8221; center construction strategy is proposed to catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 and H2O and enhance &#183;OH yield using Bi0.44Ba0.06Na0.5TiO2.97 nanocrystals. The built&#8208;in electric field and electron&#8208;rich oxygen vacancies promote &#183;OH yield even in the tumor area with a low H2O2 concentration, resulting in extensive cellular damage and enhanced cell&#8208;killing efficiency by activating the necroptosis pathway.








Abstract
Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) is an emerging tumor microenvironment&#8208;responsive cancer therapeutic strategy based on Fenton/Fenton&#8208;like reactions. However, the effectiveness of CDT is subject to the slow kinetic rate and non&#8208;homogeneous distribution of H2O2. In this study, a conceptual non&#8208;metallic &#8220;Fenton&#8208;active&#8221; center construction strategy is proposed to enhance CDT efficiency using Bi0.44Ba0.06Na0.5TiO2.97 (BNBT&#8208;6) nanocrystals. The separated charge carriers under a piezoelectric&#8208;induced electric field synchronize the oxidation of H2O and reduction of H2O2, which consequently increases hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) yield even under low H2O2 levels. Moreover, acceptor doping induces electron&#8208;rich oxygen vacancies to facilitate the dissociation of H2O2 and H2O and further promote &#183;OH generation. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that BNBT&#8208;6 induces extensive intracellular oxidative stress and enhances cell&#8208;killing efficiency by activating necroptosis in addition to the conventional apoptotic pathway. This study proposes a novel design approach for nanomaterials used in CDT and presents a new treatment strategy for apoptosis&#8208;resistant tumors.

         <title>An Ultrafast Air Self&#8208;Charging Zinc Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrafast air self&#8208;charging Zn/polyaniline@Pt/C (Zn/PANI@Pt/C) battery is developed. Benefiting from the Pt/C catalysis, the reaction kinetics of the redox reaction between PANI and O2 is accelerated and the redox potential difference between them is extended due to the reduced overpotential of oxygen reduction reaction. Therefore, the Zn/PANI@Pt/C batteries exhibit superior self&#8208;charging performance compared with typical Zn/PANI batteries.








Abstract
Air self&#8208;charging power systems possess the capability of energy harvesting, conversion, and storage simultaneously. However, in general, their self&#8208;charging rate is slow and the batteries cannot be oxidized to the fully charged state due to the weak oxidizability of O2. Herein, an ultrafast air self&#8208;charging aqueous zinc battery is designed by constructing a polyaniline@Pt/C (PANI@Pt/C)&#160;composite cathode. The introduction of Pt/C catalyst endows the redox reaction between PANI and O2 with fast reaction kinetics and extended redox potential difference. Therefore, the self&#8208;charging rate of the Zn/PANI@Pt/C batteries is effectively accelerated and they can be self&#8208;charged to fully charged state. Furthermore, the PANI can be recharged by O2 simultaneously during discharging process to compensate the consumed electrical energy, achieving prolonged energy supply. In addition, the PANI@Pt/C cathodes can be directly used as the cathodes of flexible self&#8208;charging zinc batteries due to their excellent mechanical properties. As a proof of concept, flexible soft&#8208;packaged Zn/PANI@Pt/C batteries are fabricated and displayed stable electrochemical performance and self&#8208;rechargeability even at different bending states. A route is provided here to design ultrafast chemical self&#8208;charging energy storage devices and the horizons of flexible energy storage devices are broadened.

         <title>Synergizing a Large Ordinary Nernst Effect and Axis&#8208;Dependent Conduction Polarity in Flat Band KMgBi Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The layered flat band material, KMgBi, simultaneously exhibits axis&#8208;dependent conduction polarity, which produces a large transverse thermoelectric effect (&#8776;46 &#181;V K&#8722;1), and ordinary Nernst effect (ONE) that greatly boosts this effect (&#8776;198 &#181;V K&#8722;1) with a 1.4 T magnetic field. The presence of both effects in one material enables an experimental understanding on their synergistic combination for transverse thermoelectric devices.








Abstract
The exploration of quantum materials in which an applied thermo/electrical/magnetic field along one crystallographic direction produces an anisotropic response has led to unique functionalities. Along these lines, KMgBi is a layered, narrow gap semiconductor near a critical state between multiple Dirac phases due to the presence of a flat band near the Fermi level. The valence band is highly anisotropic with minimal cross&#8208;plane dispersion, which, in combination with an isotropic conduction band, enables axis&#8208;dependent conduction polarity. Thermopower and Hall measurements indicate dominant p&#8208;type conduction along the cross&#8208;plane direction, and n&#8208;type conduction along the in&#8208;plane direction, leading to a significant zero&#8208;field transverse thermoelectric response when the heat flux is at an angle to the principal crystallographic directions. Additionally, a large Ordinary Nernst effect (ONE) is observed with an applied field.&#160; It arises from the ambipolar term in the Nernst effect, whereby the Lorentz force on electrons and holes makes them drift in opposite directions so that the resulting Nernst voltage becomes a function of the difference between their partial thermopowers, greatly enhancing the ONE. It is proven that axis&#8208;dependent polarity&#160;can synergistically enhance the ONE, in addition to leading to a zero&#8208;field transverse thermoelectric performance.

         <title>Mechanical Actuation via Homeomorphic Transformations of Topological Solitons within Polymer Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The response of a topological soliton embedded in a liquid crystal network. Upon thermal stimulus, complex reversible modulations are observed. For example, a field of valleys turn into protrusions with a modulation of 40%. The results are in agreement with the numerical model. This technology is expected to broaden the range of applications from tunable optical devices to tribology applications.








Abstract
Topological solitons are currently under investigation for their exotic properties, especially in nonlinear physics, optics, and material sciences. However, challenges of robust generation and limited stability over time have hindered their practical uses. To address this issue, an approach is developed to form structured arrays of solitons in films of polymerizable liquid crystals. Their complex molecular architecture is preserved by in situ photopolymerization forming a stable liquid crystal network. Most excitingly, their properties are advanced to include responsiveness functions. When thermally actuated, these topological solitons mediate the reconfiguration of surface topographies. Complex shape changes occur depending on the intrinsic complex spatial distribution of the director, which may even lead to full shape inversion and topographical changes as high as &#8776;40% of the initial thickness. Conversely, the shape changes provide information on the initial director profile, which is consistent with the mathematical model. The soliton&#8208;containing polymer coatings are applicable in multiple domains, ranging from tunable optics to haptics, and from shape&#8208;coupled sensing systems to temperature&#8208;coupled heat management.

         <dc:description>
Inflammation&#8208;free radicals cycle after myocardial infarction (MI) leads to heart failure and patient death. This work creates a Fe&#8208;Cur@TA nanozyme for cardiac&#8208;targeted myocardial infarction therapy, with powerful anti&#8208;inflammatory and free radical scavenging properties. In mice and beagle dog MI models, it can improve cardiac function and reduce scarring, showing potential for clinical use in heart disease.








Abstract
Severe systemic inflammation following myocardial infarction (MI) is a major cause of patient mortality. MI&#8208;induced inflammation can trigger the production of free radicals, which in turn ultimately leads to increased inflammation in cardiac lesions (i.e., inflammation&#8208;free radicals cycle), resulting in heart failure and patient death. However, currently available anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs have limited efficacy due to their weak anti&#8208;inflammatory effect and poor accumulation at the cardiac site. Herein, a novel Fe&#8208;Cur@TA nanozyme is developed for targeted therapy of MI, which is generated by coordinating Fe3+ and anti&#8208;inflammatory drug curcumin (Cur) with further modification of tannic acid (TA). Such Fe&#8208;Cur@TA nanozyme exhibits excellent free radicals scavenging and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties by reducing immune cell infiltration, promoting macrophage polarization toward the M2&#8208;like phenotype, suppressing inflammatory cytokine secretion, and blocking the inflammatory free radicals cycle. Furthermore, due to the high affinity of TA for cardiac tissue, Fe&#8208;Cur@TA shows an almost tenfold greater in cardiac retention and uptake than Fe&#8208;Cur. In mouse and preclinical beagle dog MI models, Fe&#8208;Cur@TA nanozyme preserves cardiac function and reduces scar size, suggesting promising potential for clinical translation in cardiovascular disease.

         <title>Scalable Solution&#8208;Processed Hybrid Electron Transport Layers for Efficient All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an electron transport layer ink is designed using hybrid fullerenes composed of mixed C60, phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester, and indene&#8208;C60 bisadduct. This electron transport layer exhibits high conductivity, good energy&#8208;level alignment, and low interfacial nonradiative recombination. The all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 23.3% (aperture area = 20.25 cm2).








Abstract
All&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells offer the potential to surpass the Shockley&#8211;Queisser (SQ) limit efficiency of single&#8208;junction solar cells while maintaining the advantages of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;productivity solution processing. However, scalable solution processing of electron transport layer (ETL) in p&#8208;i&#8208;n structured perovskite solar subcells remains challenging due to the rough perovskite film surface and energy level mismatch between ETL and perovskites. Here, scalable solution processing of hybrid fullerenes (HF) with blade&#8208;coating on both wide&#8208;bandgap (&#8776;1.80 eV) and narrow&#8208;bandgap (&#8776;1.25 eV) perovskite films in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules is developed. The HF, comprising a mixture of fullerene (C60), phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester, and indene&#8208;C60 bisadduct, exhibits improved conductivity, superior energy level alignment with both wide&#8208; and narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskites, and reduced interfacial nonradiative recombination when compared to the conventional thermal&#8208;evaporated C60. With scalable solution&#8208;processed HF as the ETLs, the all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 23.3% (aperture area = 20.25 cm2). This study paves the way to all&#8208;solution processing of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules in the future.

         <title>Optical Nonlinearity Enabled Super&#8208;Resolved Multiplexing Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiplexing is of great significance in biology, medicine, and microscopic imaging. Here, a new approach is introduced using the optical nonlinearity of lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) for super&#8208;resolved multiplexing microscopy. By applying a vortex beam, imaging resolution is enhanced and UCNPs are differentiated based on their distinctive nonlinearities. This enables a complementary dimension to spectral, temporal, and polarized dimensions for nanoscale multiplexing.








Abstract
Optical multiplexing for nanoscale object recognition is of great significance within the intricate domains of biology, medicine, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and microscopic imaging. Traditionally, the multiplexing dimensions of nanoscopy are limited to emission intensity, color, lifetime, and polarization. Here, a novel dimension, optical nonlinearity, is proposed for super&#8208;resolved multiplexing microscopy. This optical nonlinearity is attributable to the energy transitions between multiple energy levels of the doped lanthanide ions in upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), resulting in unique optical fingerprints for UCNPs with different compositions. A vortex beam is applied to transport the optical nonlinearity onto the imaging point&#8208;spread function (PSF), creating a robust super&#8208;resolved multiplexing imaging strategy for differentiating UCNPs with distinctive optical nonlinearities. The composition information of the nanoparticles can be retrieved with variations of the corresponding PSF in the obtained image. Four channels multiplexing super&#8208;resolved imaging with a single scanning, applying emission color and nonlinearity of two orthogonal imaging dimensions with a spatial resolution higher than 150&#160;nm (1/6.5&#955;), are demonstrated. This work provides a new and orthogonal dimension &#8211; optical nonlinearity &#8211; to existing multiplexing dimensions, which shows great potential in bioimaging, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, microarray assays, deep tissue multiplexing detection, and high&#8208;density data storage.

         <title>Band Structure Engineering and Orbital Orientation Control Constructing Dual Active Sites for Efficient Sulfur Redox Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interaction trend among redox reactions affect evolutionarily electrocatalytic activity. Using WS2 as an example, band structure engineering and orbital orientation control are combined to construct Li&#8722;S and S&#8722;B dual&#8208;coordination, accurately modulating the interaction trend to accelerate the rate&#8208;determined process. This work presents a dual&#8208;coordination design for advancing evolutionarily catalytic activity, helping with effective catalyst design for practical Li&#8722;S batteries.








Abstract
The kinetics difference among multistep electrochemical processes leads to the accumulation of soluble polysulfides and thus shuttle effect in lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. While the interaction between catalysts and representative species has been reported, the root of the kinetics difference, interaction change among redox reactions, remains unclear, which significantly impedes the catalysts design for Li&#8722;S batteries. Here, this work deciphers the interaction change among electrocatalytic sulfur reactions, using tungsten disulfide (WS2) a model system to demonstrate the efficiency of modifying electrocatalytic selectivity via dual&#8208;coordination design. Band structure engineering and orbital orientation control are combined to guide the design of WS2 with boron dopants and sulfur vacancies (B&#8722;WS2&#8722;x), accurately modulating interaction with lithium and sulfur sites in polysulfide species for relatively higher interaction with short&#8208;chain polysulfides. The modified interaction trend is experimentally confirmed by distinguishing the kinetics of each electrochemical reaction step, indicating the effectiveness of the designed strategy. An Ah&#8208;level pouch cell with B&#8722;WS2&#8722;x delivers a gravimetric energy density of up to 417.6 Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 3.6&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1 and negative/positive ratio of 1.2. This work presents a dual&#8208;coordination strategy for advancing evolutionarily catalytic activity, offering a rational strategy to develop effective catalysts for practical Li&#8722;S batteries.

The heterogeneous integration of cesium lead bromide LEDs and molybdenum disulfide&#8208;based thin&#8208;film transistors enables the fabrication of active&#8208;matrix perovskite light&#8208;emitting diode (PeLED) display. The single&#8208;source evaporation method enables the deposition of uniform perovskite thin films over large areas. The fabricated active&#8208;matrix display exhibits excellent brightness control capability and a high switching speed, indicating the potential of PeLED as a promising light source.








Abstract
The uniform deposition of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) and their integration with backplane thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) remain challenging for large&#8208;area display applications. Herein, an active&#8208;matrix PeLED display fabricated via the heterogeneous integration of cesium lead bromide LEDs and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)&#8208;based TFTs is presented. The single&#8208;source evaporation method enables the deposition of highly uniform perovskite thin films over large areas. PeLEDs are integrated with MoS2 TFTs to fabricate an active&#8208;matrix PeLED display with an 8 &#215; 8 array, which exhibits excellent brightness control capability and high switching speed. This study demonstrates the potential of PeLEDs as candidates for next&#8208;generation displays and presents a novel approach for fabricating optoelectronic devices via the heterogeneous integration of 2D materials and perovskites, thereby paving the way toward the fabrication of practical future optoelectronic systems.

         <title>Breadmaking&#8208;Inspired Antioxidant Porous Yeast Microcarriers for Stem Cell Delivery in Diabetic Wound Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work represents an innovative application of breadmaking principle in the creation of porous microcarriers for adipose&#8208;derived stem cells (ADSCs) delivery (ADSC@YMC) to treat diabetic wound. Simultaneously, the release of glutathione (GSH) from the yeast imparts antioxidative qualities to the microcarriers, ultimately extending the viability and retention of ADSCs.








Abstract
Stem cell&#8208;based therapies have exhibited significant promise in the treatment of diabetic ulcers (DU). Nevertheless, enhancing the survival rate and functionality of transplanted stem cells poses a substantial challenge. In this study, inspired by the breadmaking process, yeast microcarriers (YMC) are devised as vehicles for stem cells to address these challenges. The fabrication of YMC involves the amalgamation of microfluidic emulsification with yeast&#8208;mediated fermentation, yielding microcarriers with outstanding biocompatibility, high porosity, and antioxidant activity. Adipose&#8208;derived stem cells (ADSCs) seeded onto YMC display remarkable cell viability and retain their cellular functions effectively. Additionally, YMC boast a rich glutathione content and exhibit remarkable ROS scavenging ability, thus shielding the ADSCs from oxidative stress. In vivo experiments further substantiate that ADSC@YMC implementation significantly lowered ROS levels in diabetic wounds, resulting in enhanced stem cell retention and improved angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and tissue regeneration. These results highlight the potential of ADSC@YMC as a promising platform for delivering stem cell in the treatment of diabetic wounds.

         <title>Massively Scalable Self&#8208;Assembly of Nano and Microparticle Monolayers via Aerosol Assisted Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled colloidal lithography provides a cost effective and simple strategy to produce submicron and nanoscale lithography. However, current self&#8208;assembly strategies have proved very challenging to scale and maintain highly ordered nanostructured arrays. A novel aerosol&#8208;based strategy is demonstrated to increase colloidal self&#8208;assembly rates as high as 268 cm2 min&#8722;1 and new physical mechanisms governing the self&#8208;assembly are discussed.








Abstract
An extremely rapid process for self&#8208;assembling well&#8208;ordered, nano, and microparticle monolayers via a novel aerosolized method is presented. The novel technique can reach monolayer self&#8208;assembly rates as high as 268 cm2 min&#8722;1 from a single aerosolizing source and methods to reach faster monolayer self&#8208;assembly rates are outlined. A new physical mechanism describing the self&#8208;assembly process is presented and new insights enabling high&#8208;efficiency nanoparticle monolayer self&#8208;assembly are developed. In addition, well&#8208;ordered monolayer arrays from particles of various sizes, surface functionality, and materials are fabricated. This new technique enables a 93&#215; increase in monolayer self&#8208;assembly rates compared to the current state of the art and has the potential to provide an extremely low&#8208;cost option for submicron nanomanufacturing.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Nano&#8208;CT Contrast Agent Leveraging Size Aggregation for Improved In Vivo Tumor CT Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monocomponent and size&#8208;adjustable nano&#8208;computed tomography (CT) contrast agent is developed by utilizing a reactive oxygen species&#8208;responsive platform and a fluorogen with aggregation function for improved in vivo tumor CT imaging. The nano&#8208;CT contrast agent displays tumor&#8208;targeting property and can rapidly aggregate in tumor regions after activation, enhancing its retention efficiency and extending the imaging time window.








Abstract
Computed tomography (CT) is a widely utilized noninvasive diagnostic tool in clinical practice. However, the commonly employed small molecular iodinated contrast agents (ICAs) in clinical CT imaging have limitations such as nonspecific distribution in body, rapid clearance through kidneys, etc., leading to a narrow imaging time window. In contrast, existing nano&#8208;sized ICAs face challenges like structural uncertainty, poor reproducibility, low iodine content, and uniformity issues. In this study, a novel approach is presented utilizing the aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) to design and fabricate a kind of monocomponent nano&#8208;sized ICA (namely, BioDHU&#8208;CT NPs) that exhibits a unique aggregation effect upon activation. The small sized BioDHU&#8208;CT nanoparticles exhibit excellent tumor targeting capabilities and can release ICA modified with AIEgen with a high release efficiency up to 88.45%, under the activation of reactive oxygen species highly expressed in tumor regions. The released ICA performs in situ aggregation capability in the tumor region, which can enhance the retention efficiency of CT contrast agents, extending the imaging time window and improving the imaging quality in tumor regions.

         <title>Rational Medium&#8208;Range Charge Transfer Strategy Toward Highly Efficient Violet&#8208;Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Narrowed Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here the wide&#8208;bandgap emitter fusing two ultraviolet multiple resonance fragments via a unique double&#8208;halide cyclized coupling reaction is presented. The resulting molecule can simultaneously achieve efficient violet&#8208;blue emission and narrowed spectra. The fabricated violet&#8208;blue electroluminescent device exhibits ideal performances with a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 20.5%.








Abstract
The spectral narrowing engineering of pure&#8208;organic emitters attracts great research interests in realizing high color purity. Here, the adjusted medium&#8208;range charge transfer (MCT) strategy of TIC&#8208;BO with rigid planar structure by fusing two typical UV&#8208;emitting multiple resonance (MR) fragments via the ingenious double&#8208;halide cyclized coupling reaction is reported. The resulting TIC&#8208;BO with MCT nature shows efficient violet&#8208;blue emission in dilute toluene and evaporated host&#8211;guest films, and desirably narrowed spectra are achieved by the suppression of structural relaxation and the shortened charge transfer states. The single&#8208;doped device with TIC&#8208;BO as emitter shows narrowed violet&#8208;blue electroluminescence peaked at 428&#160;nm with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 43&#160;nm (0.28&#160;eV), and the Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.160, 0.050). A maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 20.50% is achieved, which is among the best results of the corresponding violet&#8208;blue emitting region. Further introduction of a stronger electron&#8208;donating carbazole group makes TIC&#8208;BNO exhibit red&#8208;shifted sky&#8208;blue emission with MR&#8208;dominant properties, and good device performance is received with EQEmax of 34.58%. The outstanding performances of TIC&#8208;BO successfully demonstrate the significance and prospect of the proposed molecular design strategy.

         <title>Correlating Single&#8208;Atomic Ruthenium Interdistance with Long&#8208;Range Interaction Boosts Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru&#8208;based correlated single&#8208;atom catalysts (c&#8208;SACs) with different and precise single&#8208;atomic interdistances are constructed via a combination of planar organometallic molecular design and &#960;&#8211;&#960; molecule&#8211;carbon nanotube confinement, for systematic investigation of the structure&#8211;activity relationship at the atomic level, precisely manipulating the electrostatic force using the atomic structure and leading to severalfold enhancement in the activity of c&#8208;SACs with multimetal sites.








Abstract
Correlated single&#8208;atom catalysts (c&#8208;SACs) with tailored intersite metal&#8211;metal interactions are superior to conventional catalysts with isolated metal sites. However, precise quantification of the single&#8208;atomic interdistance (SAD) in c&#8208;SACs is not yet achieved, which is essential for a crucial understanding and remarkable improvement of the correlated metal&#8208;site&#8208;governed catalytic reaction kinetics. Here, three Ru c&#8208;SACs are fabricated with precise SAD using a planar organometallic molecular design and &#960;&#8211;&#960; molecule&#8211;carbon nanotube confinement. This strategy results in graded SAD from 2.4 to 9.3 &#197; in the Ru c&#8208;SACs, wherein tailoring the Ru SAD into 7.0 &#197; generates an exceptionally high turnover frequency of 17.92 H2 s&#8722;1 and a remarkable mass activity of 100.4 A mg&#8722;1 under 50 and 100 mV overpotentials, respectively, which is superior to all the Ru&#8208;based catalysts reported previously. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations confirm that Ru SAD has a negative correlation with its d&#8208;band center owing to the long&#8208;range interactions induced by distinct local atomic geometries, resulting in an appropriate electrostatic potential and the highest catalytic activity on c&#8208;SACs with 7.0 &#197; Ru SAD. The present study promises an attractive methodology for experimentally quantifying the metal SAD to provide valuable insights into the catalytic mechanism of c&#8208;SACs.

         <title>Immunogenic PANoptosis&#8208;Initiated Cancer Sono&#8208;Immune Reediting Nanotherapy by Iteratively Boosting Cancer Immunity Cycle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nano/genetically engineered sonosensitive extracellular vesicles are rationally designed for ultrasound nanomedicine&#8208;triggered tumor immuno&#8208;reediting therapeutic by efficiently inducing tumor immunogenic PANoptosis and iteratively boosting cancer innate immunity cycle. This specific regulated cell death renders tumor cells highly immunogenic through maximally activating damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, thereby reprogramming negative immune microenvironment and advancing positive adaptive antitumor immune response.








Abstract
The cancer&#8208;immune cycle conceptualized the mechanisms of driving T cell responses to tumors, but w as limited by immunological ignorance elicited by tumor inherent immunoediting, which failed to initiate and maintain adaptive immunity. Targeting specific vulnerabilities of cell death patterns may provide unique opportunities to boost T cell antitumor immunological effects. Here an ultrasound nanomedicine&#8208;triggered tumor immuno&#8208;reediting therapeutic strategy using nano/genetically engineered extracellular vesicles, which can induce tumor highly immunogenic PANoptosis and iteratively start&#8208;up the energization of cancer innate immunity cycle by repeatedly liberating damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, thereby priming sufficient antigen&#8208;specific T cells and shaping protective immune response through activating cGAS&#8208;STING signaling pathways, is reported. Aided by immune checkpoint blockade, the reprogramming of immune microenvironment further facilitated a prompt bridging of innate and adaptive immunity, and remarkably suppressed metastatic and rechallenged tumor growth. Thus, targeting PANoptotic cell death provides a catcher against immune escape and a positive&#8208;feedback immune activation gateway for overcoming immune resistance to intractable cancers.

         <title>Intrafibrillar Crosslinking Enables Decoupling of Mechanical Properties and Structure of a Composite Fibrous Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to the controllable intrafibrillar photocrosslinking, a composite fibrous hydrogel enables the variation in hydrogel stiffness without changing its architecture. For fibroblasts seeded on this gel, a sole increase in gel stiffness results in stronger contraction forces and activation.








Abstract
The fibrous network of an extracellular matrix (ECM) possesses mechanical properties that convey critical biological functions in cell mechanotransduction. Engineered fibrous hydrogels show promise in emulating key aspects of ECM structure and functions. However, varying hydrogel mechanics without changing its architecture remains a challenge. A composite fibrous hydrogel is developed to vary gel stiffness without affecting its structure by controlling intrafibrillar crosslinking. The hydrogel is formed from aldehyde&#8208;modified cellulose nanocrystals and gelatin methacryloyl that provide the capability of intrafibrillar photocrosslinking. By varying the degree of gelatin functionalization with methacryloyl groups and/or photoirradiation time, the hydrogel's elastic modulus is changed by more than an order of magnitude, while preserving the same fiber diameter and pore size. The hydrogel is used to seed primary mouse lung fibroblasts and test the role of ECM stiffness on fibroblast contraction and activation. Increasing hydrogel stiffness by stronger intrafibrillar crosslinking results in enhanced fibroblast activation and increased fibroblast contraction force, yet at a reduced contraction speed. The developed approach enables the fabrication of biomimetic hydrogels with decoupled structural and mechanical properties, facilitating studies of ECM mechanics on tissue development and disease progression.

         <title>Boron and Nitrogen Isotope Effects on Hexagonal Boron Nitride Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexagonal boron nitride crystals with controlled concentrations of the boron (10B and 11B) and nitrogen (14N and 15N) isotopes are synthesized and their optical properties are measured, including their Raman spectra. This provides a method for tailoring hBN's optical and nuclear spin properties for specific applications.








Abstract
The unique physical, mechanical, chemical, optical, and electronic properties of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) make it a promising 2D material for electronic, optoelectronic, nanophotonic, and quantum devices. Here, the changes in hBN's properties induced by isotopic purification in both boron and nitrogen are reported. Previous studies on isotopically pure hBN have focused on purifying the boron isotope concentration in hBN from its natural concentration (&#8776;20 at% 10B, 80 at% 11B) while using naturally abundant nitrogen (99.6 at% 14N, 0.4 at% 15N), that is, almost pure 14N. In this study, the class of isotopically purified hBN crystals to 15N is extended. Crystals in the four configurations, namely h10B14N, h11B14N, h10B15N, and h11B15N, are grown by the metal flux method using boron and nitrogen single isotope (&gt; 99%) enriched sources, with nickel plus chromium as the solvent. In&#8208;depth Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopies demonstrate the high quality of the monoisotopic hBN crystals with vibrational and optical properties of the 15N&#8208;purified crystals at the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of currently available 14N&#8208;purified hBN. The growth of high&#8208;quality h10B14N, h11B14N, h10B15N, and h11B15N opens exciting perspectives for thermal conductivity control in heat management, as well as for advanced functionalities in quantum technologies.

         <title>Architecture of Vanadium&#8208;Based MXene Dysregulating Tumor Redox Homeostasis for Amplified Nanozyme Catalytic/Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vanadium&#8208;based MXene nanoplatform is constructured for amplified nanozyme catalytic/ photothermal therapy, which displays favorable photothermal effect and nanozyme&#8208;catalyzed efficacy. Tumor hypoxia is relieved and lower thermal resistance contributes to photothermal therapy for further promoting enzycatalytic activity, which leads to a significant disruption of redox homeostasis and inhibition of tumor growth.








Abstract
Taking the significance of the special microenvironment for tumor cell survival into account, disrupting tumor redox homeostasis is highly prospective for improving therapeutic efficacy. Herein, a multifunctional 2D vanadium&#8208;based MXene nanoplatform, V4C3/atovaquone@bovine albumin (V4C3/ATO@BSA, abbreviated as VAB) has been elaborately constructed for ATO&#8208;enhanced nanozyme catalytic/photothermal therapy. The redox homeostasis within the tumor cells is eventually disrupted, showing a remarkable anti&#8208;tumor effect. The VAB nanoplatform with mixed vanadium valence states can induce a cascade of catalyzed reactions in the tumor microenvironment, generating plenty of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with effective glutathione consumption to amplify oxidative stress. Meanwhile, the stable and strong photothermal effect of VAB under near&#8208;infrared irradiation not only causes the necrosis of tumor cells, but also improves its peroxidase&#8208;like activity. In addition, the release of ATO can effectively alleviate endogenous oxygen consumption to limit triphosadenine formation and inhibit mitochondrial respiration. As a result, the expression of heat shock proteins is effectively suppressed to overcome thermoresistance and the production of ROS can be further promoted due to mitochondrial injury. Moreover, VAB also presents high photoacoustic and photothermal imaging performances. In brief, the multifunctional nanoplatform can provide ATO&#8208;enhanced nanozyme catalytic/photothermal therapy with broadening the biomedical applications of vanadium&#8208;based MXene.

         <title>A Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte Based on Li0.95Na0.05FePO4 for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible composite solid electrolyte based on Li0.95Na0.05FePO4 with excellent interface compatibility by a simple preparation method. Due to its excellent interfacial stability with lithium metal and cathodes, the lithium metal battery of Li||LFP at 0.5 C current density shows excellent cycling stability (151.5 mAh g&#8722;1 for 500 cycles, 96.5% capacity retention, and 99.3%).








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) play a crucial role in developing lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with high safety and energy density. Exploring SSEs with excellent comprehensive performance is the key to achieving the practical application of LMBs. In this work, the great potential of Li0.95Na0.05FePO4 (LNFP) as an ideal SSE due to its enhanced ionic conductivity and reliable stability in contact with lithium metal anode is demonstrated. Moreover, LNFP&#8208;based composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) are prepared to further improve electronic insulation and interface stability. The CSE containing 50 wt% of LNFP (LNFP50) shows high ionic conductivity (3.58 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C) and good compatibility with Li metal anode and cathodes. Surprisingly, the LMB of Li|LNFP50|LiFePO4 cell at 0.5 C current density shows good cycling stability (151.5 mAh g&#8722;1 for 500 cycles, 96.5% capacity retention, and 99.3% Coulombic efficiency), and high&#8208;energy LMB of Li|LNFP50|Li[Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1]O2 cell maintains 80% capacity retention after 170 cycles, which are better than that with traditional liquid electrolytes (LEs). This investigation offers a new approach to commercializing SSEs with excellent comprehensive performance for high&#8208;performance LMBs.

Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts
In article number 2310699, Bowen Jiang, Cheng Chen, Zongkui Kou, and co&#8208;workers report the precise manipulation of single&#8208;atomic Ru interdistances via a planar organometallic molecular design. Assembling the Ru interdistance to a rational level produces long&#8208;range interaction for electrocatalysis, whereas the unassembled ones are &#8220;on tiptoes&#8221; outside electrocatalysis.

Microneedle Patches
Due to the challenges associated with the extraction of dermal interstitial fluid (ISF), the impact of ISF sampling in clinical applications has been limited. In article number 2304704, Levent Beker and co&#8208;workers propose a fully integrated wearable device that leverages a versatile hollow microneedle patch for ISF extraction using touch&#8208;activated vacuum pressure. The developed device can continuously sample and detect ISF biomarkers for long periods.

Living Hydrogels
When embedded inside 3D&#8208;printed hydrogels, cells from the eukaryotic microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii grow in clusters predominantly located in the hydrogel periphery, where they benefit from increased gas exchange and access to light. CO2 capture efficiency increases proportionally with the exposed surface area of the living hydrogels. These findings, presented by Kunal Masania, Marie&#8208;Eve Aubin&#8208;Tam, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2305505 provide design parameters for the development of highly efficient 3D photosynthetic living materials.

Super&#8208;Resolved Multiplexing Microscopy
The optical nonlinearity of lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles can be transported by a vortex excitation beam onto the imaging point spread function for differentiating single nanoparticles. In article number 2308844, Chaohao Chen, Faliang Cheng, Lan Fu, Xiaoxue Xu, Fan Wang, and co&#8208;workers propose a novel and efficient dimension, optical nonlinearity, for super&#8208;resolved multiplexing microscopy and demonstrate its orthogonal capacity to emission color in a four&#8208;channel multiplexed imaging.

Lanthanide Halide Nanocrystals
Novel luminescent 0D lanthanide halide nanocrystals with bright narrow&#8208;band green emission are reported by Peigeng Han, Kun Zhao, Ruifeng Lu, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2302140. The introduction of an ns2&#8208;cation dopant not only optimizes the crystallinity, but also greatly boosts the photoluminescence efficiency up to 48.1%. Furthermore, Cs3TbCl6:2.5%Sb nanocrystals are proved to serve as a promising nanoscintillator, which has versatile application prospects for lighting and X&#8208;ray imaging.

Electrochemical Microactuators
In article number 2304517, Mahdi Hamidinejad, Michael De Volder, and co&#8208;workers introduce a new type of ultralow&#8208;power electrochemical microactuator. These microsctructures are made out of lithographically defined 3D carbon nanotube architectures that are loaded with active materials that can alloy with lithium. Upon electrochemical lithiation and delithiation of that material, the microstructures are actuated reversibly.

         <title>Micro&#8208;/Nanohierarchical Structures Physically Engineered on Surfaces: Analysis and Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent decades, significant progress has been achieved in micro&#8208;/nanohierarchical structures physically engineered on surfaces. This review summarizes the recent advances in the development of such structures, provides a classification of their basic constituents according to function and shape, and discusses the related fabrication strategies, ways of combining basic components, potential applications, and future research directions.








Abstract
The high demand for micro&#8208;/nanohierarchical structures as components of functional substrates, bioinspired devices, energy&#8208;related electronics, and chemical/physical transducers has inspired their in&#8208;depth studies and active development of the related fabrication techniques. In particular, significant progress has been achieved in hierarchical structures physically engineered on surfaces, which offer the advantages of wide&#8208;range material compatibility, design diversity, and mechanical stability, and numerous unique structures with important niche applications have been developed. This review categorizes the basic components of hierarchical structures physically engineered on surfaces according to function/shape and comprehensively summarizes the related advances, focusing on the fabrication strategies, ways of combining basic components, potential applications, and future research directions. Moreover, the physicochemical properties of hierarchical structures physically engineered on surfaces are compared based on the function of their basic components, which may help to avoid the bottlenecks of conventional single&#8208;scale functional substrates. Thus, the present work is expected to provide a useful reference for scientists working on multicomponent functional substrates and inspire further research in this field.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembled Carbon Nitride Nanostructures for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;inspired supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is an elegant bottom&#8208;up strategy to synthesize high surface area carbon nitride with superior morphological features and other semiconducting and catalytic properties in a facile and eco&#8208;friendly manner. The current review article provides a bird's eye view of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly synthesis of carbon nitride nanostructures and their photocatalytic water&#8208;splitting application and provides a comprehensive outlook.








Abstract
Fast production of hydrogen and oxygen in large amounts at an economic rate is the need of the hour to cater to the needs of the most awaited hydrogen energy, a futuristic renewable energy solution. Production of hydrogen through simple water splitting via visible light photocatalytic approach using sunlight is considered as one of the most promising and sustainable approaches for generating clean fuels. For this purpose, a variety of catalytic techniques and novel catalysts have been investigated. Among these catalysts, carbon nitride is presently deemed as one of the best candidates for the visible light photocatalysis due to its unique molecular structure and adequate visible&#8208;range bandgap. Its bandgap can be further engineered by structural and morphological manipulation or by doping/hybridization. Among numerous synthetic approaches for carbon nitrides, supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is one of the recently developed elegant bottom&#8208;up strategies as it is bio&#8208;inspired and provides a facile and eco&#8208;friendly route to synthesize high surface area carbon nitride with superior morphological features and other semiconducting and catalytic properties. The current review article broadly covers supramolecular self&#8208;assembly synthesis of carbon nitride nanostructures and their photocatalytic water&#8208;splitting applications and provides a comprehensive outlook on future directions.

         <title>The Material World of 3D&#8208;Bioprinted and Microfluidic&#8208;Chip Models of Human Liver Fibrosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomaterials are essential components of disease models as they more precisely replicate interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix. In this review, the use of biomaterials in advanced 3D&#8208;bioprinted and microfluidic&#8208;chip in vitro models of human liver fibrosis are discussed, highlighting how mechanical and biochemical properties of the materials are explored to mimic the disease microenvironment in vitro.








Abstract
Biomaterials are extensively used to mimic cell&#8211;matrix interactions, which are essential for cell growth, function, and differentiation. This is particularly relevant when developing in vitro disease models of organs rich in extracellular matrix, like the liver. Liver disease involves a chronic wound&#8208;healing response with formation of scar tissue known as fibrosis. At early stages, liver disease can be reverted, but as disease progresses, reversion is no longer possible, and there is no cure. Research for new therapies is hampered by the lack of adequate models that replicate the mechanical properties and biochemical stimuli present in the fibrotic liver. Fibrosis is associated with changes in the composition of the extracellular matrix that directly influence cell behavior. Biomaterials could play an essential role in better emulating the disease microenvironment. In this paper, the recent and cutting&#8208;edge biomaterials used for creating in vitro models of human liver fibrosis are revised, in combination with cells, bioprinting, and/or microfluidics. These technologies have been instrumental to replicate the intricate structure of the unhealthy tissue and promote medium perfusion that improves cell growth and function, respectively. A comprehensive analysis of the impact of material hints and cell&#8211;material interactions in a tridimensional context is provided.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks and Their Composites for Chronic Wound Healing: From Bench to Bedside</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article highlights recent representative research progress using metal&#8211;organic frameworks and their composites with antibacterial effects and pro&#8208;angiogenic activity for the treatment of chronic wounds.








Abstract
Chronic wounds are characterized by delayed and dysregulated healing processes. As such, they have emerged as an increasingly significant threat. The associated morbidity and socioeconomic toll are clinically and financially challenging, necessitating novel approaches in the management of chronic wounds. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are an innovative type of porous coordination polymers, with low toxicity and high eco&#8208;friendliness. Documented anti&#8208;bacterial effects and pro&#8208;angiogenic activity predestine these nanomaterials as promising systems for the treatment of chronic wounds. In this context, the therapeutic applicability and efficacy of MOFs remain to be elucidated. It is, therefore, reviewed the structural&#8211;functional properties of MOFs and their composite materials and discusses how their multifunctionality and customizability can be leveraged as a clinical therapy for chronic wounds.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Ion Engineering Strategies toward High Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically summarizes and names various types of multi&#8208;ion engineering strategies. The recent advances of aqueous multi&#8208;ion zinc&#8208;based batteries are presented, and the reaction mechanisms, application effects, merits, and disadvantages of different multi&#8208;ion strategies are comprehensively evaluated to provide guidance for the development of ideal aqueous multi&#8208;ion zinc&#8208;based batteries.








Abstract
As alternatives to batteries with organic electrolytes, aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries (AZBs) have been intensively studied. However, the sluggish kinetics, side reactions, structural collapse, and dissolution of the cathode severely compromise the commercialization of AZBs. Among various strategies to accelerate their practical applications, multi&#8208;ion engineering shows great feasibility to maintain the original structure of the cathode and provide sufficient energy density for high&#8208;performance AZBs. Though multi&#8208;ion engineering strategies could solve most of the problems encountered by AZBs and show great potential in achieving practical AZBs, the comprehensive summaries of the batteries undergo electrochemical reactions involving more than one charge carrier is still in deficiency. The ambiguous nomenclature and classification are becoming the fountainhead of confusion and chaos. In this circumstance, this review overviews all the battery configurations and the corresponding reaction mechanisms are investigated in the multi&#8208;ion engineering of aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries. By combing through all the reported works, this is the first to nomenclate the different configurations according to the reaction mechanisms of the additional ions, laying the foundation for future unified discussions. The performance enhancement, fundamental challenges, and future developing direction of multi&#8208;ion strategies are accordingly proposed, aiming to further accelerate the pace to achieve the commercialization of AZBs with high performance.

Abstract
Atomically thin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) oxide crystals have garnered considerable attention because of their remarkable physical properties and potential for versatile applications. In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the design, preparation, and application of ultrathin 2D oxides, providing many opportunities for new&#8208;generation advanced technologies. This review focuses on the controllable preparation of 2D oxide crystals and their applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices. Based on their bonding nature, the various types of 2D oxide crystals are first summarized, including both layered and nonlayered crystals, as well as their current top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up synthetic approaches. Subsequently, in terms of the unique physical and electrical properties of 2D oxides, recent advances in device applications are emphasized, including photodetectors, field&#8208;effect transistors, dielectric layers, magnetic and ferroelectric devices, memories, and gas sensors. Finally, conclusions and future prospects of 2D oxide crystals are presented. It is hoped that this review will provide comprehensive and insightful guidance for the development of 2D oxide crystals and their device applications.

         <title>Nanoscale Metal Particle Modified Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst: Synthesis, Characterization, and Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the latest development of nanoscale metal particle modified single&#8208;atom catalysts (NMP&#8208;SACs) from the aspects of synthesis, characterization techniques, and catalytic applications. The mechanism behind their superior performance in various catalytic applications is discussed. The review ends with relevant challenges and perspectives of NMP&#8208;SACs in the future.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted considerable attention in heterogeneous catalysis because of their well&#8208;defined active sites, maximum atomic utilization efficiency, and unique unsaturated coordinated structures. However, their effectiveness is limited to reactions requiring active sites containing multiple metal atoms. Furthermore, the loading amounts of single&#8208;atom sites must be restricted to prevent aggregation, which can adversely affect the catalytic performance despite the high activity of the individual atoms. The introduction of nanoscale metal particles (NMPs) into SACs (NMP&#8208;SACs) has proven to be an efficient approach for improving their catalytic performance. A comprehensive review is urgently needed to systematically introduce the synthesis, characterization, and application of NMP&#8208;SACs and the mechanisms behind their superior catalytic performance. This review first presents and classifies the different mechanisms through which NMPs enhance the performance of SACs. It then summarizes the currently reported synthetic strategies and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization techniques of NMP&#8208;SACs. Moreover, their application in electro/thermo/photocatalysis, and the reasons for their superior performance are discussed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of NMP&#8208;SACs for the future design of advanced catalysts are addressed.

         <dc:description>
The recent progress with regard to MXene&#8208;based current collectors for rechargeable batteries is systematically reviewed. The application of MXene in the current collector has achieved considerable achievements due to its unique structure, large surface area, and high conductivity. Up to now, various effective strategies have been presented and achieved positive effects, such as vacuum filtration, freeze&#8208;drying and in situ electrodeposition, etc.








Abstract
As an indispensable component of rechargeable batteries, the current collector plays a crucial role in supporting the electrode materials and collecting the accumulated electrical energy. However, some key issues, like uneven resources, high weight percentage, electrolytic&#160;corrosion, and high&#8208;voltage instability, cannot meet the growing need for rechargeable batteries. In recent years, MXene&#8208;based current collectors have achieved considerable achievements due to its unique structure, large surface area, and high conductivity. The related research has increased significantly. Nonetheless, a comprehensive review of this area is seldom. Herein the applications and progress of MXene in current collector are systematically summarized and discussed. Meanwhile, some challenges and future directions are presented.

         <title>Silk Fibroin&#8208;Regulated Nanochannels for Flexible Hydrovoltaic Ion Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for controllable nanochannel regulation for flexible hydrovoltaic ion sensing is developed to simultaneously achieve a high surface potential, matching nanochannel size and high structural stability, resulting in a high&#8208;performance hydrovoltaic device with a Voc of 4.82 V in DI water, sensitivity as high as 1.37 V dec&#8722;1, and a sensing range of 10&#8722;7 to 100 M.








Abstract
The evaporation&#8208;induced hydrovoltaic effect based on ion&#8208;selective nanochannels can theoretically be employed for high&#8208;performance ion sensing; yet, the indeterminate ion&#8208;sensing properties and the acquisition of high sensing performance are rarely explored. Herein, a controllable nanochannel regulation strategy for flexible hydrovoltaic devices with highly sensitive ion&#8208;sensing abilities is presented across a wide concentration range. By multiple dip&#8208;coating of silk fibroin (SF) on an electrospinning nylon&#8208;66 nanofiber (NNF) film, the surface polarity enhancement, the fibers size regulation with a precision of &#8776;25&#160;nm, and the nanostructure firm binding are achieved simultaneously. The resultant flexible freestanding hydrovoltaic device exhibits an open circuit voltage up to 4.82&#160;V in deionized water, a wide ion sensing range of 10&#8722;7 to 100&#160;m, and ultrahigh sensitivity as high as 1.37&#160;V dec&#8722;1, which is significantly higher than the sensitivity of the traditional solid&#8208;contact ion&#8208;selective electrodes (SC&#8208;ISEs). The fabricated flexible ion&#8208;sensitive hydrovoltaic device is successfully applied for wearable human sweat electrolyte sensing and for environmental trace&#8208;ion monitoring, thereby confirming the potential application of the hydrovoltaic effect for ion sensing.

         <title>Chaotropic Effect&#8208;Boosted Thermogalvanic Ionogel Thermocells for All&#8208;Weather Power Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermogalvanic ionogel composed of an ionic liquid, 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium dicyanamide, and an ion redox couple, [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/[Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;, is prepared to achieve high thermogalvanic effects for all&#8208;weather, temperature self&#8208;supplying thermocell, through the combination of the passive radiative cooling regulation. The fabricated thermocell displays a high normalized temperature&#8208;relevant power density (Pmax/&#916;T2) and a giant Seebeck coefficient.








Abstract
Ionic thermocells convert heat into electricity and are promising power sources for electronic devices. However, discontinuous and small electricity output limits practical use under varying environmental conditions. Here, a thermogalvanic ionogel with a high Seebeck coefficient (32.4&#160;mV K&#8722;1) is designed. Thermocells that combine thermogalvanic ionogel&#8208;based thermocells, which realize all&#8208;weather power generation via passive radiative cooling, are also developed. These thermocells generate electricity continuously under varying weather conditions and over a wide temperature range (&#8722;40 to 90 &#176;C), with a normalized power density of 25.84&#160;mW m&#8722;2 K&#8722;2. Advanced characterization shows that the chaotropic effect enhances the Seebeck coefficient, while the self&#8208;supplying temperature difference given the radiative cooling structure enables all&#8208;weather power generation. These results provide an effective strategy for developing practical thermocells suitable for diverse daily and seasonal variations.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and a giant Seebeck coefficient.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ionic thermocells convert heat into electricity and are promising power sources for electronic devices. However, discontinuous and small electricity output limits practical use under varying environmental conditions. Here, a thermogalvanic ionogel with a high Seebeck coefficient (32.4&#160;mV K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is designed. Thermocells that combine thermogalvanic ionogel-based thermocells, which realize all-weather power generation via passive radiative cooling, are also developed. These thermocells generate electricity continuously under varying weather conditions and over a wide temperature range (&#8722;40 to 90 &#176;C), with a normalized power density of 25.84&#160;mW m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Advanced characterization shows that the chaotropic effect enhances the Seebeck coefficient, while the self-supplying temperature difference given the radiative cooling structure enables all-weather power generation. These results provide an effective strategy for developing practical thermocells suitable for diverse daily and seasonal variations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Tiled Auxetic Metamaterial: A New Family of Mechanical Metamaterial with High Resilience and Mechanical Hysteresis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to create novel mechanical metamaterial via 3D space filling tiles with engaging key&#8208;channel pairs is demonstrated via new 3D printed auxetic 3D keyed&#8208;octahedron&#8211;cuboctahedron metamaterials. The new designs show auxeticity, high resilience, large mechanical hysteresis, ideal isotropy, and a unique coupled auxeticity and twisting behavior, as rarely seen in existing 3D mechanical metamaterials.








Abstract
For artificial materials, desired properties often conflict. For example, engineering materials often achieve high energy dissipation by sacrificing resilience and vice versa, or desired auxeticity by losing their isotropy, which limits their performance and applications. To solve these conflicts, a strategy is proposed to create novel mechanical metamaterial via 3D space filling tiles with engaging key&#8208;channel pairs, exemplified via auxetic 3D keyed&#8208;octahedron&#8211;cuboctahedron metamaterials. This metamaterial shows high resilience while achieving large mechanical hysteresis synergistically under large compressive strain. Especially, this metamaterial exhibits ideal isotropy approaching the theoretical limit of isotropic Poisson's ratio, &#8208;1, as rarely seen in existing 3D mechanical metamaterials. In addition, the new class of metamaterials provides wide tunability on mechanical properties and behaviors, including an unusual coupled auxeticity and twisting behavior under normal compression. The designing methodology is illustrated by the integral of numerical modeling, theoretical analysis, and experimental characterization. The new mechanical metamaterials have broad applications in actuators and dampers, soft robotics, biomedical materials, and engineering materials/systems for energy dissipation.

         <title>Recent Advances of Green Electricity Generation: Potential in Solar Interfacial Evaporation System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, insights into the remarkable advancements and potential of interfacial evaporation for water&#8211;electricity cogeneration (WEC) are provided. The existing literature is critically analyzed, highlighting its limitations in fully exploring the synergistic potential between interfacial evaporation and WEC. Additionally, the need for further research to optimize material selection, thermal management, and water management is emphasized.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) has played a pivotal role in optimizing water&#8208;energy utilization, reducing conventional power costs, and mitigating environmental impacts. The increasing emphasis on the synergistic cogeneration of water and green electricity through SDIE is particularly noteworthy. However, there is a gap of existing reviews that have focused on the mechanistic understanding of green power from water&#8208;electricity cogeneration (WEC) systems, the structure&#8208;activity relationship between efficiency of green energy utilization in WEC and material design in SDIE. Particularly, it lacks a comprehensive discussion to address the challenges faced in these areas along with potential solutions. Therefore, this review aims to comprehensively assess the progress and future perspective of green electricity from WEC systems by investigating the potential expansion of SDIE. First, it provides a comprehensive overview about material rational design, thermal management, and water transportation tunnels in SDIE. Then, it summarizes diverse energy sources utilized in the SDIE process, including steaming generation, photovoltaics, salinity gradient effect, temperature gradient effect, and piezoelectric effect. Subsequently, it explores factors that affect generated green electricity efficiency in WEC. Finally, this review proposes challenges and possible solution in the development of WEC.

         <title>A Tough Monolithic&#8208;Integrated Triboelectric Bioplastic Enabled&#160;by Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To solve the problem of mismatch at the dielectric&#8211;conductive layer interface in green electronics, this study utilizes dynamic covalent chemistry to synthesize a tough monolithic&#8208;integrated triboelectric bioplastic. The triboelectric bioplastic has tensile strength (87.4 MPa) and toughness (33.3 MJ m&#8722;3) and is noncracking after being subjected to a tensile force of 10&#160;000 times its own weight.








Abstract
Electronic waste is a growing threat to the global environment and human health, raising particular concerns. Triboelectric devices synthesized from sustainable and degradable materials are a promising electronic alternative, but the mechanical mismatch at the interface between the polymer substrate and the electrodes remains unresolved in practical applications. This study uses the sulfhydryl silanization reaction and the chemical selectivity and site specificity of the thiol&#8211;disulfide exchange reaction in dynamic covalent chemistry to prepare a tough monolithic&#8208;integrated triboelectric bioplastic. The stress is dissipated by covalent bond adaptation to the interface interaction, which makes the polymer dielectric layer to the conductive layer have a good interface adhesion effect (220.55&#160;kPa). The interfacial interlocking of the polymer substrate with the conductive layer gives the triboelectric bioplastic excellent tensile strength (87.4&#160;MPa) and fracture toughness (33.3&#160;MJ m&#8722;3). Even when subjected to a tension force of 10&#160;000 times its weight, it still maintains a stable triboelectric output with no visible cracks. This study provides new insights into the design of reliable and environmentally friendly self&#8208;powered devices, which is significant for the development of flexible wearable electronics.

         <title>Fast and Facile Liquid Metal Printing via Projection Lithography for Highly Stretchable Electronic Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A digital light processing&#8208;based liquid metal printing strategy using a photo&#8208;crosslinkable ink is described. This technique patterns&#160;stretchable eutectic gallium&#8208;indium with high resolution (&#8776;20 &#181;m), excellent conductivity (3 &#215; 106 S m&#8722;1), extreme stretchability (&#8776;2500%), and excellent stability under various deformations. Its potential is showcased in applications like stretchable circuits, wearable electronics, and soft robotics.








Abstract
Soft electronic circuits are crucial for wearable electronics, biomedical technologies, and soft robotics, requiring soft conductive materials with high conductivity, high strain limit, and stable electrical performance under deformation. Liquid metals (LMs) have become attractive candidates with high conductivity and fluidic compliance, while effective manufacturing methods are demanded. Digital light processing (DLP)&#8208;based projection lithography is a high&#8208;resolution and high&#8208;throughput printing technique for primarily polymers and some metals. If LMs can be printed with DLP as well, the entire soft devices can be fabricated by one printer in a streamlined and highly efficient process. Herein, fast and facile DLP&#8208;based LM printing is achieved. Simply with 5&#8211;10 s of patterned ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;light exposure, a highly conductive and stretchable pattern can be printed using a photo&#8208;crosslinkable LM particle ink. The printed eutectic gallium indium traces feature high resolution (&#8776;20 &#181;m), conductivity (3 &#215; 106 S m&#8722;1), stretchability (&#8776;2500%), and excellent stability (consistent performance at different deformation). Various patterns are printed in diverse material systems for broad applications including stretchable displays, epidermal strain sensors, heaters, humidity sensors, conformal electrodes for electrography, and multi&#8208;layer actuators. The facile and scalable process, excellent performance, and diverse applications ensure its broad impact on soft electronic manufacturing.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Architectured Silicones with Autonomic Self&#8208;Healing and Creep&#8208;Resistant Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Architectured silicones comprising vitrimer and conventional elastomers are developed to simultaneously achieve creep resistance and autonomic self&#8208;heal at room temperature. Self&#8208;healing capabilities arise from dynamic dioxaborolane groups in the silicone vitrimer, whereas creep resistance emerges from the permanently crosslinked conventional elastomer. The potential of architectured silicones is illustrated by 3D printing a patient&#8208;specific vascular phantom and fluidic chambers for prospective applications in robotics and medicine.








Abstract
Self&#8208;healing silicones that are able to restore functionalities and extend the lifetime of soft devices hold great potential in many applications. However, currently available silicones need to be triggered to self&#8208;heal or suffer from creep&#8208;induced irreversible deformation during use. Here, a platform is proposed to design and print silicone objects that are programmed at the molecular and architecture levels to achieve self&#8208;healing at room temperature while simultaneously resisting creep. At the molecular scale, dioxaborolanes moieties are incorporated into silicones to synthesize self&#8208;healing vitrimers, whereas conventional covalent bonds are exploited to make creep&#8208;resistant elastomers. When combined into architectured printed parts at a coarser length scale, the layered materials exhibit fast healing at room temperature without compromising the elastic recovery obtained from covalent polymer networks.

     alt="3D-Printed Architectured Silicones with Autonomic Self-Healing and Creep-Resistant Behavior"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architectured silicones comprising vitrimer and conventional elastomers are developed to simultaneously achieve creep resistance and autonomic self-heal at room temperature. Self-healing capabilities arise from dynamic dioxaborolane groups in the silicone vitrimer, whereas creep resistance emerges from the permanently crosslinked conventional elastomer. The potential of architectured silicones is illustrated by 3D printing a patient-specific vascular phantom and fluidic chambers for prospective applications in robotics and medicine.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-healing silicones that are able to restore functionalities and extend the lifetime of soft devices hold great potential in many applications. However, currently available silicones need to be triggered to self-heal or suffer from creep-induced irreversible deformation during use. Here, a platform is proposed to design and print silicone objects that are programmed at the molecular and architecture levels to achieve self-healing at room temperature while simultaneously resisting creep. At the molecular scale, dioxaborolanes moieties are incorporated into silicones to synthesize self-healing vitrimers, whereas conventional covalent bonds are exploited to make creep-resistant elastomers. When combined into architectured printed parts at a coarser length scale, the layered materials exhibit fast healing at room temperature without compromising the elastic recovery obtained from covalent polymer networks. A patient-specific vascular phantom and fluidic chambers are printed to demonstrate the potential of architectured silicones in creating damage-resilient functional devices using molecularly designed elastomer materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transient Mild Photothermia Improves Therapeutic Performance of Oral Nanomedicines with Enhanced Accumulation in the Colitis Mucosa</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oral medications for treating ulcerative colitis (UC) encounter challenges of insufficient drug accumulation in the colitis mucosa and unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. A high&#8208;performance gold shell&#8208;polymeric core nanotherapeutic is constructed to achieve mucus penetration, improve wound healing, relieve oxidative stress, and reduce inflammatory responses under transient mild photothermia. Oral hydrogel&#8208;encapsulating nanotherapeutics plus transient mild photothermia efficiently alleviates acute and chronic UC.








Abstract
The treatment outcomes of oral medications against ulcerative colitis (UC) have long been restricted by low drug accumulation in the colitis mucosa and subsequent unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Here, high&#8208;performance pluronic F127 (P127)&#8208;modified gold shell (AuS)&#8208;polymeric core nanotherapeutics loading with curcumin (CUR) is constructed. Under near&#8208;infrared irradiation, the resultant P127&#8208;AuS@CURs generate transient mild photothermia (TMP; &#8776;42&#160;&#176;C, 10 min), which facilitates their penetration through colonic mucus and favors multiple cellular processes, including cell internalization, lysosomal escape, and controlled CUR release. This strategy relieves intracellular oxidative stress, improves wound healing, and reduces immune responses by polarizing the proinflammatory M1&#8208;type macrophages to the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2&#8208;type. Upon oral administration of hydrogel&#8208;encapsulating P127&#8208;AuS@CURs plus intestinal intralumen TMP, their therapeutic effects against acute and chronic UC are demonstrated to be superior to those of a widely used clinical drug, dexamethasone. The treatment of P127&#8208;AuS@CURs (+ TMP) elevates the proportions of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus and Lachnospiraceae), whose metabolites can also mitigate colitis symptoms by regulating genes associated with antioxidation, anti&#8208;inflammation, and wound healing. Overall, the intestinal intralumen TMP offers a promising approach to enhance the therapeutic outcomes of noninvasive medicines against UC.

         <title>3D Hydrogel Encapsulation Regulates Nephrogenesis in Kidney Organoids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stem cell&#8208;derived kidney organoid differentiation is largely conducted using biochemical signals to control cell differentiation. Here, the hypothesis that mechanical signaling regulates nephrogenesis in kidney organoids is investigated. 3D encapsulation of differentiating kidney organoids in viscoelastic alginate hydrogels alters nephron patterning and morphology. These findings suggest that mechanical signaling is an important consideration for kidney regenerative medicine.








Abstract
Stem cell&#8208;derived kidney organoids contain nephron segments that recapitulate morphological and functional aspects of the human kidney. However, directed differentiation protocols for kidney organoids are largely conducted using biochemical signals to control differentiation. Here, the hypothesis that mechanical signals regulate nephrogenesis is investigated in 3D culture by encapsulating kidney organoids within viscoelastic alginate hydrogels with varying rates of stress relaxation. Tubular nephron segments are significantly more convoluted in kidney organoids differentiated in encapsulating hydrogels when compared with those in suspension culture. Hydrogel viscoelasticity regulates the spatial distribution of nephron segments within the differentiating kidney organoids. Consistent with these observations, a particle&#8208;based computational model predicts that the extent of deformation of the hydrogel&#8211;organoid interface regulates the morphology of nephron segments. Elevated extracellular calcium levels in the culture medium, which can be impacted by the hydrogels, decrease the glomerulus&#8208;to&#8208;tubule ratio of nephron segments. These findings reveal that hydrogel encapsulation regulates nephron patterning and morphology and suggest that the mechanical microenvironment is an important design variable for kidney regenerative medicine.

         <title>Protonation Stimulates the Layered to Rock Salt Phase Transition of Ni&#8208;Rich Sodium Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The de&#8208;protonation of electrolyte solvents and subsequent protonation of layered NaNiO2 triggers multiple degradation mechanisms. Intercalated protons are primarily responsible for the accelerated layered to rock salt phase formation process, which ends up in porous bulk structures as well as anisotropic surface degradations. 








Abstract
Protonation of oxide cathodes triggers surface transition metal dissolution and accelerates the performance degradation of Li&#8208;ion batteries. While strategies are developed to improve cathode material surface stability, little is known about the effects of protonation on bulk phase transitions in these cathode materials or their sodium&#8208;ion battery counterparts. Here, using NaNiO2 in electrolytes with different proton&#8208;generating levels as model systems, a holistic picture of the effect of incorporated protons is presented. Protonation of lattice oxygens stimulate transition metal migration to the alkaline layer and accelerates layered&#8208;rock&#8208;salt phase transition, which leads to bulk structure disintegration and anisotropic surface reconstruction layers formation. A cathode that undergoes severe protonation reactions attains a porous architecture corresponding to its multifold performance fade. This work reveals that interactions between electrolyte and cathode that result in protonation can dominate the structural reversibility/stability of bulk cathodes, and the insight sheds light for the development of future batteries.

         <title>Perforin&#8208;Mimicking Molecular Drillings Enable Macroporous Hollow Lignin Spheres for Performance&#8208;Configurable Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite the first observations that the perforin can punch holes in target cells for live/dead cycles in the human immune system over 110 years ago, emulating this behaviour in materials science remains challenging. In this study, a perforin&#8208;mimicking molecular drilling strategy is employed to engineer macroporous hollow lignin spheres as performance&#8208;configurable catalysts, adhesives, and gels. Using a toolbox of over 20 molecular compounds, the local curvature of amphiphilic lignin is modulated to generate macroporous spheres with hole sizes ranging from 0&#8211;100&#160;nm. Multiscale control is precisely achieved through non&#8208;covalent assembly directing catalysis, synthesis, and polymerization. Exceptional performance mutations correlated with the changes in hole size, including an increase in catalytic efficiency from 50% to 100%, transition from non&#8208;stick synthetics to ultrastrong adhesives (adhesion &#8764;18.3&#160;MPa, exceeding that of classic epoxies), and transformation of viscous sols to tough nanogels. Thus, this study provides a robust and versatile non&#8208;covalent route for mimicking perforin&#8208;induced structural variations in cells, representing a significant stride towards the exquisite orchestration of assemblies over multiple length scales.

         <title>A DNA/Upconversion Nanoparticle Complex Enables Controlled Co&#8208;Delivery of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 and Photodynamic Agents for Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a noninvasive therapeutic strategy that depends on the light&#8208;irradiated exciting of photosensitizer (PS) to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which faces challenges and limitations in hypoxia and antioxidant response of cancer cells, and limited tissue&#8208;penetration of light. Herein, we develop a multi&#8208;functional DNA/upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) complex that enables controlled co&#8208;delivery of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9, hemin, and protoporphyrin (PP) for synergistic PDT activated by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. An ultra&#8208;long ssDNA is prepared via rolling circle amplification (RCA), which contains recognition sequences of sgRNA for loading Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP), G&#8208;quadruplex sequences for loading hemin and PP, and linker sequences for combining UCNP. Cas9 RNP precisely cleaves the antioxidant regulator nuclear factor E2&#8208;related factor 2 (Nrf2) gene, improving the sensitivity of cancer cells to ROS, and enhancing the synergistic PDT effect. The G&#8208;quadruplex/hemin DNAzyme mimicks horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to catalyze the endogenous H2O2 to O2, overcoming the hypoxia condition in tumors. The introduced UCNP converts NIR irradiation with deep tissue penetration to light with shorter wavelength, exciting PP to transform the abundant O2 to 1O2. The integration of gene editing and PDT allows substantial accumulation of 1O2 in cancer cells for enhanced cell apoptosis, and this synergistic PDT has shown remarkable therapeutic efficacy in a breast cancer mouse model.

The G-quadruplex/hemin DNAzyme mimicks horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to catalyze the endogenous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, overcoming the hypoxia condition in tumors. The introduced UCNP converts NIR irradiation with deep tissue penetration to light with shorter wavelength, exciting PP to transform the abundant O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The integration of gene editing and PDT allows substantial accumulation of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in cancer cells for enhanced cell apoptosis, and this synergistic PDT has shown remarkable therapeutic efficacy in a breast cancer mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Unveiling Cutting&#8208;Edge Developments in Electrocatalytic Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The excessive enrichment of nitrate in the environment can be converted into ammonia (NH3) through electrochemical processes, offering significant implications for modern agriculture and the potential to reduce the burden of the Haber&#8208;Bosch (HB) process while achieving environmentally&#8208;friendly NH3 production. Emerging research on electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (eNitRR) to NH3 has gained considerable momentum in recent years for efficient NH3 synthesis. However, existing reviews on nitrate reduction have primarily focused on limited aspects, often lacking a comprehensive summary of catalysts, reaction systems, reaction mechanisms, and detection methods employed in nitrate reduction. This review aims to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the eNitRR field by integrating existing research progress and identifying current challenges. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the research progress achieved using various materials in electrochemical nitrate reduction, elucidates the underlying theoretical mechanism behind eNitRR, and discusses effective strategies based on numerous case studies to enhance the electrochemical reduction from NO3&#727; to NH3. Finally, this review discusses challenges and development prospects in the eNitRR field with an aim to guide design and development of large&#8208;scale sustainable nitrate reduction electrocatalysts.

         <title>Co&#8208;self&#8208;assembled Monolayers Modified NiOx for Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
[4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;4PACz) self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAM) are an effective method to solve the problem of the buried interface of NiOx in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the Me&#8208;4PACz end group (carbazole core) cannot forcefully passivate defects at the bottom of the perovskite film. Here, we employ a Co&#8208;SAM strategy to modify the buried interface of PSCs. Me&#8208;4PACz is doped with phosphorylcholine chloride (PC) to form a Co&#8208;SAM to improve the monolayer coverage and reduce leakage current. The phosphate group and chloride ions (Cl&#8722;) in PC can inhibit NiOx surface defects. Meantime, the quaternary ammonium ions and Cl&#8722; in PC can fill organic cations and halogen vacancies in the perovskite film to enable defects passivation. Moreover, Co&#8208;SAM can promote the growth of perovskite crystals, collaboratively solve the problem of buried defects, suppress non&#8208;radiative recombination, accelerate carrier transmission, and relieve the residual stress of the perovskite film. Consequently, the Co&#8208;SAM modified devices show power conversion efficiencies as high as 25.09% as well as excellent device stability with 93% initial efficiency after 1000&#8208;hours of operation under one&#8208;sun illumination. This work demonstrates the novel approach for enhancing the performance and stability of PSCs by modifying Co&#8208;SAM on NiOx.

         <title>Charge Carrier Induced Structural Ordering And Disordering in Organic Mixed Ionic Electronic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Operational stability underpins the successful application of organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) in a wide range of fields, including biosensing, neuromorphic computing, and wearable electronics. In this work, we investigate both the operation and stability of a p&#8208;type OMIEC material of various molecular weights. Electrochemical transistor measurements reveal that device operation is very stable for at least 300 charging/discharging cycles independent of molecular weight, provided the charge density is kept below the threshold where strong charge&#8208;charge interactions become likely. When electrochemically charged to higher charge densities, we observe an increase in device hysteresis and a decrease in conductivity due to a drop in the hole mobility arising from long&#8208;range microstructural disruptions. By employing operando X&#8208;ray scattering techniques, we find two regimes of polaron&#8208;induced structural changes: 1) polaron&#8208;induced structural ordering at low carrier densities, and 2) irreversible structural disordering that disrupts charge transport at high carrier densities, where charge&#8208;charge interactions are significant. These operando measurements also reveal that the transfer curve hysteresis at high carrier densities is accompanied by an analogous structural hysteresis, providing a microstructural basis for such instabilities. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of the structural dynamics and material instabilities of OMIEC materials during device operation.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Organic Narrow Dual&#8208;band Circular Polarized Light Detection for Encrypted Communications And Color Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conventional circularly polarized light (CPL) detectors necessitate several optical elements, posing difficulties in achieving miniature and integrated devices. Recently developed organic CPL detectors require no additional optical elements but usually suffer from low detectivity or low asymmetry factor (g&#8208;factor). Here, an organic CPL detector with excellent detectivity and a high g&#8208;factor is fabricated. By employing an inverted quasi&#8208;planar heterojunction (IPHJ) structure and incorporating an additional liquid crystal film, we develop a CPL detector with an outstanding g&#8208;factor of 1.62. Unfavorable charge injection is effectively suppressed by the IPHJ structure, which reduces the dark current of the organic photodetector. Consequently, a left CPL detectivity of 6.16 &#215; 1014 Jones at 640&#160;nm is realized, surpassing all of the latest photodiode&#8208;type CPL detectors. Adopting a liquid crystal film with adjustable wavelengths of selectively reflected light, the hybrid device achieved narrow dual&#8208;band CPL detection, varying from 530&#160;nm to 640&#160;nm, with a half&#8208;maximum full width below 90&#160;nm. Notably, the device achieves excellent stability of 260000 on/off cycles without attenuation. To the best of our knowledge, all these features have rarely been reported in previous work. The CPL detector arrays are also demonstrated for encrypted communications and color imaging.

         <title>Capacitive&#8208;coupling&#8208;responsive Hydrogel Scaffolds Offering Wireless in Situ Electrical Stimulation Promotes Nerve Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrical stimulation (ES) has shown beneficial effects in repairing injured tissues. However, current ES techniques that use tissue&#8208;traversing leads and bulky external power suppliers have significant limitations in translational medicine. Hence, exploring non&#8208;invasive in vivo ES to provide controllable electrical cues in tissue engineering is an imminent necessity. Herein, we demonstrate a conductive hydrogel with in situ electrical generation capability as a biodegradable regeneration scaffold and wireless ES platform for spinal cord injury (SCI) repair. When a soft insulated metal plate is placed on top of the injury site as a wireless power transmitter, the conductive hydrogel implanted at the injury site can serve as a wireless power receiver, and the capacitive coupling between the receiver and transmitter can generate an alternating current in the hydrogel scaffold owing to electrostatic induction effect. In a complete transection model of SCI rats, the implanted conductive hydrogels with capacitive&#8208;coupling in situ ES enhanced functional recovery and neural tissue repair by promoting remyelination, accelerating axon regeneration, and facilitating endogenous neural stem cell differentiation. This facile wireless&#8208;powered electroactive&#8208;hydrogel strategy thus offers on&#8208;demand in vivo ES with an adjustable timeline, duration, and strength and holds great promise in translational medicine.

         <title>Self&#8208;Heating Multistage Microneedle Patch for Topical Therapy of Skin Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topical therapy is a favored route for treating skin cancers, but remain many challenges, such as low delivery efficiency, limited tumor tissue penetration, and unsatisfactory blood circulation. Here, we describe a self&#8208;heating microneedle (MN) patch with multi&#8208;level structures, including a dissolvable base for rapid drug release, a degradable tip for sustained drug release, and a self&#8208;heating substrate. The thermally enhanced drug release performance has been validated through both in vitro and in vivo experiments. High tumor therapeutic efficacy can be achieved due to the rapid release of 5&#8208;fluorouracil, while the sustained release of thymoquinone endows the MN patch with long&#8208;term tumor inhibition ability. We further demonstrated the feasibility of such an MN patch for in vivo topical therapy of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma with high efficacy, low side effects, and long&#8208;term inhibition of recurrence. This self&#8208;heating MN patch holds great promise for potential clinical applications, especially for the treatment of skin cancers.

         <title>Resistive Memory Devices at the Thinnest Limit: Progress and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The Si&#8208;based integrated circuits industry has been developing for more than half a century, by focusing on the scaling&#8208;down of transistor. However, the miniaturization of transistors will soon reach its physical limits, thereby requiring novel material and device technologies. Resistive memory is a promising candidate for in&#8208;memory computing and energy&#8208;efficient synaptic devices that can satisfy the computational demands of the future applications. However, poor cycle&#8208;to&#8208;cycle and device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformities hinder its mass production. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, as a new type of semiconductor, have been successfully employed in various micro/nano electronic devices and have the potential to drive future innovation in resistive memory technology. This review evaluates the potential of using the thinnest advanced materials, that is, monolayer 2D materials, for memristor or memtransistor applications, including resistive switching behavior and atomic mechanism, high&#8208;frequency device performances, and in&#8208;memory computing/neuromorphic computing applications. The scaling&#8208;down advantages of promising monolayer 2D materials including graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride are presented. Finally, the technical challenges of these atomic devices for practical applications are elaborately discussed. The study of monolayer&#8208;2D&#8208;material&#8208;based resistive memory is expected to play a positive role in the exploration of beyond&#8208;Si electronic technologies.

&lt;p&gt;The Si-based integrated circuits industry has been developing for more than half a century, by focusing on the scaling-down of transistor. However, the miniaturization of transistors will soon reach its physical limits, thereby requiring novel material and device technologies. Resistive memory is a promising candidate for in-memory computing and energy-efficient synaptic devices that can satisfy the computational demands of the future applications. However, poor cycle-to-cycle and device-to-device uniformities hinder its mass production. Two-dimensional (2D) materials, as a new type of semiconductor, have been successfully employed in various micro/nano electronic devices and have the potential to drive future innovation in resistive memory technology.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Optical Detection and Elimination of Residual Microtumors with a Postoperative Implantable Hydrogel Sensor for Preventing Cancer Recurrence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A postoperative implantable hydrogel sensor integrating a molecular beacon (MB) nanoprobe and fibroblasts is designed for visual detection and elimination of residual microtumors by ultrasensitive in situ monitoring of trace biomarkers, whose amplification of the signal is achieved by fibroblast&#8208;mediated local enrichment of tumor cells and spatially selective release of exonuclease I (exo I)&#8208;triggered biomarker recycling.








Abstract
In vivo optical imaging of trace biomarkers in residual microtumors holds significant promise for cancer prognosis but poses a formidable challenge. Here, a novel hydrogel sensor is designed for ultrasensitive and specific imaging of the elusive biomarker. This hydrogel sensor seamlessly integrates a molecular beacon nanoprobe with fibroblasts, offering both high tissue retention capability and an impressive signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio for imaging. Signal amplification is accomplished through exonuclease I&#8208;mediated biomarker recycling. The resulting hydrogel sensor sensitively detects the biomarker carcinoembryonic antigen with a detection limit of 1.8&#160;pg&#160;mL&#8722;1 in test tubes. Moreover, it successfully identifies residual cancer nodules with a median diameter of less than 2&#160;mm in mice bearing partially removed primary triple&#8208;negative breast carcinomas (4T1). Notably, this hydrogel sensor is proven effective for the sensitive diagnosis of invasive tumors in post&#8208;surgical mice with infiltrating 4T1 cells, leveraging the role of fibroblasts in locally enriching tumor cells. Furthermore, the residual microtumor is rapidly photothermal ablation by polydopamine&#8208;based nanoprobe under the guidance of visualization, achieving &#8776;100% suppression of tumor recurrence and lung metastasis. This work offers a promising alternative strategy for visually detecting residual microtumors, potentially enhancing the prognosis of cancer patients following surgical interventions.

         <title>Electrolyte Engineering with Tamed Electrode Interphases for High&#8208;Voltage Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;stable operation of high&#8208;energy sodium&#8208;ion batteries with tamed electrode interphase is obtained via innovation in electrolyte chemistry. Benefiting from the suppressed cathode electrolyte interphase dissolution, advanced Na+ storage performance, including outstanding cycling stability as long as 8 months and wide&#8208;temperature adaptability from &#8722;25 to 60 &#176;C, is achieved in the high&#8208;voltage Na3V2O2(PO4)2F cathode.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) hold great promise for next&#8208;generation grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the highly instable electrolyte/electrode interphases threaten the long&#8208;term cycling of high&#8208;energy SIBs. In particular, the instable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) at high voltage causes persistent electrolyte decomposition, transition metal dissolution, and fast capacity fade. Here, this work proposes a balanced principle for the molecular design of SIB electrolytes that enables an ultra&#8208;thin, homogeneous, and robust CEI layer by coupling an intrinsically oxidation&#8208;stable succinonitrile solvent with moderately solvating carbonates. The proposed electrolyte not only shows limited anodic decomposition thus leading to a thin CEI,&#160;but also suppresses dissolution of CEI components at high voltage. Consequently, the tamed electrolyte/electrode interphases enable extremely stable cycling of Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) cathodes with outstanding capacity retention (&gt;90%) over 3000 cycles (8 months) at 1 C with a high charging voltage of 4.3&#8201;V. Further, the NVOPF||hard carbon full cell shows stable cycling over 500&#8201;cycles at 1 C with a high average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.6%. The electrolyte also endows high&#8208;voltage operation of SIBs with great temperature adaptability from &#8722;25 to 60&#160;&#176;C, shedding light on the essence of fundamental electrolyte design for SIBs operating under harsh conditions.

         <title>Advanced Terahertz Refractive Sensing And Fingerprint Recognition Through Metasurface&#8208;Excited Surface Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein a novel sensing strategy is proposed to achieve Terahertz refractive sensing and fingerprint recognition within a continuous spectrum based on the coupling of surface waves. By covering 5 &#181;m thickness of polyimide, quartz, and silicon nitride layers, the phase change of 91.1&#176;, 101.8&#176;, and 126.4&#176; is experimentally obtained, respectively.








Abstract
High&#8208;sensitive metasurface&#8208;based sensors are essential for effective substance detection and insightful bio&#8208;interaction studies, which compress light in subwavelength volumes to enhance light&#8211;matter interactions. However, current methods to improve sensing performance always focus on optimizing near&#8208;field response of individual meta&#8208;atom, and fingerprint recognition for bio&#8208;substances necessitates several pixelated metasurfaces to establish a quasi&#8208;continuous spectrum. Here, a novel sensing strategy is proposed to achieve Terahertz (THz) refractive sensing, and fingerprint recognition based on surface waves (SWs). Leveraging the long&#8208;range transmission, strong confinement, and interface sensitivity of SWs, a metasurface&#8208;supporting SWs excitation and propagation is experimentally verified to achieve sensing integrations. Through wide&#8208;band information collection of SWs, the proposed sensor not only facilitates refractive sensing up to 215.5&#176;/RIU, but also enables the simultaneous resolution of multiple fingerprint information within a continuous spectrum. By covering 5&#160;&#181;m thickness of polyimide, quartz and silicon nitride layers, the maximum phase change of 91.1&#176;, 101.8&#176;, and 126.4&#176; is experimentally obtained within THz band, respectively. Thus, this strategy broadens the research scope of metasurface&#8208;excited SWs and introduces a novel paradigm for ultrasensitive sensing functions.

         <title>Surface Engineered Single&#8208;atom Systems for Energy Conversion</title>

Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been demonstrated to show exceptional reactivity and selectivity in catalytic reactions by effectively utilizing metal species, making them a favorable choice among the different active materials for energy conversion. However, SACs are still in the early stage of energy conversion, and problems like agglomeration and low energy conversion efficiency are hampering their practical applications. Substantial researches focus on support modifications, which are vital for SAC reactivity and stability due to the intimate relationship between metal atoms and support. In this review, a category of supports and a variety of surface engineering strategies employed in SA systems are summarized, including surface site engineering (heteroatom doping, vacancy introducing, surface groups grafting, and coordination tunning) and surface structure engineering (size/morphology control, cocatalyst deposition, facet engineering, and crystallinity control). Also, the merits of support surface engineering in single&#8208;atom systems are systematically introduced. Highlights are the comprehensive summary and discussions on the utilization of surface engineered SACs in diversified energy conversion applications including photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, thermocatalysis, and energy conversion devices. At the end of this review, we have discussed the potential and obstacles of using surface engineered SACs in the field of energy conversion. This review aims to guide the rational design and manipulation of SACs for target&#8208;specific applications by capitalizing on the characteristic benefits of support surface engineering.

         <title>Ultrathin Magnesium&#8208;Based Coating as An Efficient Oxygen Barrier for Superconducting Circuit Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Scaling up superconducting quantum circuits based on transmon qubits necessitates substantial enhancements in qubit coherence time. Over recent years, tantalum (Ta) has emerged as a promising candidate for transmon qubits, surpassing conventional counterparts in terms of coherence time. However, amorphous surface Ta oxide layer may introduce dielectric loss, ultimately placing a limit on the coherence time. In this study, we present a novel approach for suppressing the formation of tantalum oxide using an ultrathin magnesium (Mg) capping layer. Synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies demonstrate that oxide is confined to an extremely thin region directly beneath the Mg/Ta interface. Additionally, we demonstrate that the superconducting properties of thin Ta films are improved following the Mg capping, exhibiting sharper and higher&#8208;temperature transitions to superconductive and magnetically ordered states. Moreover, we establish an atomic&#8208;scale mechanistic understanding of the role of the capping layer in protecting Ta from oxidation based on computational modeling. This work provides valuable insights into the formation mechanism and functionality of surface tantalum oxide, as well as a new materials design principle with the potential to reduce dielectric loss in superconducting quantum materials. Ultimately, our findings pave the way for the realization of large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;performance quantum computing systems.

         <title>Exploiting the Mechanical Bond Effect for Enhanced Molecular Recognition and Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building upon the established chelate and macrocyclic effects, supramolecular chemists have exploited the mechanical bond to create selective supramolecular hosts with enhanced binding affinities and selectivity over non&#8208;interlocked acyclic and macrocyclic host analogs. This review delineates advantages of mechanically interlocked hosts for charged species, and discusses current and potential applications of the mechanical bond effect for recognition and sensing applications.








Abstract
The ubiquity of charged species in biological and industrial processes has resulted in ever&#8208;increasing interest in their selective recognition, detection, and environmental remediation. Building on the established coordination chemistry principles of the chelate and macrocyclic effects, and host preorganization, supramolecular chemists seek to construct specific 3D binding cavities reminiscent of biotic systems to enhance host&#8208;guest binding affinity and selectivity. Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) present a wholly unique platform for synthetic host design, wherein topologies afforded by the mechanical bond enable the decoration of 3D cavities for non&#8208;covalent interactions with a range of target guest geometries. Notably, MIM host systems exhibit mechanical bond effect augmented affinities and selectivities for a variety of charged guest species, compared to non&#8208;interlocked acyclic and macrocycle host analogs. Furthermore, the modular nature of MIM synthesis facilitates incorporation of optical and electrochemical reporter groups, enabling fabrication of highly sensitive and specific molecular sensors. This review discusses the development of recognition and sensing MIMs, from the first reports in the late 20th century through to the present day, delineating how their topologically preorganized and dynamic host cavities enhance charged guest recognition and sensing, demonstrating the mechanical bond effect as a potent tool in future chemosensing materials.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Layer Controlled Transition from Inverse Rashba&#8211;Edelstein Effect to Inverse Spin Hall Effect in 2D PtSe2 Probed by THz Spintronic Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion (SCC) is studied in 2D PtSe2 using THz emission. PtSe2 layers are grown epitaxially on graphene, followed by in situ ferromagnet deposition resulting in well&#8208;defined atomic interfaces.The unique thickness&#8208;dependent electronic structure of PtSe2 allows the control of SCC: from the inverse RashbaEdelstein effect in the semiconducting layers to the inverse spin Hall effect in the semi&#8208;metallic state.








Abstract
2D materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, are ideal platforms for spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion (SCC) as they possess strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC), reduced dimensionality and crystal symmetries as well as tuneable band structure, compared to metallic structures. Moreover, SCC can be tuned with the number of layers, electric field, or strain. Here, SCC in epitaxially grown 2D PtSe2 by THz spintronic emission is studied since its 1T crystal symmetry and strong SOC favor SCC. High quality of as&#8208;grown PtSe2 layers is demonstrated, followed by in situ ferromagnet deposition by sputtering that leaves the PtSe2 unaffected, resulting in well&#8208;defined clean interfaces as evidenced with extensive characterization. Through this atomic growth control and using THz spintronic emission, the unique thickness&#8208;dependent electronic structure of PtSe2 allows the control of SCC. Indeed, the transition from the inverse Rashba&#8211;Edelstein effect (IREE) in 1&#8211;3 monolayers (ML) to the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) in multilayers (&gt;3 ML) of PtSe2 enabling the extraction of the perpendicular spin diffusion length and relative strength of IREE and ISHE is demonstrated. This band structure flexibility makes PtSe2 an ideal candidate to explore the underlying mechanisms and engineering of the SCC as well as for the development of tuneable THz spintronic&#160;emitters.

         <title>Flexible, Biodegradable, and Wireless Magnetoelectric Paper for Simple In Situ Personalization of Bioelectric Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible, biodegradable bioelectronic paper featuring homogeneously distributed wireless stimulation functionality is presented. This paper synergistically combines lead&#8208;free magnetoelectric nanoparticles for external magnetic field&#8208;induced electrical stimulation and flexible, biodegradable nanofibers for high&#8208;selectivity stimulation, oxygen/nutrient permeation, cell orientation modulation, and biodegradation rate control. Scalability, design flexibility, and rapid customizability are demonstrated through simple paper crafting techniques such as origami and kirigami.








Abstract
Bioelectronic implants delivering electrical stimulation offer an attractive alternative to traditional pharmaceuticals in electrotherapy. However, achieving simple, rapid, and cost&#8208;effective personalization of these implants for customized treatment in unique clinical and physical scenarios presents a substantial challenge. This challenge is further compounded by the need to ensure safety and minimal invasiveness, requiring essential attributes such as flexibility, biocompatibility, lightness, biodegradability, and wireless stimulation capability. Here, a flexible, biodegradable bioelectronic paper with homogeneously distributed wireless stimulation functionality for simple personalization of bioelectronic implants is introduced. The bioelectronic paper synergistically combines i) lead&#8208;free magnetoelectric nanoparticles (MENs) that facilitate electrical stimulation in response to external magnetic field and ii) flexible and biodegradable nanofibers (NFs) that enable localization of MENs for high&#8208;selectivity stimulation, oxygen/nutrient permeation, cell orientation modulation, and biodegradation rate control. The effectiveness of wireless electrical stimulation in vitro through enhanced neuronal differentiation of neuron&#8208;like PC12 cells and the controllability of their microstructural orientation are shown. Also, scalability, design flexibility, and rapid customizability of the bioelectronic paper are shown by creating various 3D macrostructures using simple paper crafting techniques such as cutting and folding. This platform holds promise for simple and rapid personalization of temporary bioelectronic implants for minimally invasive wireless stimulation therapies.

Abstract
Neuromorphic circuits that can function under extreme deformations are important for various data&#8208;driven wearable and robotic applications. Herein, biphasic liquid metal particle (BMP) with unprecedented stretchability and strain&#8208;insensitivity (&#916;R/R0 = 1.4@ 1200% strain) were developed to realize a stretchable neuromorphic circuit that mimics a spike&#8208;based biologic sensory system. The BMP consists of liquid metal particles (LMPs) and rigid liquid metal particles (RLMPs), which are homogeneously mixed via spontaneous solutal&#8208;Marangoni mixing flow during coating. This permits facile single step patterning directly on various substrates at room temperature. BMP is highly conductive (2.3 &#215; 106 S/m) without any post activation steps. BMP interconnects were utilized for a sensory system, which is capable of distinguishing variations of biaxial strains with a spiking neural network, thus demonstrating their potential for various sensing and signal processing applications.

         <title>Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Pouch Cell Using Cu3P Nanowires In Situ Grown on Current Collector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu3P nanowires in situ grown on the current collector are capable of realizing uniform deposition of sodium metal during repeated cycling, which is attributed to low Na+ absorption energy and diffusion energy barrier on Na3P. Superior electrochemical performance of Cu3P@Cu anode successfully enables anode&#8208;free sodium metal pouch cell with stable cycling lifespan.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sodium metal battery (AFSMB) promises high energy density but suffers from the difficulty of maintaining high cycling stability. Nonuniform sodium (Na) deposition on the current collector is largely responsible for capacity decay in the cycling process of AFSMB. Here, a unique copper phosphide (Cu3P) nanowire is constructed on copper (Cu3P@Cu) as a sodium deposition substrate by an in situ growth method. Superior electrochemical performance of Cu3P@Cu anode is delivered in asymmetric cells with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% for over 800 cycles at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with 1 mA h cm&#8722;2. The symmetric cell of Cu3P@Cu displayed a cycling lifespan of over 2000&#160;h at 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with 1 mA h cm&#8722;2. Cryo&#8208;transmission electron microscope&#160;characterization and first principles calculation revealed that the low Na+ absorption energy and low Na+ diffusion energy barrier on Na3P promoted uniform Na nucleation and deposition, thus enhancing the Na surface stability. Moreover, anode&#8208;free Na3V2(PO4)3//Cu3P@Cu full pouch cell delivered a considerable cycling capacity of &#8776;15&#160;mA h in 170 cycles, demonstrating its practical feasibility.

         <title>The Case for a Defect Genome Initiative</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Point defects in crystalline solids are likened to new &#8220;elements&#8221; beyond the periodic table. In the spirit of the Material Genome Initiative, a Defect Genome Initiative (DGI) is proposed to fast&#8208;track defect discoveries for energy, quantum, and other applications. This initiative focuses on open defect platforms, data&#8208;driven defect design, and experimental methods, hoping to spur a new community&#8208;wide interest.








Abstract
The Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) has streamlined the materials discovery effort by leveraging generic traits of materials, with focus largely on perfect solids. Defects such as impurities and perturbations, however, drive many attractive functional properties of materials. The rich tapestry of charge, spin, and bonding states hosted by defects are not accessible to elements and perfect crystals, and defects can thus be viewed as another class of &#8220;elements&#8221; that lie beyond the periodic table. Accordingly, a Defect Genome Initiative (DGI) to accelerate functional defect discovery for energy, quantum information, and other applications is proposed. First, major advances made under the MGI are highlighted, followed by a delineation of pathways for accelerating the discovery and design of functional defects under the DGI. Near&#8208;term goals for the DGI are suggested. The construction of open defect platforms and design of data&#8208;driven functional defects, along with approaches for fabrication and characterization of defects, are discussed. The associated challenges and opportunities are considered and recent advances towards controlled introduction of functional defects at the atomic scale are reviewed. It is hoped this perspective will spur a community&#8208;wide interest in undertaking a DGI effort in recognition of the importance of defects in enabling unique functionalities in materials.

         <title>Nanoengineered Red Blood Cells Loaded with TMPRSS2 and Cathepsin L Inhibitors Block SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Pseudovirus Entry into Lung ACE2+ Cells</title>

Abstract
The enzymatic activities of Furin, Transmembrane serine proteinase 2 (TMPRSS2), Cathepsin L (CTSL), and Angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding are necessary for the entry of coronaviruses into host cells. Precise inhibition of these key proteases in ACE2+ lung cells during a viral infection cycle should prevent viral S protein activation and its fusion with a host cell membrane, consequently averting virus entry to the cells. In this study, we construct dual&#8208;drug&#8208;combined (TMPRSS2 inhibitor Camostat and CTSL inhibitor E&#8208;64d) nanocarriers (NCs) conjugated with an anti&#8208;hACE2 antibody and employ RBC&#8208;hitchhiking, termed &#8220;Nanoengineered RBCs,&#8221; for targeting lung cells. We report the significant therapeutic efficacy of the dual&#8208;drug&#8208;loaded nanoengineered RBCs in pseudovirus&#8208;infected K18&#8208;hACE2 transgenic mice. Notably, our modular nanoengineered RBCs (anti&#8208;receptor antibody+NCs+RBCs) precisely target key proteases of host cells in the lungs to block the entry of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, regardless of virus variations. Our findings are anticipated to benefit the development of a series of novel and safe host&#8208;cell&#8208;protecting antiviral therapies.

         <title>Formulating Local Environment of Oxygen Mitigates Voltage Hysteresis in Li&#8208;rich Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Li&#8208;rich cathode materials have emerged as one of the most prospective options for Li&#8208;ion batteries owing to their remarkable energy density (&gt; 900&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1). However, voltage hysteresis during charge and discharge process lowers the energy conversion efficiency, which hinders their application in practical devices. Herein, we unveil the fundamental reason for voltage hysteresis through investigating the O redox behavior under different (de)lithiation states and successfully address it by formulating the local environment of O2&#8722;. In Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based materials, we have confirmed that there exists reaction activity of oxygen ions at low discharge voltage (&lt; 3.6&#160;V) in the presence of TM&#8208;TM&#8208;Li ordered arrangement, generating massive amount of voltage hysteresis and resulting in a decreased energy efficiency (80.95%). Moreover, in the case where Li 2b sites are numerously occupied by TM ions, the local environment of O2&#8722; evolves, the reactivity of oxygen ions at low voltage is significantly inhibited, thus giving rise to the large energy conversion efficiency (89.07%). This study unveils the structure&#8208;activity relationship between the local environment around O2&#8722; and voltage hysteresis, which provides guidance in designing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance cathode materials.

         <title>Reduced Lattice Constant in Al&#8208;Doped LiMn2O4 Nanoparticles for Boosted Electrochemical Lithium Extraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Extracting lithium selectively and efficiently from brine sources is crucial for addressing energy and environmental challenges. The electrochemical system employing LiMn2O4 (LMO) electrodes has been recognized as an effective method for lithium recovery. However, the lithium selectivity and stability of LMO need further enhancement for its practical applications. Herein, the Al&#8208;doped LMO with reduced lattice constant is successfully fabricated through a facile one&#8208;step solid&#8208;state sintering method, leading to enhanced lithium selectivity. The reduced lattice constant in Al&#8208;doped LMO is proved through spectroscopic analyses and theoretic calculations. Compared to the original LMO, the Al&#8208;doped LMO (LiAl0.05Mn1.95O4, LMO&#8208;Al0.05) exhibit higher specific capacitance, lower resistance, and improved stability. Moreover, the LMO&#8208;Al0.05 with reduced lattice constant can offer higher Li+ diffusion coefficient and lower intercalation energy revealed by cyclic voltammetry and multiscale simulations. When employed in hybrid capacitive deionization (CDI), the LMO&#8208;Al0.05 obtained a Li+ intercalation capacity of 21.7&#160;mg g&#8722;1 and low energy consumption of 2.6&#160;Wh mol&#8722;1 Li+. Importantly, the LMO&#8208;Al0.05 achieves a high Li+ extraction percentage (approximately 86%) with Li+/Na+ and Li+/Mg2+ selectivity of 1653.8 and 434.9, respectively, in synthetic brine. Our results demonstrate that the Al&#8208;doped LMO with reduced lattice constant could be a sustainable solution for electrochemical lithium extraction.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Materials for Advanced Sodium Storage: Development and Anticipation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As a pioneering battery technology, even though sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are safe, non&#8208;flammable, and capable of exhibiting better temperature endurance performance than lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), because of lower energy density and larger ionic size, they are not amicable for large&#8208;scale applications. Generally, the electrochemical storage performance of a secondary battery can be improved by monitoring the composition and morphology of electrode materials. Because more is the intricacy of a nanostructured composite electrode material, more electrochemical storage applications would be expected. Despite the conventional methods suitable for practical production, the synthesis of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) would offer enormous opportunities for next&#8208;generation battery applications by delicately systematizing the structure and composition at the molecular level to store sodium ions with larger sizes compared with lithium ions. Here in this review, we comprehensively discuss the progress of nanostructured MOFs and their derivatives applied as negative and positive electrode materials for effective sodium storage in SIBs. The commercialization goal has prompted the development of MOFs and their derivatives as electrode materials, before which the synthesis and mechanism for MOF&#8208;based SIB electrodes with improved sodium storage performance were systematically discussed. Finally, the existing challenges, possible perspectives, and future opportunities will be anticipated.

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;Structured Materials: Molecular Fundamentals and Electrocatalytic Roles in Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs), a kind of molecular metal oxide cluster with unique physical&#8208;chemical properties, have made essential contributions to creating efficient and robust electrocatalysts in renewable energy systems. Due to the fundamental advantages of POMs, such as the diversity of molecular structures and large numbers of redox active sites, numerous efforts have been devoted to extending their application areas. Up to now, various strategies of assembling POM molecules into superstructures, supporting POMs on heterogeneous substrates, and POMs&#8208;derived metal compounds have been developed for synthesizing electrocatalysts. From a multidisciplinary perspective, we systematically summarize the latest advances in creating POM&#8208;structured materials with a unique focus on their molecular fundamentals, electrocatalytic roles, and the recent breakthroughs of POMs and POM&#8208;derived electrocatalysts. Notably, we focus on exposing the current states, essences, and mechanisms of how POM&#8208;structured materials influence their electrocatalytic activities and disclose the critical requirements for future developments. The future challenges, objectives, comparisons, and perspectives for creating POM&#8208;structured materials have also been systematically discussed. We anticipate that this review will offer a substantial impact on stimulating interdisciplinary efforts for the prosperities and widespread utilizations of POM&#8208;structured materials in electrocatalysis.

         <title>Physiochemical Coupled Dynamic Nanosphere Lithography Enabling Multiple Metastructures from Single Mask</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metastructures are widely used in photonic devices, energy conversion and biomedical applications. However, to fabricate multiple patterns continuously in single etching protocol with highly tunable photonic properties is challenging. Here we proposed a simple and robust dynamic nanosphere lithography by inserting a spacer between the nanosphere assembly and the wafer. The nanosphere diameter decrease and uneven penetration of the spacer during etching leads to a dynamic masking process. Coupled anisotropic physical ion sputtering and ricocheting with isotropic chemical radical etching achieved highly tunable structures with various 3D patterns continuously forming through a single etching process. Specifically, the nanosphere diameters define the periodicity, the etched spacer forms the upper parts, and the wafer forms the lower parts. Each part of the structure is highly tunable through changing nanosphere diameter, spacer thickness and etch conditions. Using this protocol, we realized numerous structures of varying sizes including nano mushrooms, nanocones, nano pencils, and nanoneedles with diverse shapes as proof of concepts. The broadband antireflection ability of the nanostructures and their use in SERS were also demonstrated for practical application. Our method substantially simplified the fabrication procedure of various metastructures, paving the way for its application in multiple disciplines especially in photonic devices.

         <title>Modifying Surface Termination by Bidentate Chelating Strategy Enables 13.77% Efficient Kesterite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Surfaces display discontinuities in the kesterite&#8208;based polycrystalline films can produce large defect densities, including strained and dangling bonds. These physical defects tend to introduce electronic defects and surface states, which can greatly promote nonradiative recombination of electron&#8208;hole pairs and damage device performance. Here, an effective chelation strategy is reported to suppress these harmful physical defects related to unterminated Cu, Zn, and Sn sites by modifying the surface of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) films with sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (NaDDTC). The conjoint theoretical calculations and experimental results reveal that the NaDDTC molecules can be coordinate to surface metal sites of CZTSSe films via robust bidentate chelating interactions, effectively reducing surface undercoordinated defects and passivating the electron trap states. Consequently, the solar cell efficiency of the NaDDTC&#8208;treated device is increased to as high as 13.77% under 100 mWcm&#8722;2 illumination, with significant improvement in fill factor (FF) and open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC). This surface chelation strategy provides strong surface termination and defect passivation for further development and application of kesterite&#8208;based photovoltaics.

         <title>Pyroelectric Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyelectrolyte brushes prepared via surface&#8208;initiated polymerization display pyro&#8208; and piezoelectric behavior. These properties are attributed to the structural complexity of polymer brushes, and depend on, and can be tuned by variation of the counterion. The ability to produce polymer brushes with piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric properties opens new avenues of application of these materials, for example, in energy harvesting or biosensing. 








Abstract
Piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric materials are of interest, for example, for energy harvesting applications, for the development of tactile sensors, as well as neuromorphic computing. This study reports the observation of pyro&#8208; and piezoelectricity in thin surface&#8208;attached polymer brushes containing zwitterionic and electrolytic side groups that are prepared via surface&#8208;initiated polymerization. The pyro&#8208; and piezoelectric properties of the surface&#8208;grafted polyelectrolyte brushes are found to sensitively depend on and can be tuned by variation of the counterion. The observed piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric properties reflect the structural complexity of polymer brushes, and are attributed to a complex interplay of the non&#8208;uniform segment density within these films, together with a non&#8208;uniform distribution of counterions and specific ion effects. The fabrication of thin pyroelectric films by surface&#8208;initiated polymerization is an important addition to the existing strategies toward such materials. Surface&#8208;initiated polymerization, in particular, allows for facile grafting of polar thin polymer films from a wide range of substrates via a straightforward two&#8208;step protocol that obviates the need for multistep laborious synthetic procedures or thin film deposition protocols. The ability to produce polymer brushes with piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric properties opens up new avenues of application of these materials, for example, in energy harvesting or biosensing.

The observed piezo- and pyroelectric properties reflect the structural complexity of polymer brushes, and are attributed to a complex interplay of the non-uniform segment density within these films, together with a non-uniform distribution of counterions and specific ion effects. The fabrication of thin pyroelectric films by surface-initiated polymerization is an important addition to the existing strategies toward such materials. Surface-initiated polymerization, in particular, allows for facile grafting of polar thin polymer films from a wide range of substrates via a straightforward two-step protocol that obviates the need for multistep laborious synthetic procedures or thin film deposition protocols. The ability to produce polymer brushes with piezo- and pyroelectric properties opens up new avenues of application of these materials, for example, in energy harvesting or biosensing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact Solar Cell Performance Analysis Using Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides two features that may enhance experimental studies and evaluations on TOPCon solar cells technology: 1) the compilation of a dataset built from current literature, and: 2) a series of rules on cell performance and heuristics for optimization that are obtained based on this dataset, which could serve as a source of inspiration for further experimental studies.








Abstract
Tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) have gained interest as a way to increase the energy conversion efficiency of silicon solar cells, and the International Technology Roadmap of Photovoltaics forecasts TOPCon to become an important technology despite a few remaining challenges. To review the recent development of TOPCon cells, this work has compiled a dataset of all device data found in current literature, which sums up to 405 devices from 131 papers. This may seem like a surprisingly small number of cells given the recent interest in the TOPCon architecture, but it illustrates a problem of data dissemination in the field. Notwithstanding the limited number of cells, there is a great diversity in cell manufacturing procedures, and this work observes a gradual increase in performance indicating that the field has not yet converged on a set of best practices. By analyzing the data using statistical methods and machine learning (ML) algorithms, this work is able to reinforces some commonly held hypotheses related to the performance differences between different device architectures. This work also identifies a few more unintuitive feature combinations that would be of interest for further experimentally studies. This work also aims to inspire improvements in data management and dissemination within the TOPCon community.

         <title>Reversing Zincophobic/Hydrophilic Nature of Metal&#8208;N&#8208;C via Metal&#8208;Coordination Interaction for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Anode with High Depth&#8208;of&#8208;Discharge</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zincophobic/hydrophilic nature of traditional Metal&#8208;N&#8208;C is ingeniously reversed through manipulating electronic interactions between metal and coordination atoms and the novel zincophilic/hydrophobic Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C host for Zn anode is fabricated. The Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C host benefits the dendrite&#8208;free and durable cyclic stability of Zn anode under high depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge.








Abstract
Dendrite&#8208;free Zn metal anodes with high depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge (DoD) and robust cycle performances are highly desired for the practical application of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, the zincophobic/hydrophilic nature of Metal&#8208;N&#8208;C through manipulating the electronic interactions between metal and coordination atoms is successfully reversed, thereby fabricating a zincophilic/hydrophobic asymmetric Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C (consisting of a Zn center coordinated with 3 pyridinic N atoms and 1 pyrrolic N atom) host, which realizes uniformed Zn deposition and a long lifespan with high DoD. The experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate weakened interaction between pyrrolic N and metal center in the asymmetric Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C triggers downshift of the Zn 3d&#8208;band&#8208;center and a new localization nonbonding state in the N and C 2p&#8208;band, resulting in preferred Zn adsorption to water adsorption. Consequently, the asymmetric Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C host delivers small Zn nucleation overpotential and high Coulombic efficiency of 98.3% over 500 cycles. The symmetric cells with Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C@Zn anode demonstrate 500&#160;h dendrite&#8208;free cycles at DoD up to 50%. The Zn&#8208;N3Py+1Pr&#8208;C@Zn/S&#8208;PANI full cell also shows a robust long&#8208;term cycle performance of 1000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1. This strategy of constructing zincophilic/hydrophobic Metal&#8208;N&#8208;C may open up their application for the dendrite&#8208;free metal anode.

         <title>Dynamic Transition between Monomer and Excimer Phosphorescence in Organic Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphorescent Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel phosphors are developed by the modification of dithienopyrrole, exhibiting efficient and persistent near&#8208;infrared room temperature phosphorescence. At low temperatures, excimer phosphorescence can be activated, enabled by the enhanced noncovalent interactions. With environmental variations, the dynamic transition process between the monomer and excimer phosphorescence is captured, establishing a framework to understand the photophysical mechanisms governing organic phosphorescence.








Abstract
Achieving efficient near&#8208;infrared room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence of purely organic phosphors remains scarce and challenging due to strong nonradiative decay. Additionally, the investigation of triplet excimer phosphorescence is rarely reported, despite the fact that excimer, a special emitter commonly formed in crystals with strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, can efficiently change the fluorescent properties of compounds. Herein, a series of dithienopyrrole derivatives with low triplet energy levels and stable triplet states, exhibiting persistent near&#8208;infrared room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, is developed. Via the modification of halogen atoms, the crystals display tunable emissions of monomers from 645 to 702&#160;nm, with a maximum lifetime of 3.68&#160;ms under ambient conditions. Notably, excimer phosphorescence can be switched on at low temperatures, enabled by noncovalent interactions rigidifying the matrix and stabilizing triplet excimer. Unprecedentedly, the dynamic transition process is captured between the monomer and excimer phosphorescence with temperature variations, revealing that the unstable triplet excimers in crystals with a tendency to dissociate can result in the effective quench of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. Excited state transitions across varying environments are elucidated, interpreting the structural dynamics of the triplet excimer and demonstrating strategies for devising novel near&#8208;infrared phosphors.

         <title>Electrically Confined Electroluminescence of Neutral Excitons in WSe2 Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates electrically confined electroluminescence of neutral excitons in WSe2 light&#8208;emitting transistors (LETs). By balancing injected electrons and holes, and electrically confining neutral excitons, WSe2 LETs exhibit strong electroluminescence with a high external quantum efficiency of &#8776;8.2 % at room temperature. This work shows a promising approach to enhancing efficiency and modulating the recombination of exciton complexes for 2D excitonic devices.








Abstract
Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have drawn significant attention for their potential in optoelectronic applications due to their direct band gap and exceptional quantum yield. However, TMD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting devices have shown low external quantum efficiencies as imbalanced free carrier injection often leads to the formation of non&#8208;radiative charged excitons, limiting practical applications. Here, electrically confined electroluminescence (EL) of neutral excitons in tungsten diselenide (WSe2) light&#8208;emitting transistors (LETs) based on the van der Waals heterostructure is demonstrated. The WSe2 channel is locally doped to simultaneously inject electrons and holes to the 1D region by a local graphene gate. At balanced concentrations of injected electrons and holes, the WSe2 LETs exhibit strong EL with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8776;8.2 % at room temperature. These experimental and theoretical results consistently show that the enhanced EQE could be attributed to dominant exciton emission confined at the 1D region while expelling charged excitons from the active area by precise control of external electric fields. This work shows a promising approach to enhancing the EQE of 2D light&#8208;emitting transistors and modulating the recombination of exciton complexes for excitonic devices.

The non&#8208;eutectic biphasic design of GaIn alloy not only maintains the conductive network integrity at a wide temperature range (77&#8211;473 K) by phase transitions of liquid Ga and solid In but also addresses the widespread leakage problem. This work provides a feasible indication of conductive composites for applications in extreme temperature applications.








Abstract
Flexible and adaptable polymer composites with high&#8208;performance reliability over wide temperature range are imperative for various applications. However, the distinct filler&#8208;matrix thermomechanical behaviors often cause severe structure damage and performance degradation upon large thermal shock. To address this issue, a general strategy is proposed to construct leakage&#8208;free, self&#8208;adaptive, stable percolation networks in polymer composites over wide temperature (77&#8211;473 K) with biphasic Ga35In65 alloy. The in situ micro&#8208;CT technology, for the first time, reveals the conformable phase transitions of Ga35In65 alloys in the polymer matrix that help repair the disruptive conductive networks over large temperature variations. The cryo&#8208;expanded Ga compensates the disruptive carbon networks at low temperatures, and flowable Ga and melted In at high temperatures conformably fill and repair the deboned interfaces and yielded crevices. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, this temperature&#8208;resistant composite demonstrates superb electrical conductivity and electromagnetic interference shielding properties and stability even after a large temperature shock (&#916;T = 396 K). Furthermore, the superiority of the construction of temperature self&#8208;adaptive networks within the composite enables them for additive manufacturing of application&#8208;oriented components. This work offers helpful inspiration for developing high&#8208;performance polymer composites for extreme&#8208;temperature applications.

         <title>Sub&#8208;1&#8208;Volt Electrically Programmable Optical Modulator Based on Active Tamm Plasmon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrically controllable Tamm plasmon coupled with poly (3,4&#8208;ethylene&#8208;dioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate signifies a breakthrough in optical switching, achieving a modulation depth surpassing 88% (&#8776;99% theoretically) in the near&#8208;infrared range at sub&#8208;1&#8208;volt levels. This device holds the potential to accelerate advancements in scalable optical modulators and non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;memory state optical devices. Consequently, it extends applications to rewritable optical memory storage with neuromorphic behavior.








Abstract
Reconfigurable optical devices hold great promise for advancing high&#8208;density optical interconnects, photonic switching, and memory applications. While many optical modulators based on active materials have been demonstrated, it is challenging to achieve a high modulation depth with a low operation voltage in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range, which is a highly sought&#8208;after wavelength window for free&#8208;space communication and imaging applications. Here, electrically switchable Tamm plasmon coupled with poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is introduced. The device allows for a high modulation depth across the entire NIR range by fully absorbing incident light even under epsilon near zero conditions. Optical modulation exceeding 88% is achieved using a CMOS&#8208;compatible voltage of &#177;1&#160;V. This modulation is facilitated by precise electrical control of the charge carrier density through an electrochemical doping/dedoping process. Additionally, the potential applications of the device are extended for a non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;memory state optical device, capable of rewritable optical memory storage and exhibiting long&#8208;term potentiation/depression properties with neuromorphic behavior.

         <title>Topological Engineering Electrodes with Ultrafast Oxygen Transport for Super&#8208;Power Sodium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pore&#8208;clogging and poor O2 diffusion restrict the output power and capacity of sodium&#8208;oxygen batteries. Here, by using 3D&#8208;printing techniques, the impact of porous structures and pore sizes on O2 diffusion in sodium&#8208;oxygen cells is studied. An electrode is 3D printed with progressively branching gas channels to balance O2 diffusion and product storage, which shows a high output power and capacity.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;oxygen battery has attracted tremendous interest due to its extraordinary theoretical specific energy (1605&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1NaO2) and appealing element abundance. However, definite mechanistic factors governing efficient oxygen diffusion and consumption inside electrolyte&#8208;flooded air cathodes remain elusive thus precluding a true gas diffusion electrode capable of high discharge current (i.e., several mA cm&#8722;2) and superior output power. Herein, 3D&#8208;printing technology is adopted to create gas channels with tailored channel size and structure to demystify the diffusion&#8208;limited oxygen delivery process. It is revealed that as the clogging discharging products increase, large channel size, and interconnected channel structure are essential to guaranteeing fast O2 diffusion. Moreover, to further encourage O2 diffusion, a bio&#8208;inspired breathable cathode with progressively branching channels that balances between O2 passage and reaction is 3D printed. This elaborated 3D electrode allows a sodium&#8208;oxygen cell to deliver an impressive discharging current density of up to 4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and an output power of 8.4&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, giving rise to an outstanding capacity of 18.4 mAh cm&#8722;2. The unraveled mystery of oxygen delivery enabled by 3D printing points to a valuable roadmap for the rational design of metal&#8208;air batteries toward practical applications.

         <title>Reorganizing Helmholtz Adsorption Plane Enables Sodium Layered&#8208;Oxide Cathode Beyond High Oxidation Limits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sodium layered&#8208;oxides (NaxTMO2) sustain severe interfacial stability issues when subjected to battery applications. Particularly at high potential, the oxidation limits including transition metal dissolution and SEI reformation are intertwined upon the cathode, resulting in poor cycle ability. Herein, by rearranging the complex and structure of Helmholtz absorption plane adjacent to NaxTMO2 cathodes, the mechanism of constructing stable cathode/electrolyte interphase to push up oxidation limits is clarified. The strong absorbent fluorinated anions replace the solvents into the inner Helmholtz plane, thereby reorganizing the Helmholtz absorption structure and spontaneously inducing an anion&#8208;dominated interphase to envelop more active sites for layered oxides. More importantly, such multi&#8208;component cathode/electrolyte interphase proves effective for long&#8208;term durability of a series of manganese&#8208;based oxide cathodes, which achieves 1500&#8208;cycles lifetime against high oxidation voltage limit beyond 4.3&#160;V. This work unravels the key role of breaking high&#8208;oxidation limits in attaining higher energy density of layered&#8208;oxide systems.

Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap metal halide perovskites have demonstrated promise in multi&#8208;junction photovoltaic (PV) cells. However, photoinduced phase segregation and the resultant low open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) have greatly limited the PV performance of perovskite&#8208;based multi&#8208;junction devices. Here, we report a alloying strategy to achieve uniform distribution of triple cations and halides in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites by doping Rb+ and Cl&#8722; with small ionic radii, which effectively suppresses halide phase segregation while promoting the homogenization of surface potential. Based on this strategy, a Voc of 1.33&#160;V was obtained from single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells, and a VOC approaching 3.0&#160;V and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.0% (obtained from reverse scan direction, certified efficiency: 24.19%) on an 1.04&#8208;cm2 photoactive area could be achieved in a perovskite/perovskite/c&#8208;Si triple&#8208;junction tandem cell, where the certification efficiency and stabilized power output (SPO) are by far the greatest PV performance of perovskite&#8208;based triple&#8208;junction tandem solar cells. This work overcomes the performance deadlock of perovskite&#8208;based triple&#8208;junction tandem cells by setting a materials&#8208;by&#8208;design paradigm.

Abstract
Advanced battery electrodes require a cautious design of microscale particles with built&#8208;in nanoscale features to exploit the advantages of both micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;particles relative to their performance attributes. Herein, we reveal the dynamic behavior of nanosized Sn clusters and their host pores in carbon nanofibers (CNFs) during sodiation and desodiation using a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 3D electron microscopic reconstruction technique. For the first time, the anomalous expansion of Sn clusters after desodiation is observed owing to the aggregation of clusters/single atoms. Pore connectivity is retained despite the anomalous expansion, suggesting inhibition of solid electrolyte interface formation in the sub&#8208;2&#8208;nm pores. Taking advantage of the built&#8208;in nanoconfinement feature, the CNF film with nanometer&#8208;sized interconnected pores hosting Sn clusters (&#8764;2&#160;nm) enables high utilization (95% at a high rate of 1 A g&#8722;1) of Sn active sites while maintaining an improved initial Coulombic efficiency of 87%. Our findings provide insights into electrochemical reactions in a confined space and a guiding principle in electrode design for battery applications.

&lt;p&gt;Advanced battery electrodes require a cautious design of microscale particles with built-in nanoscale features to exploit the advantages of both micro- and nano-particles relative to their performance attributes. Herein, we reveal the dynamic behavior of nanosized Sn clusters and their host pores in carbon nanofibers (CNFs) during sodiation and desodiation using a state-of-the-art 3D electron microscopic reconstruction technique. For the first time, the anomalous expansion of Sn clusters after desodiation is observed owing to the aggregation of clusters/single atoms. Pore connectivity is retained despite the anomalous expansion, suggesting inhibition of solid electrolyte interface formation in the sub-2-nm pores. Taking advantage of the built-in nanoconfinement feature, the CNF film with nanometer-sized interconnected pores hosting Sn clusters (&#8764;2&#160;nm) enables high utilization (95% at a high rate of 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) of Sn active sites while maintaining an improved initial Coulombic efficiency of 87%.

         <title>CO2 Enrichment Boosts Highly Selective Infrared&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Conversion to CH4 By UiO&#8208;66/Co9S8 Photocatalyst</title>

Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to high&#8208;value chemicals is an attractive approach to mitigate climate change, but it remains a great challenge to produce a specific product selectively by low&#8208;energy IR light. To meet this challenge, UiO&#8208;66/Co9S8 composite is designed to couple the advantages of metallic photocatalysts and porous CO2 adsorbers for IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion. The metallic nature of Co9S8 endows UiO&#8208;66/Co9S8 with exceptional IR light absorption, while UiO&#8208;66 dramatically enhances its CO2 affinity. Notably, finite&#8208;element method simulations reveal the porous structure of UiO&#8208;66 enriches local CO2 concentration around Co9S8. As a result, Co9S8 or UiO&#8208;66 alone doesn't show observable IR&#8208;light photocatalytic activity, whereas UiO&#8208;66/Co9S8 reveals exceptional activity. The CH4 evolution rate over UiO&#8208;66/Co9S8 reaches 25.7&#160;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with ca. 100% selectivity under IR light irradiation, outperforming most reported catalysts under similar reaction conditions. The XAFS spectra verify the presence of two distinct Co sites and confirm the existence of metallic Co&#8208;Co bond in Co9S8. Energy diagrams analysis and fs&#8208;TA spectra manifest that CO2 reduction mainly occurs on Co9S8 for UiO&#8208;66/Co9S8, while DFT calculations demonstrate that high&#8208;electron&#8208;density Co1 sites are the key active sites, possessing lower energy barriers for further protonation of *CO, leading to the ultra&#8208;high selectivity towards CH4.

         <title>Bioinspired Tumor Calcification&#8208;Guided Early Diagnosis and Eradication of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tumor calcification was found to be associated with the benign prognostic, and which showed considerable promise as a somewhat predictive index of the tumor response clinically. However, calcification is still a missing area in clinical cancer treatment. We propose a specific strategy for inducing tumor calcification through the synergy of CaO2&#8208;based microspheres and transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The persistent calcium stress in situ specifically leads to powerful tumor calcioptosis, resulting in diffuse calcification and a high&#8208;density shadow on computed tomography (CT) that enables clear localization the in vivo tumor site and partial delineation of tumor&#160;margins in an orthotopic HCC rabbit model. This osmotic calcification could facilitate tumor clinical diagnosis, which is of great significance in differentiating tumor response during early follow&#8208;up periods. Proteome and phosphoproteome analysis identified that calreticulin (CALR) is a crucial target protein involved in tumor calcioptosis. Further fluorescence molecular imaging analysis also indicated that CALR can be used as a prodromal marker of calcification to predict tumor response at an earlier stage in different preclinical rodent models. Our findings suggest that upregulated CALR in association with tumor calcification, which might be broadly useful for quick visualization of tumor response.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Triggered Cascade Therapy: A NIR&#8208;II AIE Luminogen Collaborating with Nitric Oxide Facilitates Efficient Collagen Depletion for Boosting Pancreatic Cancer Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional theranostic liposome (Lip&#8208;DTI/NO) by integration of a NIR&#8208;II AIE luminogen DTITBT and GSH or heat&#8208;responsive NO donor S&#8208;nitroso&#8208;N&#8208;acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) is constructed and demonstrated the NIR light&#8208;triggered in situ generation of ONOO&#8722; for tumor stroma depletion and enhanced drug delivery, and consequently boosting pancreatic cancer phototherapy.








Abstract
The dense extracellular matrix (ECM) in the pancreatic cancer severely hampers the penetration of nanodrugs, which causes inferior therapeutic efficacy. To address this issue, a multifunctional liposome, namely, Lip&#8208;DTI/NO, integrating a type&#8208;I photosensitizer DTITBT with glutathione (GSH) or heat&#8208;responsive nitric oxide (NO) donor S&#8208;nitroso&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;penicillamine (SNAP) is constructed to deplete the tumor ECM, leading to enhanced drug delivery and consequently improved phototherapy. The loaded DTITBT possesses multiple functions including NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging, efficient superoxide radical (O2&#8226;&#8722;) generation and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency, making it feasible for precisely pinpointing the tumor in the phototherapy process. Responding to the intracellular overexpressed glutathione or heat produced by photothermal effect of DTITBT, NO can be released from SNAP. Upon 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, Lip&#8208;DTI/NO could selectively induce in situ generation of peroxynitrite anion (ONOO&#8722;) in tumor after cascade processes including O2&#8226;&#8722; production, GSH or heat&#8208;triggered NO release, and rapid reaction between O2&#8226;&#8722; and NO. The generated ONOO&#8722; could activate the expression of endogenous matrix metalloproteinases which could efficiently digest collagen of tumor ECM, thus facilitating enhanced penetration and accumulation of Lip&#8208;DTI/NO in tumor. In vivo evaluation demonstrates the notable therapeutic efficacy via ONOO&#8722;&#8208;potentiated synergistic photodynamic&#8208;photothermal therapies on both subcutaneous and orthotopic pancreatic cancer model.

         <title>Mismatched Refractive Index Strategy for Fabricating Laser&#8208;Driven Wood Diffusers from Bulk Wood for Illumination Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laser&#8208;driven wood diffusers are prepared by impregnating porous delignified wood with poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate with a mismatched refractive index to enhance scattering. The fabrication of laser&#8208;driven wood diffusers is simple, environment&#8208;friendly, and rapid. This low&#8208;cost and highly efficient strategy can provide substantial energy savings and a basis for the application of natural wood in emerging laser diode lighting technology.








Abstract
Laser&#8208;diode&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lighting is primarily used in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art illumination systems. However, these systems rely on light&#8208;converting inorganic phosphors, which have low quantum efficiencies and complex manufacturing conditions. In this study, a mismatched refractive index strategy is proposed to directly convert natural bulk wood into a laser&#8208;driven wood diffuser using a simple delignification and polymer infiltration method. The resulting material has the potential to be used in laser&#8208;driven diffuse illumination applications. The optical performance of the laser&#8208;driven wood diffuser is optimized by changing the density of natural wood. The optimal coefficient of illuminance variation of the wood diffuser is as low as 17.7%, which is significantly lower than that of commercial diffusers. The illuminance uniformity is larger than 0.9, which is significantly higher than the ISO requirements for indoor workplace lighting. The laser damage threshold is 7.9&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;2, which is considerably higher than those of the substrates of commercially available phosphors. Furthermore, the optimized wood diffuser exhibits outstanding mechanical properties, excellent thermal stability, tolerance to harsh environmental conditions, and low speckle contrast. These results show that the laser&#8208;driven wood diffuser is a promising laser&#8208;color converter that is suitable for indoor, long&#8208;distance outdoor, undersea, and other high&#8208;luminance laser lighting applications.

The illuminance uniformity is larger than 0.9, which is significantly higher than the ISO requirements for indoor workplace lighting. The laser damage threshold is 7.9&#160;J&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is considerably higher than those of the substrates of commercially available phosphors. Furthermore, the optimized wood diffuser exhibits outstanding mechanical properties, excellent thermal stability, tolerance to harsh environmental conditions, and low speckle contrast. These results show that the laser-driven wood diffuser is a promising laser-color converter that is suitable for indoor, long-distance outdoor, undersea, and other high-luminance laser lighting applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>New Nanophotonics Approaches for Enhancing the Efficiency and Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review begins by introducing the fundamental photophysics of plasmonic metal nanostructures, including radiative and nonradiative decay processes of surface plasmons, and the mechanism of light harvesting and trapping by photonic dielectric microstructures. It then provides a systematic review on the design, implementation, and benefits of these nanophotonic structures for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Over the past decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has experienced a remarkable ascent, soaring from 3.8% in 2009 to a remarkable record of 26.1% in 2023. Many recent approaches for improving PSC performance employ nanophotonic technologies, from light harvesting and thermal management to the manipulation of charge carrier dynamics. Plasmonic nanoparticles and arrayed dielectric nanostructures have been applied to tailor the light absorption, scattering, and conversion, as well as the heat dissipation within PSCs to improve their PCE and operational stability. In this review, it is begin with a concise introduction to define the realm of nanophotonics by focusing on the nanoscale interactions between light and surface plasmons or dielectric photonic structures. Prevailing strategies that utilize resonance&#8208;enhanced light&#8211;matter interactions for boosting the PCE and stability of PSCs from light trapping, carrier transportation, and thermal management perspectives are then elaborated, and the resultant practical applications, such as semitransparent photovoltaics, colored PSCs, and smart perovskite windows are discussed. Finally, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nanophotonic paradigms in PSCs are reviewed, and the benefits of these approaches in improving the aesthetic effects and energy&#8208;saving character of PSC&#8208;integrated buildings are highlighted.

         <title>Boosting the performance of PEDOT:PSS based electronics via ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The conducting polymer poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) offers superior advantages in electronics due to its remarkable combination of high electrical conductivity, excellent biocompatibility, and mechanical flexibility, making it an ideal material among electronic skin, health monitoring, and energy harvesting and storage. Nevertheless, pristine PEDOT:PSS films exhibit limitations in terms of both low conductivity and stretchability, while conventional processing techniques cannot enhance these properties simultaneously, facing the dilemma that highly conductive interconnected PEDOT:PSS domains are susceptible to tensile strain. Via modifying PEDOT:PSS with ionic liquids (ILs), not only a synergistic enhancement of the electrical and mechanical properties can be achieved, but also the requirements for the printable bioelectronic are satisfied. In this comprehensive review, we have undertaken the task of providing a thorough examination of the mechanisms and applications of ILs as modifiers for PEDOT:PSS. First, the theoretical mechanisms governing the interactions between ILs and PEDOT:PSS is discussed detailly. Then, we have reviewed the enhanced properties and the elucidation of the underlying mechanisms achieved through the incorporation of ILs. Next, specific applications of ILs&#8208;modified PEDOT:PSS relevant to bioelectronic devices are presented. Lastly, we offer a concise summary and engage in a discussion regarding the opportunities and challenges in this exciting field.

         <title>Redox Gating for Colossal Carrier Modulation And Unique Phase Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Redox gating, a novel approach distinct from conventional electrolyte gating, combines reversible redox functionalities with common ionic electrolyte moieties to engineer charge transport, enabling power&#8208;efficient electronic phase control. In our study, we achieve a colossal sheet carrier density modulation beyond 1016 cm&#8722;2, sustainable over thousands of cycles, all within the sub&#8208;volt regime for functional oxide thin films. The key advantage of this method lies in the controlled injection of a large quantity of carriers from the electrolyte into the channel material without the deleterious effects associated with traditional electrolyte gating processes, such as the production of ionic defects or intercalated species. The redox gating approach offers a simple and practical means of decoupling electrical and structural phase transitions, enabling the isostructural metal&#8208;insulator transition and improved device endurance. The versatility of redox gating extends across multiple materials, irrespective of their crystallinity, crystallographic orientation, or carrier type (n&#8208; or p&#8208;type). This inclusivity encompasses functional heterostructures and low&#8208;dimensional quantum materials composed of sustainable elements, highlighting the broad applicability and potential of the technique in electronic devices.

         <title>Freeze&#8208;thaw Microfluidic System Produces &#8220;Themis&#8221; Nanocomplex for Cleaning Persisters&#8208;infected Macrophages and Enhancing Uninfected Macrophages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Macrophages are the primary effectors against potential pathogen infections. They can be &#8220;parasitized&#8221; by intracellular bacteria, serving as &#8220;accomplices&#8221;, protecting intracellular bacteria and even switching them to persisters. Here, using a freeze&#8208;thaw strategy&#8208;based microfluidic chip, we created a &#8220;Themis&#8221; nanocomplex (TNC). The TNC consisted of Lactobacillus reuteri&#8208;derived membrane vesicles, heme, and vancomycin, which cleaned infected macrophages and enhanced uninfected macrophages. In infected macrophages, TNC released heme that led to the reconstruction of the respiratory chain complexes of intracellular persisters, forcing them to regrow. The revived bacteria produced virulence factors that destroyed host macrophages (accomplices), thereby being externalized and becoming vulnerable to immune responses. In uninfected macrophages, TNC upregulated the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), contributing to immunoenhancement. The combined effect of TNC of cleaning the accomplice (infected macrophages) and reinforcing uninfected macrophages provides a promising strategy for intracellular bacterial therapy.

         <title>Digital Multiphase Composites via Additive Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Mechanical properties of traditional engineering materials are typically coupled to each other, presenting a challenge to practitioners with multi&#8208;dimensional material property requirements. In this work we&#160;demonstrate continuous, independent control over multiple mechanical properties in composite materials realized using additive manufacturing. For the first time, we&#160;experimentally characterize composites additively manufactured from rigid plastic, soft elastomer, and liquid constituents, demonstrating materials which span four orders of magnitude in modulus and two orders of magnitude in toughness. By forming analytical mappings between relative concentrations of constituents at the microscale and resulting macroscale material properties, we&#160;enable inverse material design; we&#160;showcase the method by printing artifacts with prescribed toughness and elasticity distributions. We&#160;place the properties of these composites in the context of biological tissues, showing they have promise as mechanically plausible tissue&#160;mimics.

         <title>Building Stable Anodes for High&#8208;Rate Na&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

Abstract
Due to the low&#8208;cost and high energy density, sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have attracted growing interests, with great potential to power future electric vehicles (EVs) and mobile electronics, which require the rapid charge/discharge capability. However, the development of high&#8208;rate SMBs has been impeded by the sluggish Na+ ion kinetics, particularly at the sodium metal anode (SMA). The high&#8208;rate operation severely threatens the SMA stability, due to the unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI), the Na dendrite growth, and large volume changes during Na plating&#8208;stripping cycles, leading to rapid electrochemical performance degradations. In this paper, we survey key challenges faced by high&#8208;rate SMAs, and we highlight representative stabilization strategies, including the general modification of SMB components (including the host, Na metal surface, electrolyte, separator, and cathode), and emerging solutions with the development of solid&#8208;state SMBs and liquid metal anodes; we elaborate the working principle, performance, and application of these strategies, to reduce the Na nucleation energy barriers and promote Na+ ion transfer kinetics for stable high&#8208;rate Na metal anodes. This review will inspire further efforts to stabilize SMAs and other metal (e.g., Li, K, Mg, Zn) anodes, promoting high&#8208;rate applications of high&#8208;energy metal batteries towards a more sustainable society.

         <title>Versatile Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Organic Redox&#8208;Active Materials for Alkali Metal&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
Versatile nitrogen&#8208;centered organic redox&#8208;active molecules have gained significant attention in alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries (AMIBs) due to their low cost, low toxicity, and ease of preparation. Specially, their multiple reaction categories (anion/cation insertion types of reaction) and higher operating voltage, when compared to traditional conjugated carbonyl materials, underscore their promising prospects. However, the high solubility of nitrogen&#8208;centered redox active materials in organic electrolyte and their low electronic conductivity contribute to inferior cycling performance, sluggish reaction kinetics, and limited rate capability. This review provides a detailed overview of nitrogen&#8208;centered redox&#8208;active materials, encompassing their redox chemistry, solutions to overcome shortcomings, characterization of charge storage mechanisms, and recent progress. Additionally, we propose prospects and directions for future investigations. It is anticipated that this review will stimulate further exploration of underlying mechanisms and interface chemistry through in situ characterization techniques, thereby promoting the practical application of nitrogen&#8208;centered redox&#8208;active materials in AMIBs.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Fatigue Tandem Organic Photovoltaics for Indoor Illumination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The ability of achieving high efficiency makes tandem organic photovoltaics a competitive technique in potential indoor applications. Except high efficiency, reliable indoor energy supplying also calls for outstanding stability. However, unavoidable instable voltage&#8208;supply from circuit control system for indoor light sources like light emitting diodes and incandescent lamps would cause carrier density fluctuating and device fatigue drove by periodic light/dark switching. In this work, the strobing induced fatigue within bulk heterojunction/interconnecting layer interface is firstly revealed and overcome. Based on reliable and effective interfacial doping between conjugated acceptor and metal oxide, the interfacial capacitance that determines the strobing induced fatigue, has been significantly restrained. The imbalance carrier migration and fierce inter&#8208;layer accommodating during burn&#8208;in stage caused by light strobing are substantially diminished. Benefitted from this method, the stability of tandem device are highly enhanced under strobing indoor illumination and a champion efficiency (35.02%) is obtained. Our method provides a guidance for further material design for interconnecting layer in organic photovoltaics.

         <title>Biomimetic Self&#8208;Maturation Mineralization System for Enamel Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Enamel repair is crucial for restoring tooth function and halting dental caries. However, contemporary research often overlooks the retention of organic residues within the repair layer, which hinders the growth of dense crystals and compromises the properties of the repaired enamel. During maturation of natural enamel, the organic matrix undergoes enzymatic processing to facilitate further crystal growth, resulting in a highly mineralized tissue. Inspired by this process, a biomimetic self&#8208;maturation mineralization system was developed, comprising RNA&#8208;stabilized amorphous calcium phosphate (RNA&#8208;ACP) and RNase. The RNA&#8208;ACP induced initial mineralization in the form of epitaxial crystal growth, while the RNase present in saliva automatically triggered a biomimetic self&#8208;maturation process. Mechanistic study further indicated that RNA degradation prompted conformational rearrangement of the RNA&#8208;ACP, effectively excluding the organic matter introduced earlier. This exclusion process promoted lateral crystal growth, resulting in the generation of denser enamel&#8208;like apatite crystals that were devoid of organic residues. This strategy of eliminating organic residues from enamel crystals enhanced the mechanical and physiochemical properties of the repaired enamel. The present study introduces a conceptual biomimetic mineralization strategy for effective enamel repair in clinical practice, and offers potential insights into the mechanisms of biomineral formation.

         <title>Strategies for the Nuclear Delivery of Metal Complexes to Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The nucleus is an essential organelle for the function of cells. It holds most of the genetic material and plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation. Since many antitumoral therapies target nucleic acids to induce cell death, tumor&#8208;specific nuclear drug delivery could potentiate therapeutic effects and prevent potential off&#8208;target side effects on healthy tissue. Due to their great structural variety, good biocompatibility and unique physico&#8208;chemical properties, organometallic complexes and other metal&#8208;based compounds have sparked great interest as promising anticancer agents. In this review, strategies for specific nuclear delivery of metal complexes are summarized and discussed to highlight crucial parameters to consider for the design of new metal complexes as anticancer drug candidates. Moreover, the existing opportunities and challenges of tumor&#8208;specific, nucleus&#8208;targeting metal complexes are emphasized to outline some new perspectives and help in the design of new cancer treatments.

         <title>Pericardial Delivery of SDF&#8208;1&#945; Puerarin Hydrogel Promotes Heart&#160;Repair and Electrical Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although the SDF&#8208;1&#945;/CXCR4 is effective for MI treatment, excessive monocytes/macrophages recruitment or activation can cause unwanted inflammation simultaneously. More seriously, the increased inflammation contributes to abnormal cardiomyocyte electrical coupling. The degradable SDF&#8208;1&#945;@PUE hydrogel simultaneously enhances the recruitment of endogenous cells and reverses the adverse effects, which improves cardiac function and reduces the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.








Abstract
The stromal&#8208;derived factor 1&#945;/chemokine receptor 4 (SDF&#8208;1&#945;/CXCR4)&#160;axis contributes to myocardial protection after myocardial infarction (MI) by recruiting endogenous stem cells into the ischemic tissue. However, excessive inflammatory macrophages are also recruited simultaneously, aggravating myocardial damage. More seriously, the increased inflammation contributes to abnormal cardiomyocyte electrical coupling, leading to inhomogeneities in ventricular conduction and retarded conduction velocity. It is highly desirable to selectively recruit the stem cells but block the inflammation. In this work, SDF&#8208;1&#945;&#8208;encapsulated Puerarin (PUE) hydrogel (SDF&#8208;1&#945;@PUE) is capable of enhancing endogenous stem cell homing and simultaneously polarizing the recruited monocyte/macrophages into a repairing phenotype. Flow cytometry analysis of the treated heart tissue shows that endogenous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, hemopoietic stem cells, and immune cells are recruited while SDF&#8208;1&#945;@PUE efficiently polarizes the recruited monocytes/macrophages into the M2 type. These macrophages influence the preservation of connexin 43 (Cx43) expression which modulates intercellular coupling and improves electrical conduction. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the improved &#8220;soil&#8221;, the recruited stem cells mediate an improved cardiac function by preventing deterioration, promoting neovascular architecture, and reducing infarct size. These findings demonstrate a promising therapeutic platform for MI that not only facilitates heart regeneration but also reduces the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.

         <title>Modulating Charge Separation of Oxygen&#8208;Doped Boron Nitride with Isolated Co Atoms for Enhancing CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated Co atoms are successfully anchored on oxygen&#8208;doped boron nitride (Co/BNF) to enhance photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. The uniformly dispersed Co atoms with a CoO2N1 coordination geometry play an essential role in promoting the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and lowering the reaction energy barriers, thus boosting the activity and selectivity of Co/BNF for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.








Abstract
To alleviate the greenhouse effect and address the related energy crisis, solar&#8208;driven reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to value&#8208;added products is considered as a sustainable strategy. However, the insufficient separation and rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers during photocatalysis greatly limit their reduction efficiency and practical application potential. Here, isolated Cobalt (Co) atoms are successfully decorated into oxygen&#8208;doped boron nitride (BN)&#160;via an in situ pyrolysis method, achieving greatly improved catalytic activity and selectivity to the carbon monoxide (CO) product. X&#8208;ray absorption fine spectroscopy demonstrates that the isolated Co atoms are stabilized by the O and N atoms with an unsaturated CoO2N1 configuration. Further experimental investigation and theoretical simulations confirm that the decorated Co atoms not only work as the real active center during the CO2 reduction process, but also perform as the electron pump to promote the electron/hole separation and transfer, resulting in greatly accelerated reaction kinetics and improved activity. In addition, the CoO2N1 coordination geometry is favorable to the conversion from *CO2 to *COOH, which shall be considered as a selectivity&#8208;determining step for the evolution of the CO products. The surface modulation strategy at the atomic level opens a new avenue for regulating the reaction kinetics for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Assisted Surface Modification of Lithium&#8208;Rich Manganese&#8208;Based Oxide toward High Anionic Redox Reversibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;assisted modification is introduced for the construction of SnS2&#8722;x&#8722;&#963;Oy coating and sulfur atoms substituting lattice oxygen. The sulfur anions in the lattice enhance the reversibility of the anionic redox by modulating the band of the redox&#8208;active center. The additional coating effectively traps the escaping active oxygen, and the trapped oxygen and coating return to the pristine upon discharge.








Abstract
Energy storage via anionic redox provides extra capacity for lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxide cathodes at high voltage but causes gradual structural collapse and irreversible capacity loss with generation of On&#8722; (0 &#8804; n &lt; 2) species upon deep oxidation. Herein, the stability and reversibility of anionic redox reactions are enhanced by a simple sulfur&#8208;assisted surface modification method, which not only modulates the material's energy band allowing feasible electron release from both bonding and antibonding bands, but also traps the escaping On&#8722; via an as&#8208;constructed SnS2&#8722;x&#8722;&#963;Oy coating layer and return them to the host lattice upon discharge. The regulation of anionic redox inhibits the irreversible structural transformation and parasitic reactions, maintaining the specific capacity retention of as&#8208;modified cathode up to 94% after 200 cycles at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1, along with outstanding voltage stability. The reported strategy incorporating energy band modulation and oxygen trapping is promising for the design and advancement of other cathodes storing energy through anion redox.

         <title>Modular Aptamer Switches for the Continuous Optical Detection of Small&#8208;Molecule Analytes in Complex Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A duplex&#8208;bubble switch architecture enables precise modulation of kinetics and thermodynamics without prior knowledge of the ligand binding site. Its integration with fiber&#8208;optic probes and applicability in real&#8208;time optical detection by achieving reversible and binding&#8208;induced fluorescence responses to dopamine and cortisol in complex matrices are demonstrated. This approach promises a universal solution for rapid aptamer&#8208;based sensor development in biomedical applications.








Abstract
Aptamers are a promising class of affinity reagents because signal transduction mechanisms can&#160;be built into the reagent, so that they can directly produce a physically measurable output signal upon target binding. However, endowing the signal transduction functionality into an aptamer remains a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error process that can compromise its affinity or specificity and typically requires knowledge of the ligand binding domain or its structure. In this work, a design architecture that can convert an existing aptamer into a &#8220;reversible aptamer switch&#8221; whose kinetic and thermodynamic properties can be tuned without a priori knowledge of the ligand binding domain or its structure is described. Finally, by combining these aptamer switches with evanescent&#8208;field&#8208;based optical detection hardware that minimizes sample autofluorescence, this study demonstrates the first optical biosensor system that can continuously measure multiple biomarkers (dopamine and cortisol) in complex samples (artificial cerebrospinal fluid and undiluted plasma) with second and subsecond&#8208;scale time responses at physiologically relevant concentration ranges.

         <title>Electrochemical Evolution of Ru&#8208;Based Polyoxometalates into Si,W&#8208;Codoped RuOx for Acidic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils the synthesis of a robust, bifunctional electrocatalyst via the electrochemical evolution of Ru&#8208;based polyoxometalates into Si,W&#8208;codoped RuOx (RuSiW) for efficient acidic water splitting. Exploiting the synergistic effects of Si and W codoping, RuSiW catalyst achieves remarkable activity and stability for acidic hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions.








Abstract
Despite intensive studies over decades, the development of electrocatalysts for acidic water splitting still relies on platinum group metals, especially Pt and Ir, which are scarce, expensive, and poorly sustainable. Because such problems can be alleviated, Ru&#8208;based bifunctional catalysts such as rutile RuO2 have recently emerged. However, RuO2 has a relatively low activity for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and low stability for oxygen evolution reactions (OER) under acidic conditions. In this study, the synthesis of a RuOx&#8208;based bifunctional catalyst (RuSiW) for acidic water splitting via the electrochemical evolution from Ru&#8208;based polyoxometalates at cathodic potentials is reported. RuSiW consists of the nanocrystalline RuO2 core and Si,W&#8208;codoped RuOx shell. RuSiW exhibits outstanding HER and OER activity comparable to Pt/C and RuO2, respectively, with high stability. Computational analysis suggests that the codoping of RuOx with W and Si synergistically improves the HER activity of otherwise poor RuO2 by shifting the d&#8208;band center and optimizing atomic configurations beneficial for proper hydrogen adsorption. This study provides insights into the design and synthesis of unprecedented bifunctional electrocatalysts using catalytically inactive and less explored elements, such as Si and W.

         <title>Humidity/Oxygen&#8208;Insensitive Organic Synaptic Transistors Based on Optical Radical Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The improvement of the stability and environmental durability of organic electronics is a challenge for the promising applications in universal environments. Herein, a stable organic photosynaptic transistor based on a photoinitiator is developed with broad operation capabilities in vacuum, dried air, and high&#8208;humidity environment. This design provides a promising platform for long&#8208;term stable organic synaptic electronics.








Abstract
For most organic synaptic transistors based on the charge trapping effect, different atmosphere conditions lead to significantly different device performance. Some devices even lose the synaptic responses under vacuum or inert atmosphere. The stable device performance of these organic synaptic transistors under varied working environments with different humidity and oxygen levels can be a challenge. Herein, a moisture&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;insensitive organic synaptic device based on the organic semiconductor and photoinitiator molecules is reported. Unlike the widely reported charge trapping effect, the photoinduced free radical is utilized to realize the photosynaptic performance. The resulting synaptic transistor displays typical excitatory postsynaptic current, paired&#8208;pulse facilitation, learning, and forgetting behaviors. Furthermore, the device exhibits decent and stable photosynaptic performances under high humidity and vacuum conditions. This type of organic synaptic device also demonstrates high potential in ultraviolet B perception based on its environmental stability and broad ultraviolet detection capability. Finally, the contrast&#8208;enhanced capability of the device is successfully validated by the single&#8208;layer&#8208;perceptron/double&#8208;layer network based Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology pattern recognition. This work could have important implications for the development of next&#8208;generation environment&#8208;stable organic synaptic devices and systems.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Functional MXene&#8208;Based Bioanode for Wearable Self&#8208;Charging Biosupercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;functional MXene&#8208;based bioanode is prepared with a 3D hierarchical structure for wearable self&#8208;charging biosupercapacitors. The device is designed in the &#8220;island&#8211;bridge&#8221; structure, and successfully realizes conformal and adhesion with human skin in a flexible environment. The skin&#8208;mountable device exhibits superior energy harvesting and storing performance from human sweat under both relaxed and stretching conditions.








Abstract
As a reliable energy&#8208;supply platform for wearable electronics, biosupercapacitors combine the characteristics of biofuel cells and supercapacitors to harvest and store the energy from human's sweat. However, the bulky preparation process and deep embedding of enzyme active sites in bioelectrodes usually limit the energy&#8208;harvesting process, retarding the practical power&#8208;supply sceneries especially during the complicated in vivo motion. Herein, a MXene/single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube/lactate oxidase hierarchical structure as the dual&#8208;functional bioanode is designed, which can not only provide a superior 3D catalytic microenvironment for enzyme accommodation to harvest energy from sweat, but also offers sufficient capacitance to store energy via the electrical double&#8208;layer capacitor. A wearable biosupercapacitor is fabricated in the &#8220;island&#8211;bridge&#8221; structure with a composite bioanode, active carbon/Pt cathode, polyacrylamide hydrogel substrate, and liquid metal conductor. The device exhibits an open&#8208;circuit voltage&#160;of 0.48&#160;V and the high power density of 220.9 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The compact conformal adhesion with skin is successfully maintained under stretching/bending conditions. After repeatedly stretching the devices, there is no significant power attenuation in pulsed output. The unique bioelectrode structure and attractive energy harvesting/storing properties demonstrate the promising potential of this biosupercapacitor as a micro self&#8208;powered platform of wearable electronics.

         <title>Enhancing the Carrier Transport in Monolayer MoS2 through Interlayer Coupling with 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacing of monolayer MoS2 with 2DCOF films determines a major enhancement in the charge transport through the 2D semiconductor. Electron doping intensity is amplified by the superlattice's long&#8208;range order, while the lattice vibration is suppressed by the high mechanical stiffness yielding a confinement effect. The MoS2 /2D&#8208;COF heterostructures represent a novel strategy to develop high&#8208;performance 2D electronics.








Abstract
The coupling of different 2D materials (2DMs) to form van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) is a powerful strategy for adjusting the electronic properties of 2D semiconductors, for applications in opto&#8208;electronics and quantum computing. 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) represents an archetypical semiconducting, monolayer thick versatile platform for the generation of hybrid vdWH with tunable charge transport characteristics through its interfacing with molecules and assemblies thereof. However, the physisorption of (macro)molecules on 2D MoS2 yields hybrids possessing a limited thermal stability, thereby jeopardizing their technological applications. Herein, the rational design and optimized synthesis of 2D covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) for the generation of MoS2/2D&#8208;COF vdWHs exhibiting strong interlayer coupling effects are reported. The high crystallinity of the 2D&#8208;COF films makes it possible to engineer an ultrastable periodic doping effect on MoS2, boosting devices&#8217; field&#8208;effect mobility at room temperature. Such a performance increase can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the efficient interfacial electron transfer process and the pronounced suppression of MoS2&#8217;s lattice vibration. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept work validates an unprecedented approach for the efficient modulation of the electronic properties of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides toward high&#8208;performance (opto)electronics for CMOS digital circuits.

         <title>Overcoming Barriers Associated with Oral Delivery of Differently Sized Fluorescent Core&#8208;Shell Silica Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interactions between poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;coated (PEGylated) core&#8208;shell silica nanoparticles (5&#8211;50) nm and major barriers associated with oral delivery are studied. Ultrasmall nanoparticles (&lt;10 nm) rapidly diffuse through intestinal mucus, passively permeate intestinal epithelial cell layers, and are found in mouse urine after oral gavage. Together with earlier in vivo results, suggest these nanoparticles are promising candidates for oral administration.








Abstract
Oral delivery, while a highly desirable form of nanoparticle&#8208;drug administration, is limited by challenges associated with overcoming several biological barriers. Here, the authors study how fluorescent and poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;coated (PEGylated) core&#8208;shell silica nanoparticles sized 5 to 50&#160;nm interact with major barriers including intestinal mucus, intestinal epithelium, and stomach acid. From imaging fluorescence correlation spectroscopy studies using quasi&#8208;total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, diffusion of nanoparticles through highly scattering mucus is progressively hindered above a critical hydrodynamic size around 20&#160;nm. By studying Caco&#8208;2 cell monolayers mimicking the intestinal epithelia, it is observed that ultrasmall nanoparticles below 10&#160;nm diameter (Cornell prime dots, [C&#8217; dots]) show permeabilities correlated with high absorption in humans from primarily enhanced passive passage through tight junctions. Particles above 20&#160;nm diameter exclusively show active transport through cells. After establishing C&#8217; dot stability in artificial gastric juice, in vivo oral gavage experiments in mice demonstrate successful passage through the body followed by renal clearance without protein corona formation. Results suggest C&#8217; dots as viable candidates for oral administration to patients with a proven pathway towards clinical translation and may generate renewed interest in examining silica as a food additive and its effects on nutrition and health.

Conventional propellant materials, such as polymers and single metal elements, have long been investigated for their potential in pulsed laser micropropulsion (LMP) technology. However, achieving superior LMP efficiency through physical mixing of these materials remains a significant challenge. This study presents a paradigm shift by introducing porous crystalline polymers, known as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), as novel propellants in pulsed LMP. MOFs are composed of metal cations and organic ligands that form ordered structures through coordination, eliminating the problem of local hot zones arising from uneven physical mixing encountered in LMP. In direct comparison to conventional polymers and single element targets, MOFs exhibit substantially higher LMP efficiency. By precisely tailoring the metal atom fraction within MOFs, an extraordinary ultrahigh efficiency of 51.15% is achieved in pulsed LMP, surpassing the performance of similar materials previously reported in the literature. This pioneering application of MOFs not only revolutionizes the field of LMP but also opens up new frontiers for MOF utilization in various energy applications.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Biohybrid Microstructures Enable Transplantation and Vascularization of Microtissues in the Anterior Chamber of the Eye</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transplanting 3D&#8208;printed biohybrid microstructures to the anterior chamber of the eye (ACE) with the aim of vascular engraftment is investigated. The ACE is an ideal platform for studying interactions between host tissues and transplant, as well as for biomedical device trans/&#8208;implantation. The results identify pupillary dynamics as an effective factor involved in graft integrity to the host. Microstructures that provide a more static configuration lead to successful vascularization even in a no&#8208;contact mode (to the vessel source) and a fluidic microenvironment.








Abstract
Hybridizing biological cells with man&#8208;made sensors enable the detection of a wide range of weak physiological responses with high specificity. The anterior chamber of the eye (ACE) is an ideal transplantation site due to its ocular immune privilege and optical transparency, which enable superior noninvasive longitudinal analyses of cells and microtissues. Engraftment of biohybrid microstructures in the ACE may, however, be affected by the pupillary response and dynamics. Here, sutureless transplantation of biohybrid microstructures, 3D printed in IP&#8208;Visio photoresin, containing a precisely localized pancreatic islet to the ACE of mice is presented. The biohybrid microstructures allow mechanical fixation in the ACE, independent of iris dynamics. After transplantation, islets in the microstructures successfully sustain their functionality for over 20 weeks and become vascularized despite physical separation from the vessel source (iris) and immersion in a low&#8208;viscous liquid (aqueous humor) with continuous circulation and clearance. This approach opens new perspectives in biohybrid microtissue transplantation in the ACE, advancing monitoring of microtissue&#8211;host interactions, disease modeling, treatment outcomes, and vascularization in engineered tissues.

         <title>Conducting Polymer Nanoparticles with Intrinsic Aqueous Dispersibility for Conductive Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable, dispersible conductive particles are simply afforded via acid crystallization of commercial poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrenesulfonate) in solution. The particles feature a tunable internal surfactant which enables intrinsic aqueous processibility for incorporation within hydrogels without complex additives or surfactants. The particles are loaded into a resin and printed via microstereolithography, offering hydrogels with biocompatibility, structural fidelity, and high conductivity (1&#8211;10 S cm&#8722;1).








Abstract
Conductive hydrogels are promising materials with mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conduction to interface living tissue (ionic signal transmission) with medical devices (electronic signal transmission). The hydrogel form factor also uniquely bridges the wet/soft biological environment with the dry/hard environment of electronics. The synthesis of hydrogels for bioelectronics requires scalable, biocompatible fillers with high electronic conductivity and compatibility with common aqueous hydrogel formulations/resins. Despite significant advances in the processing of carbon nanomaterials, fillers that satisfy all these requirements are lacking. Herein, intrinsically dispersible acid&#8208;crystalized PEDOT:PSS nanoparticles (ncrys&#8208;PEDOTX) are reported which are processed through a facile and scalable nonsolvent induced phase separation method from commercial PEDOT:PSS without complex instrumentation. The particles feature conductivities of up to 410 S cm&#8722;1, and when compared to other common conductive fillers, display remarkable dispersibility, enabling homogeneous incorporation at relatively high loadings within diverse aqueous biomaterial solutions without additives or surfactants. The aqueous dispersibility of the ncrys&#8208;PEDOTX particles also allows simple incorporation into resins designed for microstereolithography without sonication or surfactant optimization; complex biomedical structures with fine features (&lt; 150 &#181;m)&#160;are&#160;printed with up to 10% particle loading . The ncrys&#8208;PEDOTX particles overcome the challenges of traditional conductive fillers, providing a scalable, biocompatible, plug&#8208;and&#8208;play platform for soft organic bioelectronic materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Area&#8208;Emissive White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistor for Full&#8208;Color Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uniform area&#8208;emissive white OLET device with an efficiency of 13.9% is realized by incorporating phosphorescent blue emissive and fluorescent yellow emissive guests in the active layer based on a unique lateral&#8208;integrated device configuration, which is the highest value in the field and demonstrates great potential for full&#8208;color display as backlight source for the first time.








Abstract
The construction of high&#8208;performance white organic light&#8208;emitting transistor (OLET) with uniform area emission is crucial for smart display technologies but remains greatly challenging. Herein, high&#8208;efficiency uniform area&#8208;emissive OLETs based on a unique lateral&#8208;integrated device configuration which incorporates efficient energy transfer of phosphorescent and fluorescent guests, enabling color&#8208;tunable and white emission, are demonstrated. Through precisely regulating the energy transfer between host and guests, high external quantum efficiency of 13.9% for white&#8208;emission OLETs is achieved due to the improved high exciton utilization and light outcoupling efficiency which is the highest value reported so far for OLETs and prevents exciton&#8208;charge annihilation and electrode photon losses. Moreover, good loop stability is also achieved, along with effective gate tunability and ultralow driving voltage of below 5&#160;V. Finally, a 4 &#215; 6 white&#8208;emission OLET array for full&#8208;color display is demonstrated for the first time, suggesting its great potential applications for advanced display technologies.

         <title>Rejuvenating Aged Perovskite Quantum Dots for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ defect healing treatment is reported to rejuvenate the aged perovskite quantum dots (PQDs), which could effectively heal the surface matrix defects and revive the morphology of aged PQDs, substantially improving the optoelectronic properties and orientation of PQD solids. Consequently, solar cells fabricated using rejuvenated PQDs show comparable photovoltaic performance with the control solar cells.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) have emerged as one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation solar cells owing to its remarkable optoelectronic properties and solution processability. However, the optoelectronic properties of PQDs suffer from severe degradation in storage due to the dynamically binding ligands, predominantly affecting photovoltaic applications. Herein, an in situ defect healing treatment (DHT) is reported to effectively rejuvenate aged PQDs. Systematically, experimental studies and theoretical calculations are performed to fundamentally understand the causes leading to the recovered optoelectronic properties of aged PQDs. The results reveal that the I3&#8722; anions produced from tetra&#8208;n&#8208;octylammonium iodide and iodine could strongly anchor on the surface matrix defects of aged PQDs, substantially diminishing the nonradiative recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Meanwhile, an DHT could also renovate the morphology of aged PQDs and thus improve the stacking orientation of PQD solids, substantially ameliorating charge carrier transport within PQD solids. Consequently, by using a DHT, the PQD solar cell (PQDSC) yields a high efficiency of up to 15.88%, which is comparable with the PQDSCs fabricated using fresh PQDs. Meanwhile, the stability of PQDSCs fabricated using the rejuvenated PQDs is also largely improved.

         <title>In Situ Formation of 2D Perovskite Seeding for Record&#8208;Efficiency Indoor Perovskite Photovoltaic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the issue of efficiency loss due to increased cell size for indoor perovskite photovoltaics by developing an in situ pre&#8208;nucleation strategy is addressed. A trace amount of &#946;&#8208;alaninamide hydrochloride (AHC) is introduced into the perovskite precursor solution, which spontaneously reacts with PbI2 to form 2D perovskite seed crystals to facilitate 3D perovskite growth.








Abstract
With 40% efficiency under room light intensity, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) will be promising power supplies for low&#8208;light applications, particularly for Internet of Things (IoT) devices and indoor electronics, shall they become commercialized. Herein, &#946;&#8208;alaninamide hydrochloride (AHC) is utilized to spontaneously form a layer of 2D perovskite nucleation seeds for improved film uniformity, crystallization quality, and solar cell performance. It is found that the AHC addition indeed improves film quality as demonstrated by better uniformity, lower trap density, smaller lattice stress, and, as a result, a 10&#8208;fold increase in charge carrier lifetime. Consequently, not only does the small&#8208;area (0.09 cm2) PSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency of 42.12%, the large&#8208;area cells (1.00 cm2, and 2.56 cm2) attain efficiency as high as 40.93%, and 40.07% respectively. All of these are the highest efficiency values for indoor photovoltaic cells with similar sizes, and more importantly, they represent the smallest efficiency loss due to area scale&#8208;up. This work provides a new method to fabricate high&#8208;performance indoor PSCs (i&#8208;PSCs) for IoT devices with great potential in large&#8208;area printing technology.

         <title>A Practical Approach Toward Highly Reproducible and High&#8208;Quality Perovskite Films Based on an Aging Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quality and reproducibility of perovskite thin films are severely influenced by spin&#8208;coating parameters and annealing conditions. Here, a facile and cost&#8208;effective aging treatment is developed to improve film coverage and uniformity. The resulting devices achieve higher device performance reproducibility and impressive operational stability under both air and vacuum conditions.








Abstract
Solution processing of hybrid perovskite semiconductors is a highly promising approach for the fabrication of cost&#8208;effective electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, challenges with this approach lie in overcoming the controllability of the perovskite film morphology and the reproducibility of device efficiencies. Here, a facile and practical aging treatment (AT) strategy is reported to modulate the perovskite crystal growth to produce sufficiently high&#8208;quality perovskite thin films with improved homogeneity and full&#8208;coverage morphology. The resulting AT&#8208;films exhibit fewer defects, faster charge carrier transfer/extraction, and suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination compared with reference. The AT&#8208;devices achieve a noticeable improvement in the reproducibility, operational stability, and photovoltaic performance of devices, with the average efficiency increased by 16%. It also demonstrates the feasibility and scalability of AT strategy in optimizing the film morphology and device performance for other perovskite components including MAPbI3, (MAPbBr3)15(FAPbI3)85, and Cs0.05(MAPbBr3)0.17(FAPbI3)0.83. This method opens an effective avenue to improve the quality of perovskite films and photovoltaic devices in a scalable and reproducible manner.

         <title>Sampling the Materials Space for Conventional Superconducting Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large&#8208;scale, machine&#8208;learning&#8208;accelerated study of conventional superconducting materials is presented, wherein the transition temperatures of approximately 200 000 metallic compounds are evaluated, all of which are close to the convex hull of thermodynamic stability to maximize the probability of synthesizability. This work is complemented with a detailed examination of several interesting materials, including nitrides, hydrides, and intermetallic compounds.








Abstract
A large scale study of conventional superconducting materials using a machine&#8208;learning accelerated high&#8208;throughput workflow is performed, starting by creating a comprehensive dataset of around 7000 electron&#8211;phonon calculations performed with reasonable convergence parameters. This dataset is then used to train a robust machine learning model capable of predicting the electron&#8211;phonon and superconducting properties based on structural, compositional, and electronic ground&#8208;state properties. Using this machine, the transition temperatures (Tc) of approximately 200&#160;000 metallic compounds are evaluated, all of which are on the convex hull of thermodynamic stability (or close to it) to maximize the probability of synthesizability. Compounds predicted to have Tc values exceeding 5&#160;K are further validated using density&#8208;functional perturbation theory. As a result, 541 compounds with Tc values surpassing 10&#160;K, encompassing a variety of crystal structures and chemical compositions, are identified. This work is complemented with a detailed examination of several interesting materials, including nitrides, hydrides, and intermetallic compounds. Particularly noteworthy is LiMoN2, which is predicted to be superconducting in the stoichiometric trigonal phase, with a Tc exceeding 38&#160;K. LiMoN2 has previously been synthesized in this phase, further heightening its potential for practical&#160;applications.

         <title>Atomic Zincophilic Sites Regulating Microspace Electric Fields for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CoSA/C additive with strong Zn affinity can preferentially absorb on the Zn surface in which the curvature&#8208;adjusted absorption enables a self&#8208;adaptive distribution. Atomic zincophilic Co&#8208;N3 sites with strong charge polarization effect redistribute the microspace electric field and ion flux, thus guiding uniform Zn deposition. Moreover, the dynamic adsorption/desorption of CoSA/C upon plating/stripping guarantees a sustainable regulation.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn metal batteries are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their intrinsic advantages. However, Zn tends to deposit irregularly and forms dendrites driven by the uneven space electric field distribution near the Zn&#8208;electrolyte interphase. Herein it is demonstrated that trace addition of Co single atom anchored carbon (denoted as CoSA/C) in the electrolyte regulates the microspace electric field at the Zn&#8208;electrolyte interphase and unifies Zn deposition. Through preferential adsorption of CoSA/C on the Zn surface, the atomically dispersed Co&#8208;N3 with strong charge polarization effect can redistribute the local space electric field and regulate ion flux. Moreover, the dynamic adsorption/desorption of CoSA/C upon plating/stripping offers sustainable long&#8208;term regulation. Therefore, Zn||Zn symmetric cells with CoSA/C electrolyte additive deliver stable cycling up to 1600&#160;h (corresponding to a cumulative plated capacity of 8 Ah cm&#8722;2) at a high current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, demonstrating the sustainable feature of microspace electric field regulation at high current density and capacity.

         <title>Engineering A Boron&#8208;Rich Interphase with Nonflammable Electrolyte toward Stable Li||NCM811 Cells Under Elevated Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>

The generation of boron&#8208;rich CEI is proposed by selecting salts and solvents with reasonable HOMO levels, which can stabilize the NCM811 at both RT and high temperature by suppressing the degradation of particles and decreasing the consumption of electrolytes. Besides, it improves the flame&#8208;retardancy to decrease the safety risk of NCM811||Li battery.








Abstract
Despite the high energy of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode, it still suffers serious decay due to the continuous solvents decomposition and unstable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layers, especially under high temperatures. The intense exothermic reaction between delithiated NCM811 and flammable electrolyte, on the other hand, pushes the batteries to their safety limit. Herein, these two issues are tackled via engineering the electrolytes, that is, utilizing salts with higher HOMO levels and nonflammable solvents with lower HOMO levels, to reduce the massive decomposition of solvents and improve battery safety under elevated temperatures. Consequently, a thin and boron&#8208;rich CEI is generated, which effectively inhibited the side reactions, thus improving the cycling stability and safety. Deviated from the highly concentrated electrolytes which heavily relies on the usage of massive salts, the electrolyte recipe can introduce a robust inorganic&#8208;rich CEI but use much less salt (i.e., dilute electrolyte), and thus, offer an encouraging alternative toward practical applications. As such, the NCM811 cathode exhibits a high&#8208;capacity retention of 81.2% after 950 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C and 75% after 300 cycles at 55&#160;&#176;C. This work provides a universal electrolyte design strategy for designing stable and safe high&#8208;temperature electrolytes for the NCM811 cathode.

         <title>Covalently Functionalized Nanopores for Highly Selective Separation of Monovalent Ions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalized graphene nanopores exhibit distinct monovalent ions transport behaviors including transport&#8208;rectification and exquisite intercation or anion/cation selectivity through precise pore structure and surface functional groups regulation. These prominent performances not only strongly rely on the ultra&#8208;low permeability resistance of atomically thin graphene but also attribute to the synergistic effects of steric hindrance and electrostatic interactions.








Abstract
Biological ion channels possess prominent ion transport performances attributed to their critical chemical groups across the continuous nanoscale filters. However, it is still a challenge to imitate these sophisticated performances in artificial nanoscale systems. Herein, this work develops the strategy to fabricate functionalized graphene nanopores in pioneer based on the synergistic regulation of the pore size and chemical properties of atomically thin confined structure through decoupling etching combined with in situ covalent modification. The modified graphene nanopores possess asymmetric ion transport behaviors and efficient monovalent metal ions sieving (K+/Li+ selectivity &#8776;48.6). Meanwhile, it also allows preferential transport for cations, the resulting membranes exhibit a K+/Cl&#8722; selectivity of 76 and a H+/Cl&#8722; selectivity of 59.3. The synergistic effects of steric hindrance and electrostatic interactions imposing a higher energy barrier for Cl&#8722; or Li+ across nanopores lead to ultra&#8208;selective H+ or K+ transport. Further, the functionalized graphene nanopores generate a power density of 25.3&#160;W m&#8722;2 and a conversion efficiency of 33.9%, showing potential application prospects in energy conversion. The theoretical studies quantitatively match well with the experimental results. The feasible preparation of functionalized graphene nanopores paves the way toward direct investigation on ion transport mechanism and advanced design in devices.

         <title>Halide Perovskites&#8208;Based Diffusive Memristors for Artificial Mechano&#8208;Nociceptive System</title>

         <dc:description>
Schematic of threshold response in the MAPbI3:Ag&#8208;based artificial nociceptor neurons and threshold firing of output current. The mechano&#8208;nociceptive system, utilizing halide perovskites&#8208;based memristors with a force sensing resistor, demonstrates the capability to detect detrimental impacts through sensitization responses. Scaling up to a 5 &#215; 5 crossbar array, the artificial skin system achieves successful stereoscopic nociception of uneven impulses.








Abstract
Numerous efforts for emulating organ systems comprised of multiple functional units have driven substantial advancements in bio&#8208;realistic electronics and systems. The resistance change behavior observed in diffusive memristors shares similarities with the potential change in biological neurons. Here, the diffusive threshold switching phenomenon in Ag&#8208;incorporated organometallic halide perovskites is utilized to demonstrate the functions of afferent neurons. Halide perovskites&#8208;based diffusive memristors show a low threshold voltage of &#8776;0.2&#160;V with little variation, attributed to the facile migration of Ag ions uniformly dispersed within the halide matrix. Based on the reversible and reliable volatile threshold switching, the memristors successfully demonstrate fundamental nociceptive functions including threshold firing, relaxation, and sensitization. Furthermore, to replicate the biological mechano&#8208;nociceptive phenomenon at a system level, an artificial mechano&#8208;nociceptive system is built by integrating a diffusive memristor with a force&#8208;sensing resistor. The presented system is capable of detecting and discerning the detrimental impact caused by a heavy steel ball, effectively exhibiting the corresponding sensitization response. By further extending the single nociceptive system into a 5 &#215; 5 array, successful stereoscopic nociception of uneven impulses is achieved in the artificial skin system through array&#8208;scale sensitization. These results represent significant progress in the field of bio&#8208;inspired electronics and systems.

         <title>Inkjet Printed Photonic Cellulose Nanocrystal Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Patterned arrays of photonic cellulose nanocrystal microfilms are prepared by inkjet printing. By dispensing directly through an oil layer, the printing and drying processes can be decoupled, which avoids the coffee stain effect and enables complex arrays to be produced. By adjusting the formulation of each individual drop via overprinting and coalescence, a spectrum of colors can be printed on&#8208;demand.








Abstract
Naturally&#8208;sourced cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are elongated, birefringent nanoparticles that can undergo cholesteric self&#8208;assembly in water to produce vibrant, structurally colored films. As such, they are an ideal candidate for use as sustainable and cost&#8208;effective inks in the printing of scalable photonic coatings and bespoke patterns. However, the small volume and large surface area of a sessile CNC drop typically leads to rapid evaporation, resulting in microfilms with a coffee&#8208;stain&#8208;like morphology and very weak coloration. Here, it is demonstrated that inkjet printing of CNC drops directly through an immiscible oil layer can immediately inhibit water loss, resulting in reduced internal mass flows and greater time for cholesteric self&#8208;assembly. The color of each microfilm is determined by the initial composition of the drop, which can be tuned on&#8208;demand by exploiting the overprinting and coalescence of multiple smaller drops of different inks. This enables the production of multicolored patterns with complex optical behaviors, such as angle&#8208;dependent color and polarization&#8208;selective reflection. Finally, the array can be made responsive to stimuli (e.g., UV light, polar solvent) by the inclusion of a degradable additive. This suite of functional properties promotes inkjet&#8208;printed photonic CNC arrays for smart colorimetric labeling or optical anticounterfeiting applications.

         <title>Suppressing Bulk Strain and Surface O2 Release in Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes by Just Tuning the Li Content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coherent thin spinel&#8208;like structure is formed on the surface of lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides by controlling the Li content during the synthesis. The combined in situ XRD and atomic&#8208;scale imaging of the structural evolution reveal that the surface layer simultaneously suppresses the bulk strain accumulation and surface O2 release, resulting in outstanding electrochemical performance and structural stability.








Abstract
Layered oxides represent a prominent class of cathodes employed in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The structural degradation of layered cathodes causes capacity decay during cycling, which is generally induced by anisotropic lattice strain in the bulk of cathode particle and oxygen release at the surface. However, particularly in lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs) that undergo intense oxygen redox reactions, the challenge of simultaneously addressing bulk and surface issues through a singular modification technique remains arduous. Here a thin (1&#8208;nm) and coherent spinel&#8208;like phase is constructed on the surface of LLOs particle to suppress bulk strain and surface O2 release by just adjusting the amount of lithium source during synthesis. The spinel&#8208;like phase hinders the surface O2 release by accommodating O2 inside the surface layer, while the trapped O2 in the bulk impedes strain evolution by &#8776;70% at high voltages compared with unmodified LLOs. Consequently, the enhanced structural stability leads to an improved capacity retention of 97.6% and a high Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99.5% after 100 cycles at 0.1&#176;C. These findings provide profound mechanistic insights into the functioning of surface structure and offer guidance for synthesizing high&#8208;capacity cathodes with superior cyclability.

However, particularly in lithium-rich layered oxides (LLOs) that undergo intense oxygen redox reactions, the challenge of simultaneously addressing bulk and surface issues through a singular modification technique remains arduous. Here a thin (1-nm) and coherent spinel-like phase is constructed on the surface of LLOs particle to suppress bulk strain and surface O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release by just adjusting the amount of lithium source during synthesis. The spinel-like phase hinders the surface O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release by accommodating O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inside the surface layer, while the trapped O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the bulk impedes strain evolution by &#8776;70% at high voltages compared with unmodified LLOs. Consequently, the enhanced structural stability leads to an improved capacity retention of 97.6% and a high Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99.5% after 100 cycles at 0.1&#176;C. These findings provide profound mechanistic insights into the functioning of surface structure and offer guidance for synthesizing high-capacity cathodes with superior cyclability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Manipulating Surface Band Bending of III&#8208;Nitride Nanowires with Ambipolar Charge&#8208;Transfer Characteristics: A Pathway Toward Advanced Photoswitching Logic Gates and Encrypted Optical Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports a novel postepitaxy method: thickness&#8208;tunable carbon layer decoration to continuously manipulate the surface band bending of III&#8208;nitride semiconductors for the first time. Enabled by the accurate modulation of the thickness of carbon layers, a spectrally distinctive bipolar photoresponse with a controllable polarity&#8208;switching&#8208;point over a wide spectrum range can be achieved, further demonstrating reprogrammable photoswitching logic gates and secured image transmission system.








Abstract
The operational principle of semiconductor devices critically relies on the band structures that ultimately govern their charge&#8208;transfer characteristics. Indeed, the precise orchestration of band structure within semiconductor devices, notably at the semiconductor surface and corresponding interface, continues to pose a perennial conundrum. Herein, for the first time, this work reports a novel postepitaxy method: thickness&#8208;tunable carbon layer decoration to continuously manipulate the surface band bending of III&#8208;nitride semiconductors. Specifically, the surface band bending of p&#8208;type aluminum&#8208;gallium&#8208;nitride (p&#8208;AlGaN) nanowires grown on n&#8208;Si can be precisely controlled by depositing different carbon layers as guided by theoretical calculations, which eventually regulate the ambipolar charge&#8208;transfer behavior between the p&#8208;AlGaN/electrolyte and p&#8208;AlGaN/n&#8208;Si interface in an electrolyte environment. Enabled by the accurate modulation of the thickness of carbon layers, a spectrally distinctive bipolar photoresponse with a controllable polarity&#8208;switching&#8208;point over a wide spectrum range can be achieved, further demonstrating reprogrammable photoswitching logic gates &#8220;XOR&#8221;, &#8220;NAND&#8221;, &#8220;OR&#8221;, and &#8220;NOT&#8221; in a single device. Finally, this work constructs a secured image transmission system where the optical signals are encrypted through the &#8220;XOR&#8221; logic operations. The proposed continuous surface band tuning strategy provides an effective avenue for the development of multifunctional integrated&#8208;photonics systems implemented with nanophotonics.

         <title>Dynamically Adaptive Bubbling for Upgrading Oxygen Evolution Reaction Using Lamellar Fern&#8208;Like Alloy Aerogel Self&#8208;Standing Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a unique lamellar fern&#8208;like alloy aerogel (LFA) as a self&#8208;standing electrode, showing a unique dynamically adaptive bubbling capability and can effectively avoid stress concentration caused by bubble aggregation. LFA not only shows superior gas evacuation capability but also exhibits significantly improved stability at high current densities.








Abstract
Adopting renewable electricity to produce &#8220;green&#8221; hydrogen has been a critical challenge because at a high current density the mass transfer capability of most catalytic electrodes deteriorates significantly. Herein, a unique lamellar fern&#8208;like alloy aerogel (LFA) electrode, showing a unique dynamically adaptive bubbling capability and can effectively avoid stress concentration caused by bubble aggregation is reported. The LFA electrode is intrinsically highly catalytic&#8208;active and shows a highly porous, resilient, hierarchically ordered, and well&#8208;percolated conductive network. It not only shows superior gas evacuation capability but also exhibits significantly improved stability at high current densities, showing the record lowest oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 244&#160;mV at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and stably over 6000 h. With the merits of mechanical robustness, excellent electron transport, and efficient bubble evacuation, LFA can be self&#8208;standing catalytic electrode and&#160;gas diffusion layers in anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE), which can achieve 3000 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low voltage of 1.88&#160;V and can sustain stable electrolysis at 2000&#8201;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 1300 h. This strategy can be extended to various gas evolution reactions as a general design rule for multiphase catalysis applications.

         <title>Regulating Crystal Orientation via Ligand Anchoring Enables Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells and Tandems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystal orientation regulation strategy by introducing dodecyl&#8208;benzene&#8208;sulfonic&#8208;acid as an additive in perovskite precursors is proposed, which significantly promotes the desired (001) crystal orientation. Thus, opaque and semitransparent 1.66 eV bandgap methylamine&#8208;free perovskite solar cells realize efficiencies of 22.40% and 20.13%, respectively. Furthermore, four&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells deliver a remarkable efficiency of 28.06%.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells have attracted considerable interest for their potential applications in tandem solar cells. However, the predominant obstacles impeding their widespread adoption are substantial open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit and severe photo&#8208;induced halide segregation. To tackle these challenges, a crystal orientation regulation strategy by introducing dodecyl&#8208;benzene&#8208;sulfonic&#8208;acid as an additive in perovskite precursors is proposed. This method significantly promotes the desired crystal orientation, passivates defects, and mitigates photo&#8208;induced halide phase segregation in perovskite films, leading to substantially reduced nonradiative recombination, minimized VOC deficits, and enhanced operational stability of the devices. The resulting 1.66&#160;eV bandgap methylamine&#8208;free perovskite solar cells achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.40% (certified at 21.97%), with the smallest VOC deficit recorded at 0.39&#160;V. Furthermore, the fabricated semitransparent WBG devices exhibit a competitive PCE of 20.13%. Consequently, four&#8208;terminal tandem cells comprising WBG perovskite top cells and 1.25&#160;eV bandgap perovskite bottom cells showcase an impressive PCE of 28.06% (stabilized 27.92%), demonstrating great potential for efficient multijunction tandem solar cell applications.

         <title>Oligo(phenylenevinylene)&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Kagome Lattice for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two kagome (kgm)&#160;topologic oligo(phenylenevinylene)&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are rationally designed for boosting photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via a &#8220;two in one&#8221; strategy. COF&#8208;954 shows high and stable photocatalytic hydrogen production performance in water, 3% NaCl solution, and seawater. The water&#8208;drainage experiments also suggest the potential of COF&#8208;954 in the practical applications for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have shown great advantages as photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. However, the effect of linkage geometry and type of linkage on the extent of &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation in the plane of the framework and photocatalytic properties of COFs remains a significant challenge. Herein, two Kagome (kgm) topologic oligo(phenylenevinylene)&#8208;based COFs are designed and synthesized for boosting photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via a &#8220;two in one&#8221; strategy. Under visible light irradiation, COF&#8208;954 with 5 wt% Pt as cocatalyst exhibits high hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 137.23&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, outperforming most reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. More importantly, even in natural seawater, COF&#8208;954 shows an average HER of 191.70&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under ultraviolet&#8211;visible (UV&#8211;vis) light irradiation. Additionally, the water&#8208;drainage experiments indoors and outdoors demonstrate that 25 and 8&#160;mL hydrogen gas could be produced in 80 min under UV&#8211;vis light and natural sunlight, respectively, corresponding to a high HER of 167.41 and 53.57&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1. This work not only demonstrates an effective design strategy toward highly efficient COF&#8208;based photocatalysts, but also shows the great potential of using the COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

However, the effect of linkage geometry and type of linkage on the extent of &#960;-electron conjugation in the plane of the framework and photocatalytic properties of COFs remains a significant challenge. Herein, two Kagome (kgm) topologic oligo(phenylenevinylene)-based COFs are designed and synthesized for boosting photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via a &#8220;two in one&#8221; strategy. Under visible light irradiation, COF-954 with 5 wt% Pt as cocatalyst exhibits high hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 137.23&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, outperforming most reported COF-based photocatalysts. More importantly, even in natural seawater, COF-954 shows an average HER of 191.70&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under ultraviolet&#8211;visible (UV&#8211;vis) light irradiation. Additionally, the water-drainage experiments indoors and outdoors demonstrate that 25 and 8&#160;mL hydrogen gas could be produced in 80 min under UV&#8211;vis light and natural sunlight, respectively, corresponding to a high HER of 167.41 and 53.57&#160;mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work not only demonstrates an effective design strategy toward highly efficient COF-based photocatalysts, but also shows the great potential of using the COF-based photocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue Narrowband Hetero[6]helicenes Showing Circularly Polarized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Toward High&#8208;Performance OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A helical extension strategy is introduced to engineer deep&#8208;blue hetero[6]helicene&#8208;based emitters for circularly polarized OLEDs. Besides satisfactory chiroptical performance, this strategy endows the emitters with enhanced quantum yield and narrower emission bands compared to their precursor. The devices display record efficiencies, high color purity, and distinct circularly polarized electroluminescence, marking a significant advance in chiroptical materials for high&#8208;definition displays.








Abstract
Helicenes exhibit substantial potential as circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) active molecules. However, their application in circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) is typically hindered by the challenge of integrating both high color purity and efficient triplet&#8208;harvesting capability, particularly in the blue spectral region. Herein, a series of hetero[6]helicene&#8208;based emitters that is strategically engineered through the helical extension of a deep&#8208;blue double&#8208;boron&#8208;based multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) motif, is introduced. Importantly, the helical extension does not cause apparent structural deformation or perturb frontier molecular orbitals; thus, preserving the deep&#8208;blue emission and MR&#8208;TADF characteristics of the parent molecule. This approach also leads to reduced reorganization energy, resulting in emitters with narrower linewidth and higher photoluminescence quantum yield. Further, the helical motif enhances the racemization barrier and leads to improved CPL performance with luminescence dissymmetry factor values up to 1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3. Exploiting these merits, devices incorporating the chiral dopants demonstrate deep&#8208;blue emission within the Broadcast Service Television 2020 color&#8208;gamut range, record external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) up to 29.3%, and have distinctive circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) signals. Overall, the authors&#8217; findings underscore the helical extension as a promising strategy for designing narrowband chiroptical materials and advancing high&#8208;definition displays.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Nanolayer&#8208;Derived Zincophilicity Suppressing Metallic Zinc Dendrites and Its Efficacy in Improving Electrochemical Stability of Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
From the initial Zn deposition, a Zn&#8208;Au alloy grows from the Au&#8208;coating layer. This further results in smooth Zn deposition, which stabilizes long&#8208;term Zn stripping/plating without Zn dendrite via the &#8216;embracing effect&#8217;.








Abstract
Herein, an Au&#8208;coating layer adjusted on the surface of a Zn metal electrode that effectively suppresses the dendrite growth as well as the mechanisms underlying the dendrite suppression as a result of the zincophilic character of Au is introduced. For the Au&#8208;coated Zn metal symmetric cell, uniform deposition of Zn&#8208;derived compounds&#160;was revealed by operando synchrotron tomography. Microscopic studies demonstrate that the Au&#8208;coating layer is induced to form a new Zn&#8211;Au alloy during the initial Zn deposition, resulting in stabilized long&#8208;term stripping/plating of Zn via the &#8216;embracing effect&#8217; that intimately accommodates Zn deposition for further cycles. This property supports the successful operation of symmetrical cells up to 50 mA cm&#8722;2. According to Zn electrodeposition simulation, it is verified that the suppression of dendrite growth is responsible for the electro&#8208;conducting Au nanolayer that uniformly distributes the electric field and protects the Zn electrode from corrosion, ultimately promoting uniform Zn growth. The compatibility of the Au&#8208;coating layer for full cell configuration is verified using NaV3O8 as a cathode material over 1&#160;000 cycles. This finding provides a new pathway for the enhancement of the electrochemical performance of ZIBs by suppressing the dendritic growth of Zn by means of a zincophilic Au nanolayer.

         <title>Conjugated Polyelectrolyte Thin Films for Pseudocapacitive Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slow evaporation from a pure water solution provides high charging rate pseudocapacitive conjugated polyelectrolyte films that are stable in aqueous electrolytes. Key to stability is increased crystallinity and a high electrolyte concentration for decreasing interchain electrostatic repulsion. This strategy may be applied for integrating organic mixed ionic electronic conductors in applications such as batteries, organic electrochemical transistors, or electrochemical sensors.








Abstract
A subclass of organic semiconductors known as conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) is characterized by a conjugated backbone with ionic pendant groups. The water solubility of CPEs typically hinders applications of thin films in aqueous media. Herein, it is reported that films of an anionic CPE, namely CPE&#8208;K, drop cast from water produces single&#8208;component solid&#8208;state pseudocapacitive electrodes that are insoluble in aqueous electrolyte. That X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments reveal a more structurally ordered film, relative to the as&#8208;obtained powder from chemical synthesis, and dynamic light scattering measurements show an increase in aggregate particle size with increasing [KCl] indicate that CPE&#8208;K films are insoluble because of tight interchain contacts and electrostatic screening by the electrolyte. CPE&#8208;K film electrodes can maintain 85% of their original capacitance (84 F g&#8722;1) at 500 A g&#8722;1 and exhibit excellent cycling stability, where a capacitance retention of 93% after 100&#160;000 cycles at a current density of 35 A g&#8722;1. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to use initially water soluble ionic&#8208;organic materials in aqueous electrolytes, by increasing the electrolyte concentration. This strategy can be applied to the application of conjugated polyelectrolytes in batteries, organic electrochemical transistors, and electrochemical sensors, where fast electron and ion transport are required.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Surface&#8208;to&#8208;Bulk Modification of High&#8208;Voltage and Long&#8208;Life LiCoO2 Cathode with Concentration Gradient Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The essence of the currently proposed one&#8208;step multi&#8208;modification strategy for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode candidates&#160;lies in its &#8243;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8243; functionality, which systematically and comprehensively considers both the localized environment (e.g., TM&#9472;O bonding state, Li/Co migration pathway, TM&#8208;derived catalytic site for electrolyte decomposition) and the overall architecture (e.g., cathode/electrolyte interface reinforcement, gliding stacking faults reformation).








Abstract
Raising the charging cut&#8208;off voltage of layered oxide cathodes can improve their energy density. However, it inevitably introduces instabilities regarding both bulk structure and surface/interface. Herein, exploiting the unique characteristics of high&#8208;valence Nb5+ element, a synchronous surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk&#8208;modified LiCoO2 featuring Li3NbO4 surface coating layer, Nb&#8208;doped bulk, and the desired concentration gradient architecture through one&#8208;step calcination is achieved. Such a multifunctional structure facilitates the construction of high&#8208;quality cathode/electrolyte interface, enhances Li+ diffusion, and restrains lattice&#8208;O loss, Co migration, and associated layer&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase distortion. Therefore, a stable operation of Nb&#8208;modified LiCoO2 half&#8208;cell is achieved at 4.6&#160;V (90.9% capacity retention after 200 cycles). Long&#8208;life 250&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 4.7&#160;V&#8208;class 550&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 pouch cells assembled with graphite and thin Li anodes are harvested (both beyond 87% after 1600 and 200 cycles). This multifunctional one&#8208;step modification strategy establishes a technological paradigm to pave the way for high&#8208;energy density and long&#8208;life lithium&#8208;ion cathode materials.

Therefore, a stable operation of Nb-modified LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; half-cell is achieved at 4.6&#160;V (90.9% capacity retention after 200 cycles). Long-life 250&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 4.7&#160;V-class 550&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; pouch cells assembled with graphite and thin Li anodes are harvested (both beyond 87% after 1600 and 200 cycles). This multifunctional one-step modification strategy establishes a technological paradigm to pave the way for high-energy density and long-life lithium-ion cathode materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Designing Chemically Replaced Interfacial Layer via Unveiling the Influence of Zn Crystal Facets for Practical Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unveiling the effect of Zn crystal facets in Sn&#8208;based chemical replacement reaction (CRR), a Sn&#8208;based interfacial architecture (ZnTCF@Sn) via a novel two&#8208;step CRR is developed. Owing to its unique crystallographic (high zincophilicity and surface energy), morphological (abundant active sites and uniform current/Zn2+ flux), and compositional (suppressed side reactions of metallic Sn) merits, ZnTCF@Sn can approach a practical Zn&#8208;metal anode.








Abstract
Zn metal anodes (ZMAs) undergo irregular deposition and unfavorable side reactions, which hinders the practical application of aqueous rechargeable Zn metal batteries (ARZMBs). Chemical replacement reaction (CRR) strategies can achieve stable ZMAs, but the effect of the crystal facets of metallic Zn as reductants remains poorly understood. In this study, based on the observation that preferentially exposed Zn crystal facets affect the surface characteristics of chemically replaced layers in Sn&#8208;based CRR, a multifunctional Sn&#8208;based interfacial layer (ZnTCF@Sn) is designed on the Zn with textured crystal facets using a novel two&#8208;step CRR process. ZnTCF@Sn simultaneously provides abundant zincophilic sites and high surface energy and homogenizes the distribution of current/Zn2+ flux, resulting in fast electrochemical kinetics and dendrite&#8208;free deposition. Furthermore, the uniform Sn coverage on the ZnTCF@Sn surface inhibits side reactions and enhances reversibility during Zn deposition/dissolution. Thus, the ZnTCF@Sn achieves exceptional cyclability over 1200&#160;h even under harsh operating conditions with a cumulative capacity of 24 Ah cm&#8722;2. This study contributes to the development of practical ARZMBs by providing new insights into the effect of the Zn crystal facets on the surface modification of ZMAs through various CRRs.

         <title>Targeting DNA Damage and Repair Machinery via Delivering WEE1 Inhibitor and Platinum (IV) Prodrugs to Stimulate STING Pathway for Maximizing Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy in Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a glutathione&#8208;responsive nanoparticle loaded with cisplatin prodrug (Pt (IV)) and WEE1 inhibitor (MK1775), which can increase DNA damage, activate the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon gene (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway, and upregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression in tumor cells, ultimately enhancing chemo&#8208;immunotherapy for bladder cancer. Moreover, the nanoparticle elicits long&#8208;term immune responses in both primary and metastatic tumors when combined with &#945;PD&#8208;L1.








Abstract
Both cisplatin&#8208;based chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs)&#8208;based immunotherapy are the first&#8208;line treatments for patients with advanced bladder cancer. Cancer cells can develop resistance to cisplatin through extensive DNA repair, while a low response rate to ICBs is mostly due to the presence of an immunosuppressive microenvironment and low PD&#8208;L1 expression. Herein, a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive nanoparticle (NP2) loaded with cisplatin prodrug (Pt (IV)) and WEE1 inhibitor (MK1775) is designed. NP2 can be triggered by GSH in cancer cells, and the released MK1775 can inhibit the activity of WEE1 protein, which ultimately increases DNA damage by cisplatin. Genome&#8208;wide RNA sequencing first reveals that NP2 can inhibit DNA repair machinery by interfering with the cell cycle and significantly activate the stimulator of interferon genes pathway. Tumor growth is significantly inhibited by NP2 in vivo. As innate and adaptive immune responses are stimulated, the immunosuppressive microenvironment is modified, and the &#8220;immune cold tumor&#8221; is transformed into an &#8220;immune hot tumor". In addition, NP2 can upregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression in tumor cells, thereby increasing the response rate of PD&#8208;L1 monoclonal antibody (&#945;PD&#8208;L1) and eliciting long&#8208;term immune responses in both primary and metastatic tumors.

&lt;p&gt;Both cisplatin-based chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs)-based immunotherapy are the first-line treatments for patients with advanced bladder cancer.

         <title>Energy Band Engineering Guided Design of Bidirectional Catalyst for Reversible Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, the design of catalysts at the molecular or atomic level and understanding of the relationship between structure and performance are essential. Under the guidance of energy band engineering, a highly efficient catalyst is designed and shows obvious bidirectional effect for CO2 redox. This work offers new avenues for designing excellent electrocatalysts in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.








Abstract
Li&#8211;CO2 batteries arouse great interest in the context of carbon neutralization, but their practicability is severely hindered by the sluggish CO2 redox reaction kinetics at the cathode, which brings about formidable challenges such as high overpotential and low Coulombic efficiency. For the complex multi&#8208;electron transfer process, the design of catalysts at the molecular or atomic level and the understanding of the relationship between electron state and performance are essential for the CO2 redox. However, little attention is paid to it. In this work, using Co3S4 as a model system, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the adjusted d&#8208;band and p&#8208;band centers of Co3S4 with the introduction of Cu and sulfur vacancies are hybridized between CO2 and Li species, respectively, which is conducive to the adsorption of reactants and the decomposition of Li2CO3, and the experimental results further verify the effectiveness of energy band engineering. As a result, a highly efficient bidirectional catalyst is produced and shows an ultra&#8208;small voltage gap of 0.73&#160;V and marvelous Coulombic efficiency&#160;of 92.6%, surpassing those of previous catalysts under similar conditions. This work presents an effective catalyst design and affords new insight into the high&#8208;performance cathode catalyst materials for Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.

A new super fuel cell (SFC) with single&#8208;atomic Pt on hollow porous carbon nanorods catalyst has super&#8208;high output ability through two creations of &#8220;oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) + electric double&#8208;layer capacitance (EDLC)&#8221; parallel discharging and self&#8208;charging to overcome sluggish ORR process. The promising SFC offers a new pathway to boost the power density of FCs with extra&#8208;low Pt loading.








Abstract
Pursuing high power density with low platinum catalysts loading is a huge challenge for developing high&#8208;performance fuel cells (FCs). Herein, a new super fuel cell (SFC) is proposed with ultrahigh output power via specific electric double&#8208;layer capacitance (EDLC) + oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) parallel discharge, which is achieved using the newly prepared catalyst, single&#8208;atomic platinum on bimetallic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived hollow porous carbon nanorods (PtSA/HPCNR). The PtSA&#8208;1.74/HPCNR&#8208;based SFC has a 3.4&#8208;time higher transient specific power density and 13.3&#8208;time longer discharge time with unique in situ self&#8208;charge and energy storage ability than 20% Pt/C&#8208;based FCs. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure, aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscope, and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the synergistic effect of Pt single&#8208;atoms anchored on carbon defects significantly boosts its electron transfer, ORR catalytic activity, durability, and rate performance, realizing rapid &#8220; ORR+EDLC&#8221; parallel discharge mechanism to overcome the sluggish ORR process of traditional FCs. The promising SFC leads to a new pathway to boost the power density of FCs with extra&#8208;low Pt loading.

X-ray absorption fine structure, aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope, and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the synergistic effect of Pt single-atoms anchored on carbon defects significantly boosts its electron transfer, ORR catalytic activity, durability, and rate performance, realizing rapid &#8220; ORR+EDLC&#8221; parallel discharge mechanism to overcome the sluggish ORR process of traditional FCs. The promising SFC leads to a new pathway to boost the power density of FCs with extra-low Pt loading.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Reversibility Sulfur Anode for Advanced Aqueous Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8596;Na2S conversion is identified as a promising anodic reaction with low potential. The viability of S anode is established in S&#8211;I2 battery that uses a cost&#8208;effective and scalable sulfonated polysulfone membrane to mitigate &#8220;shuttle effects.&#8221; Compared to Zn anode, S anode avoids dendrite formation and hydrogen evolution, and it can withstand super&#8208;high utilization (100% vs &lt; 1% for Zn).








Abstract
Despite being extensively explored as cathodes in batteries, sulfur (S) can function as a low&#8208;potential anode by changing charge carriers in electrolytes. Here, a highly reversible S anode that fully converts from S80 to S2&#8722; in static aqueous S&#8211;I2 batteries by using Na+ as the charge carrier is reported. This S anode exhibits a low potential of &#8722;0.5&#160;V (vs standard hydrogen electrode) and a near&#8208;to&#8208;theoretical capacity of 1404&#160;mA h g&#8722;1. Importantly, it shows significant advantages over the widely used Zn anode in aqueous media by obviating dendrite formation and H2 evolution. To suppress &#8220;shuttle effects&#8221; faced by both S and I2 electrodes, a scalable sulfonated polysulfone (SPSF) membrane is proposed, which is superior to commercial Nafion in cost (US$1.82 m&#8722;2&#160;vs $3500 m&#8722;2) and environmental benignity. Because of its ultra&#8208;high selectivity in blocking polysulfides/iodides, the battery with SPSF displays excellent cycling stability. Even under 100% depth of discharge, the battery demonstrates high capacity retention of 87.6% over 500 cycles, outperforming Zn&#8211;I2 batteries with 3.1% capacity under the same conditions. These findings broaden anode options beyond metals for high&#8208;energy, low&#8208;cost, and fast&#8208;chargeable batteries.

         <title>Reinforcing the Electrode/Electrolyte Interphases of Lithium Metal Batteries Employing Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte based on trifluoromethoxybenzene cosolvent is proposed for lithium metal batteries with nickel&#8208;rich cathodes, through a comparative study of three fluorinated aromatic cosolvents. The generated solid electrolyte interphase rich in inorganic species on anodes and, particularly, a uniform cathode/electrolyte interphase rich in organic cation&#8208;derived species on cathodes enable stable cycling of Li/LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 cells.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with nickel&#8208;rich cathodes are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, but the lack of sufficiently protective electrode/electrolyte interphases (EEIs) limits their cyclability. Herein, trifluoromethoxybenzene is proposed as a cosolvent for locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes (LCILEs) to reinforce the EEIs. With a comparative study of a neat ionic liquid electrolyte (ILE) and three LCILEs employing fluorobenzene, trifluoromethylbenzene, or trifluoromethoxybenzene as cosolvents, it is revealed that the fluorinated groups tethered to the benzene ring of the cosolvents not only affect the electrolytes&#8217; ionic conductivity and fluidity, but also the EEIs&#8217; composition via adjusting the contribution of the 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cation (Emim+) and bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anion. Trifluoromethoxybenzene, as the optimal cosolvent, leads to a stable cycling of LMBs employing 5 mAh cm&#8722;2 lithium metal anodes (LMAs), 21&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05 (NCA) cathodes, and 4.2&#160;&#181;L mAh&#8722;1 electrolytes for 150 cycles with a remarkable capacity retention of 71%, thanks to a solid electrolyte interphase rich in inorganic species on LMAs and, particularly, a uniform cathode/electrolyte interphase rich in Emim+&#8208;derived species on NCA cathodes. By contrast, the capacity retention under the same condition is only 16%, 46%, and 18% for the neat ILE and the LCILEs based on fluorobenzene and benzotrifluoride, respectively.

         <title>All&#8208;Inorganic Polyoxometalates Act as Superchaotropic Membrane Carriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inorganic anions of the polyoxometalate type display a new biological activity: They efficiently transport cationic peptides across lipidic and cellular membranes. This function is related to their superchaotropic nature, resulting in strong and concomitant interactions with peptides and lipids. Mixed&#8208;metal Keggin&#8208;type anions show the required hydrolytic stability and sufficiently low charge density that are prerequisites for the desirable carrier utility.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are known antitumoral, antibacterial, antiviral, and anticancer agents and considered as next&#8208;generation metallodrugs. Herein, a new biological functionality in neutral physiological media, where selected mixed&#8208;metal POMs are sufficiently stable and able to affect membrane transport of impermeable, hydrophilic, and cationic peptides (heptaarginine, heptalysine, protamine, and polyarginine) is reported. The uptake is observed in both, model membranes as well as cells, and attributed to the superchaotropic properties of the polyoxoanions. In view of the structural diversity of POMs these findings pave the way toward their biomedical application in drug delivery or for cell&#8208;biological uptake studies with biological effector molecules or staining agents.

         <title>Recycled Tandem Catalysts Promising Ultralow Overpotential Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
One critical challenge&#160;of lithium&#8208;carbon dioxide (Li&#8208;CO2) batteries&#160;is to develop highly efficient and low&#8208;cost catalysts with precise structure. A tandem catalyst with an in&#8208;built electric field is elaborately recycled from the spent batteries and exhibits remarkable bidirectional activities. This work affords new opportunities to fabricate low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts and inspires fresh perceptions of interfacial regulation to engineer better Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;carbon dioxide (Li&#8208;CO2) batteries are regarded as a prospective technology to relieve the pressure of greenhouse emissions but are confronted with sluggish CO2 redox kinetics and low energy efficiency. Developing highly efficient and low&#8208;cost catalysts to boost bidirectional activities is craved but remains a huge challenge. Herein, derived from the spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries, a tandem catalyst is subtly synthesized and significantly accelerates the CO2 reduction and evolution reactions (CO2RR and CO2ER) kinetics with an in&#8208;built electric field (BEF). Combining with the theoretical calculations and advanced characterization techniques, this work reveals that the designed interface&#8208;induced BEF regulates the adsorption/decomposition of the intermediates during CO2RR and CO2ER, endowing the recycled tandem catalyst with excellent bidirectional activities. As a result, the spent electronics&#8208;derived tandem catalyst exhibits remarkable bidirectional catalytic performance, such as an ultralow voltage gap of 0.26&#160;V and an ultrahigh energy efficiency of 92.4%. Profoundly, this work affords new opportunities to fabricate low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts from recycled spent electronics and inspires fresh perceptions of interfacial regulation including but not limited to BEF to engineer better Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Thermochromic Photonic Crystal Paper with Integrated Multilayer Structure and Fast Thermal Response: A Waterproof and Mechanically Stable Material for Structural&#8208;Colored Thermal Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermochromic polyurethane/hydrophobic&#8208;SiO2 photonic crystal/paraffin (PU/HPO&#8208;SiO2&#8208;PC/Para) multilayer film is fabricated for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state and single&#8208;step thermal printing. The fast thermal response enables high&#8208;resolution and grayscale printing. The integrated and hydrophobic multilayer structure ensures good stability in daily liquids and enhances its mechanical stability for better user experience.








Abstract
Thermochromic photonic crystals are promising materials for thermal printing due to their unfaded colors under chemical/illuminated environments and the absence of toxic chemicals. However, the slow thermochromic response, the multistep printing procedures, the use of inks or developing liquids, and the requirement of expensive parts in printers limit their applications. Here, a thermochromic polyurethane/hydrophobic&#8208;SiO2 photonic crystal/paraffin (PU/HPO&#8208;SiO2&#8208;PC/Para)&#160;film with an integrated multilayer structure is fabricated for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state and single&#8208;step thermal printing that is fully compatible with commercial printers. The fast thermochromic response in milliseconds enables high&#8208;resolution and grayscale printing as the paraffin infiltration and the color change can be finely controlled in a microscale range. The integrated and hydrophobic multilayer structure renders the thermochromic film good stability in daily liquids, which addresses the long&#8208;existing concern of print fading. Meanwhile, the integrated multilayer structure also enhances the mechanical stability when it is deposited on fibrous paper so that people can fold, cut, or staple the thermal papers, and make notes confidently in practical usage.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Modulated Ionic Polymer as an Adaptable Electron Transport Material for Optically Switchable Pixel&#8208;Free Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adaptive photosensitive ionic polymer comprising photocrosslinkable moieties and electron transport moieties enables organic light&#8208;emitting devices to be switched by external optical direct writing and erasing. Independent solution&#8208;processed electron transport layer (ETL) using photo&#8208;modulated ionic polymer realizes the fabrication of optically switchable pixel&#8208;free displays (OSPFDs) with tunable illuminants and seamless imaging capability.








Abstract
In addition to electrically driven organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED)&#160;displays that rely on complicated and costly circuits for switching individual pixel illumination, developing a facile approach that structures pixel&#8208;free light&#8208;emitting displays with exceptional precision and spatial resolution via external photo&#8208;modulation holds significant importance for advancing consumer electronics. Here, optically switchable organic light&#8208;emitting pixel&#8208;free displays (OSPFDs) are presented and fabricated by judiciously combining an adaptive photosensitive ionic polymer as electron transport materials (ETM) with external photo&#8208;modulation as the switching mode while ensuring superior illumination performance and seamless imaging capability. By irradiating the solution&#8208;processed OSPFDs with light at specific wavelengths, efficient and reversible tuning of both electron transport and electroluminescence is achieved simultaneously. This remarkable control is achieved by altering the energetic matching within OSPFDs, which also exhibits a high level of universality and adjustable flexibility in the three primary color&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting displays. Moreover, the ease of creating and erasing desired pixel&#8208;free emitting patterns through a non&#8208;invasive photopatterning process within a single OSPFD is demonstrated, thereby rendering this approach promising for commercial displaying devices and highly precise pixelated illuminants.

         <title>Fabrication of Oriented Polycrystalline MOF Superstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have progressed beyond powdery and single&#8208;crystalline materials towards polycrystalline superstructures. A current challenge is&#160;the fabrication of superstructures with defined crystalline orientation to access anisotropic properties. This perspective examines methods for the fabrication of oriented MOF superstructures (colloidal assembly, external fields, heteroepitaxial ceramic&#8208;to&#8208;MOF, and other emerging methods), to promote the development of systems with oriented pore channels.








Abstract
The field of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) has progressed beyond the design and exploration of powdery and single&#8208;crystalline materials. A current challenge is the fabrication of organized superstructures that can harness the directional properties of the individual constituent MOF crystals. To date, the progress in the fabrication methods of polycrystalline MOF superstructures has led to close&#8208;packed structures with defined crystalline orientation. By controlling the crystalline orientation, the MOF pore channels of the constituent crystals can be aligned along specific directions: these systems possess anisotropic properties including enhanced diffusion along specific directions, preferential orientation of guest species, and protection of functional guests. In this perspective, we&#160;discuss the current status of MOF research in the fabrication of oriented polycrystalline superstructures focusing on the specific crystalline directions of orientation. Three methods are examined in detail: the assembly from colloidal MOF solutions, the use of external fields for the alignment of MOF particles, and the heteroepitaxial ceramic&#8208;to&#8208;MOF growth. This perspective aims at promoting the progress of this field of research and inspiring the development of new protocols for the preparation of MOF systems with oriented pore channels, to enable advanced MOF&#8208;based devices with anisotropic properties.

         <title>Amphoteric Ion Bridged Buried Interface for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphoteric organic salt, 4FPEAPSA, is applied as the buried interface bridged layer to induce large&#8208;grain perovskite film with uniform morphology. 4FPEAPSA treatment can facilitate the matchable energy level alignment at the perovskite buried interface, reducing defect recombination loss. Such a multi&#8208;functional bridged layer enables a high efficiency of 25.03% and preferable stability in the inverted perovskite solar cells (PerSCs).








Abstract
Synergistic morphology and defects management at the buried perovskite interface are challenging but crucial for the further improvement of inverted perovskite solar cells (PerSCs). Herein, an amphoteric organic salt, 2&#8208;(4&#8208;fluorophenyl)ethylammonium&#8208;4&#8208;methyl benzenesulfonate (4FPEAPSA), is designed to optimize the film morphology and energy level alignment at the perovskite buried interface. 4FPEAPSA treatment promotes the growth of a void&#8208;free, coarse&#8208;grained, and hydrophobic film by inducing the crystal orientation. Besides, the dual&#8208;functional 4FPEAPSA can chemically interact with the perovskite film, and passivate the defects of iodine and formamidine vacancies, tending to revert the fermi level of perovskite to its defect&#8208;free state. Meanwhile, the formation of a p&#8208;type doping buried interface can facilitate the interfacial charge extraction and transport of PerSCs for reduced carrier recombination loss. Consequently, 4FPEAPSA treatment improves the efficiency of the perovskite devices to 25.03% with better storage, heat, and humidity stability. This work contributes to strengthening the systematic understanding of the perovskite buried interface, providing a synergetic approach to realize precise morphology control, effective defect suppression, and energy level alignment for efficient PerSCs.

         <title>Selenophene Substitution Enabled High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;Type Polymeric Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors for Organic Electrochemical Transistors and Glucose Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With selenophene substitution, the resulting polymers demonstrate enhanced charge transport properties and improved ion&#8208;uptake capabilities, resulting in unprecedented performance for n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors. These advancements hold great promise for various biosensing applications, exemplified by the successful development of a highly sensitive glucose sensor.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymeric mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (PMIECs) are essential for realizing organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs)&#8208;based low&#8208;power complementary circuits and biosensors, but their development still remains a great challenge. Herein, by devising two novel n&#8208;type polymers (f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;SVSCN and f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN) containing varying selenophene contents together with their thiophene&#8208;based counterpart as the control, it is demonstrated that gradually increasing selenophene loading in polymer backbones can simultaneously yield lowered lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels, boosted charge&#8208;transport properties, and improved ion&#8208;uptake capabilities. Therefore, a remarkable volumetric capacitance (C*) of 387.2 F cm&#8722;3 and a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OECT electron mobility (&#181;e,OECT) of 0.48 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 are synchronously achieved for f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN having the highest selenophene content, yielding an unprecedented geometry&#8208;normalized transconductance (gm,norm) of 71.4 S cm&#8722;1 and record figure of merit (&#181;C*) value of 191.2 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for n&#8208;type OECTs. Thanks to such excellent performance of f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN&#8208;based OECTs, a glucose sensor with a remarkably low detection limit of 10&#160;nMm and decent selectivity is further implemented, demonstrating the power of selenophene substitution strategy in enabling high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type PMIECs for biosensing applications.

&lt;p&gt;High-performance n-type polymeric mixed ionic-electronic conductors (PMIECs) are essential for realizing organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs)-based low-power complementary circuits and biosensors, but their development still remains a great challenge. Herein, by devising two novel n-type polymers (f-BTI2g-SVSCN and f-BSeI2g-SVSCN) containing varying selenophene contents together with their thiophene-based counterpart as the control, it is demonstrated that gradually increasing selenophene loading in polymer backbones can simultaneously yield lowered lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels, boosted charge-transport properties, and improved ion-uptake capabilities. Therefore, a remarkable volumetric capacitance (&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;*) of 387.2 F cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; and a state-of-the-art OECT electron mobility (&lt;i&gt;&#181;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;e,OECT&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.48 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; are synchronously achieved for f-BSeI2g-SVSCN having the highest selenophene content, yielding an unprecedented geometry-normalized transconductance (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m,norm&lt;/sub&gt;) of 71.4 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and record figure of merit (&lt;i&gt;&#181;C&lt;/i&gt;*) value of 191.2 F cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for n-type OECTs. Thanks to such excellent performance of f-BSeI2g-SVSCN-based OECTs, a glucose sensor with a remarkably low detection limit of 10&#160;nM&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; and decent selectivity is further implemented, demonstrating the power of selenophene substitution strategy in enabling high-performance n-type PMIECs for biosensing applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unraveling the Coupling Effect between Cathode and Anode toward Practical Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Butler&#8211;Volmer equation fundamentally describes the relationship between electrode overpotential and local current densities. Inspired by the equation, a binary descriptor (IBD) is proposed to guide the design of sulfur cathodes. This descriptor can evaluate the influence of mass transport and charge transfer on reaction kinetics, and unravel the coupling effect between sulfur cathode and Li anode.








Abstract
The localized reaction heterogeneity of the sulfur cathode and the uneven Li deposition on the Li anode are intractable issues for lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries under practical operation. Despite impressive progress in separately optimizing the sulfur cathode or Li anode, a comprehensive understanding of the highly coupled relationship between the cathode and anode is still lacking. In this work, inspired by the Butler&#8211;Volmer equation, a binary descriptor (IBD) assisting the rational structural design of sulfur cathode by simultaneously considering the mass&#8208;transport index (Imass) and the charge&#8208;transfer index (Icharge) is identified, and subsequently the relationship between IBD and the morphological evolution of Li anode is established. Guided by the IBD, a scalable electrode providing interpenetrated flow channels for efficient mass/charge transfer, full utilization of active sulfur, and mechanically elastic support for aggressive electrochemical reactions under practical conditions is reported. These characteristics induce a homogenous distribution of local current densities and reduced reaction heterogeneity on both sides of the cathode and anode. Impressive energy density of 318&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 473&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 in an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell can be achieved by the design concept. This work offers a promising paradigm for unlocking the interaction between cathode and anode and designing high&#8208;energy practical Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>A Layered Bi2Te3@PPy Cathode for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries: Mechanism and Application in Printed Flexible Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors analyze the reaction mechanism of Bi2Te3&#8208;based cathode for zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) and demonstrate that, in the aqueous system, Zn2+ is not inserted into the cathode as previously assumed. In contrast, proton charge storage dominates the process. The authors also demonstrate the great application prospect of aqueous ZIBs in flexible electronics via jet printing technology.








Abstract
Low&#8208;cost, safe, and environmental&#8208;friendly rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising as next&#8208;generation energy storage devices for wearable electronics among other applications. However, sluggish ionic transport kinetics and the unstable electrode structure during ionic insertion/extraction hamper their deployment. Herein, a new cathode material based on a layered metal chalcogenide (LMC), bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3), coated with polypyrrole (PPy) is proposed. Taking advantage of the PPy coating, the Bi2Te3@PPy composite presents strong ionic absorption affinity, high oxidation resistance, and high structural stability. The ZIBs based on Bi2Te3@PPy cathodes exhibit high capacities and ultra&#8208;long lifespans of over 5000 cycles. They also present outstanding stability even under bending. In addition, here the reaction mechanism is analyzed using in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and computational tools and it is demonstrated that, in the aqueous system, Zn2+ is not inserted into the cathode as previously assumed. In contrast, proton charge storage dominates the process. Overall, this work not only shows the great potential of LMCs as ZIB cathode materials and the advantages of PPy coating, but also clarifies the charge/discharge mechanism in rechargeable ZIBs based on LMCs.

         <title>Regulating Phase Separation Kinetics for High&#8208;Efficiency and Mechanically Robust All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By synthesizing a random terpolymer PBDB&#8208;TFCl and combining a ternary blending strategy, favorable phase separation and reinforced molecular packing are obtained. Resulting flexible organic solar modules exhibit maximum power conversion efficiency of 12.7% and excellent mechanical properties and photostability.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) possess excellent operation stability and mechanical robustness than other types of organic solar cells, thereby attracting considerable attention for wearable flexible electron devices. However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all&#8208;PSCs are still lagging behind those of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based systems owing to the limitation of photoactive materials and unsatisfactory blend morphology. In this work, a novel terpolymer, denoted as PBDB&#8208;TFCl (poly4,8&#8208;bis(5&#8208;(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;4&#8208;fluorothiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8243;]dithiophene&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;5,7&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;4H,8H&#8208;benzo[1,2&#8208;c:4,5&#8208;c&#8243;]dithiophene&#8208;4,8&#8208;dione&#8208;4,8&#8208;bis(4&#8208;chloro&#8208;5&#8208;(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene), is used as an electron donor coupled with a ternary strategy to optimize the performance of all&#8208;PSCs. The addition of PBDB&#8208;TCl unit deepens the highest occupied molecular orbital energy level, reducing voltage losses. Moreover, the introduction of the guest donor (D18&#8208;Cl) effectively regulates the phase&#8208;transition kinetics of PBDB&#8208;TFCl:D18&#8208;Cl:PY&#8208;IT during the film formation, leading to ideal size of aggregations and enhanced crystallinity. PBDB&#8208;TFCl:D18&#8208;Cl:PY&#8208;IT devices exhibit a PCE of 18.6% (certified as 18.3%), judged as the highest value so far obtained with all&#8208;PSCs. Besides, based on the ternary active layer, the manufactured 36 cm2 flexible modules exhibit a PCE of 15.1%. Meanwhile, the ternary PSCs exhibit superior photostability and mechanical stability. In summary, the proposed strategy, based on molecular design and the ternary strategy, allows optimization of the all&#8208;polymer blend morphology and improvement of the photovoltaic performance for stable large&#8208;scale flexible PSCs.

         <title>How Photogenerated I2 Induces I&#8208;Rich Phase Formation in Lead Mixed Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photogenerated I2 in the mixed I&#8208;Br perovskite induces I&#8208;rich phase formation through a chemical chain reaction. The Br&#8722; binding strength in the perovskite regulates the chemical chain reaction and thus the I&#8208;rich phase formation. This study demonstrates the increasing of Br&#8208;binding strength and eliminating of defects leading to I2 photogeneration in the lattice to stabilize the mixed I&#8208;Br perovskite.








Abstract
Bandgap tunability of lead mixed halide perovskites (LMHPs) is a crucial characteristic for versatile optoelectronic applications. Nevertheless, LMHPs show the formation of iodide&#8208;rich (I&#8208;rich) phase under illumination, which destabilizes the semiconductor bandgap and impedes their exploitation. Here, it is shown that how I2, photogenerated upon charge carrier trapping at iodine interstitials in LMHPs, can promote the formation of I&#8208;rich phase. I2 can react with bromide (Br&#8722;) in the perovskite to form a trihalide ion I2Br&#8722; (I&#948;&#8722;&#8208;I&#948;+&#8208;Br&#948;&#8722;), whose negatively charged iodide (I&#948;&#8722;) can further exchange with another lattice Br&#8722; to form the I&#8208;rich phase. Importantly, it is observed that the effectiveness of the process is dependent on the overall stability of the crystalline perovskite structure. Therefore, the bandgap instability in LMHPs is governed by two factors, i.e., the density of native defects leading to I2 production and the Br&#8722; binding strength within the crystalline unit. Eventually, this study provides rules for the design of chemical composition in LMHPs to reach their full potential for optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Grain Engineering of Sb2S3 Thin Films to Enable Efficient Planar Solar Cells with High Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work achieves large&#8208;grained Sb2S3 films by incorporating Ce3+ into the precursor solution for hydrothermal deposition. The formation of ultrathin Ce2S3 at the CdS/Sb2S3 interface is proposed to mediate the nucleation and growth of Sb2S3 grains. Planar Sb2S3 solar cells are achieved with an open&#8208;circuit voltage&#160;close to 800 mV (the highest reported to date), along with competitive efficiencies up to 7.66%.








Abstract
Sb2S3 is a promising environmentally friendly semiconductor for high performance solar cells. But, like many other polycrystalline materials, Sb2S3 is limited by nonradiative recombination and carrier scattering by grain boundaries (GBs). This work shows how the GB density in Sb2S3 films can be significantly reduced from 1068&#160;&#177;&#160;40&#160;to 327&#160;&#177;&#160;23&#160;nm &#181;m&#8722;2 by incorporating an appropriate amount of Ce3+ into the precursor solution for Sb2S3 deposition. Through extensive characterization of structural, morphological, and optoelectronic properties, complemented with computations, it is revealed that a critical factor is the formation of an ultrathin Ce2S3 layer at the CdS/Sb2S3 interface, which can reduce the interfacial energy and increase the adhesion work between Sb2S3 and the substrate to encourage heterogeneous nucleation of Sb2S3, as well as promote lateral grain growth. Through reductions in nonradiative recombination at GBs and/or the CdS/Sb2S3 heterointerface, as well as improved charge&#8208;carrier transport properties at the heterojunction, this work achieves high performance Sb2S3 solar cells with a power conversion efficiency reaching 7.66%. An impressive open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 796&#160;mV is achieved, which is the highest reported thus far for Sb2S3 solar cells. This work provides a strategy to simultaneously regulate the nucleation and growth of Sb2S3 absorber films for enhanced device performance.

         <title>Spontaneous Vortex&#8208;Antivortex Pairs and Their Topological Transitions in a Chiral&#8208;Lattice Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging field of quantum computing, which relies on multiple electronic states, has recently garnered significant attention. Here, the on&#8208;demand creation of multiple states in a helimagnet Fe0.5Co0.5Ge, including (anti)merons with N&#160;=&#160;&#177;1/2, bimerons, and skyrmions with N&#160;=&#160;&#8722;1 is presented. The transformations among these states through the application of magnetic fields and electric currents are demonstrated.








Abstract
The spontaneous formation and topological transitions of vortex&#8208;antivortex pairs have implications for a broad range of emergent phenomena, for example, from superconductivity to quantum computing. Unlike magnets exhibiting collinear spin textures, helimagnets with noncollinear spin textures provide unique opportunities to manipulate topological forms such as (anti)merons and (anti)skyrmions. However, it is challenging to achieve multiple topological states and their interconversion in a single helimagnet due to the topological protection for each state. Here, the on&#8208;demand creation of multiple topological states in a helimagnet Fe0.5Co0.5Ge, including a spontaneous vortex pair of meron with topological charge N&#160;=&#160;&#8722;1/2 and antimeron with N&#160;=&#160;1/2, and a vortex&#8208;antivortex bundle, that is, a bimeron (meron pair) with N&#160;=&#160;&#8722;1 is reported. The mutual transformation between skyrmions and bimerons with respect to the competitive effects of magnetic field and magnetic shape anisotropy is demonstrated. It is shown that electric currents drive the individual bimerons to form their connecting assembly and then into a skyrmion lattice. These findings signify the feasibility of designing topological states and offer new insights into the manipulation of noncollinear spin textures for potential applications in various fields.

         <title>3D Printed Cellulose Nanofiber Aerogel Scaffold with Hierarchical Porous Structures for Fast Solar&#8208;Driven Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cellulose nanofiber&#8208;based bilayer scaffold for atmospheric water harvesting has been developed through 3D printing combined with freeze&#8208;drying, which introduces both a&#160;millimeter&#8208;sized grid structure for water sorption and evaporation enhancement, and a micrometer&#8208;sized pore structure for lithium chloride confinement. Benefiting from the milli/micrometer pore structures, the scaffold shows an excellent water sorption/release performance and good cyclic stability.








Abstract
Hygroscopic salt&#8208;based composite sorbents are considered ideal candidates for solar&#8208;driven atmospheric water harvesting. The primary challenge for the sorbents lies in exposing more hygroscopically active sites to the surrounding air while preventing salt leakage. Herein, a hierarchically structured scaffold is constructed by integrating cellulose nanofiber and lithium chloride (LiCl) as building blocks through 3D printing combined with freeze&#8208;drying. The milli/micrometer multiscale pores can effectively confine LiCl and simultaneously provide a more exposed active area for water sorption and release, accelerating both water sorption and evaporation kinetics of the 3D printed structure. Compared to a conventional freeze&#8208;dried aerogel, the 3D printed scaffold exhibits a water sorption rate that is increased 1.6&#8208;fold, along with a more than 2.4&#8208;fold greater water release rate. An array of bilayer scaffolds is demonstrated, which can produce 0.63&#160;g g&#8722;1 day&#8722;1 of water outdoors under natural sunlight. This article provides a sustainable strategy for collecting freshwater from the atmosphere.

Compared to a conventional freeze-dried aerogel, the 3D printed scaffold exhibits a water sorption rate that is increased 1.6-fold, along with a more than 2.4-fold greater water release rate. An array of bilayer scaffolds is demonstrated, which can produce 0.63&#160;g g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; day&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of water outdoors under natural sunlight. This article provides a sustainable strategy for collecting freshwater from the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Orderly Nanodendritic Nickel Substitute for Raney Nickel Catalyst Improving Alkali Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>

Orderly dendritic nickel catalyst enables more effective charge/mass transport for high current density hydrogen evolution and promises an alternative to commercial Raney nickel in alkaline water electrolyzers.








Abstract
The development of nonprecious metal catalysts to meet the activity&#8208;stability balance at industrial&#8208;grade large current densities remains a challenge toward practical alkali&#8208;water electrolysis. Here, this work develops an orderly nanodendritic nickel (ND&#8208;Ni) catalyst that consists of ultrafine nanograins in chain&#8208;like&#160;conformation, which shows both excellent activity and robust stability for large current density hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media, superior to currently applied Raney nickel (R&#8208;Ni) catalyst in commercial alkali&#8208;water electrolyzer (AWE). The ND&#8208;Ni catalyst featured by a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) interconnecting microporous structure endows with high specific surface area and excellent conductivity and hydrophilicity, which together afford superior charge/mass transport favorable to HER kinetics at high current densities. An actual AWE with ND&#8208;Ni catalyst demonstrates durable water splitting with 1.0&#8201;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.71&#160;V under industrial conditions and renders a record&#8208;low power consumption of 3.95&#160;kW h Nm&#8722;3 with an energy efficiency close to 90%. The hydrogen price per gallon of gasoline equivalent (GGE) is calculated to be &#8776;$0.95, which is less than the target of $2.0 per GGE by 2026 from the U.S. Department of Energy. The results suggest the feasibility of ND&#8208;Ni substitute for R&#8208;Ni catalyst in commercial AWE.

         <title>Electrochemically and Thermally Stable Inorganics&#8211;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Robust Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An F&#8208;/N&#8208;containing inorganics&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase is constructed, which is electrochemically and thermally stable during the long&#8208;term cycles and safety abuse conditions. More than 6 times longer cycles compared with routine cells are achieved in 1.0 Ah pouch&#8208;type cells. The onset and triggering temperatures during the thermal runaway are increased from 70.8 and 117.4 to 100.6 and 153.1&#160;&#176;C, respectively.








Abstract
Severe dendrite growth and high&#8208;level activity of the lithium metal anode lead to a short life span and poor safety, seriously hindering the practical applications of lithium metal batteries. With a trisalt electrolyte design, an F&#8208;/N&#8208;containing inorganics&#8211;rich solid electrolyte interphase on a lithium anode is constructed, which is electrochemically and thermally stable over long&#8208;term cycles and safety abuse conditions. As a result, its Coulombic efficiency can be maintained over&#160;98.98% for 400 cycles. An 85.0% capacity can be retained for coin&#8208;type full cells with a 3.14 mAh cm&#8722;2 LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode after 200 cycles and 1.0 Ah pouch&#8208;type full cells with a 4.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 cathode after 72 cycles. During the thermal runaway tests of a cycled 1.0 Ah pouch cell, the onset and triggering temperatures&#160;were increased from 70.8 &#176;C&#160;and 117.4 &#176;C&#160;to 100.6 &#176;C&#160;and 153.1&#160;&#176;C, respectively, indicating a greatly enhanced safety performance. This work gives&#160;novel insights into electrolyte and interface design, potentially paving the way for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, long&#8208;life&#8208;span, and thermally safe lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Manipulating Electron Redistribution in Ni2P for Enhanced Alkaline Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv is successfully synthesized through manipulation of electron redistribution in Ni2P addressed by cation doping and vacancy engineering. Bifunctional Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv achieves the industrially required high current densities at low voltages for overall seawater splitting at 60 &#176;C in 6.0&#160;m KOH seawater. In Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv, P vacancies greatly improve the electrical conductivity, and Ni sites are the dominant oxygen evolution reaction active centers; meanwhile Fe atoms as active centers for the HER, synergistically improve electrocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Developing bifunctional electrocatalyst for seawater splitting remains a persistent challenge. Herein, an approach is proposed through density functional theory (DFT) preanalysis to manipulate electron redistribution in Ni2P addressed by cation doping and vacancy engineering. The needle&#8208;like Fe&#8208;doped Ni2P with P vacancy (Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv) is successfully synthesized on nickel foam, exhibiting a superior bifunctional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity for seawater electrolysis in alkaline condition. As a result, bifunctional Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv achieves the industrially required current densities of 1.0 and 3.0 A cm&#8722;2 at low voltages of 1.68 and 1.73&#160;V, respectively, for seawater splitting at 60 &#176;C in 6.0&#160;m KOH circumstances. The theoretical calculation and the experimental results collectively reveal the reasons for the enhancement of catalyst activity. Specifically, Fe doping and P vacancies can accelerate the reconstruction of OER active species and optimize the hydrogen adsorption free energy (&#916;GH*) for HER. In addition, the active sites of Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv are identified, where P vacancies greatly improve the electrical conductivity and Ni sites are the dominant OER active centers, meanwhile Fe atoms as active centers for the HER. The study provides a deep insight into the exploration for the enhancement of activity of nickel&#8208;based phosphide catalysts and the identification of their real active centers.

Oxygen Evolution Reaction
In article number 2307925, Cheng Yang and co&#8208;workers develop a unique lamellar fern&#8208;like aerogel electrode, showing dynamically adaptive bubbling capability, which can effectively avoid stress concentration caused by bubble aggregation. Such a method features potentially major advances in nanostructured electrodes for high&#8208;performance alkaline hydrolysis membrane electrodes under industrial
working conditions.

Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries
Chemically replaced interfacial layer design, via unveiling the influence of zinc (Zn) crystal facets for aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries, is introduced by Dong&#8208;Wan Kim and co&#8208;workers in article number 2308684. Owing to the unique crystallographic (high zincophilicity and surface energy), morphological (abundant active sites and uniform current/Zn2+ flux), and compositional (suppressed side&#8208;reactions of metallic Sn) merits of the chemically replaced layer, uniform dendrite&#8208;free Zn(002)&#8208;preferred Zn deposition is guided and unfavorable side&#8208;reactions are suppressed. A superior performance even under practical operating conditions is thereby achieved.

Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries
In article number 2305128, Qing Sun, Shang Wang, Yanhong Tian, Andreu Cabot, and co&#8208;workers report an investigation of the energy&#8208;storage mechanism of a layered Bi2Te3&#8208;based cathode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). They demonstrate that the zinc ion is not inserted into the cathode as previously assumed; in contrast, proton charge&#8208;storage dominates the process. They also demonstrate the great application prospects of aqueous ZIBs in flexible electronics via jet printing technology.

Zinc Anodes
In article number 2307219, Huanlei Wang, Jingyi Wu, Guihua Yu, and co&#8208;workers report Co single atoms as an electrolyte additive to facilitate dendrite&#8208;free zinc anodes. The additive can be preferentially adsorbed on the zinc surface in which the atomically dispersed zincophilic active site with strong charge polarization effect regulates the microspace electric field at the Zn&#8211;electrolyte interphase, thus promoting uniform zinc deposition.

Graphene Nanopores
In article number 2307242, Liping Guo, Luda Wang, and co&#8208;workers report functionalized graphene nanopores that exhibit distinct monovalent&#8208;ion transport behaviors including exquisite intercation or anion/cation selectivity. These prominent performances not only strongly rely on the ultralow permeability resistance of atomically thin graphene, but they also are attributed to the synergistic effects of steric hindrance and electrostatic interactions.

Atmospheric Water Harvesting
In article number 2306653, Wenshuai Chen, Gang Chen, Feng Jiang, and co&#8208;workers report a hierarchically structured cellulose nanofiber/lithium chloride scaffold through 3D printing combined with freeze&#8208;drying methods for solar&#8208;driven atmospheric water harvesting. The milli&#8208;/micrometer multiscale pores provide more exposed active area with the surrounding air, thus accelerating both water sorption and evaporation kinetics of the 3D&#8208;printed structure.

         <title>Liquid Metal Actuators: A Comparative Analysis of Surface Tension Controlled Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the operation and design principles of surface tension&#8208;controlled actuation by liquid metals and discusses their performance and functionalities. Theoretical pathways toward higher performances, thanks to the unique scaling law of surface tension, are analyzed and compared to other popular soft actuators. The review concludes by offering a roadmap for future research&#160;directions.








Abstract
Liquid metals, with their unique combination of electrical and mechanical properties, offer great opportunities for actuation based on surface tension modulation. Thanks to the scaling laws of surface tension, which can be electrochemically controlled at low voltages, liquid metal actuators stand out from other soft actuators for their remarkable characteristics such as high contractile strain rates and higher work densities at smaller length scales. This review summarizes the principles of liquid metal actuators and discusses their performance as well as theoretical pathways toward higher performances. The objective is to provide a comparative analysis of the ongoing development of liquid metal actuators. The design principles of the liquid metal actuators are analyzed, including low&#8208;level elemental principles (kinematics and electrochemistry), mid&#8208;level structural principles (reversibility, integrity, and scalability), and high&#8208;level functionalities. A wide range of practical use cases of liquid metal actuators from robotic locomotion and object manipulation to logic and computation is reviewed. From an energy perspective, strategies are compared for coupling the liquid metal actuators with an energy source toward fully untethered robots. The review concludes by offering a roadmap of future research directions of liquid metal actuators.

         <title>Coplanar Conformational Structure of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coplanar conformational segment of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer is a unique structure with a rigid backbone, long effective conjugated length, and narrow bandgap, which may enhance emission behavior, strengthen &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, and improve charge transport. This overview mainly reports the recent development of coplanar conformational structure of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers. The characteristics, analysis methods, preparation, and their optoelectronic application are introduced and summarized systematically.








Abstract
Hierarchical structure of conjugated polymers is critical to dominating their optoelectronic properties and applications. Compared to nonplanar conformational segments, coplanar conformational segments of conjugated polymers (CPs) demonstrate favorable properties for applications as a semiconductor. Herein, recent developments in the coplanar conformational structure of CPs for optoelectronic devices are summarized. First, this review comprehensively summarizes the unique properties of planar conformational structures. Second, the characteristics of the coplanar conformation in terms of optoelectrical properties and other polymer physics characteristics are emphasized. Five primary characterization methods for investigating the complanate backbone structures are illustrated, providing a systematical toolbox for studying this specific conformation. Third, internal and external conditions for inducing the coplanar conformational structure are presented, offering guidelines for designing this conformation. Fourth, the optoelectronic applications of this segment, such as light&#8208;emitting diodes, solar cells, and field&#8208;effect transistors, are briefly summarized. Finally, a conclusion and outlook for the coplanar conformational segment regarding molecular design and applications are provided.

         <title>3D Motion Manipulation for Micro&#8208; and Nanomachines: Progress and Future Directions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into the latest progress made in micro&#8208; and nanomachines (MNMs) with three&#8208;dimensional (3D) motion capabilities by different manipulation approaches, discusses the underlying motion mechanisms and their corresponding applications, explores potential design concepts inspired by nature for guiding the future design direction in controllable 3D motile MNMs, and presents the available 3D observation and tracking systems.








Abstract
In the past decade, micro&#8208; and nanomachines (MNMs) have made outstanding achievements in the fields of targeted drug delivery, tumor therapy, microsurgery, biological detection, and environmental monitoring and remediation. Researchers have made significant efforts to accelerate the rapid development of MNMs capable of moving through fluids by means of different energy sources (chemical reactions, ultrasound, light, electricity, magnetism, heat, or their combinations). However, the motion of MNMs is primarily investigated in confined two&#8208;dimensional (2D) horizontal setups. Furthermore, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) motion control remains challenging, especially for vertical movement and control, significantly limiting its potential applications in cargo transportation, environmental remediation, and biotherapy. Hence, an urgent need is to develop MNMs that can overcome self&#8208;gravity and controllably move in 3D spaces. This review delves into the latest progress made in MNMs with 3D motion capabilities under different manipulation approaches, discusses the underlying motion mechanisms, explores potential design concepts inspired by nature for controllable 3D motion in MNMs, and presents the available 3D observation and tracking systems.

         <title>Bistable Spin&#8208;Crossover Nanoparticles for Molecular Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;crossover materials showing bistability are very attractive for fabricating molecular electronic devices. Departing from chemical design, this paper reports on how the miniaturization as nanoparticles and their integration into various architectures, in particular combining them with two&#8208;dimensional materials,&#160;provides a suitable approach to prepare robust and resilient devices for electrically sensing spin transitions.








Abstract
The field of spin&#8208;crossover complexes is rapidly evolving from the study of the spin transition phenomenon to its exploitation in molecular electronics. Such spin transition is gradual in a single&#8208;molecule, while in bulk it can be abrupt, showing sometimes thermal hysteresis and thus a memory effect. A convenient way to keep this bistability while reducing the size of the spin&#8208;crossover material is to process it as nanoparticles (NPs). Here, the most recent advances in the chemical design of these NPs and their integration into electronic devices, paying particular attention to optimizing the switching ratio are reviewed. Then, integrating spin&#8208;crossover NPs over 2D materials is focused to improve the endurance, performance, and detection of the spin state in these hybrid devices.

         <title>Inorganic All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries: Electrolyte Designing and Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes various inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (such as oxide&#8208;based, NASICON&#8208;type, sulfide&#8208;based, etc.) for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries. Their crystal structures, and modification strategies to enhance ionic conductivity are discussed. Additionally, methods for modifying the interfaces between solid electrolytes and cathodes/anodes, and optimizing full battery performance are explored. Lastly, the future development directions of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries are proposed.








Abstract
Inorganic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries (IASSSBs) are emerged as promising candidates to replace commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems due to their potential advantages, such as abundant raw materials, robust safety, low price, high&#8208;energy density, favorable reliability and stability. Inorganic sodium solid electrolytes (ISSEs) are an indispensable component of IASSSBs, gaining significant attention. Herein, this review begins by discussing the fundamentals of ISSEs, including their ionic conductivity, mechanical property, chemical and electrochemical stabilities. It then presents the crystal structures of advanced ISSEs (e.g., &#946;/&#946;''&#8208;alumina, NASICON, sulfides, complex hydride and halide electrolytes) and the related issues, along with corresponding modification strategies. The review also outlines effective approaches for forming intimate interfaces between ISSEs and working electrodes. Finally, current challenges and critical perspectives for the potential developments and possible directions to improve interfacial contacts for future practical applications of ISSEs are highlighted. This comprehensive review aims to advance the understanding and development of next&#8208;generation rechargeable IASSSBs.

         <title>Leveraging Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles for Combination Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have been widely used in tumor treatment. Through modification, SPNs can encapsulate or conjugate with various types of immune modulators. This review summarizes the recent progress of SPNs&#8208;based combination cancer immunotherapy and highlights the synergetic effect that amplifies the anti&#8208;tumor immune response.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy has become a promising method for cancer treatment, bringing hope to advanced cancer patients. However, immune&#8208;related adverse events caused by immunotherapy also bring heavy burden to patients. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as an emerging nanomaterial with high biocompatibility, can eliminate tumors and induce tumor immunogenic cell death through different therapeutic modalities, including photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and sonodynamic therapy. In addition, SPNs can work as a functional nanocarrier to synergize with a variety of immunomodulators to amplify anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. In this review, SPNs&#8208;based combination cancer immunotherapy is comprehensively summarized according to the SPNs&#8217; therapeutic modalities and the type of loaded immunomodulators. The in&#8208;depth understanding of existing SPNs&#8208;based therapeutic modalities will hopefully inspire the design of more novel nanomaterials with potent anti&#8208;tumor immune effects, and ultimately promote their clinical translation.

         <title>Wearable and Implantable Cortisol&#8208;Sensing Electronics for Stress Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable and implantable device can be placed on the body to continuously monitor the status of the subject. Cortisol, a hormone released in response to stress, varies in concentration among individuals and its fluctuations are not consistent. In this review, recent research that utilizes continuous measurements to analyze the dynamic stress response is examined.








Abstract
Cortisol is a steroid hormone that is released from the body in response to stress. Although a moderate level of cortisol secretion can help the body maintain homeostasis, excessive secretion can cause various diseases, such as depression and anxiety. Conventional methods for cortisol measurement undergo procedures that limit continuous monitoring, typically collecting samples of bodily fluids, followed by separate analysis in a laboratory setting that takes several hours. Thus, recent studies demonstrate wearable, miniaturized sensors integrated with electronic modules that enable wireless real&#8208;time analysis. Here, the primary focus is on wearable and implantable electronic devices that continuously measure cortisol concentration. Diverse types of cortisol&#8208;sensing techniques, such as antibody&#8208;, DNA&#8208;aptamer&#8208;, and molecularly imprinted polymer&#8208;based sensors, as well as wearable and implantable devices that aim to continuously monitor cortisol in a minimally invasive fashion are discussed. In addition to the cortisol monitors that directly measure stress levels, other schemes that indirectly measure stress, such as electrophysiological signals and sweat are also summarized. Finally, the challenges and future directions in stress monitoring and management electronics are reviewed.

         <title>Material Breakthroughs in Smart Food Monitoring: Intelligent Packaging and On&#8208;Site Testing Technologies for Spoilage and Contamination Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper comprehensively reviews material breakthroughs in in situ and on&#8208;site food monitoring. Base material substrates are discussed, both with regards to their intrinsic material properties and their contributions within recently reported sensing platforms. Biogenic amine, pH, and pathogen monitoring are all examined. Finally, a situational assessment and anticipated future directions are outlined.








Abstract
Despite extensive commercial and regulatory interventions, food spoilage and contamination continue to impose massive ramifications on human health and the global economy. Recognizing that such issues will be significantly eliminated by the accurate and timely monitoring of food quality markers, smart food sensors have garnered significant interest as platforms for both real&#8208;time, in&#8208;package food monitoring and on&#8208;site commercial testing. In both cases, the sensitivity, stability, and efficiency of the developed sensors are largely informed by underlying material design, driving focus toward the creation of advanced materials optimized for such applications. Herein, a comprehensive review of emerging intelligent materials and sensors developed in this space is provided, through the lens of three key food quality markers &#8211; biogenic amines, pH, and pathogenic microbes. Each sensing platform is presented with targeted consideration toward the contributions of the underlying metallic or polymeric substrate to the sensing mechanism and detection performance. Further, the real&#8208;world applicability of presented works is considered with respect to their capabilities, regulatory adherence, and commercial potential. Finally, a situational assessment of the current state of intelligent food monitoring technologies is provided, discussing material&#8208;centric strategies to address their existing limitations, regulatory concerns, and commercial considerations.

         <title>Review of Carbon Support Coordination Environments for Single Metal Atom Electrocatalysts (SACS)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon support single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are widely investigated in numerous electrocatalytic systems due to their high selectivity and activity from size effects and unique metal&#8208;support interactions. This review summarizes the recent progress on carbon&#8208;supported SACs in key electrocatalytic systems from the perspective of their coordination environment regulations that greatly affect the electrocatalytic activity and electrocatalytic selectivity.








Abstract
This topical review focuses on the distinct role of carbon support coordination environment of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for electrocatalysis. The article begins with an overview of atomic coordination configurations in SACs, including a discussion of the advanced characterization techniques and simulation used for understanding the active sites. A summary of key electrocatalysis applications is then provided. These processes are oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The review then shifts to modulation of the metal atom&#8208;carbon coordination environments, focusing on nitrogen and other non&#8208;metal coordination through modulation at the first coordination shell and modulation in the second and higher coordination shells. Representative case studies are provided, starting with the classic four&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single metal atom (M&#63743;N4) based SACs. Bimetallic coordination models including homo&#8208;paired and hetero&#8208;paired active sites are also discussed, being categorized as emerging approaches. The theme of the discussions is the correlation between synthesis methods for selective doping, the carbon structure&#8211;electron configuration changes associated with the doping, the analytical techniques used to ascertain these changes, and the resultant electrocatalysis performance. Critical unanswered questions as well as promising underexplored research directions are identified.

         <title>J&#8208;Aggregation Strategy toward Potentiated NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Bioimaging of Molecular Fluorophores</title>

         <dc:description>
This review emphatically concentrates on the detailed summary of strategic design and comprehensive overview of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) J&#8208;aggregated scaffolds for perfecting and extending the NIR&#8208;II imaging window. By overviewing the nowadays research advances, this review paves the way for constructing bright NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregated emitters to promote bioimaging applications.








Abstract
Molecular fluorophores emitting in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700 nm) window with strong optical harvesting and high quantum yields hold great potential for in vivo deep&#8208;tissue bioimaging and high&#8208;resolution biosensing. Recently, J&#8208;aggregates are harnessed to engineer long&#8208;wavelength NIR&#8208;II emitters and show unique superiority in tumor detection, vessel mapping, surgical navigation, and phototheranostics due to their bathochromic&#8208;shifted optical bands in the required slip&#8208;stacked arrangement aggregation state. However, despite the preliminary progress of NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates and theoretical study of structure&#8208;property relationships, further paradigms of NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates remain scarce due to the lack of study on aggregated fluorophores with slip&#8208;stacked fashion. In this effort, how to utilize the specific molecular structure to form slip&#8208;stacked packing motifs with J&#8208;type aggregated exciton coupling is emphatically elucidated. First, several molecular regulating strategies to achieve NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates containing intermolecular interactions and external conditions are positively summarized and deeply analyzed. Then, the recent reports on J&#8208;aggregates for NIR&#8208;II bioimaging and theranostics are systematically summarized to provide a clear reference and direction for promoting the development of NIR&#8208;II organic fluorophores. Eventually, the prospective efforts on ameliorating and promoting NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates to further clinical practices are outlined.

         <title>2D Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Liquid&#8208;Phase Molecular Separations: State of the Field, Common Pitfalls, and Future Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D covalent organic framework (COF) membranes are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation molecular sieves due to their uniform, tunable pores, but inconsistent characterization practices are currently leading this subfield astray. This review identifies common characterization pitfalls in existing 2D COF membrane literature and establishes rigorous protocols for assigning membrane structures and molecular transport mechanisms to direct the field toward achieving its long&#8208;term promise.








Abstract
2D covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) are attractive candidates for next&#8208;generation membranes due to their robust linkages and uniform, tunable pores. Many publications have claimed to achieve selective molecular transport through COF pores, but reported performance metrics for similar networks vary dramatically, and in several cases the reported experiments are inadequate to support such conclusions. These issues require a reevaluation of the literature. Published examples of 2D COF membranes for liquid&#8208;phase separations can be broadly divided into two categories, each with common performance characteristics: polycrystalline COF films (most &gt;1&#160;&#181;m thick) and weakly crystalline or amorphous films (most &lt;500&#160;nm thick). Neither category has demonstrated consistent relationships between the designed COF pore structure and separation performance, suggesting that these imperfect materials do not sieve molecules through uniform pores. In this perspective, rigorous practices for evaluating COF membrane structures and separation performance are described, which will facilitate their development toward molecularly precise membranes capable of performing previously unrealized chemical separations. In the absence of this more rigorous standard of proof, reports of COF&#8208;based membranes should be treated with skepticism. As methods to control 2D polymerization improve, precise 2D polymer membranes may exhibit exquisite and energy efficient performance relevant for contemporary separation challenges.

         <title>Wearable Sensors for Breath Monitoring Based on Water&#8208;based Hexagonal Boron Nitride Inks Made with Supramolecular Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Wearable humidity sensors are attracting strong attention as they allow to continuously monitor in real time important physiological information by enabling activity tracking as well as air quality assessment. Amongst 2&#8208;Dimensional (2D) materials, Graphene Oxide (GO) is very attractive for humidity sensing due to its tuneable surface chemistry, high surface area, processability in water and easy integration onto flexible substrates. However, large hysteresis, low sensitivity and strong cross&#8208;sensitivity issues limit the use of GO in practical applications, where continuous monitoring is preferred. Herein, we demonstrate a wearable and wireless impedance&#8208;based humidity sensor made with pyrene&#8208;functionalized hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) nanosheets, which shows enhanced sensitivity towards relative humidity, RH (&gt;1010 Ohms/%RH in the range from 5% to 100%RH), fast response (0.1&#160;ms), no appreciable hysteresis and cross&#8208;sensitivity in the range of 25&#8211;60&#176;C. We finally demonstrate that the h&#8208;BN based sensor is able to monitor the whole breathing cycle process of exhaling and inhaling, hence enabling to record in real time the subtlest changes of respiratory signals associated with different daily activities as well as various symptoms of flu, without requiring any direct contact with the individual.

         <title>Important Role of Ion Flux Regulated by Separators in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Polyolefin separators are the most common separators used in rechargeable lithium (Li)&#8208;ion batteries. However, the influence of different polyolefin separators on the performance of Li metal batteries (LMBs) has not been well studied. By performing particle injection simulations on the reconstructed three&#8208;dimensional pores of different polyolefin separators, it was revealed that the pore structure of the separator had a significant impact on the ion flux distribution, the Li deposition behavior and consequently, the cycle life of LMBs. It was also discovered that the homogeneity factor of Li ion toward Li metal electrode was positively correlated to the longevity and reproducibility of LMBs. This work not only emphasizes the importance of pore structure of polyolefin separators, but also provides an economic and effective method to screen favorable separators for LMBs.

         <title>Observation of a Photonic Orbital Gauge Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Gauge field is widely studied in natural and artificial materials. With an effective magnetic field for uncharged particles, many intriguing phenomena have been observed in several systems like photonic Floquet topological insulator. However, previous researches about the gauge field mostly focus on limited dimensions such as the Dirac spinor in graphene materials. Here, we firstly propose and experimentally observe an orbital gauge field based on photonic triangular lattices. Disclination defects with Frank angle &#937;${\bf \Omega}$ created on such lattices breaks the original lattice symmetry and generates purely geometric gauge field operating on orbital basis functions. Interestingly, it is found that bound states near zero energy with the orbital angular momentum l=2$l=2$ are intensively confined at the disclination as gradually expanding &#937;${\bf \Omega}$. Moreover, the introduction of a vector potential field breaks the time&#8208;reversal symmetry of the orbital gauge field, experimentally manifested by the chiral transmission of light on helical waveguides. The orbital gauge field further suggests fantastic applications of manipulating the vortex light in photonic integrated&#160;devices.

         <title>Probing the Strain Direction&#8208;Dependent Nonmonotonic Optical Bandgap Modulation of Layered Violet Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recent theoretical investigations have well predicted strain&#8208;induced nonmonotonic optical band gap variations in low&#8208;dimensional materials. However, few 2D materials have been experimentally confirmed to exhibit nonmonotonic optical band gap variation under the varying strain. Here, we observe a strain&#8208;induced nonmonotonic optical bandgap variation in violet phosphorus nanosheets, as evidenced by photoluminescence spectroscopy, which has been reported in few other 2D materials in our knowledge. The optical bandgap variations are characterized to show the modulation rates of 41 meV/% and &#8208;24 meV/% with compression and tensile strains, respectively. Remarkably, first&#8208;principle calculations predict and clarify the nonmonotonic modulation accurately, highlighting its relationship with the strain direction&#8208;dependent asymmetric distribution of conduction band minimum wavefunctions, demonstrating that this unique nonmonotonic optical bandgap modulation is determined by the distinctive crystal structure of VP. This work provides a deep insight into the design of 2D materials towards optoelectronic and photoelectrochemical applications via strain engineering.

However, few 2D materials have been experimentally confirmed to exhibit nonmonotonic optical band gap variation under the varying strain. Here, we observe a strain-induced nonmonotonic optical bandgap variation in violet phosphorus nanosheets, as evidenced by photoluminescence spectroscopy, which has been reported in few other 2D materials in our knowledge. The optical bandgap variations are characterized to show the modulation rates of 41 meV/% and -24 meV/% with compression and tensile strains, respectively. Remarkably, first-principle calculations predict and clarify the nonmonotonic modulation accurately, highlighting its relationship with the strain direction-dependent asymmetric distribution of conduction band minimum wavefunctions, demonstrating that this unique nonmonotonic optical bandgap modulation is determined by the distinctive crystal structure of VP. This work provides a deep insight into the design of 2D materials towards optoelectronic and photoelectrochemical applications via strain engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Nanotechnology profoundly affects the advancement of medicine. Limitations in diagnosing and treating cancer and chronic diseases promote the growth of nanomedicine. However, there are few analytical and descriptive studies regarding the trajectory of nanomedicine, key research powers, present research landscape, focal investigative points, and future outlooks. Herein, articles and reviews published in the Science Citation Index Expanded of Web of Science Core Collection from 1st January 2000 to 18th July 2023 are analyzed. Herein, a bibliometric visualization of publication trends, countries/regions, institutions, journals, research categories, themes, references, and keywords is produced and elaborated. Nanomedicine&#8208;related academic output is increasing in since the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, solidifying the uneven global distribution of research performance. While China leads in terms of publication quantity and has numerous highly productive institutions, the USA has advantages in academic impact, commercialization, and industrial value. Nanomedicine integrates with other disciplines, establishing interdisciplinary platforms, in which drug delivery and nanoparticles remain focal points. Current research focuses on integrating nanomedicine and cell ferroptosis induction in cancer immunotherapy. The keyword &#8220;burst testing&#8221; identifies promising research directions, including immunogenic cell death, chemodynamic therapy, tumor microenvironment, immunotherapy, and extracellular vesicles. The prospects, major challenges, and barriers to addressing these directions are discussed.
