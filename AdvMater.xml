         <title>Strongly Correlated Exciton&#8208;Magnetization System for Optical Spin Pumping in CrBr3 and CrI3.</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ferromagnetism in van der Waals systems, preserved down to a monolayer limit, attracted attention to a class of materials with general composition CrX3 (X=I, Br, Cl), which are treated now as canonical two&#8208;dimensional ferromagnets. Their diverse magnetic properties, such as different easy axes or varying and controllable character of in&#8208;plane or interlayer ferromagnetic coupling, make them promising candidates for spintronic, photonic, optoelectronic, and other applications. Still, significantly different magneto&#8208;optical properties between the three materials, have been presenting a challenging puzzle for researchers over the last few years. Herewith, we&#160;demonstrate that despite similar structural and magnetic configurations, the coupling between excitons and magnetization is qualitatively different in CrBr3 and CrI3 films. Through a combination of the optical spin pumping experiments with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art theory describing bound excitonic states in the presence of magnetization, we&#160;concluded that the hole&#8208;magnetization coupling has the opposite sign in CrBr3 and CrI3 and also between the ground and excited exciton state. Consequently, we&#160;demonstrate efficient spin pumping capabilities in CrBr3 driven by magnetization via spin&#8208;dependent absorption and unraveled the different origins of the magnetic hysteresis in CrBr3 and CrI3.

         <title>Concerted redox&#8208; and light&#8208;activated agent for controlled multimodal therapy against hypoxic cancer cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Hypoxia represents a remarkably exploitable target for cancer therapy as it is encountered only in solid human tumors and is highly associated with cancer resistance and recurrence. Here we report a hypoxia&#8208;activated mitochondrial&#8208;accumulated Ru(II) polypyridyl prodrug functionalized with conjugated azo (Az) and nitrogen mustard (NM) functionalities, RuAzNM. This prodrug has multimodal theranostic properties towards hypoxic cancer cells. Reduction of the azo group in hypoxic cell microenvironments gives rise to the generation of two primary amine products, a free aniline mustard, and the polypyridyl RuNH2 complex. Thus, aniline mustard triggers ROS generation and mtDNA crosslinking. Meanwhile, the resultant biologically&#8208;benign phosphorescent RuNH2 gives rise to a diagnostic signal and signals activation of the phototherapy. This multimodal therapeutic effect eventually elevates ROS levels, depletes NADH and ATP, and induces mitochondrial membrane damage, mtDNA damage, and ultimately cell apoptosis. This unique strategy allows controlled multimodal theranostics to be realized in hypoxic cells and multicellular spheroids, making RuAzNM a highly selective and effective cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;selective theranostic agent (IC50 = 2.3&#160;&#956;M for hypoxic HepG2 cancer cells versus 58.2&#160;&#956;M for normoxic THL&#8208;3 normal cells). This is the first report of a metal&#8208;based compound developed as a multimodal theranostic agent for hypoxia.

         <title>Prioritizing Hetero&#8208;Metallic Interfaces via Thermodynamics Inertia and Kinetics Zincophilia Metrics for Tough Zn&#8208;based Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Poor thermodynamic stability and sluggish electrochemical kinetics of metallic Zn anode in aqueous solution greatly hamper its practical application. To solve such problems, to date, various zincophilic surface modification strategies have been developed, which can facilitate reversible Zn plating/stripping behavior. However, there is still a lack of systematic and fundamental understanding regarding the metrics of thermodynamics inertia and kinetics zincophilia in selecting zincophilic sites. Herein, w e prioritize hetero&#8208;metallic interfaces for the first time via optimizing different hetero metals (Fe, Co, Ni, Sn, Bi, Cu, Zn, etc.) and synthetic solvents (ethanol, ethylene glycol, n&#8208;propanol, etc.). Specifically, both theoretical simulations and experimental results suggest that this Bi@Zn interface can exhibit high efficiency owing to the thermodynamics inertia and kinetics zincophilia. A best practice for prioritizing zincophilic sites in a more practical metric is also proposed. As a proof of concept, the Bi@Zn anode delivers ultralow overpotential of ca. 55&#160;mV at a high rate of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and stable cycle life over 4700 cycles. The elaborated &#8220;thermodynamics inertia and kinetics metalphilia&#8221; metrics for hetero&#8208;metallic interfaces could benchmark the success of other metal&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Multivalent Nanobody Conjugate with Rigid, Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenging Scaffold for Multi&#8208;Target Therapy of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Efficient therapeutic strategies that concurrently target both A&#946; aggregation and oxidative stress in the AD microenvironment emerge as a cutting&#8208;edge tool to combat the intricate pathogenesis of AD. Here we develop a multivalent nanobody conjugate with rigid, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging scaffold to achieve simultaneous A&#946; amyloidogenesis mitigation, ROS elimination, and A&#946; plaque clearance. Grafting A&#946; segment (33&#8208;GLMVGGVVIA&#8208;42) into the third complementary&#8208;determining region of a parent nanobody generates an engineered nanobody NB that can recognize A&#946; and inhibit its aggregation through homotypic interactions. NB is further genetically modified with a fragment of human interleukin&#8208;1&#946; (163&#8208;VQGEESNDK&#8208;171), so that the obtained fusion nanobody NBIL can also facilitate the A&#946; clearance by microglia. Linking NBIL covalently onto a rigid, ROS scavenging scaffold poly(deca&#8208;4,6&#8208;diynedioic acid) (PDDA) creates the multivalent nanobody conjugate PNBIL, which not only boosts the binding affinity between NBIL and A&#946; aggregates for nearly 100 times but also possesses a long&#8208;term capability of oxidative stress alleviation, inflammation reduction, and neuron protection. PNBIL has significantly attenuated symptoms on two AD mouse models through amyloidogenesis inhibition and AD microenvironment modulation, validating that our multivalent nanobody conjugate design based on combinatory nanobody and molecular engineering is a promising approach of multi&#8208;target therapeutic strategies.

         <title>Tetramode Metamaterials as Phonon Polarizers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In classical Cauchy elasticity, three&#8208;dimensional materials exhibit six eigenmodes of deformation. Following the 1995 work of Milton and Cherkaev, extremal elastic materials can be classified by the number of eigenmodes, N, out of these six that are &#8220;easy&#8221;. Using Greek number words, this leads to hexamode (N&#8197; = &#8197;6), pentamode (N&#8197; = &#8197;5), tetramode (N&#8197; = &#8197;4), trimode (N&#8197; = &#8197;3), dimode (N&#8197; = &#8197;2), and monomode (N&#8197; = &#8197;1) materials. While hexamode materials are unstable in all regards, the possibility of pentamode metamaterials (&#8220;meta&#8208;fluids&#8221;) has attracted considerable attention throughout the last decade. Here, inspired by the 2021 theoretical work of Wei, Liu, and Hu, microstructured three&#8208;dimensional polymer&#8208;based tetramode metamaterials are designed and characterized by numerical band&#8208;structure calculations, fabricated by laser printing, characterized by ultrasound experiments, and compared to the theoretical ideal. An application in terms of a compact and broadband polarizer for acoustical phonons at ultrasound frequencies is demonstrated.

         <title>Elastomers Grow into Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elastomer that can grow automatically and finally becomes a soft actuator is presented. The whole process does not need energy input or external stimuli other than a single pre&#8208;stretch. The growth can output mechanical work. The material has an uncommon liquid crystal phase. The formation of soft actuators is associated with a usually unnoticed reaction.








Abstract
It is common knowledge that when an elastomer (rubber) is stretched, its length will be&#160;maintained if its two ends are fixed. Here, it is serendipitously found that when&#160;an elastomer is&#160;slowly elongated further to achieve buckling under such conditions, the final length is much longer than the pre&#8208;stretched length. This allows the design&#160;of untethered autonomous synthetic&#8208;material&#8208;based soft robots that do not need any other chemical or electrical energy sources or external stimuli after the pre&#8208;strain is installed. Once the growth starts, the elongation continues to proceed even when the applied force is removed. Moreover, the elastomer, after growing, eventually forms a robust soft actuator that can be reshaped for different purposes. Few synthetic materials can grow like this, so far. This investigation shows that the material has an uncommon liquid crystal phase. Contrary to normal liquid crystals, it becomes birefringent only at high temperatures. The formation and the reshaping of the resulting soft actuators relate to a usually unnoticed reversible reaction. The work is promising to promote further understanding of dynamic covalent chemistry and liquid crystal elastomers, as well as to foster new designs and high&#8208;impact applications of bioinspired sustainable soft actuators in areas other than soft robots.

         <title>Colloid Electrolyte with Changed Li+ Solvation Structure for High&#8208;Power, Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel colloid electrolyte constructs a weak Li+ solvation environment by introducing lithium thiocarbonate colloids to coordinate with solvents and anions competitively. Thus, the Li+ conductivity, desolvation process, and configuration of the&#160;cathode electrolyte interface are optimized. The enhanced interfacial Li+ transfer kinetics endow lithium&#8208;ion batteries with excellent fast charging/discharging capability and long lifespan at room and low temperatures.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries currently suffer from low capacity and fast degradation under fast charging and/or low temperatures. In&#160;this&#160;work, a colloid liquid electrolyte (CLE) is designed, where the trace amount of lithium thiocarbonate (LTC) colloids in commercial carbonate electrolyte (1&#160;m LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate) not only boosts up &#963;Li+ but also improves the Li+ transfer kinetics at LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA) cathode/electrolyte interface. The competitive coordination of LTCs with anions and solvents facilitates the dissociation of lithium salts and Li+ decoupling, dramatically enhancing the &#963;Li+ (15 to 4.5 mS cm&#8722;1 at 30 and &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, respectively); meanwhile, the desolvation process is accelerated. It demonstrates that LTC colloids induce an&#160;&#8776;5&#160;nm ultrathin Li2CO3&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interface&#160;and infuse the grain boundary of NCA particles, enhancing interfacial Li+ transfer and inhibiting the particle cracks during cycling. Consequently, the Li||CLE||NCA battery delivers a maximum capacity of 135 mAh g&#8722;1 at a 10 C rate with 80% retention after 2000 cycles. Moreover, the fast&#8208;charging capability under a sub&#8208;zero environment is proved (122 mAh g&#8722;1 with 90% retention after 400 cycles at 2 C and &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C). This strategy for tailoring the interfacial charge transfer appears generalizable and can practically be extended to next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Mott&#8208;Insulator&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Phase Transition in Ultrathin Intermediate&#8208;Spin Ferromagnetic Perovskite Ruthenates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A&#160;photocarrier&#8208;doping&#8208;induced reversible Mott&#8208;insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal phase transition is realized by means of UV&#8208;light irradiation in a few atomic layers of intermediate&#8208;spin ferromagnetic SrRuO3&#8722;&#948;. Dynamical mean&#8208;field theory calculations further verify such photoinduced electronic phase transformation,&#160;owing to oxygen vacancies and orbital reconstruction. Therefore, a new intermediate&#8208;spin ferromagnetic metallic metastable phase of perovskite ruthenate is demonstrated.








Abstract
Light control of emergent quantum phenomena is a widely used external stimulus for quantum materials. Generally, perovskite strontium ruthenate SrRuO3 has an itinerant ferromagnetism with a low&#8208;spin state. However, the phase of intermediate&#8208;spin (IS) ferromagnetic metallic state has never been seen. Here, by means of UV&#8208;light irradiation, a photocarrier&#8208;doping&#8208;induced Mott&#8208;insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal phase transition is shown in a few atomic layers of perovskite IS ferromagnetic SrRuO3&#8722;&#948;. This new metastable IS metallic phase can be reversibly regulated due to the convenient photocharge transfer from SrTiO3 substrates to SrRuO3&#8722;&#948; ultrathin films. These dynamical mean&#8208;field theory calculations further verify such photoinduced electronic phase transformation, owing to oxygen vacancies and orbital reconstruction. The optical manipulation of charge&#8208;transfer finesse is an alternative pathway toward discovering novel metastable phases in strongly correlated systems and facilitates potential light&#8208;controlled device applications in optoelectronics and spintronics.

         <title>Interface Modulation of Metal Sulfide Anodes for Long&#8208;Cycle&#8208;Life Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new capacity fading mechanism of metal sulfide electrode materials is discovered, that is, the parasitic reaction between electrolyte anions and metal sulfides. Herein, a universal strategy is proposed to manipulate the electrolyte decomposition and construct a stable and ion&#8208;conductive solid electrolyte interphase that prevents the corrosive side reactions and leads to prolonged cycle life.








Abstract
Although studies of transition metal sulfides (TMS) as anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries are extensively reported, the short cycle life is still a thorny problem that impedes their practical application. In this work, a new capacity fading mechanism of the TMS electrodes is demonstrated; that is, the parasitic reaction between electrolyte anions (i.e., ClO4&#8722;) and metal sulfides yields non&#8208;conductive and unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and meanwhile, corrosively turns metal sulfides into less&#8208;active oxides. This knowledge guides the development of an electrochemical strategy to manipulate the anion decomposition and construct a stable interface that prevents extensive parasitic reactions. It is shown that introducing sodium nitrate to the electrolyte radically changes the Na+ solvation structure by populating nitrate ions in the first solvation sheath, generating a stable and conductive SEI layer containing both Na3N and NaF. The optimized interface enables an iron sulfide anode to stably cycle for over 2000 cycles with negligible capacity loss, and a similar enhancement in cycle performance is demonstrated on a number of other metal sulfides. This work discloses metal sulfides&#8217; cycling failure mechanism from a unique perspective and highlights the critical importance of manipulating the interface chemistry in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Membrane Protein Modification Modulates Big and Small Extracellular Vesicle Biodistribution and Tumorigenic Potential in Breast Cancers In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Big and small extracellular vesicles circulate differentially and confer tumorigenic function modulatable by extracellular vesicle (EV) membrane proteins. Malignant breast cancers release more big EVs, in addition to small EVs, than normal cells to target organs and individually promote tumor growth via tumor&#8208;progression&#8208;associated EV surface membrane proteins.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Big and small extracellular vesicles circulate differentially and confer tumorigenic function modulatable by extracellular vesicle (EV) membrane proteins. Malignant breast cancers release more big EVs, in addition to small EVs, than normal cells to target organs and individually promote tumor growth via tumor-progression-associated EV surface membrane proteins.

         <title>Pollen&#8208;Inspired Shell&#8211;Core Aerosol Particles Capable of Brownian Motion for Pulmonary Vascularization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by pollen in nature, novel shell&#8211;core aerosol particles capable of Brownian motion and immune evasion are constructed for respiratory administration. The aerosol particles disperse into the alveolar cavity by Brownian motion, implant in the alveolar interstitium by immune evasion, and activate angiogenic sprouting via the HIF&#8208;1 pathway, thus promoting bronchopulmonary development.








Abstract
Nebulization is the most widely used respiratory delivery technique with non&#8208;invasive properties. However, nebulized drugs often fail to function due to the excretion and immune clearance of the respiratory system. In&#160;this&#160;work, inspired by pollen in nature, novel shell&#8211;core aerosol particles (APs) capable of Brownian motion are constructed for respiratory delivery. Drugs&#8208;loaded poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) nanoparticles are prepared by emulsification to form the inner core, and the membranes of macrophages are extracted to form the outer shell. The optimized size and the shell&#8211;core structure endow APs with Brownian motion and atomization stability, thus enabling the APs to reach the bronchi and alveoli deeply for effective deposition. Camouflaging the&#160;macrophage membranes equips the APs with immune evasion. In vitro experiments prove that deferoxamine (DFO)&#8208;loaded APs (DFO@APs) can promote the angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. A hyperoxia&#8208;induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) model is constructed to validate the efficiency of DFO@APs. In BPD mice, DFO@APs can release DFO in the alveolar interstitium, thus promoting the reconstruction of microvasculature, ultimately inducing lung development for treating BPD. In conclusion, this study develops &#8220;pollen&#8221;&#8208;inspired shell&#8211;core aerosol particles capable of Brownian motion, which provides a novel idea and theoretical basis for respiratory administration.

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Enabled Stable Cobalt Species Deposition on MnO2 for Water Oxidation in Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high voltage endows cobalt oxides with stably acidic oxygen evolution on the surface of a&#160;MnO2 host material. MnO2 treated with molten salt possesses more cobalt deposition sites and therefore shows higher oxygen&#160;evolution&#160;reaction&#160;(OER) activity. The stable presence of CoO2 at 1.8&#160;V in the acid electrolyte is beneficial to high activity and stability for the&#160;OER. The exploration of applying high voltage to construct stable species in the&#160;Pourbaix diagram before they are exposed in an&#160;acidic environment proves the feasibility of this method to improve the stability of cobalt&#8208;based electrocatalyst, which provides a new perspective for the design of acidic non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The design and maintenance of highly active sites in an&#160;acidic environment is vital and challenging for the&#160;oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In&#160;this&#160;work, it is found that the obtained CoO2 under high applied potential can be stable on MnO2 host in acidic environment, which may act as an effective means to solve the instability of cobalt&#8208;based electrocatalyst. The significant improvement of acidic OER activity (6.9 times) and stability (46.4 times) of 90&#8208;Co&#8208;MnO2 (treated by molten salt with more Co deposition sites) demonstrates the advantages of this approach. In situ Raman and the&#160;Pourbaix diagram suggest that the enhanced performance derives from the stable presence of CoO2 at the voltage &gt;1.8&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). However, when the potential is &lt;1.8&#160;V, the corresponding other cobalt species is too unstable to facilitate the&#160;OER. Density functional theorycalculations reveal that the deposited cobalt oxides can act as active sites, thus effectively reducing the reaction energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step. This work provides a new perspective for enhancing the stability of cobalt&#8208;based electrocatalyst. In the future, the dual consideration of applied potential and stable species of active element in the&#160;Pourbaix diagram may be a new direction for developing acid&#8208;stable electrocatalysts.

         <title>Harvesting Triplet Excitons in High Mobility Emissive Organic Semiconductor for Efficiency Enhancement of Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triplet excitons in high mobility emissive semiconductor 2,6&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA) are successfully harvested via triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation and further increased by doping a highly emissive guest. The exciton utilization and device efficiency of DPA are significantly improved in organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs). This concept can be extended to other advanced high mobility emissive organic semiconductors for promoting the development of OLETs and related functional devices.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs), a kind of highly integrated and minimized optoelectronic device, demonstrate great potential applications in various fields. The construction of high&#8208;performance OLETs requires the integration of high charge carrier mobility, strong emission, and high triplet exciton utilization efficiency in the active layer. However, it remains a significant long&#8208;term challenge, especially for single component active layer OLETs. Herein, the successful harvesting of triplet excitons in a high mobility emissive molecule, 2,6&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA), through the triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation process is demonstrated. By incorporating a highly emissive guest into the DPA host system, an obvious increase in photoluminescence efficiency along with exciton utilization efficiency results in an obvious enhancement of external quantum efficiency of 7.2&#160;times for OLETs compared to the non&#8208;doped devices. Moreover, well&#8208;tunable multi&#8208;color electroluminescence, especially white emission with Commission Internationale del'Eclairage&#160; of (0.31, 0.35), from OLETs is also achieved by modulating the doping concentration with a controlled energy transfer process. This work opens a new avenue for integrating strong emission and efficient exciton utilization in high&#8208;mobility organic semiconductors for high&#8208;performance OLETs and advancing their related functional device applications.

         <title>Electrically Driven Sub&#8208;Micrometer Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Arrays Using Maskless and Etching&#8208;Free Pixelation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A&#160;pixelation technique of micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diodes via helium focused ion beam irradiation is introduced. Various pixel sizes down to sub&#8208;micrometer scale are demonstrated, and their optical and electrical properties are investigated. This approach does not require any complicated fabrication processes for pixelation such as lithography, passivation, and planarization, providing a new way to fabricate sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;scale optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
For decades, group&#8208;III&#8208;nitride&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) have&#160;been regarded as a light emitting source for future displays by virtue of their novel properties such as high efficiency, brightness, and stability. Nevertheless, realization of high pixel density displays is still challenging due to limitations of pixelation methods. Here, a maskless and etching&#8208;free micro&#8208;LED (&#181;LED) pixelation method is developed via tailored He focused ion beam (FIB) irradiation technique, and electrically driven sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;scale &#181;LED pixel arrays are demonstrated. It is confirmed that optical quenching and electrical isolation effects are simultaneously induced at a certain ion dose (&#8776;1014 ions cm&#8722;2) without surface damage. Furthermore, highly efficient &#181;LED pixel arrays at sub&#8208;micrometer scale (square pixel, 0.5&#160;&#181;m side length) are fabricated. Their pixelation and brightness are verified by various optical measurements such as cathodo&#8208;, photo&#8208;, and electroluminescence. It is expected that the FIB&#8208;induced optical quenching and electrical isolation method can pioneer a new defect engineering technology not only for &#181;LED fabrication, but also for sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;scale optoelectronic devices.

This approach does not require any complicated fabrication processes for pixelation such as lithography, passivation, and planarization, providing a new way to fabricate sub-micrometer-scale optoelectronic devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, group-III-nitride-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have&#160;been regarded as a light emitting source for future displays by virtue of their novel properties such as high efficiency, brightness, and stability. Nevertheless, realization of high pixel density displays is still challenging due to limitations of pixelation methods. Here, a maskless and etching-free micro-LED (&#181;LED) pixelation method is developed via tailored He focused ion beam (FIB) irradiation technique, and electrically driven sub-micrometer-scale &#181;LED pixel arrays are demonstrated. It is confirmed that optical quenching and electrical isolation effects are simultaneously induced at a certain ion dose (&#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; ions cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) without surface damage. Furthermore, highly efficient &#181;LED pixel arrays at sub-micrometer scale (square pixel, 0.5&#160;&#181;m side length) are fabricated. Their pixelation and brightness are verified by various optical measurements such as cathodo-, photo-, and electroluminescence. It is expected that the FIB-induced optical quenching and electrical isolation method can pioneer a new defect engineering technology not only for &#181;LED fabrication, but also for sub-micrometer-scale optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Specific Photothermal&#8208;Therapy&#8208;Assisted Immunomodulation via Multiresponsive Adjuvant Nanoparticles</title>

Abstract
Multiresponsive adjuvant nanoparticles (RMmAGL) were fabricated to perform tumor&#8208;specific photothermal therapy while regulating the behavior of tumor&#8208;associated immune cells for primary tumor eradication and metastasis inhibition. Core&#8211;satellite&#8208;like RMmAGL had a core of mannose&#8208;functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded with R837 (R837@MSN&#8208;mannose) connected via hydrazone bonds to satellites of glutamine (Glu)&#8208; and lysine (Lys)&#8208;comodified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys). During therapy, the acidic environment in tumor tissue cleaved the hydrazone bonds to release AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys, which further accumulated in tumor cells. After internalization, photothermal agents (aggregated AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys) were generated in situ through the intratumoral enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reaction between Glu and Lys, resulting in tumor&#8208;specific photothermal therapy. The detachment of AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys also triggered the release of R837, which matured dendritic cells (DCs) via a vaccine&#8208;like mechanism along with the tumor&#8208;associated antigens generated by photothermal therapy. These matured DCs further activated surrounding T cells for immunotherapy. Moreover, the resulting free MSN&#8208;mannose served as an artificial glycocalyx to continuously induce the polarization of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages from an immunosuppressive phenotype to an inflammatory phenotype, thus further enhancing immunotherapy. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated significant inhibition of malignant tumors after therapy.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of 2D Mo2C and Thickness&#8208;Dependent Hydrogen Evolution on Its Basal Plane and Edges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides (2D TMC and MXenes) are promising candidates for applications of energy storage and catalysis. Mo2C MXene has shown promise for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but scalable synthesis of high&#8208;quality large 2D Mo2C flakes could not be achieved. Here, we report a facile strategy for direct synthesis of 2D Mo2C with a low concentration of defects by salt&#8208;assisted templating, in which KCl serves as a template to form an intermediate 2D product and facilitates Mo2C formation without coarsening upon melting. Ability to produce flakes with thicknesses from monolayer (0.36&#160;nm) to 10 layers (4.55&#160;nm) allowed us to show that the electrocatalytical HER activity of 2D Mo2C is inversely proportional to its thickness. The thinnest monolayer Mo2C shows a remarkable HER performance with a current density of &#8764; 6800&#160;mA/cm2 at 470&#160;mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode and an ultra&#8208;high turnover frequency of &#8764; 17500 s&#8722;1. The theoretical calculations demonstrate that the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption increases with decreasing thickness of Mo2C, increasing HER activity. WC and V8C7 nanosheets were fabricated using this versatile approach, thus expanding the family of 2D carbides. These results indicate that the salt&#8208;assisted synthesis opens a new pathway to direct synthesis of MXene&#8208;like 2D carbides that eliminates the need for layered ceramic precursors.

         <title>Boosting the Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy Performance of 2D Layered Double Hydroxide Nanosheet&#8208;Based Sonosensitizers Via Crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;Amorphous Phase Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has been a promising therapeutic modality for cancer because of its superior advantages compared with other therapeutic strategies. However, the current sonosensitizers used for SDT normally exhibit low activity for ultrasound (US)&#8208;induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Herein, we first report the crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;amorphous phase transformation as a simple but powerful strategy to engineer ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) CoW&#8208;LDH and NiW&#8208;LDH nanosheets as highly efficient sonosensitizers for SDT. The phase transformation of CoW&#8208;LDH and NiW&#8208;LDH nanosheets from polycrystalline to amorphous ones is achieved through a simple acid etching treatment. Importantly, compared with the polycrystalline one, the amorphous CoW&#8208;LDH (a&#8208;CoW&#8208;LDH) nanosheets possess higher ROS generation activity under US irradiation, which is &#8764;17 times of the commercial TiO2 sonosensitizer. Our results suggest that the enhanced performance of ultrathin a&#8208;CoW&#8208;LDH nanosheets for US&#8208;induced ROS generation may be attributed to the phase transformation&#8208;induced defect generation and electronic structure changes. After polyethylene glycol modification, the a&#8208;CoW&#8208;LDH nanosheets can serve as a high&#8208;efficiency sonosensitizer for SDT to achieve cell death in vitro and tumor eradication in vivo under US irradiation.

         <title>Unveiling the Intrinsic Structure and Intragrain Defects of Organic Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites by Ultra&#8208;low Dose Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a powerful tool for unveiling the structural, compositional, and electronic properties of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHP) at the atomic to micron length scales. However, the structural and compositional instability of OIHPs under electron beam radiation results in misunderstandings of the microscopic structure&#8722;property&#8722;performance relationship in OIHP devices. Here, we utilize ultra&#8208;low dose TEM to identify the mechanism of the electron beam&#8208;induced changes in OHIPs and clarify the cumulative electron dose thresholds (critical dose) of different commercially interesting state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OIHPs, including MAPbI3, FAPbI3, FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3, FA0.15Cs0.85PbI3, and MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3. The critical dose is related to the composition of the OIHPs, with FA0.15Cs0.85PbI3 having the highest critical dose of &#8764;84 e &#197;&#8722;2 and FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 having the lowest critical dose of &#8764;4.2 e &#197;&#8722;2. The electron beam irradiation results in the formation of a superstructure with ordered I and FA vacancies along &lt;110&gt;c, as identified from the three major crystal axes in cubic FAPbI3, &lt;100&gt;c, &lt;110&gt;c and &lt;111&gt;c. The intragrain planar defects in FAPbI3 are stable while an obvious modification is observed in FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 under continuous electron beam exposure. This information can serve as a guide for ensuring a reliable understanding of the microstructure of OIHP optoelectronic devices by TEM.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;fast Piezocatalysts Enabled By Interfacial Interaction of Reduced Graphene Oxide/MoS2 Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The catalytic activity has been investigated in 2D materials, and the unique structural and electronic properties contribute to their success in conventional heterogeneous catalysis. Heterojunction&#8208;based piezocatalysis has attracted increasing attention due to the band&#8208;structure engineering and the enhanced charge carrier separation by prominent piezoelectric effect.

Piezoresponse force microscope (PFM) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveal that the coupling between semiconductive and piezoelectric properties in the vdW heterojunction is vital to break the metallic state screening effect at the MoS2 edge for keeping the piezoelectric potential. The dynamic charges generated by MoS2 and the fast charge transfer in rGO activate and maintain catalytically active sites for pollutant degradation with ultra&#8208;fast rate and good stability. The working mechanism opens new avenues for developing efficient catalysts significant to wastewater treatments and other applications.

Abstract
Magnetic materials in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) have attracted widespread attention for their intriguing magnetic properties. 2D magnetic heterostructures can provide unprecedented opportunities for exploring fundamental physics and novel spintronic devices. Here, w e report the heteroepitaxial growth of ferromagnetic CuCr2Te4 nanosheets on Cr2Te3 and mica by chemical vapor deposition. Magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect measurements revealed the thickness&#8208;dependent ferromagnetism of CuCr2Te4 nanosheets on mica, where a decrease of Curie temperature (TC) from 320 K to 260 K and an enhancement of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with reducing thickness w ere observed. Moreover, lattice&#8208;matched heteroepitaxial ultrathin CuCr2Te4 on Cr2Te3 exhibits an enhanced robust ferromagnetism with TC up to 340 K due to the interfacial charge transfer. Stripe&#8208;type magnetic domains and single magnetic domain w ere discovered in this heterostructure with different thicknesses. O ur work provides a way to construct robust room&#8208;temperature 2D magnetic heterostructures for functional spintronic devices.

         <title>Coexistence of Merons with Skyrmions in the Centrosymmetric van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe5&#8208;xGeTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Fe5&#8208;xGeTe2 is a centrosymmetric, layered van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet that displays Curie temperatures Tc (270&#8208;330 K) that are within the useful range for spintronic applications. However, little is known about the interplay between its topological spin textures (e.g., merons, skyrmions) with technologically relevant transport properties such as the topological Hall effect (THE), or topological thermal transport. Here, we show via high&#8208;resolution Lorentz transmission electron microscopy that merons and anti&#8208;meron pairs coexist with N&#233;el skyrmions in Fe5&#8208;xGeTe2 over a wide range of temperatures and probe their effects on thermal and electrical transport. We detect a THE, even at room T, that senses merons at higher T&#8217;s as well as their coexistence with skyrmions as T is lowered indicating an on&#8208;demand thermally driven formation of either type of spin texture. Remarkably, we also observe an unconventional THE in absence of Lorentz force and attribute it to the interaction between charge carriers and magnetic field&#8208;induced chiral spin textures. Our results expose Fe5&#8208;xGeTe2 as a promising candidate for the development of applications in skyrmionics/meronics due to the interplay between distinct but coexisting topological magnetic textures and unconventional transport of charge/heat carriers.

         <title>Piezocatalytic 2D WS2 Nanosheets for Ultrasound&#8208;Triggered and Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Piezodynamic Cancer Therapy Synergized with Energy Metabolism&#8208;Targeted Chemotherapy</title>

Abstract
Piezoelectric nanomaterials that can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) by piezoelectric polarization under an external mechanical force have emerged as an effective platform for cancer therapy. In this study, piezoelectric, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) WS2 nanosheets were prepared and functionalized with mitochondrial&#8208;targeting triphenylphosphonium (TPP) for ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered, mitochondria&#8208;targeted piezodynamic cancer therapy. In addition, a glycolysis inhibitor (FX11) that can inhibit cellular energy metabolism was loaded into TPP&#8208; and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)&#8208;conjugated WS2 nanosheets (TPEG&#8208;WS2) to potentiate its piezodynamic therapeutic efficacy. FX11&#8208;loaded TPEG&#8208;WS2 (FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2) exhibited high physiological stability and biocompatibility. Upon US irradiation, the sono&#8208;excited electrons and holes generated in the 2D WS2 were efficiently separated by piezoelectric polarization, which subsequently promoted the production of ROS. The variation in the piezoelectric potential with respect to US&#8208;induced pressure was calculated using COMSOL Multiphysics&#174;. TPEG&#8208;WS2 selectively accumulates in the mitochondria of human breast cancer cells, rendering them more vulnerable&#160;to ROS&#8208;triggered apoptosis. In addition, FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 effectively inhibited glycolytic pathways, leading to the significant inhibition of adenosine triphosphate and lactate production. Thus, FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 exhibited outstanding anticancer effects under US irradiation. An in vivo biodistribution study using tumor&#8208;xenograft mice demonstrated that FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 effectively accumulated in the tumors. Tumor accumulation of FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 was also visualized using in vivo computed tomography imaging. Notably, a single intravenous injection of FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 under US irradiation remarkably suppressed the tumor growth of mice without systemic toxicity. This study demonstrates that the combination of US&#8208;triggered piezodynamic cancer therapy and energy metabolism&#8208;targeted chemotherapy using mitochondria&#8208;targeting piezoelectric 2D WS2 nanosheets is a novel therapeutic strategy for the selective and effective treatment of tumors

         <title>Building K&#8208;C anode with ultrahigh self&#8208;diffusion coefficient for solid state potassium metal batteries operating at &#8208;20 to 120&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Solid state potassium metal batteries are intriguing in grid&#8208;scale energy storage, benefiting from the low cost, safety and high energy density. However, their practical applications are impeded by poor K/solid electrolyte (SE) interfacial contact and limited capacity caused by the low K self&#8208;diffusion coefficient, dendrite growth, and the intrinsically low melting point/soft features of metallic K. Herein, we demonstrate that a fused&#8208;modeling strategy using potassiophilic carbon allotropes molted with K, can enhance the electrochemical performance/stability of the system via promoting K diffusion kinetics (2.37 &#215; 10&#8722;8 cm2 s&#8722;1), creating an extremely low interfacial resistance (&#8764;1.3 &#937; cm2), suppressing dendrite growth, and maintaining mechanical/thermal stability at 200&#176;C. A homogeneous/stable K stripping/plating is consequently implemented with a high current density of 2.8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 (at 25&#176;C) and a record&#8208;high areal capacity of 11.86 mAh cm&#8722;2 (at 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). The enhanced K diffusion kinetics contributes to sustaining intimate interfacial contact, stabilizing the stripping/plating at high current densities. Full cells coupling ultrathin K&#8208;C composite anodes (&#8764;50&#160;&#956;m) with Prussian blue cathodes and &#946;/&#946;"&#8208;Al2O3 SEs delivers a high energy density of 389&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 with a retention of 94.4% after 150 cycles and fantastic performances in a temperature range from &#8208;20 to 120&#176;C.

         <title>Transition from Elastohydrodynamic to Mixed Regimes in Lubricated Friction of Soft Solid Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lubricated contacts in soft materials are common in various engineering and natural systems. Two major regimes are elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL), in which solid surfaces are fully separated by a fluid film, and mixed lubrication (ML), in which there is partial solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid contact. Transition between these regimes governs the minimum sliding friction achievable and is thus very important in various engineering and natural settings such as tires, haptic applications, bio&#8208;inspired systems, contact lenses, and the fabrication of soft electronic devices. Generally, the transition from EHL to ML regimes is believed to occur when the thickness of the lubricant layer is comparable with the amplitude of surface roughness. We performed lubricated sliding experiments on smooth polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates under various normal load, sliding velocity, and lubricant conditions. We found that for smooth soft surfaces, the transition from EHL to ML regimes can occur when the thickness of the liquid layer is much larger than the height of asperities, that is, the conventional criterion is highly inaccurate. By direct visualization of the &#8220;contact&#8221; region during sliding experiments, we demonstrate that the transition corresponds to the formation of wave&#8208;like surface wrinkles at the leading contact edge and associated instabilities at the trailing contact edge. We believe these instabilities are peculiar to soft solids and trigger transition to the mixed regime. Our results change the fundamental understanding of what governs the important EHL&#8208;ML transition in lubricated sliding of soft solids.

         <title>Tuning the Coordination Environment of Carbon&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts via Doping with Multiple Heteroatoms and Their Applications in Electrocatalysis</title>

Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are considered to be a perfect platform for studying the structure&#8208;activity relationship of different reactions due to the adjustability of their coordination environment. Multi&#8208;heteroatom doping has been demonstrated as an effective strategy for tuning the coordination environment of carbon&#8208;based SACs and enhancing catalytic performance in electrochemical reactions. Herein, we summarize recently developed strategies for multi&#8208;heteroatom doping, focusing on the regulation of single&#8208;atom active sites by heteroatoms in different coordination shells. In addition, we investigate the correlation between the coordination environment and the catalytic activity of carbon&#8208;based SACs through representative experiments and theoretical calculations for various electrochemical reactions. Finally, concerning certain shortcomings of the current strategies of doping multi&#8208;heteroatoms, some suggestions are put forward to promote the development of carbon&#8208;based SACs in the field of electrocatalysis.

         <title>Engineered Living Intestinal Muscle Patch Produces Macroscopic Contractions that can Mix and Break down Artificial Intestinal Contents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intestinal muscle layers execute various gut wall movements to achieve controlled propulsion and mixing of intestinal content. Engineering intestinal muscle layers with complex contractile function is critical for developing bioartificial intestinal tissue to treat patients with short bowel syndrome. Here we report the first demonstration of a living intestinal muscle patch capable of generating three distinct motility patterns and displaying multiple digesta manipulations. Assessment of cell contractility, cellular morphology, and transcriptome profile reveals that successful generation of the contracting intestinal muscle patch relies on both biological factors in a serum&#8208;free medium and environmental cues from an elastic electrospun gelatin scaffold. By comparing gene&#8208;expression patterns among samples, we show that biological factors from the medium strongly affect ion transport activities, while the scaffold unexpectedly regulates cell&#8208;cell communication. Analysis of the ligand&#8208;receptor interactome identifies the scaffold&#8208;driven changes in intercellular communication, and 78% of the upregulated ligand&#8208;receptor interactions are involved in the development and function of enteric neurons. Our discoveries highlight the importance of combining biomolecular and biomaterial approaches for tissue engineering. The living intestinal muscle patch represents a pivotal advancement for building functional replacement intestinal tissue. It offers a more physiological model for studying GI motility and for preclinical drug discovery.

         <title>Young Exosome Bio&#8208;nanoparticles Restore Aging&#8208;Impaired Tendon Stem/Progenitor Cell Function and Reparative Capacity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aging impairs tendon stem cell function and homeostasis, however, effective treatments for aging&#8208;induced tendon diseases are lacking. Exosomes are naturally derived nanoparticles that contain bioactive molecules, and therefore, have attracted great interests in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In this study, we show that young exosomes secreted by stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED&#8208;Exos) possess abundant anti&#8208;aging signals. These young bio&#8208;nanoparticles can alleviate the aging phenotypes of aged tendon stem/progenitor cells (AT&#8208;SCs) and maintain their tenogenic capacity. Mechanistically, SHED&#8208;Exos modulate histone methylation and inhibit nuclear factor&#8208;&#954;B to reverse AT&#8208;SC aging. In a naturally aging mouse model, systemic administration of SHED&#8208;Exo bio&#8208;nanoparticles retards tendon degeneration. Interestingly, local delivery of SHED&#8208;Exos&#8208;loaded microspheres confers anti&#8208;aging phenotypes, including reduced senescent cells and decreased ectopic bone formation, and thereby functionally and structurally rescuing endogenous tendon regeneration and repair capacity in aged rats. Overall, SHED&#8208;Exos, as natural bioactive nanoparticles, have promising translational and therapeutic potential for aging&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Synaptic Resistor Circuits Based on Al Oxide and Ti Silicide for Concurrent Learning and Signal&#8208;Processing in Artificial Intelligence Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neurobiological circuits containing synapses can process signals while learning concurrently in real&#8208;time. Before an artificial neural network (ANN) can execute a signal&#8208;processing program, it must first be programmed by humans or trained with respect to a large and defined data set during learning processes, resulting in significant latency, high power consumption, and poor adaptability to unpredictable changing environments. In this article, we report a crossbar circuit of synaptic resistors (synstors), each synstor integrating an Si channel with an Al oxide memory layer and Ti silicide Schottky contacts. Individual synstors were characterized and analyzed to understand their concurrent signal&#8208;processing and learning abilities. Without any prior training, synstor circuits concurrently execute signal&#8208;processing and learning in real time to fly drones toward a target position in an aerodynamically changing environment faster than human controllers, and with learning speed, performance, power consumption, and adaptability to the environment significantly superior to an ANN running on computers. The synstor circuit provides a path to establish power&#8208;efficient intelligent systems with real&#8208;time learning and adaptability in the capriciously mutable real&#8208;world.

         <title>Triclinic Phase Bismuth Chromate: a Promising Candidate for Photocatalytic Water Splitting with Broad Spectrum Ranges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic water splitting for solar energy conversion remains challenged by the lack of novel semiconductor photocatalysts with paramount parameters including wide light harvesting ranges and suitable band structures. Here, we disclose a novel triclinic phase bismuth chromate (Bi2CrO6) acting as a semiconductor photocatalyst candidate. Triclinic Bi2CrO6 exhibits a broad absorption range of &#8764;650&#160;nm with a direct band gap of 1.86&#160;eV and shows a suitable band structure for water splitting. Theoretical simulations of triclinic Bi2CrO6 revealed a high charge mobility possibly owing to the strong hybridized covalent bonds, large elastic modulus, and small carrier effective mass. The triclinic Bi2CrO6 was demonstrated to work well towards photocatalytic water oxidation and hydrogen production reactions under visible light and match well with its absorption ranges. In particular, it exhibits decent photocatalytic water oxidation performance in the presence of various electron scavengers. Furthermore, the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven Z&#8208;scheme overall water splitting system was fabricated by coupling triclinic Bi2CrO6 as the oxygen evolution photocatalyst with SrTiO3:Rh as the hydrogen evolution photocatalyst, giving a stable overall water splitting with stoichiometric evolution of H2 and O2. This work presents a promising semiconductor material enabling wide&#8208;range light harvesting for photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical solar energy conversion.

         <title>An in&#8208;situ Fabricated Graphene/bi&#8208;polar Polymer Hybrid Material Delivers Ultra&#8208;long Cycle Life over 15,000 cycles as a High&#8208;performance Electrode Material</title>

Organic electrode materials are promising for the future energy storage systems owing to their tunable structures, abundant resources and environmental friendliness etc. Many advanced lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with organic electrodes are developed and show excellent performance. However, developing organic materials with overall superior performance still face great challenges such as low capacity, poor stability, inferior conductivity and low utilization of active sites. To address these issues, a bi&#8208;polar polymer (Fc&#8208;DAB) is designed and further polymerized in&#8208;situ with three&#8208;dimensional graphene (3DG), offering a hybrid material (Fc&#8208;DAB@3DG) with a variety of merits. Fc&#8208;DAB possesses stable polymer backbone and multiple redox&#8208;active sites that could improve stability and capacity simultaneously. The imbedded highly conductive 3DG network endows Fc&#8208;DAB@3DG with stable conductive framework, large surface area and porous morphology all together, so the fast ions/electrons diffusion could be achieved, leading to high utilization of active sites and enhanced electrochemical performance. As a result, Fc&#8208;DAB@3DG cathode delivers capacity of &#8764;260 mA h g&#8722;1 at 25 mA g&#8722;1, ultra&#8208;long cycle life over 15,000 cycles at 2,000 mA g&#8722;1 with retention of 99.999% per cycle and remarkable rate performance. The quasi&#8208;solid Li metal battery and full cell fabricated using this material also exhibit superior electrochemical performance.

         <title>N&#8208;B&#8208;OH Site&#8208;activated Graphene Quantum Dots for Boosting Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>

Abstract
Carbon materials are considered promising 2/4 e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts for synthesizing H2O2/H2O via regulating heteroatom dopants and functionalization. Here, we designed various doped and functionalized graphene quantum dots (GQDs) to reveal the crucial active sites of carbon materials for ORR to produce H2O2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that the edge structure involving edge N, B dopant pairs and further &#8208;OH functionalization to the B (N&#8208;B&#8208;OH) is an active center for ORR via a 2 e&#8722; pathway. To verify the above predication, GQDs with an enriched density of N&#8208;B&#8208;OH (NBO&#8208;GQDs) were designed and synthesized by the hydrothermal reaction of &#8208;NH2 edge&#8208;functionalized GQDs with H3BO3 forming six&#8208;member heterocycle containing the N&#8208;B&#8208;OH structure. When dispersed on conductive carbon substrates, the NBO&#8208;GQDs show H2O2 selectivity of over 90% at 0.7&#160;V&#8208;0.8&#160;V versus RHE in the alkaline solution in a rotating ring&#8208;disk electrode setup. The selectivity retains 90% of the initial value after a 12&#160;h stability test. In a flow cell setup, the H2O2 production rate is up to 709&#160;mmol gcatalyst&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, superior to most reported carbon&#8208; and metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This work provides molecular insight into the design and formulation of highly efficient carbon&#8208;based catalysts for sustainable H2O2 production.

         <title>Wetting Effect on Patterned Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
A droplet deposited on a solid substrate leads to the wetting phenomenon. A natural observation is the lotus effect known for its superhydrophobicity. This special feature is engendered by the structured microstructure of the lotus leaf, namely, surface heterogeneity, as explained by the quintessential Cassie&#8208;Wenzel theory. In this work, recent designs of functional substrates are overviewed based on the Cassie&#8208;Wenzel theory via manipulating the contact area between the liquid and the solid substrate as well as the intrinsic Young's contact angle. Moreover, the limitation of the Cassie&#8208;Wenzel theory is discussed. When the droplet size is comparable to the surface heterogeneity, anisotropic wetting morphology often appears, which is beyond the scope of the Cassie&#8208;Wenzel work. In this case, several recent studies addressing the anisotropic wetting effect on chemically and mechanically patterned substrates are elucidated. Surface designs for anisotropic wetting morphologies are summarized with respect to the shape and the arrangement of the surface heterogeneity, the droplet volume, the deposition position of the droplet, as well as the mean curvature of the surface heterogeneity. A thermodynamic interpretation for the wetting effect and the corresponding open questions are presented at the&#160;end.

         <title>Enhancement of Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Spin&#8211;Orbit Torque by Interfacial Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation in CuPt/ferromagnet interface is found to be able to enhance the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (OOP) torque and associated spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT) switching efficiency with remaining threefold rotational symmetry. The enhancement is independent of the device shapes, magnetic materials, or magnetization easy axis. This work offers an industrial&#8208;compatible route to improve the performance of low&#8208;symmetry crystal&#8208;based spintronic devices.








Abstract
Spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT)&#8208;induced switching of perpendicular magnetization in the absence of magnetic field is crucial for the application of SOT&#8208;based spintronic devices. Recent works have demonstrated that the low&#8208;symmetry crystal structure in CuPt/CoPt can give rise to an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (OOP) spin torque and lead to deterministic magnetization switching without an external field. However, it is essential to improve OOP effective field for the efficient switching. In this work, the impact of interface oxidation on the generation of OOP effective field in a CuPt/ferromagnet heterostructure is systematically studied. By introducing an oxidized CuPt surface, it is found that the field&#8208;free switching performance shows remarkable improvement. OOP effective field measurement indicates that the oxidation treatment can enhance the OOP effective field by more than two times. It is also demonstrated that this oxidation&#8208;induced OOP SOT efficiency enhancement is independent of the device shapes, magnetic materials, or magnetization easy axis. This work contributes to improve the performance of SOT devices and provides an effective fabrication guidance for future spintronic devices that utilize OOP SOT.

         <title>A&#160;Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Based Approach for Solving Atomic Structures of Nanomaterials Combining Pair Distribution Functions with Density Functional Theory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Determination of crystal structures of nanocrystalline compounds is a great challenge in solid&#8208;state chemistry. In&#160;this&#160;work, an algorithm is introduced,&#160;which&#160;is able to determine the crystal structure of an unknown compound by means of an on&#8208;the&#8208;fly trained machine&#160;learning model that combines density functional calculations with comparison of calculated and measured pair distribution functions for global optimization.








Abstract
Determination of crystal structures of nanocrystalline or amorphous compounds is a great challenge in solid&#8208;state chemistry and physics. Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of X&#8208;ray or neutron total scattering&#160;data has proven to be a key element in tackling this challenge. However, in most cases, a reliable structural motif is needed as a&#160;starting configuration for structure refinements. Here, an algorithm that is able to determine the crystal structure of an unknown compound by means of an on&#8208;the&#8208;fly trained machine&#160;learning model,&#160;which&#160;combines density functional theory calculations with comparison of calculated and measured PDFs for global optimization in an artificial landscape, is presented. Due to the nature of this landscape, even metastable configurations and stacking disorders can be identified.

         <title>Versatile Assembly of Metal&#8211;Phenolic Network Foams Enabled by Tannin&#8211;Cellulose Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;phenolic network foams are prepared using tannin&#8211;cellulose nanofibers as a structured background. The method relies on ice&#8208;templating the nanofibers to promote the metal&#8211;phenolic networking in situ, during thawing in ethanol solutions of metal nitrates. This leads to strong and homogenous lightweight foams, whose properties are tailorable by adjusting the tannin type and content, as well as the metal ion.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;phenolic network (MPN) foams are prepared using colloidal suspensions of tannin&#8208;containing cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) that are ice&#8208;templated and thawed in ethanolic media in the presence of metal nitrates. The MPN facilitates the formation of solid foams by air drying, given the strength and self&#8208;supporting nature of the obtained tannin&#8211;cellulose nanohybrid structures. The porous characteristics and (dry and wet) compression strength of the foams are rationalized by the development of secondary, cohesive&#160;metal&#8208;phenolic layers combined with a hydrogen bonding network involving the CNF. The shrinkage of the MPN foams is as low as 6% for samples prepared with 2.5&#8211;10% tannic acid (or condensed tannin at 2.5%) with respect to CNF content. The strength of the MPN foams reaches a maximum at 10% tannic acid (using Fe(III) ions), equivalent to a compressive strength 70% higher than that produced with tannin&#8208;free CNF foams. Overall, a straightforward framework is introduced to synthesize MPN foams whose physical and mechanical properties are tailored by the presence of tannins as well as the metal ion species that enable the metal&#8211;phenolic networking. Depending on the metal ion, the foams are amenable to modification according to the desired application.

         <title>Deciphering Adverse Detrapped Hole Transfer in Hot&#8208;Electron Photoelectric Conversion at Infrared Wavelengths</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Existing hot&#8208;carrier devices suffer from low efficiencies, particularly in the infrared region, and ambiguous physical mechanisms. In&#160;this&#160;work,&#160;the competitive interfacial transfer mechanisms of detrapped holes and hot electrons in hot&#8208;carrier devices are discovered. By eliminating the adverse detrapped&#8208;hole transfer, the external quantum efficiency of a hot&#8208;electron device can increase by over two orders of magnitude at 10&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Hot&#8208;carrier devices are promising alternatives for enabling path breaking photoelectric conversion. However, existing hot&#8208;carrier devices suffer from low efficiencies, particularly in the infrared region, and ambiguous physical mechanisms. In&#160;this&#160;work,&#160;the competitive interfacial transfer mechanisms of detrapped holes and hot electrons in hot&#8208;carrier devices are discovered. Through photocurrent polarity research and optical&#8208;pump&#8211;THz&#8208;probe (OPTP) spectroscopy, it is verified that detrapped hole transfer (DHT) and hot&#8208;electron transfer (HET) dominate the low&#8208; and high&#8208;density excitation responses, respectively. The photocurrent ratio assigned to DHT and HET increases from 6.6% to over 1133.3% as the illumination intensity decreases. DHT induces severe degeneration of the external quantum efficiency (EQE), especially at low illumination intensities. The EQE of a hot&#8208;electron device can theoretically increase by over two orders of magnitude at 10&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 through DHT elimination. The OPTP results show that competitive transfer arises from the carrier oscillation type and carrier&#8208;density&#8208;related Coulomb screening. The screening intensity determines the excitation weight and hot&#8208;electron cooling scenes and thereby the transfer dynamics.

         <title>Inhibiting Formation and Reduction of Li2CO3 to LiCx at Grain Boundaries in Garnet Electrolytes to Prevent Li Penetration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel mechanism for Li penetration is discovered within Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) where Li2CO3 at the grain boundaries (GBs) of LLZO is reduced to an electron&#8208;conductive LiCx network. The ion/electron transfer properties of GBs within LLZO are regulated via F&#8208;doping and LiAlO2 infusion, which significantly reduce the formation of Li2CO3 and promote homogenous Li plating/stripping.








Abstract
Poor ion and high electron transport at the grain boundaries (GBs) of ceramic electrolytes are the primary reasons for lithium filament infiltration and short&#8208;circuiting of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASLMBs). Herein, it is discovered that Li2CO3 at the GBs of Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) sheets is reduced to highly electron&#8208;conductive LiCx during cycling, resulting in lithium penetration of LLZO. The ionic and electronic conductivity of the GBs within LLZO can be simultaneously tuned using sintered Li3AlF6. The generated LiAlO2 (LAO) infusion and F&#8208;doping at the GBs of LLZO (LAO&#8208;LLZOF) significantly reduce the Li2CO3 content and broaden the energy bandgap of LLZO, which decreases the electronic conductivity of LAO&#8208;LLZOF. LAO forms a 3D continuous ion transport network at the GB that significantly improves the total ionic conductivity. Lithium penetration within LLZO is suppressed and an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LiFePO4/LAO&#8208;LLZOF/Li battery stably cycled for 5500 cycles at 3&#160;C. This work reveals the chemistry of Li2CO3 at the LLZO GBs during cycling, presents a novel lithium penetration mechanism within garnet electrolytes, and provides an innovative method to simultaneously regulate the ion and electron transport at the GBs in garnet electrodes for advanced ASLMBs.

         <title>Controlled Synthesis of Sub&#8208;Millimeter Nonlayered WO2 Nanoplates via a WSe2&#8208;Assisted Method</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality and nonlayered WO2 nanoplates with tunable thickness and lateral dimension by a WSe2&#8208;assisted strategy are reported. Electrical measurements demonstrate that&#160;the WO2 nanoplates exhibit metallic behavior with excellent conductivity, ultrahigh breakdown current density, and strong anisotropic resistance. Magnetotransport studies show quantum&#8208;interference&#8208;induced weak&#8208;localization behavior. These studies demonstrate that 2D&#160;metal oxides are promising candidates for interconnecting and other novel electronic devices.








Abstract
2D&#160;metal oxides (2DMOs) have stimulated tremendous attention due to their distinct electronic structures and abundant surface chemistry. However, it remains a standing challenge for the synthesis of 2DMOs because of their intrinsic 3D&#160;lattice structure and ultrahigh synthesis temperature. Here, a reliable WSe2&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) strategy to grow nonlayered WO2 nanoplates with tunable thickness and lateral dimension is reported. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy studies demonstrate that the&#160;WO2 nanoplates exhibit a well&#8208;faceted rhombic geometry with a lateral dimension up to the sub&#8208;millimeter level (&#8776;135&#160;&#181;m), which is the largest size of 2DMO single crystals obtained by CVD to date. Scanning transmission electron microscopy studies reveal that the nanoplates are high&#8208;quality single crystals. Electrical measurements show the nanoplates exhibit metallic behavior with strong anisotropic resistance, outstanding conductivity of 1.1&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1, and breakdown current density of 7.1&#160;&#215;&#160;107&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. More interestingly, low&#8208;temperature magnetotransport studies demonstrate that the nanoplates show a quantum&#8208;interference&#8208;induced weak&#8208;localization effect. The developed WSe2&#8208;assisted strategy for the growth of WO2 nanoplates can enrich the library of 2DMO materials and provide a material platform for other property explorations based on 2D WO2.

         <title>Hydrogel Nanoarchitectonics of a Flexible and Self&#8208;Adhesive Electrode for Long&#8208;Term Wireless Electroencephalogram Recording and High&#8208;Accuracy Sustained Attention Evaluation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multichannel and wirelessly operated hydrogel electrode for long&#8208;term electroencephalography (EEG) signal recording and real&#8208;time sustained attention evaluation is presented. Due to the combined merits of conductivity, self&#8208;adhesion, low modulus, flexibility, and transparency of the hydrogel, it is able to construct an effective and stable bioelectrical interface for high&#8208;quality EEG signal acquisition.








Abstract
Hydrogels are ideal building blocks to fabricate the next generation of electrodes for acquiring high&#8208;quality physiological electrical signals, for example, electroencephalography (EEG). However, collection of EEG signals still suffers from electrode deformation, sweating, extensive body motion and vibration, and environmental interference. Herein, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinylpyrrolidone are selected to prepare a hydrogel network with tissue&#8208;like modulus and excellent flexibility. Additionally, polydopamine nanoparticles, obtained by polydopamine peroxidation, are integrated into the hydrogel to endow them with higher transparency, higher self&#8208;adhesion, and lower impedance. Consequently, a multichannel and wirelessly operated hydrogel electrode can establish a conformal and stable interface with tissue and illustrate high channel uniformity, low interfacial contact impedance, low power noise, long&#8208;term stability, and a tolerance to sweat and motion. Furthermore, the hydrogel electrode shows the unprecedented ability to classify the recorded high&#8208;quality prefrontal EEG signals into seven&#8208;category sustained attention with high accuracy (91.5%), having great potential applications in the assessment of human consciousness and in multifunctional diagnoses.

         <title>Widely Tunable Berry Curvature in the Magnetic Semimetal Cr1+&#948;Te2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide Cr1+&#948;Te2 is shown to be a unique magnetic semimetal enabling widely tunable k&#8208;space Berry curvature near Fermi energy. The door has been opened for probing and tailoring the intertwined Berry curvature physics in real and momentum&#160;space in Cr1+&#948;Te2 epitaxial thin films and their heterostructures.








Abstract
Magnetic semimetals have increasingly emerged as lucrative platforms hosting spin&#8208;based topological phenomena in real and momentum spaces. Cr1+&#948;Te2 is a self&#8208;intercalated magnetic transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD), which exhibits topological magnetism and tunable electron filling. While recent studies have explored real&#8208;space Berry curvature effects, similar considerations of momentum&#8208;space Berry curvature&#160;are lacking. Here, the electronic structure and transport properties of epitaxial Cr1+&#948;Te2 thin films are systematically investigated over a range of doping, &#948; (0.33 &#8211; 0.71). Spectroscopic experiments reveal the presence of a characteristic semi&#8208;metallic band region, which shows a rigid like energy shift with &#948;. Transport experiments show that the intrinsic component of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is sizable and undergoes a sign flip across &#948;. Finally, density functional theory calculations establish a link between the doping evolution of the band structure and AHE: the AHE sign flip is shown to emerge from the sign change of the Berry curvature, as the semi&#8208;metallic band region crosses the Fermi energy. These findings underscore the increasing relevance of momentum&#8208;space Berry curvature in magnetic TMDs and provide a unique platform for intertwining topological physics in real and momentum spaces.

         <title>Thermoresponsive Electrolytes for Safe Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermoresponsive electrolyte is introduced into a working cell to relieve the exothermic reactions between electrodes and electrolytes, the internal short circuit. The critical temperature for thermal safety, &#8220;ignition point&#8221; of battery, and internal&#8208;short&#8208;circuit temperature of batteries with thermoresponsive electrolyte increase from 71.5, 100.3, and 126.3&#160;&#176;C to 137.4, 203.6, and 176.5&#160;&#176;C compared with routine electrolyte.








Abstract
Exploring advanced strategies in alleviating the thermal runaway of lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) is critically essential. Herein, a novel electrolyte system with thermoresponsive characteristics is designed to largely enhance the thermal safety of 1.0 Ah LMBs. Specifically, vinyl carbonate (VC) with azodiisobutyronitrile is introduced as a thermoresponsive solvent to boost the thermal stability of both the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and electrolyte. First, abundant poly(VC) is formed in SEI with thermoresponsive electrolyte, which is more thermally stable against lithium hexafluorophosphate compared to the inorganic components widely acquired in routine electrolyte. This increases the critical temperature for thermal safety (the beginning temperature of obvious self&#8208;heating) from 71.5 to 137.4&#160;&#176;C. The remained VC solvents can be polymerized into poly(VC) as the battery temperature abnormally increases. The poly(VC) can not only afford as a barrier to prevent the direct contact between electrodes, but also immobilize the free liquid solvents, thereby reducing the exothermic reactions between electrodes and electrolytes. Consequently, the internal&#8208;short&#8208;circuit temperature and &#8220;ignition point&#8221; temperature (the starting temperature of thermal runaway) of LMBs are largely increased from 126.3 and 100.3&#160;&#176;C to 176.5 and 203.6&#160;&#176;C. This work provides novel insights for pursuing thermally stable LMBs with the addition of various thermoresponsive solvents in commercial electrolytes.

         <dc:description>
NiSx&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2/Ni is elaborately designed for the efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to valuable 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), along with green hydrogen production. The reaction path and mechanism are comprehensively understood by ex/in situ characterization and theoretical calculations, and the high&#8208;valence Ni2+&#948; is identified as the real active species.








Abstract
An efficient NiSx&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 electrode is reported for the selective oxidation reaction of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMFOR) with excellent electrocatalytic 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) selectivity (99.4%), conversion (97.7%), and Faradaic efficiency (98.3%). The decoration of NiSx will evoke high&#8208;valence Ni2+&#948; species in the reconstructed &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 electrode, which are the real active species for HMFOR. The generated NiSx/Ni(OH)O modulates the proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer (PCET) process of HMFOR, where the electrocatalytically generated Ni(OH)O can effectively trap the protons from the CHO&#63743; end in HMF to realize electron transfer. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) competes with the HMFOR when NiSx/Ni(OH)O continues to accumulate, to generate the NiSx/NiOx(OH)y intermediate. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results verify that the adsorption energy of HMF can be optimized through the increased NiSx composition for more efficient capture of protons and electrons in the HMFOR.

         <title>Revisiting Lithium&#8208; and Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage in Hard Carbon Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive comparison of the lithium&#8208; and sodium&#8208;ion storage behaviors of hard carbon is conducted, yielding the key findings: the sloping voltage section is presented by the lithium&#8208;ion intercalation in the graphitic lattices of hard carbons, whereas it mainly arises from the chemisorption of sodium ions. The intercalation preference and the plateau capacity have an inverse correlation.








Abstract

         <title>Super&#8208;Resolution Detection of DNA Nanostructures Using a Nanopore</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glass nanopores with 3&#8211;4&#160;nm diameters demonstrate super&#8208;resolution single&#8208;molecule sensing capability, which can be used to detect DNA nanostructures separated only by 18&#160;bp (&#8776;6&#160;nm). The super&#8208;resolution is attributed to the electric field enhancement at the nanopore tip and the slowdown of the&#160;DNA, with great potential for label&#8208;free, high&#8208;resolution DNA sequence mapping and digital information storage.








Abstract
High&#8208;resolution analysis of biomolecules has brought unprecedented insights into fundamental biological processes and dramatically advanced biosensing. Notwithstanding the ongoing resolution revolution in electron microscopy and optical imaging, only a few methods are presently available for high&#8208;resolution analysis of unlabeled single molecules in their native states. Here, label&#8208;free electrical sensing of structured single molecules with a spatial resolution down to single&#8208;digit nanometers is demonstrated. Using a narrow solid&#8208;state nanopore, the passage of a series of nanostructures attached to a freely translocating DNA molecule is detected, resolving individual nanostructures placed as close as 6&#160;nm apart and with a surface&#8208;to&#8208;surface gap distance of only 2&#160;nm. Such super&#8208;resolution ability is attributed to the nanostructure&#8208;induced enhancement of the electric field at the tip of the nanopore. This work demonstrates a general approach to improving the resolution of single&#8208;molecule nanopore sensing and presents a critical advance towards label&#8208;free, high&#8208;resolution DNA sequence mapping, and digital information storage independent of molecular motors.

         <title>Thermo&#8208;pH&#8208;Sensitive Polymer Conjugated Glucose Oxidase for Tumour&#8208;Selective Starvation&#8208;Oxidation&#8208;Immune Therapy</title>

Abstract
Protein drugs are increasingly used as therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. However, their inherent drawbacks, such as poor stability, low cell membrane and tissue permeability, lack of tumour selectivity, and severe side effects, limit their wide applications in cancer therapy. Herein, we report screening of a thermo&#8208;pH&#8208;sensitive polymer&#8722;glucose oxidase conjugate that can controllably self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles with improved stability. The size, surface charge, and bioactivity of the conjugate can be tuned by adjustment of the solution temperature and pH. The cellular uptake, intracellular hydrogen peroxide generation, and tumour cell spheroid penetration of the conjugate are greatly enhanced under the acidic tumour microenvironment, leading to increased cytotoxicity to tumour cells. Upon a single intratumoural injection, the conjugate penetrates into the whole tumour tissue but hardly diffuses into the normal tissues, resulting in the eradication of the tumours in mice without perceivable side effects. Simultaneously, the conjugate induces a robust antitumour immunity to efficiently inhibit the growth of distant tumours, especially in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. These findings provide a novel and general strategy to make multifunctional protein&#8208;polymer conjugates with responsiveness to the acidic tumour microenvironment for selective tumour therapy.

         <title>Tailoring the d&#8208;Orbital Splitting Manner of Single Atomic Sites for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Regulating the electronic states of single atomic sites around the Fermi level remains a major concern for boosting the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we present a Fe d&#8208;orbital splitting manner modulation strategy by constructing axial coordination on Fe&#8208;N4 sites. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that the axial tractions induce the distortion of square&#8208;planar field (Fe&#8208;N4 SP), up to the quasi&#8208;octahedral coordination (Fe&#8208;N4O1 OCquasi), thus leading to the electron rearrangement with a diluted spin polarization. The declined population of unpaired electrons in dz2, dxz, and dyz states engenders a moderate adsorption of ORR intermediates, thereby reinforcing the intrinsic reaction activity. In situ infrared spectroscopy further demonstrates that the reordering of d&#8208;orbital splitting and occupation facilitates the desorption of *OH. The Fe&#8208;N4O1 OCquasi exhibits a dramatic improvement of kinetic current density and turnover frequency, which are five&#8208;fold and ten&#8208;fold higher than those of Fe&#8208;N4 SP. This work presents a novel understanding on improving the electrocatalytic performance through the orbital&#8208;scale manipulation.

         <title>Pore perforation of graphene coupled with in&#8208;situ growth of Co3Se4 for high&#8208;performance Na&#8208;ion battery</title>

Abstract
Graphene&#8208;based nanomaterials have sprung up as promising anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to the intriguing properties of graphene itself and the synergic effect between graphene and active materials. However, the two&#8208;dimensional graphene sheet only allows the rapid diffusion of sodium ions along the parallel direction while that of the vertical direction is difficult, limiting the rate capability of graphene&#8208;based electrode materials. To tackle this problem, pore&#8208;forming engineering has been employed to perforate graphene and concurrently achieve the in&#8208;situ growth of Co3Se4 nanoparticles. The generation of in&#8208;plane nanohole breaks through the physical barriers of the graphene nanosheets, enabling the fast diffusion of electrolyte ions in the longitudinal direction. In addition, this design limits the aggregation of Co3Se4 nanoparticles because of the high affinity of Co3Se4 on graphene. Benefiting from the high conductivity and fast ion transport bestowed by the ingenious architecture, the Co3Se4/holey graphene exhibits a remarkable rate performance of 519.5 mAh g&#8211;1 at 5.0 A g&#8211;1 and desirable cycle stability. Conclusions drawn from this investigation are that the transport of sodium inside the graphene&#8208;based composites is crucial for rate performance enhancement and this method is effective in modifying graphene&#8208;based nanomaterials as potential anode materials.

         <title>Atom&#8208;Precise Heteroatom Core&#8208;Tailoring of Nanoclusters for Enhanced Solar Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
While core&#8208;shell nanomaterials are highly desirable for realizing enhanced optical and catalytic properties, their synthesis with the atomic&#8208;level control is challenging. Here we present the synthesis and crystal structure of [Au12Ag32(SePh)30]4&#8213;, the first example of selenolated Au&#8208;Ag core&#8208;shell nanoclusters, comprising a gold icosahedron core trapped in a silver dodecahedron, which is protected by an Ag12(SePh)30 shell. The gold core strongly modifies the overall electronic structure and induces synergistic effects, resulting in the high enhancements in the stability and near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II photoluminescence. The Au12Ag32 and its homometal analogue Ag44, show strong interactions with oxygen vacancies of TiO2, facilitating the interfacial charge transfer for photocatalysis. Indeed, the Au12Ag32/TiO2 exhibits remarkable solar H2 production (6810 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), which is &#8764;6.2 and &#8764;37.8 times higher than that of Ag44/TiO2 and TiO2, respectively. Good stability and recyclability with minimal catalytic activity loss are additional features of Au12Ag32/TiO2. The experimental and computational results reveal that the Au12Ag32 acts as an efficient cocatalyst by possessing a favorable electronic structure that aligns well with the TiO2 bands for the enhanced separation of photoinduced charge carriers due to the relatively negatively charged Au12 core. These atomistic insights will motivate uncovering of the structure&#8208;catalytic activity relationships of other nanoclusters.

Here we present the synthesis and crystal structure of [Au&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;(SePh)&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8213;&lt;/sup&gt;, the first example of selenolated Au-Ag core-shell nanoclusters, comprising a gold icosahedron core trapped in a silver dodecahedron, which is protected by an Ag&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;(SePh)&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt; shell. The gold core strongly modifies the overall electronic structure and induces synergistic effects, resulting in the high enhancements in the stability and near-infrared-II photoluminescence. The Au&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt; and its homometal analogue Ag&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt;, show strong interactions with oxygen vacancies of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, facilitating the interfacial charge transfer for photocatalysis. Indeed, the Au&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits remarkable solar H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production (6810 &#956;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), which is &#8764;6.2 and &#8764;37.8 times higher than that of Ag&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. Good stability and recyclability with minimal catalytic activity loss are additional features of Au&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The experimental and computational results reveal that the Au&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt; acts as an efficient cocatalyst by possessing a favorable electronic structure that aligns well with the TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bands for the enhanced separation of photoinduced charge carriers due to the relatively negatively charged Au&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; core. These atomistic insights will motivate uncovering of the structure-catalytic activity relationships of other nanoclusters.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Artificial enzymes designed with high catalytic efficiency and stability hold great potential to develop the promising surrogates for naturally&#8208;occurring enzymes. Nanozymes, a class of nanomaterials mimicking the function of enzymes, have aroused much attention as the candidate in diverse fields with the arbitrarily tunable features owing to the diversity of crystalline nanostructures, composition, and surface configurations. However, the uncertainty of their active sites and the lower intrinsic deficiencies of nanomaterials&#8208;initiated catalysis compared with the natural enzymes promote the pursing of alternatives by imitating the biological active centers. Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) maximize the atom utilization with the well&#8208;defined structure, providing an important bridge to investigate mechanism and the relationship between structure and catalytic activity. They have risen as the new burgeoning alternative to the natural enzyme from in vitro bioanalytical tool to in vivo therapy owing to the flexible atomic engineering structure. In this review, we mainly focus on the three parts including the synthesis approaches for the preparation of SAzymes, catalysis modulation strategies and biomedical applications of SAzymes. Firstly, a detailed overview of single&#8208;atom catalyst synthesis strategies including bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down approaches is given. Then, according to the structural feature of single atom nanocatalysts, the influence factors such as central metal atom, coordination number, heteroatom doping, and the metal&#8208;support interaction are discussed. And the representative biological applications (including anti&#8208;bacterial/anti&#8208;viral performance, cancer therapy and biosensing) are highlighted. In the end, the future perspective and challenge facing are demonstrated.

         <title>Coordinatively Stiffen and Toughen Hydrogels with Adaptable Crystal&#8208;Domain Cross&#8208;Linking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homogeneous dynamic cross&#8208;linking design is developed to reconcile the stiffness&#8211;toughness trade&#8208;off for hydrogels via fully triggering both deformation&#8208;resisting and energy&#8208;dissipating capacities of strong yet dynamic cross&#8208;links. Using a solvent&#8208;exchange&#8208;assisted salting&#8208;out method, a class of sal&#8208;exogels with high number densities of crystalline domains embedded in homogeneous networks is constructed, which achieves coordinatively enhanced stiffness and toughness.








Abstract
Conventional hydrogels usually suffer from the inherent conflict between stiffness and toughness, severely hampering their applications as load&#8208;bearing materials. Herein, an adaptable crystal&#8208;domain cross&#8208;linking design is reported to overcome this inherent trade&#8208;off for hydrogels by taking full advantage of both deformation&#8208;resisting and energy&#8208;dissipating capacities of cross&#8208;linking points. Through solvent exchange to homogenize the polymer network, followed by salting out to foster crystallization, a class of sal&#8208;exogels with high number densities of uniform crystalline domains embedded in homogeneous networks is constructed. During the deformation, those adaptive crystalline domains initially survive to arrest deformation, while later gradually disentangle to efficiently dissipate energy, crucial to the realization of the desirable compatibility between stiffness and toughness. The resultant sal&#8208;exogel achieves coordinatively enhanced stiffness (52.3 &#177; 2.7&#160;MPa) and toughness (120.7 &#177; 11.7&#160;kJ m&#8722;2), reconciling the challenging trade&#8208;off between them. This finding provides a practical and universal route to design stiff and tough hydrogels and has a profound impact on many applications requiring hydrogels with such combined mechanical properties.

         <title>A&#160;Reconfigurable Optoelectronic Synaptic Transistor with Stable Zr&#8208;CsPbI3 Nanocrystals for Visuomorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wavelength&#8208;aware transistor memory is designed by incorporating air&#8208;stable Zr&#8208;CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals. On&#8208;demand creation of an&#160;artificial synapse and non&#8208;volatile memory in such homogeneous phototransistor that can be quickly reconfigured for a specific purpose by adjusting the wavelength of the incident light is demonstrated.








Abstract
Reconfigurable phototransistor memory attracts considerable attention for adaptive visuomorphic computing, with highly&#160;efficient sensing, memory, and processing functions integrated onto a single device. However, developing reconfigurable phototransistor memory remains a challenge due to the lack of an&#160;all&#8208;optically controlled transition between short&#8208;term plasticity (STP) and long&#8208;term plasticity (LTP). Herein, an air&#8208;stable Zr&#8208;CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystal (PNC)&#8208;based phototransistor memory is designed,&#160;which&#160;is capable of broadband photoresponses. Benefitting from the different electron capture ability of Zr&#8208;CsPbI3 PNCs to 650 and 405&#160;nm light, an&#160;artificial synapse and non&#8208;volatile memory can be created on&#8208;demand and quickly reconfigured within a single device for specific purposes. Owing to the optically reconfigurable and wavelength&#8208;aware operation between STP and LTP modes, the integrated blue feature extraction and target recognition can be demonstrated in a homogeneous neuromorphic vision sensor array. This work suggests a new way in developing perovskite optoelectronic transistors for highly efficient in&#8208;sensor computing.

         <title>4D&#8208;Printed Soft and Stretchable Self&#8208;Folding Cuff Electrodes for Small&#8208;Nerve Interfacing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric peripheral nerve interface that can fold itself to a cuff around small nerves during the implantation is presented. This actuation property, combined with the use of stretchable materials, makes the device robust and straightforward to use. The stimulation and recording capabilities are shown on small nerves in vivo.








Abstract
Peripheral nerve interfacing (PNI) has a high clinical potential for treating various diseases, such as obesity or diabetes. However, currently existing electrodes present challenges to the interfacing procedure, which limit their clinical application, in particular, when targeting small peripheral nerves (&lt;200&#160;&#181;m). To improve the electrode handling and implantation, a nerve interface that can fold itself to a cuff around a small nerve, triggered by the body moisture during insertion, is fabricated. This folding is achieved by printing a bilayer of a flexible polyurethane printing resin and a highly swelling sodium acrylate hydrogel using photopolymerization. When immersed in an aqueous liquid, the hydrogel swells and folds the electrode softly around the nerve. Furthermore, the electrodes are robust, can be stretched (&gt;20%), and bent to facilitate the implantation due to the use of soft and stretchable printing resins as substrates and a microcracked gold film as conductive layer. The straightforward implantation and extraction of the electrode as well as stimulation and recording capabilities on a small peripheral nerve in vivo are demonstrated. It is believed that such simple and robust to use self&#8208;folding electrodes will pave the way for bringing PNI to a broader clinical application.

         <title>Band Engineering of the Second Phase to Reach High Thermoelectric Performance in Cu2Se&#8208;based Composite Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hitherto, Cu2Se incorporated with a dispersed second phase show extremely low thermal conductivity and excellent thermoelectric properties. However, the significant mismatch in electronic band structure between the second phases and the matrix often causes a deterioration of carrier mobility. In this work, based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we adjust the electronic band structure of the second phase through doping S and Te. We find that Cu2Se0.88S0.06Te0.06 has a highly similar electronic band structure as the Cu2Se matrix, which results in high carrier mobility and power factor in Cu2Se&#8208;based composite materials. Additionally, the dispersed second phase Cu2Se0.88S0.06Te0.06, dislocations, and nano&#8208;grains are observed in the Cu2Se/5wt% Cu2Se0.88S0.06Te0.06 product, which leads to a substantial reduction in the thermal conductivity. Finally, a high zT value of 2.04 (by Dulong&#8208;Petit heat capacity) and 2.34 (by DSC measured heat capacity) are achieved at 850 K, which is about 65% higher than that of Cu2Se in this work and comparable to the recently reported p&#8208;type Cu2Se with outstanding performance.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitherto, Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se incorporated with a dispersed second phase show extremely low thermal conductivity and excellent thermoelectric properties. However, the significant mismatch in electronic band structure between the second phases and the matrix often causes a deterioration of carrier mobility. In this work, based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we adjust the electronic band structure of the second phase through doping S and Te. We find that Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;0.88&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;0.06&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;0.06&lt;/sub&gt; has a highly similar electronic band structure as the Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se matrix, which results in high carrier mobility and power factor in Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se-based composite materials. Additionally, the dispersed second phase Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;0.88&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;0.06&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;0.06&lt;/sub&gt;, dislocations, and nano-grains are observed in the Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se/5wt% Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;0.88&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;0.06&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;0.06&lt;/sub&gt; product, which leads to a substantial reduction in the thermal conductivity. Finally, a high &lt;i&gt;zT&lt;/i&gt; value of 2.04 (by Dulong-Petit heat capacity) and 2.34 (by DSC measured heat capacity) are achieved at 850 K, which is about 65% higher than that of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se in this work and comparable to the recently reported p-type Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se with outstanding performance.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Intrinsically Stretchable Polymer Semiconductors with Good Ductility and High Charge Mobility through Reducing the Central Symmetry of the Conjugated Backbone Units</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable polymer semiconductors are highly demanding for flexible electronics. However, it still remains challenging to achieve synergy between intrinsic stretchability and charge transport property properly for polymer semiconductors. In this paper, we report terpolymers (see Scheme 1) as intrinsically stretchable polymeric semiconductors with good ductility and high charge mobility simultaneously by incorporation of non&#8208;centrosymmetric spiro[cycloalkane&#8208;1,9'&#8208;fluorene] (spiro&#8208;fluorene) units into the backbone of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based conjugated polymers. The results reveal that these terpolymers show obviously high crack onset strains and their tensile moduli are remarkably reduced, by comparing with the parent DPP&#8208;based conjugated polymer without spiro&#8208;fluorene units. They exhibit simultaneously high charge mobilities (&gt;1.0 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1) at 100% strain and even after repeated stretching and releasing cycles for 500 times under 50% strain. The terpolymer P2, in which cyclopropane is linked to the spiro&#8208;fluorene unit, is among the best reported intrinsically stretchable polymer semiconductors with record mobility up to 3.1 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 at even 150% strain and 1.4 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 after repeated stretching and releasing cycles for 1000 times. The random presence of non&#8208;centrosymmetric spiro&#8208;fluorene units in the backbones results in the reduction of thin film crystallinity on the basis of two&#8208;dimensional grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) and absorption spectral data. However, the respective interchain lamellar and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distances are shortened because the spiro&#8208;fluorene units contain no bulky alkyl chains. Such microstructures of thin films of these terpolymers satisfy the structural requirements for stretchability and charge mobility simultaneously.

         <title>Optimizing the Pd Sites in Pure Metallic Aerogels for Efficient Electrocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Decentralized electrochemical production of H2O2 is an attractive alternative to the industrial anthraquinone process, the application of which is hindered by the lack of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts in acidic media. Herein, we report a novel catalyst design strategy to optimize the Pd sites in pure metallic aerogels by tuning their geometric environments and electronic structures. By increasing the Hg content in the Pd&#8208;Hg aerogels, the Pd&#8208;Pd coordination is gradually diminished, resulting in isolated, single&#8208;atom&#8208;like Pd motifs in the Pd2Hg5 aerogel. Further heterometal doping leads to a series of M&#8208;Pd2Hg5 aerogels with an unalterable geometric environment, which allows us to solely investigate the electronic effects. Combining theoretical and experimental analysis, a volcano relationship has been obtained for the M&#8208;Pd2Hg5 aerogels, demonstrating an effective tunability of the electronic structure of the Pd active sites. The optimized Au&#8208;Pd2Hg5 aerogel exhibits an outstanding H2O2 selectivity of 92.8% as well as transferred electron numbers of &#8764;2.1 in the potential range of 0.0 &#8211; 0.4 VRHE. Our work opens a door for designing metallic aerogel electrocatalysts for H2O2 production and highlights the importance of electronic effects in tuning electrocatalytic performances.

         <title>Rational Design of Polymethine Dyes with NIR&#8208;II Emission and High Photothermal Conversion Efficiency for Multimodal&#8208;Imaging&#8208;Guided Photo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymethine dyes with second near&#8208;infrared emission and photoacoustic imaging capability are synthesized by the electronic&#8208;donor group regulation strategy, which demonstrates high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE = 81.1%) as an antitumor stategy in vivo and in vitro under the multimodal imaging guidance; theoretical calculation reveals the structure regulation mechanism for the polymethine&#8208;based phototheranostic agent to achieve an excellent PCE.








Abstract
Phototheranostics have emerged and flourished as a promising pattern for cancer theranostics owing to their precise photoinduced diagnosis and therapeutic to meet the demands of precision medicine. The diagnosis information and therapeutic effect are directly determined by the fluorescence imaging ability and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of phototheranostic agents. Hence, how to balance the competitive radiative and nonradiative processes of phototheranostic agents is the key factor to evaluate the phototheranostic effect. Herein, molecules named ICRs with high photostaibility&#160; are rationally designed, exhibiting fluorescence emission in the second near&#8208;infrared window&#160;(NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700 nm) and high PCE,&#160;which are related to the strong donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) interaction and high reorganization energy&#160;Noteworthily, ICR&#8208;Qu with stronger D&#8211;A interaction and a&#160;large&#8208;sized conjugated unit encapsulated in nanoparticles exhibits high PCE (81.1%). In&#160;addition, ICR&#8208;QuNPs are used for fluorescence imaging (FLI), photoacoustic imaging (PAI), and photothermal imaging (PTI) to guide deep&#8208;tissue photonic hyperthermia, achieving precise removal and inhibition of breast cancer. Furthermore, combined with &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;1, ICR&#8208;QuNPs show huge potential to be a facile and efficient tool for photo&#8208;immunotherapy. More importantly, this study not only reports an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; polymethine&#8208;based phototheranostic agent, but also sheds light on the exploration of versatile organic molecules for future practical applications.

         <title>A Physiologically Responsive Nanocomposite Hydrogel for Treatment of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma via Proteolysis&#8208;Targeting Chimeras Enhanced Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PP&#8208;RC&#8208;H hydrogel confers potent immuno&#8208; and bio&#8208;chemotherapeutic effects against tumor growth and metastasis by exploiting multiple known vulnerabilities of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This synergistic strategy reverses the immunosuppressive microenvironment in tumor tissues for immunotherapy and also used a proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras drug and paclitaxel to induce tumor apoptosis and suppression of immune escape to further promote the immunotherapy against HNSCC.








Abstract
Although immunotherapy has revolutionized oncotherapy, only &#8776;15% of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients benefit from the current therapies. An immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and dysregulation of the polycomb ring finger oncogene BMI1 are potential reasons for the failure. Herein, to promote immunotherapeutic efficacy against HNSCC, an injectable nanocomposite hydrogel is developed with a polymer framework (PLGA&#8208;PEG&#8208;PLGA) that is loaded with both imiquimod encapsulated CaCO3 nanoparticles (RC) and cancer cell membrane (CCM)&#8208;coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles containing a peptide&#8208;based proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTAC) for BMI1 and paclitaxel (PepM@PacC). Upon injection, this nanocomposite hydrogel undergoes in situ gelation, after which it degrades in the TME over time, releasing RC and PepM@PacC nanoparticles to respectively perform immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Specifically, the RC particles selectively manipulate tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and dendritic cells to activate a T&#8208;cell immune response, while CCM&#8208;mediated homologous targeting and endocytosis delivers the PepM@PacC particles into cancer cells, where endogenous glutathione promotes disulfide bond cleavage to release the PROTAC peptide for BMI1 degradation and frees the paclitaxel from the particle pores to elicit apoptosis meanwhile enhance immunotherapy. Thus, the nanocomposite hydrogel, which is designed to exploit multiple known vulnerabilities of HNSCC, succeeds in suppressing both growth and metastasis of HNSCC.

Thus, the nanocomposite hydrogel, which is designed to exploit multiple known vulnerabilities of HNSCC, succeeds in suppressing both growth and metastasis of HNSCC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>21.15%&#8208;Efficiency and Stable &#947;&#8201;&#8208;CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by an Acyloin Ligand</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acyloin ligand (1,2&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;dione (DED)) is developed to construct &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Comprehensive characterizations confirm that the&#160;carbonyl and thienyl in DED can synergistically bind with Pb2+&#8208;related defects by forming a&#160;chelate (one DED bind with two Pb2+ ions), yielding a stable &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3 film. Consequently, DED&#8208;CsPbI3 yields a champion PCE of 21.15% among the reported CsPbI3 PSCs to date.








Abstract
Cesium lead triiodide (CsPbI3) is a promising light&#8208;absorbing material for constructing perovskite solar cells (PSCs) owing to its favorable bandgap and thermal tolerance. However, the high density of defects in the CsPbI3 film not only act as recombination centers, but also facilitate ion migration, leading to lower PCE and inferior stability compared with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid PSC counterpart. Theoretical analyses suggest that the effective suppression of defects in CsPbI3 film is helpful for improving the device performance. Herein, the stable and efficient &#947;&#8201;&#8208;CsPbI3 PSCs are demonstrated by developing an&#160;acyloin ligand (1,2&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;dione (DED)) as a&#160;phase stabilizer and defect passivator. The experiment and calculation results confirm that carbonyl and thienyl in DED can synergistically interact with CsPbI3 by forming a&#160;chelate to effectively passivate Pb&#8208;related defects and further suppress ion migration. Consequently, DED&#8208;treated CsPbI3 PSCs yield a champion PCE of 21.15%, which is one of the highest PCE among all the reported CsPbI3 PSCs to date. In addition, the unencapsulated DED&#8208;CsPbI3 PSC can retain 94.9% of itsinitial PCE when stored under ambient conditions for 1000&#160;h and 92.8% of its initial PCE under constant illumination for 250&#160;h.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Localized Vibrations at Complex Grain Boundaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Localized measurements of vibrations in the dislocation cores of a complex grain boundary are correlated with structure and nonstoichiometry using monochromated electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope. The experimental results are correlated with density functional theory calculations to understand the atomistic influence of the unique structure and chemistry of grain boundary dislocations and their influence on atomic vibrations.








Abstract
Grain boundaries (GBs) are a prolific microstructural feature that dominates the functionality of a wide class of materials. The functionality at a GB results from the unique atomic arrangements, different from those in the grain, that have driven extensive experimental and theoretical studies correlating atomic&#8208;scale GB structures to macroscopic electronic, infrared optical, and thermal properties. In this work, a SrTiO3 GB is examined using atomic&#8208;resolution aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and ultrahigh&#8208;energy&#8208;resolution monochromated electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy, in conjunction with density functional theory. This combination enables the correlation of the GB structure, nonstoichiometry, and chemical bonding with a redistribution of vibrational states within the GB dislocation cores. The new experimental access to localized GB vibrations provides a direct route to quantifying the impact of individual boundaries on macroscopic properties.

         <title>Electric Control of Two&#8208;Dimensional Van Hove Singularity in Oxide Ultra&#8208;Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Divergent density of states (DOS) can induce extraordinary phenomena such as significant enhancement of superconductivity and unexpected phase transitions. Moreover, van Hove singularities (VHSs) lead to divergent DOS in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) systems. Despite recent interest in VHSs, only a few controllable cases have been reported to date. In this work, we&#160;investigate the electronic band structures of a 2D VHS with angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and control transport properties by utilizing an atomically ultra&#8208;thin SrRuO3 film. By applying electric fields with alkali metal deposition and ionic&#8208;liquid gating methods, we&#160;precisely control the 2D VHS, and the sign of the charge carrier. Use of a tunable 2D VHS in an atomically flat oxide film could serve as a new strategy to realize infinite DOS near the Fermi level, thereby allowing efficient tuning of electric properties.

         <title>Designed concave octahedron heterostructures decode distinct metabolic patterns of epithelial ovarian tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a polyfactorial process associated with alterations in metabolic pathways. High&#8208;performance screening tool for EOC is in high demand to improve prognostic outcome but still missing. Here, we develop a concave octahedron Mn2O3/(Co, Mn)(Co, Mn)2O4 (MO/CMO) composite with a heterojunction, rough surface, hollow interior, and sharp corners to record metabolic patterns of ovarian tumors with laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometer (LDI MS). The MO/CMO composites with multiple physical effects induce enhanced light absorption, preferred charge transfer, increased photothermal conversion and selective trapping of small molecules. The MO/CMO shows &#8764;2&#8208;5&#8208;fold signal enhancement compared to mono&#8208; or dual&#8208;enhancement counterparts, and &#8764;10&#8208;48&#8208;fold compared to the commercialized products. Subsequently, serum metabolic fingerprints of ovarian tumors are revealed by MO/CMO assisted LDI&#8208;MS, achieving high reproducibility of direct serum detection without treatment. Furthermore, machine learning of the metabolic fingerprints distinguishes malignant ovarian tumors from benign controls with the area under the curve value of 0.987. Finally, we screen seven metabolites associated with the progression of ovarian tumors as potential biomarkers. Our approach guides the future depiction of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art matrix for intensive MS detection and accelerates the growth of nanomaterials&#8208;based platforms toward precision diagnosis scenarios.

Abstract
The emergence of plastic electronics satisfies the increasing demand for flexible electronics. However, it has caused severe ecological problems. Flexible electronics based on natural materials are increasingly to hopefully realize the &#8220;green&#8221; and eco&#8208;friendly concept. In this study, recent advances in the design and fabrication of green flexible electronics are reviewed. First, this review comprehensively introduces various natural materials and derivatives, focusing particularly on fibroin and silk, wood and paper, plants, and biomass. Second, fabrication techniques for modifying natural materials, including physical and chemical methods, are presented, after which their merits and demerits are thoroughly discussed. Green flexible electronics based on natural materials, comprising electrical wires/electrodes, antennas, thermal management devices, transistors, memristors, sensors, energy harvesting devices, energy storage devices, displays, actuators, electromagnetic shielding, and integration systems, are described in detail. Finally, perspectives on the existing challenges and opportunities to employ natural materials in green flexible electronics are presented.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Carbon using Commodity Polypropylene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Carbon materials are essential to the development of modern society with indispensable use in various applications, such as energy storage and high&#8208;performance composites. Despite great progress, on&#8208;demand carbon manufacturing with control over three&#8208;dimensional (3D) macroscopic configuration is still an intractable challenge, hindering their direct use in many areas requiring structured materials and products. This work introduces a simple and scalable method to generate complex, large&#8208;scale carbon structures using easily accessible materials and technologies. 3D&#8208;printed, commercial polypropylene (PP) parts can be thermally stabilized through cracking&#8208;facilitated diffusion and crosslinking. This newly elucidated mechanism from our work allows thick PP parts to yield carbonaceous products with complex structures through a subsequent pyrolysis step. Our approach for enabling PP&#8208;to&#8208;carbon conversion has consistent product yield and controlled dimensional shrinkage. Under optimized processing conditions, these PP&#8208;derived carbons exhibit robust mechanical properties and excellent joule heating performance, demonstrated by their versatile use as heating elements. Furthermore, this process can be extended to recycled PP, enabling the conversion of waste plastic materials to value&#8208;added products. This work provides an innovative approach to create structured carbon materials with direct access to complex geometry, which can be transformative to, and broadly benefit, many important technological applications.

         <title>Sub&#8208;nanosecond two&#8208;dimensional perovskite scintillators by dielectric engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite materials have demonstrated great potential for ultrafast scintillators with high light yield. However, the decay time of perovskite still could not be further minimized into sub&#8208;nanosecond region, while sub&#8208;nanosecond scintillators are highly demanded in various radiation detection, including high&#8208;speed X&#8208;ray imaging, time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (TOF) based tomography or particle discrimination, and timing resolution measurement in synchrotron radiation facilities, etc.. Here, we show a rational design strategy to shorten the scintillation decay time by maximizing the dielectric difference between organic amines and Pb&#8208;Br octahedral emitters in 2D organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHP). Benzimidazole (BM) with low dielectric constant inserted between [PbBr6]2&#8722; layers, resulting in a surprisingly large exciton binding energy (360.3&#177;4.8 meV) of 2D OIHP BM2PbBr4. The emitting decay time is shortened as 0.97&#160;ns, which is smallest among all the perovskite materials. Moreover, the light yield is 3,190 photons/MeV, which is greatly higher than conventional ultrafast scintillator BaF2 (1,500 photons/MeV). The rare combination of ultrafast decay time and considerable light yield renders BM2PbBr4 excellent performance in &#947;&#8208;ray, neutron, &#945;&#8208;particle detection, and the best theoretical coincidence time resolution (CTR) of 65.1&#160;ps, which is only half of the refence sample LYSO (141.3&#160;ps).

         <title>Exploring Optimal Water Splitting Bifunctional Alloy Catalyst by Pareto Active Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Design of bifunctional multi&#8208;metallic alloy catalysts, which are one of the most promising candidates for water splitting, has been a significant issue for the efficient production of renewable energy. Owing to large dimensions of the components and composition of multi&#8208;metallic alloys, as well as the trade&#8208;off behavior in terms of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential for bifunctional catalysts, it is difficult to search for high&#8208;performance bifunctional catalysts with multi&#8208;metallic alloys using conventional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error experiments. In this study, an optimal bifunctional catalyst for water splitting was obtained by combining Pareto active learning and experiments, where 110 experimental data points out of 77,946 possible points led to effective model development. The as&#8208;obtained bifunctional catalysts for HER and OER exhibited high performance, which was revealed by model development using Pareto active learning; among the catalysts, an optimal catalyst (Pt0.15Pd0.30Ru0.30Cu0.25) exhibited a water splitting behavior of 1.56 V at a current density of 10 mA/cm2. This study opens avenues for the efficient exploration of multi&#8208;metallic alloys, which can be applied in multifunctional catalysts as well as in other applications.

         <title>Unveiling the Morphological and Physical Mechanism of Burn&#8208;in Loss Alleviation by Ternary Matrix Towards Stable and Efficient All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (All&#8208;PSCs) are considered the most promising candidate in achieving both efficient and stable organic photovoltaic devices, yet the field has rarely presented in&#8208;depth understanding of corresponding device stability while efficiency is continuously boosted via the innovation of polymer acceptors. Herein, we build a ternary matrix for all&#8208;PSCs with optimized morphology, improved film ductility and importantly, boosted efficiency and better operational stability than its parental binary counterparts, as a platform to study the underlying mechanism. The target system PQM&#8208;Cl:PTQ10:PY&#8208;IT (0.8:0.2:1.2) exhibits an alleviated burn&#8208;in loss of morphology and efficiency under light soaking, which supports its promoted device lifetime. The comprehensive characterizations of fresh and light&#8208;soaked active layers lead us to a clear illustration of opposite morphological and physical degradation direction of PQM&#8208;Cl and PTQ10, thus resulting in a delicate balance at the optimal ternary system. Specifically, the enlarging tendency of PQM&#8208;Cl and shrinking preference of PTQ10 in terms of phase separation leads to a stable morphology in their mixing phase; the hole transfer kinetics of PQM&#8208;Cl:PY&#8208;IT host is stabilized by incorporating PTQ10. This work succeeds in reaching a deep insight of all&#8208;PSC's stability promotion by a rational ternary design, which booms the prospect of gaining high&#8208;performance all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>A Materials Acceleration Platform for Organic Laser Discovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The accelerated discovery of two molecules with a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic laser performance from screening 40&#160;candidates is made possible by the introduction of an automated platform encompassing automated synthesis, product identification, and optical characterization that can be run fully end&#8208;to&#8208;end. These promising results show the potential of automated synthesis and accelerated discovery of materials.








Abstract
Conventional materials discovery is a laborious and time&#8208;consuming process that can take decades from initial conception of the material to commercialization. Recent developments in materials acceleration platforms promise to accelerate materials discovery using automation of experiments coupled with machine learning. However, most of the automation efforts in chemistry focus on synthesis and compound identification, with integrated target property characterization receiving less attention. In this work, an automated platform is introduced for the discovery of molecules as gain mediums for organic semiconductor lasers, a problem that has been challenging for conventional approaches. This platform encompasses automated lego&#8208;like synthesis, product identification, and optical characterization that can be executed in a fully integrated end&#8208;to&#8208;end fashion. Using this workflow to screen organic laser candidates, discovered eight potential candidates for organic lasers is discovered. The lasing threshold of four molecules in thin&#8208;film devices and find two molecules with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance is tested. These promising results show the potential of automated synthesis and screening for accelerated materials development.

         <title>Thermally Driven Point Defect Transformation in Antimony Selenosulfide Photovoltaic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energetic ions in the hydrothermal deposition lead to deep&#8208;level defects with high formation energy, while post&#8208;annealing with prolonged time enables defect transformation from high to low formation energy.

Thermal treatment of inorganic thin films is a general and necessary step to facilitate crystallization and, in particular, to regulate the formation of point defects. Understanding the dependence of the defect formation mechanism on the annealing process is a critical challenge in terms of designing material synthesis approaches for obtaining desired optoelectronic properties. Herein, a mechanistic understanding of the evolution of defects in emerging Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell films is presented. A top&#8208;efficiency Sb2(S,Se)3 solar&#8208;cell film is adopted in this study to consolidate this investigation. This study reveals that, under hydrothermal conditions, the as&#8208;deposited Sb2(S,Se)3 film generates defects with a high formation energy, demonstrating kinetically favorable defect formation characteristics. Annealing at elevated temperatures leads to a two&#8208;step defect transformation process: 1) formation of sulfur and selenium vacancy defects, followed by 2) migration of antimony ions to fill the vacancy defects. This process finally results in the generation of cation&#8211;anion antisite defects, which exhibit low formation energy, suggesting a thermodynamically favorable defect formation feature. This study establishes a new strategy for the fundamental investigation of the evolution of deep&#8208;level defects in metal chalcogenide films and provides guidance for designing material synthesis strategies in terms of defect control.

&lt;p&gt;Energetic ions in the hydrothermal deposition lead to deep-level defects with high formation energy, while post-annealing with prolonged time enables defect transformation from high to low formation energy. A general principle regarding kinetically and thermodynamically controlled defect formation is uncovered and a guidance for materials synthesis is provided.

         <title>Surfactant&#8208;Assisted Sulfonated Covalent Organic Nanosheets: Extrinsic Charge for Improved Ion Transport and Salinity&#8208;Gradient Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient ion transport through nanofluidic channels is critical to electrochemical energy conversion technology, however, limited by low intrinsic surface charges of channels. Herein, the tunable incorporations of extrinsic surface charge is demonstrated to improve ion transport properties, which are achieved by assembly of ionic surfactant and covalent organic nanosheets. The optimized ion channels exhibit a high&#8208;efficiency salinity&#8208;gradient energy conversion.








Abstract
Charge&#8208;governed ion transport is the vital property of nanofluidic channels for salinity&#8208;gradient energy harvesting and other electrochemical energy conversion technologies. 2D nanofluidic channels constructed by nanosheets exhibit great superiority in ion selectivity, but a high ion transport rate remains challenging due to the insufficiency of intrinsic surface charge density in nanoconfinement. Herein, extrinsic surface charge into nanofluidic channels composed of surfactant&#8208;assisted sulfonated covalent organic nanosheets (SCONs), which enable tunable ion transport behaviors, is demonstrated. The polar moiety of surfactant is embedded in SCONs to adjust in&#8208;plane surface charges, and the aggregation of nonpolar moiety results in the sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel transformation of SCON solution for membrane fabrication. The combination endows SCON/surfactant membranes with considerable water&#8208;resistance, and the designable extrinsic charges promise fast ion transport and high ion selectivity. Additionally, the SCON/surfactant membrane, serving as a power generator, exhibits huge potential in harvesting salinity&#8208;gradient energy where corresponding output power density can reach up to 9.08&#160;W m&#8722;2 under a 50&#8208;fold salinity gradient (0.5&#160;m NaCl|0.01&#160;m NaCl). The approach to extrinsic surface charge provides new and promising insight into regulating ion transport behaviors.

         <title>Colored Silicon Heterojunction Solar Cells Exceeding 23.5% Efficiency Enabled by Luminescent Down&#8208;Shift Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, high photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) quantum dot (QD) films with different emission wavelengths are deposited on (silicon heterojunction) SHJ solar cells to alleviate the parasitic short&#8208;wavelength light absorption through the luminescence down&#8208;shift process. By utilizing inkjet printing technology, color&#8208;patterned SHJ solar cells are achieved, which can maintain a power conversion efficiency of 23.5% for more than 4 months.








Abstract
Colored solar panels, realized by depositing various reflection layers or structures, are emerging as power sources for building with visual aesthetics. However, these panels suffer from reduced photocurrent generation due to the less efficient light harvesting from visible light reflection and degraded power conversion efficiency (PCE). Here, color&#8208;patterned silicon heterojunction solar cells are achieved by incorporating luminescent quantum dots (QDs) with high quantum yields as light converters to realize an asthenic appearance with high PCE. It is found that large bandgap (blue) QD layers can convert UV light into visible light, which can notably alleviate the parasitic absorption by the front indium tin oxide and doped amorphous silicon. Additionally, a universal optical path model is proposed to understand the light transmission process, which is suitable for luminescent down&#8208;shift devices. In this study, solar cells with a PCE exceeding 23.5% are achieved using the combination of a blue QD layer and a top low refractive index anti&#8208;reflection layer. Based on our&#160;best knoledge,the obtained PCE is the highest for a color&#8208;patterned solar cell. The results suggest an enhanced strategy involving incorporation of luminescent QDs with an optical path design for high&#8208;performance photovoltaic panels with visual aesthetics.

         <title>Lightweight 3D Graphene Metamaterials with Tunable Negative Thermal Expansion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A negatively thermal expanded 3D graphene metamaterial is created through a hyperbolically oriented freezing strategy under a dual temperature gradient along with orthogonal directions after &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking&#8208;derived assembly among 2D graphene sheets. It has demonstrated tunable negative thermal expansion. Both experimental investigation and numerical simulation have cooperatively revealed the evolution mechanism of thermal&#8208;induced deformation at multiscale.








Abstract
In this study, a 3D graphene metamaterial (GM) showing negative thermal expansion is prepared using a strategy of hyperbolically oriented freezing under a dual temperature gradient along orthogonal directions after the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking&#8208;derived assembly of 2D graphene sheets. As the fundamental construction element of the 3D GM, the graphene sheet displays anomalous shrinking deformation with a thermal expansion coefficient of (&#8722;6.12 &#177; 0.28) &#215; 10&#8722;6 that is triggered by thermally induced out&#8208;of&#8208;plane vibrations of the C&#63743;C bonds. A combination of numerical simulations and experimental investigations validates that anomalous negative thermal expansion (NTE) behavior can be effectively delivered to scalable 3D GM candidates at larger dimensions beyond the basic 2D graphene sheets at the microscale. The multiscale design and optimization of the structural characterization of the 3D GM further realize the desirable regulation of the NTE performance with the NTE coefficient ranging from negative ((&#8722;7.5&#177; 0.65) &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1) to near&#8208;zero values ((&#8722;0.8 &#177; 0.25) &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1). This is attributed to the NTE&#8208;derived release regulation of the primary stress/strain of the microstructure, and the 3D GM exhibits high thermal stability while preserving the desirable structural robustness and fatigue resistance under thermo&#8208;mechanical coupling conditions. Therefore, this 3D GM offers promising potential for applications as protective skin, thermal actuator, smart switcher, and packing filler.

         <title>Switchable Polyacrylonitrile&#8208;Copolymer for Melt&#8208;Processing and Thermal Carbonization&#8212;3D Printing of Carbon Supercapacitor Electrodes with High Capacitance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyacrylonitrile copolymer is 3D patterned using melt&#8208;extrusion&#8208;based additive manufacturing. During prestabilization the structure is made infusible allowing thermal stabilization and carbonization without remelting. 3D printed grid&#8208;type supercapacitor electrodes exhibit high capacitance of up to 387 mF cm&#8722;2 after activation.








Abstract
Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) represents the most widely used precursor for carbon fibers and carbon materials. Carbon materials stand out with their high mechanical performance, but they also show excellent electrical conductivity and high surface area. These properties render carbon materials suitable as electrode material for fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors. However, PAN has to be processed from solution before being thermally converted to carbon, limiting its final format to fibers, films, and non&#8208;wovens. Here, a PAN&#8208;copolymer with an intrinsic plasticizer is presented to reduce the melting temperature and avoid undesired entering of the thermal carbonization regime. This plasticizer enables melt extrusion&#8208;based additive manufacturing (EAM). The plasticizer in the PAN&#8208;copolymer can be switched to increase the melting temperature after processing, allowing the 3D&#8208;melt&#8208;printed workpiece to be thermally carbonized after EAM. Melt&#8208;processing of the PAN copolymer extends the freedom&#8208;in&#8208;design of carbon materials to mold&#8208;free rapid prototyping, in the absence of solvents, which enables more economic and sustainable manufacturing processes. As an example for the capability of this material system, open meshed carbon electrodes are printed for supercapacitors that are metal&#8208; and binder&#8208;free with an optimized thickness of 1.5&#160;mm and a capacitance of up to 387 mF cm&#8722;2.

During prestabilization the structure is made infusible allowing thermal stabilization and carbonization without remelting. 3D printed grid-type supercapacitor electrodes exhibit high capacitance of up to 387 mF cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; after activation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) represents the most widely used precursor for carbon fibers and carbon materials. Carbon materials stand out with their high mechanical performance, but they also show excellent electrical conductivity and high surface area. These properties render carbon materials suitable as electrode material for fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors. However, PAN has to be processed from solution before being thermally converted to carbon, limiting its final format to fibers, films, and non-wovens. Here, a PAN-copolymer with an intrinsic plasticizer is presented to reduce the melting temperature and avoid undesired entering of the thermal carbonization regime. This plasticizer enables melt extrusion-based additive manufacturing (EAM). The plasticizer in the PAN-copolymer can be switched to increase the melting temperature after processing, allowing the 3D-melt-printed workpiece to be thermally carbonized after EAM. Melt-processing of the PAN copolymer extends the freedom-in-design of carbon materials to mold-free rapid prototyping, in the absence of solvents, which enables more economic and sustainable manufacturing processes. As an example for the capability of this material system, open meshed carbon electrodes are printed for supercapacitors that are metal- and binder-free with an optimized thickness of 1.5&#160;mm and a capacitance of up to 387 mF cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Natural Shaping of Acellular Dermal Matrices for Implant&#8208;Based Breast Reconstruction via Expansile Kirigami</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An expansile kirigami acellular dermal matrix (ADM) offers natural shaping of implant&#8208;based breast reconstruction with securely holding the implant. Guided by finite element modeling, stretchability, curvature, and elasticity of kirigami ADM is precisely controlled. The developed kirigami ADM potentially offers patient&#8208;specific reconstruction while minimizing operative time and cost.








Abstract
To complete a successful and aesthetic breast reconstruction for breast cancer survivors, tissue reinforcing acellular dermal matrices (ADMs) are widely utilized to create slings/pockets to keep breast implants or autologous tissue transfer secured against the chest wall in the desired location. However, ADM sheets are 2D and cannot completely cover the entire implant without wrinkles. Here, guided by finite element modeling, a kirigami strategy is presented to cut the ADM sheets with locally and precisely controlled stretchability, curvature, and elasticity. Upon expansion, a single kirigami ADM sheet can conformably wrap the implant regardless of the shape and size, forming a natural teardrop shape; contour cuts prescribe the topographical height and fractal cuts in the center ensures horizontal expandability and thus conformability. This kirigami ADM can provide support to the reconstructed breast in the desired regions, potentially offering optimal outcomes and patient&#8208;specific reconstruction, while minimizing operative time and cost.

         <title>Regulating Charge Carrier Recombination in the Interconnecting Layer to Boost the Efficiency and Stability of Monolithic Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;dynamic management strategy for inorganic perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (TSCs) is conducted to narrow the hole/electron density offset in the interconnecting layer, which contributes to a balanced charge carrier recombination thus reducing the energy loss of the TSCs. A promising 23.17% power conversion efficiency, an ultrahigh open&#8208;circuit voltage of 2.15&#160;V, and robust operational stability are obtained.








Abstract
The charge carriers of single&#8208;junction solar cells can be fluently extracted and then collected by electrodes, leading to weak charge carrier accumulation and low energy loss (Eloss). However, in tandem solar cells (TSCs), it is a considerable challenge to obtain a balance between the densities of the holes and electrons extracted from the two respective subcells to facilitate an efficient recombination in the interconnecting layer (ICL). Herein, a charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;dynamic management strategy for inorganic perovskite/organic TSCs is proposed, centered on the simultaneous regulation of the defect states of CsPbI1.9Br1.1 perovskite in the front subcell and hole transport ability from the perovskite to ICL. The target hole density on the perovskite surface and the hole loss before reaching the ICL are significantly improved. As a result, the hole/electron density offset in the ICL can be effectively narrowed, leading to a balanced charge carrier recombination, which reduces the Eloss in TSCs. The resulting inorganic perovskite/organic 0.062&#8208;cm2 TSC exhibits a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.17% with an ultrahigh open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 2.15&#160;V, and the PCE of the 1.004&#8208;cm2 device (21.69%) exhibited a weak size&#8208;dependence. This charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;dynamic management strategy can also effectively enhance the operational and ultraviolet&#8208;light stabilities of the TSCs.

         <title>Enabling Durable Ultralow&#8208;k Capacitors with Enhanced Breakdown Strength in Density&#8208;Variant Nanolattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density&#8208;variant nanolattices exhibit bi&#8208;phase deformation by which the lower&#8208;density region protects the higher&#8208;density region, acquiring high strength, and ductility like composites. This deformation improves the electrical breakdown strength of the density&#8208;variant nanolattice by &#8776;3.3&#8208;fold of the uniform&#8208;density nanolattice, while maintaining the ultralow&#8208;k&#160;of &#8776;1.2 with complete electric and dielectric stability and recoverability during 100 cyclic compressions to 62.5% strain.








Abstract
Ultralow&#8208;k materials used in high voltage devices require mechanical resilience and electrical and dielectric stability even when subjected to mechanical loads. Existing devices with organic polymers suffer from low thermal and mechanical stability while those with inorganic porous structures struggle with poor mechanical integrity. Recently, 3D hollow&#8208;beam nanolattices have emerged as promising candidates that satisfy these requirements. However, their properties are maintained for only five stress cycles at strains below 25%. Here,&#160;we&#160;demonstrate that alumina nanolattices with different relative density distributions across their height elicit a deterministic mechanical response concomitant with a 1.5&#8211;3.3 times higher electrical breakdown strength than nanolattices with uniform density. These density&#8208;variant nanolattices exhibit an ultralow&#8208;k of &#8776;1.2, accompanied by complete electric and dielectric stability and mechanical recoverability over 100 cyclic compressions to 62.5% strain.&#160;We&#160;explain the enhanced insulation and long&#8208;term cyclical stability by the bi&#8208;phase deformation where the lower&#8208;density region protects the higher&#8208;density region as it is compressed before the higher&#8208;density region, allowing to simultaneously possess high strength and ductility like composites. This study highlights the superior electrical performance of the bi&#8208;phase nanolattice with a single interface in providing stable conduction and maximum breakdown strength.

         <title>Synthesis of L10&#8208;Iron Triad (Fe, Co, Ni)/Pt Intermetallic Electrocatalysts via a Phosphide&#8208;Induced Structural Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a novel synthesis of L10&#8208;iron triad (Fe, Co, Ni)/Pt nanoparticles as ORR electrocatalysts by using phosphide intermediate&#8208;induced structural phase transition. The formation of the L10 structure depends on the abundant P vacancies to accelerate the Pt diffusion into the M(iron triad)&#8208;rich skeletons, instead of the traditional route of intermetallic from solid solution.








Abstract
Structurally ordered L10&#8208;iron triad (Fe, Co, Ni)/Pt with a M(iron triad)/Pt ratio &#8776;1:1 has drawn increasing attention in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis and fuel cell technologies by virtue of the high performance derived from their strong surface strain. However, the synthesis of intermetallic L10&#8208;M(iron triad)Pt generally requires the accurate content control of the multicomponent and the sufficient thermal energy to overcome the kinetic barrier for atom diffusion. This work reports a synthesis of sub &#8776;5&#160;nm L10&#8208;intermetallic nanoparticles using phosphide intermediate&#8208;induced structural phase transition. Taking the L10&#8208;CoPt intermetallic, for example, the formation of the L10 structure depends on the Co2P intermediates can provide abundant P vacancies to accelerate the Pt diffusion into the orthorhombic Co&#8208;rich skeletons, instead of the traditional route of intermetallic from solid solution. L10&#8208;CoPt prepared by this method has a high degree of ordering and shows the broad adaptability of various Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts with different loading and states to improve their electrocatalytic performance. Additionally, the other L10&#8208;M(iron triad)Pt intermetallics, i.e., L10&#8208;NiPt and L10&#8208;FePt, are also prepared through this phosphide&#8208;induced phase transition. The findings provide a promising strategy for designing other intermetallic materials alloy materials using a structural phase transition induced by a second phase.

Taking the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-CoPt intermetallic, for example, the formation of the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; structure depends on the Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P intermediates can provide abundant P vacancies to accelerate the Pt diffusion into the orthorhombic Co-rich skeletons, instead of the traditional route of intermetallic from solid solution. &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-CoPt prepared by this method has a high degree of ordering and shows the broad adaptability of various Pt-based electrocatalysts with different loading and states to improve their electrocatalytic performance. Additionally, the other &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;(iron triad)Pt intermetallics, i.e., &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-NiPt and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-FePt, are also prepared through this phosphide-induced phase transition. The findings provide a promising strategy for designing other intermetallic materials alloy materials using a structural phase transition induced by a second phase.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>MoS2&#8208;Mediated Epitaxial Plating of Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large area mono&#8208;oriented MoS2 is employed as the substrate for realizing epitaxial plating of zinc. The edges of MoS2 are proved to have an inducing effect on zinc deposition and thus facilitating the vertical growth of zinc. When only exposing basal plane of the large area mono&#8208;oriented MoS2, epitaxial zinc deposition with high (002) plane orientation is realized.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;based anodes (Li, Zn, etc.) are regarded as promising solutions for next&#8208;generation advanced batteries due to their high theoretical specific capacities. However, most of these metal anodes suffer from dendrite growth, which severely restricts their practical applications. Recently, epitaxial anode metal deposition by choosing a suitable substrate has received tremendous attention as an effective strategy to suppress dendrites. However, the epitaxial relationship between plated metal and the substrate has been a subject of debate. Herein, large&#8208;area, mono&#8208;orientated 2D material (MoS2) is used, for the first time, to electrodeposit truly epitaxial Zn anodes. The continuous (without edges) mono&#8208;orientated MoS2 films are shown to be an effective strategy for suppressing metal dendrites. In addition, the epitaxial nature of the electrodeposited Zn anode is proven by pole figure analysis, which provides the first demonstration of truly epitaxial Zn anode growth over large area as metal anode protection strategy through epitaxy.

         <title>A Twin S&#8208;Scheme Artificial Photosynthetic System with Self&#8208;Assembled Heterojunctions Yields Superior Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Rate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar hydrogen generation using heterojunction photocatalysts imitating natural photosynthetic systems is fast emerging. The poor charge separation and futile charge transports routes in Z&#8208;Scheme heterojunctions; however, constitute a huge bottleneck for hydrogen evolution. A Twin S&#8208;Scheme artificial photosynthetic system is developed to overcome this bottleneck, which yields an outstanding hydrogen evolution rate and high apparent quantum efficiency.








Abstract
Designing heterojunction photocatalysts imitating natural photosynthetic systems has been a promising approach for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. However, in the traditional Z&#8208;Scheme artificial photosynthetic systems, the poor charge separation, and rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers remain a huge bottleneck. To rationally design S&#8208;Scheme (i.e., Step scheme) heterojunctions by avoiding the futile charge transport routes is therefore seen as an attractive approach to achieving high hydrogen evolution rates. Herein, a twin S&#8208;scheme heterojunction is proposed involving graphitic C3N4 nanosheets self&#8208;assembled with hydrogen&#8208;doped rutile TiO2 nanorods and anatase TiO2 nanoparticles. This catalyst shows an excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 62.37&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and high apparent quantum efficiency of 45.9% at 365&#160;nm. The significant enhancement of photocatalytic performance is attributed to the efficient charge separation and transfer induced by the unique twin S&#8208;scheme structure. The charge transfer route in the twin S&#8208;scheme is confirmed by in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron spin resonance (ESR) spin&#8208;trapping tests. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectroscopy, transient&#8208;state surface photovoltage (TPV), and other ex situ characterizations further corroborate the efficient charge transport across the catalyst interface. This work offers a new perspective on constructing artificial photosynthetic systems with S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions to enhance photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Photolithography&#8208;Based Microfabrication of Biodegradable Flexible and Stretchable Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient or biodegradable flexible and stretchable devices which degrade into benign components, especially in biofluids or aqueous solutions, can pave way for the next generation of eco&#8208;friendly electronics for both industrial and medical applications. A photolithography&#8208;based approach allows highly miniaturized and scalable fabrication of flexible/stretchable biodegradable devices using standard semiconductor manufacturing techniques.








Abstract
Biodegradable sensors based on integrating conductive layers with polymeric materials in flexible and stretchable forms have been established. However, the lack of a generalized microfabrication method results in large&#8208;sized, low spatial density, and low device yield compared to the silicon&#8208;based devices manufactured via batch&#8208;compatible microfabrication processes. Here, a batch fabrication&#8208;compatible photolithography&#8208;based microfabrication approach for biodegradable and highly miniaturized essential sensor components is presented on flexible and stretchable substrates. Up to 1600 devices are fabricated within a 1 cm2 footprint and then the functionality of various biodegradable passive electrical components, mechanical sensors, and chemical sensors is demonstrated on flexible and stretchable substrates. The results are highly repeatable and consistent, proving the proposed method's high device yield and high&#8208;density potential. This simple, innovative, and robust fabrication recipe allows complete freedom over the applicability of various biodegradable materials with different properties toward the unique application of interests. The process offers a route to utilize standard micro&#8208;fabrication procedures toward scalable fabrication of highly miniaturized flexible and stretchable transient sensors and electronics.

         <title>A Highly Crystalline Single Layer 2D Polymer for Low Variability and Excellent Scalability Molecular Memristors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crystalline single layer 2D polymers (SL&#8208;2DPs) are prepared and further used as an active layer in the memristor. The devices exhibit low variability, high reliability in terms of yield, stability and durability, nanometer scalability, as well as distinguished bending endurance, which verified the unambiguous role of SL&#8208;2DP film in diverse applications from high density information storage to ultra&#8208;thin flexible electronics.








Abstract
Large&#8208;scale growth of highly crystalline single layer 2D polymers (SL&#8208;2DPs) and their subsequent integration into memristors is key to advancing the development of high&#8208;density data storage devices. However, leakage problems resulting from the porous structure of 2DPs continue to make such advances extremely challenging. Herein,&#160;we&#160;overcome this issue by incorporating long alkoxy chains into key molecular building blocks to obtain a highly crystalline 2DP, as visualized by scanning tunneling microscopy, and prevent metal permeation in the subsequent device fabrication process. SL&#8208;2DP memristors constructed via direct evaporation of the top electrodes exhibit low variability (&#963;Vset&#160;= 0.14) due to the single&#8208;monomer&#8208;thick feature together with the high regular structure and coordination ability which minimizes the stochastic spatial distribution of conductive filaments (CFs) in both vertical and lateral dimensions. The variability is further decreased to 0.04 by confining the formation and fracture of CFs to the interface through the utilization of bilayer junctions. Using peak force tunneling atomic force microscopy, the nanometer scalability (&lt; 50 nm2) and low power consumption of these molecular memristor devices are demonstrated.

         <title>Perovskite Solar Cell&#8208;Gated Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Flexible Photodetectors with Ultrahigh Sensitivity and Fast Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance flexible photodetector is realized by gating an organic electrochemical transistor with a perovskite solar cell, outperforming previously reported flexible photodetectors, which can be attributed to the high transconductance of the transistor. The device can monitor photoplethysmogram signals and peripheral oxygen saturation under ambient light and even remotely. This novel device design demonstrates great potential in emerging wearable optoelectronics.








Abstract
Photodetectors (PDs) are the building block of various imaging and sensing applications. However, commercially available PDs based on crystalline inorganic semiconductors cannot meet the requirements of emerging wearable/implantable applications due to their rigidity and fragility, which creates the need for flexible devices. Here, a high&#8208;performance flexible PD is presented by gating an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) with a perovskite solar cell. Due to the ultrahigh transconductance of the OECT, the device demonstrates a high gain of &#8776;106, a fast response time of 67&#160;&#181;s and an ultrahigh detectivity of 6.7&#160;&#215;&#160;1017 Jones to light signals under a low working voltage (&#8804;0.6&#160;V). Thanks to the ultrahigh sensitivity and fast response, the device can track photoplethysmogram signals and peripheral oxygen saturation under ambient light and even provide contactless remote sensing, offering a low&#8208;power and convenient way for continuous vital signs monitoring. This work offers a novel strategy for realizing high&#8208;performance flexible PDs that are promising for low&#8208;power, user&#8208;friendly and wearable optoelectronics.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Perturbed Multiresonance TADF Emitter Enables High&#8208;Efficiency and Ultralow Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off Nonsensitized OLEDs with Pure Green Gamut</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;perturbation approach is developed for boosting the reverse intersystem crossing rate of multiresonance type B&#8211;N molecule by utilizing the spin&#8211;orbit coupling effect of a gold atom. The resultant emitter exhibits a short&#8208;lived thermally activated delayed fluorescence, which enables the fabrication of high&#8208;performance nonsensitized organic light&#8208;emitting diode with a high external quantum efficiency, little efficiency roll&#8208;off, and good color purity.








Abstract
Multiresonance (MR)&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters based on B&#8208; and N&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatics are desirable for ultrahigh&#8208;definition organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and narrow bandwidth. But the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rates of MR&#8208;TADF emitters are usually small, resulting in severe device efficiency roll&#8208;off at high brightness. To solve this issue, a sensitizer for the MR&#8208;TADF emitter has been required. Herein, a new MR&#8208;TADF emitter is developed through coordination of Au with B/N&#8208;embedded polycyclic ligand. Benefitting from the Au perturbation, the RISC rate is dramatically accelerated to 2.3 &#215; 107 s&#8722;1, leading to delayed fluorescence lifetime as short as 4.3 &#181;s. Meanwhile, the PLQY of 95% and full width at half maximum of 39&#160;nm (0.18&#160;eV) are essentially unchanged after metal coordination. Therefore, a high PLQY, short delayed fluorescence lifetime, and high color purity are concurrently realized in a single TADF emitter. Accordingly, vacuum&#8208;deposited OLEDs exhibit high&#8208;performance electroluminescence with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 35.8% without sensitization. The EQE is maintained as high as 32.3% at 10&#160;000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. Furthermore, solution&#8208;processed OLED based on the emitter also achieves excellent performance with a maximum EQE of 25.7% and a small efficiency roll&#8208;off.

         <title>Ferromagnetic Flexible Electronics for Brain&#8208;Wide Selective Neural Recording</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel injectable class of flexible electronics with stable recording, omnidirectional steering, and precise navigating capabilities based on remote magnetic actuation is developed. Its functionality, stability, extensibility, and biocompatibility for large&#8208;scale electrophysiological monitoring the neural activities of distinct neuron populations in the rodent brains are successfully demonstrated in this study.








Abstract
Flexible microelectronics capable of straightforward implantation, remotely controlled navigation, and stable long&#8208;term recording hold great promise in diverse medical applications, particularly in deciphering complex functions of neural circuits in the brain. Existing flexible electronics, however, are often limited in bending and buckling during implantation, and unable to access a large brain region. Here, an injectable class of electronics with stable recording, omnidirectional steering, and precise navigating capabilities based on magnetic actuation is presented. After simple transcriptional injection, the rigid coatings are biodegraded quickly and the bundles of magnetic&#8208;nanoparticles&#8208;coated microelectrodes become separated, ultra&#8208;flexible, and magnetic actuated for further minimally invasive&#160;three&#8208;dimensional&#160;interpenetration in the brain. As proof of concept, this paradigm&#8208;shifting approach is demonstrated for selective and multiplexed neural activities recording across distant regions in the deep rodent brains. Coupling with optogenetic neural stimulation, the unique capabilities of this platform in electrophysiological readouts of projection dynamics in vivo are also demonstrated. The ability of these miniaturized, remotely controllable, and biocompatible ferromagnetic flexible electronics to afford minimally invasive manipulations in the soft tissues of the mammalian brain foreshadows applications in other organ systems, with great potential for broad utility in biomedical science and engineering.

         <title>Complex Living Materials Made by Light&#8208;Based Printing of Genetically Programmed Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;based printing can be exploited to shape bacteria&#8208;laden hydrogels into complex living materials. By combining a wild&#8208;type bioluminescent bacterium with a deliberately engineered E. coli strain, a living device is printed and used as a self&#8208;powered chemical sensor that simultaneously generate and absorb light through the metabolic activity of the embedded microorganisms.








Abstract
Living materials with embedded microorganisms can genetically encode attractive sensing, self&#8208;repairing, and responsive functionalities for applications in medicine, robotics, and infrastructure. While the synthetic toolbox for genetically engineering bacteria continues to expand, technologies to shape bacteria&#8208;laden living materials into complex 3D geometries are still rather limited. Here, it is shown that bacteria&#8208;laden hydrogels can be shaped into living materials with unusual architectures and functionalities using readily available light&#8208;based printing techniques. Bioluminescent and melanin&#8208;producing bacteria are used to create complex materials with autonomous chemical&#8208;sensing capabilities by harnessing the metabolic activity of wild&#8208;type and engineered microorganisms. The shaping freedom offered by printing technologies and the rich biochemical diversity available in bacteria provides ample design space for the creation and exploration of complex living materials with programmable functionalities for a broad range of applications.

         <title>Piezoelectric 1T Phase MoSe2 Nanoflowers and Crystallographically Textured Electrodes for Enhanced Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The piezoelectric 1T MoSe2/carbon cloth (CC) nanocomposite is fabricated on a crystallographically textured electrode through a facile solvothermal method. The generated piezoelectric field can serve as the zinc&#8208;ion piezo&#8208;electrochemical coupling accelerator to promote kinetics. By virtue of intrinsic piezoelectric effect and phase engineering strategy, this nanopiezocomposite possesses enhanced kinetics and desirable electrochemical performances at low temperatures.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are regarded as promising cathode materials for zinc&#8208;ion storage owing to their large interlayer spacings. However, their capabilities are still limited by sluggish kinetics and inferior conductivities. In this study, a facile one&#8208;pot solvothermal method is exploited to vertically plant piezoelectric 1T MoSe2&#160;nanoflowers on carbon cloth (CC) to fabricate crystallographically textured electrodes. The self&#8208;built&#8208;in electric field owing to the intrinsic piezoelectricity during the intercalation/deintercalation processes can serve as an additional piezo&#8208;electrochemical coupling accelerator to enhance the migration of Zn2+. Moreover, the expanded interlayer distance (9&#8211;10&#160;&#197;), overall high hydrophilicity, and conductivity of the 1T phase MoSe2&#160;also promoted the kinetics. These advantages endow the tailored 1T MoSe2/CC nanopiezocomposite with feasible Zn2+ diffusion and desirable electrochemical performances at room and low temperatures. Moreover, 1T MoSe2/CC&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;ion batteries are constructed to evaluate the potential of the proposed material in low&#8208;temperature flexible energy storage devices.

&lt;p&gt;The piezoelectric 1T MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/carbon cloth (CC) nanocomposite is fabricated on a crystallographically textured electrode through a facile solvothermal method. The generated piezoelectric field can serve as the zinc-ion piezo-electrochemical coupling accelerator to promote kinetics. By virtue of intrinsic piezoelectric effect and phase engineering strategy, this nanopiezocomposite possesses enhanced kinetics and desirable electrochemical performances at low temperatures.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are regarded as promising cathode materials for zinc-ion storage owing to their large interlayer spacings. However, their capabilities are still limited by sluggish kinetics and inferior conductivities. In this study, a facile one-pot solvothermal method is exploited to vertically plant piezoelectric 1T MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;nanoflowers on carbon cloth (CC) to fabricate crystallographically textured electrodes. The self-built-in electric field owing to the intrinsic piezoelectricity during the intercalation/deintercalation processes can serve as an additional piezo-electrochemical coupling accelerator to enhance the migration of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, the expanded interlayer distance (9&#8211;10&#160;&#197;), overall high hydrophilicity, and conductivity of the 1T phase MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;also promoted the kinetics. These advantages endow the tailored 1T MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CC nanopiezocomposite with feasible Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion and desirable electrochemical performances at room and low temperatures. Moreover, 1T MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CC-based quasi-solid-state zinc-ion batteries are constructed to evaluate the potential of the proposed material in low-temperature flexible energy storage devices. This work expounds the positive effect of intrinsic piezoelectricity of TMDs on Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; migration and further explores the availabilities of TMDs in low-temperature wearable energy-storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Overcoming the Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier for Gene Therapy via Systemic Administration of GSH&#8208;Responsive Silica Nanocapsules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of glutathione&#8208;responsive silica nanocapsules (SNCs) is created and screened for brain gene editing via systemic administration. SNCs conjugated with glucose and rabies virus glycoprotein peptide under glycemic control can efficiently bypass intact blood&#8211;brain barrier, enabling brain&#8208;wide delivery of various biologics (mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA, and Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoprotein).








Abstract
CRISPR genome editing can&#160;potentially treat the root causes of many genetic diseases, including central nervous system (CNS) disorders. However, the promise of brain&#8208;targeted therapeutic genome editing relies on the efficient delivery of biologics bypassing the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), which represents a major challenge in the development of CRISPR therapeutics.&#160;We&#160;created and screened&#160;a library of glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive silica nanocapsules (SNCs) for brain targeted delivery of biologics via systemic administration. In vivo studies demonstrate that systemically delivered SNCs conjugated with glucose and rabies virus glycoprotein peptide under glycemic control can efficiently bypass the intact BBB, enabling brain&#8208;wide delivery of various biologics including CRISPR genome editors targeting different genes in both Ai14 reporter mice and wild&#8208;type mice. In particular, up to 28% neuron editing via systemic delivery of Cre mRNA in Ai14 mice, up to 6.1% amyloid precursor protein (App) gene editing (resulting in 19.1% reduction in the expression level of intact APP), and up to 3.9% tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) gene editing (resulting in 30.3% reduction in the expression level of TH) in wild&#8208;type mice are observed. This versatile SNC nanoplatform may offer a novel strategy for the treatment of CNS disorders including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease.

         <title>Identification of the Origin for Reconstructed Active Sites on Oxyhydroxide for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The irreversible reconstruction behavior accompanied by copper dynamic evolution for cobalt iron layered double hydroxide (CoFe LDH) precatalyst to form CoFeCuOOH active species with high&#8208;valent Co species is reported, identifying the origin of reconstructed active sites and proposing oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;site mechanism during oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
The regulation of atomic and electronic structures of active sites plays an important role in the rational design of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts toward electrocatalytic hydrogen generation. However, the precise identification of the active sites for surface reconstruction behavior during OER remains elusive for water&#8208;alkali electrolysis. Herein, irreversible reconstruction behavior accompanied by copper dynamic evolution for cobalt iron layered double hydroxide (CoFe LDH) precatalyst to form CoFeCuOOH active species with high&#8208;valent Co species is reported, identifying the origin of reconstructed active sites through operando UV&#8208;Visible (UV&#8211;vis), in situ Raman, and X&#8208;ray absorption fine&#8208;structure (XAFS) spectroscopies. Density functional theory analysis rationalizes this typical electronic structure evolution causing the transfer of intramolecular electrons to form ligand holes, promoting the reconstruction of active sites. Specifically, unambiguous identification of active sites for CoFeCuOOH is explored by in situ 18O isotope&#8208;labeling differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and supported by theoretical calculation, confirming mechanism switch to oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;site mechanism (OVSM) pathway on lattice oxygen. This work enables to elucidate the vital role of dynamic active&#8208;site generation and the representative contribution of OVSM pathway for efficient OER performance.

         <title>Engineered Phage with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Photosensitizer in Cocktail Therapy against Sepsis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy combining the aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer with phages is developed that not only selectively identifies bacterial species but also shows a powerful ability to kill pathogenic bacteria in sepsis diagnosis and treatment. This synergetic therapy strategy combining phage cocktail therapy and photodynamic therapy offers a strong &#8220;1&#160;+&#160;1&#160;&gt;&#160;2&#8221; bactericidal efficacy in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Sepsis, a widely recognized disease, is characterized by multiple pathogen infections. Therefore, it is imperative to develop methods that can efficiently identify and neutralize pathogen species. Phage cocktail therapy utilizes the host specificity of phages to adapt to infect resistant bacteria. However, its low sterilization stability efficiency and lack of imaging units seriously restrict its application. Here, a novel strategy combining the aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer (AIE&#8208;PS) TBTCP&#8208;PMB with phages through a nucleophilic substitution reaction between benzyl bromide and sulfhydryl groups to remove pathogenic bacteria for sepsis treatment is proposed. This strategy retains the phage's host specificity while possessing AIE&#8208;PS characteristics with a fluorescence imaging function and reactive&#160;oxygen&#160;species (ROS) for detecting and sterilizing bacteria. This synergetic strategy combining phage cocktail therapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) shows a strong &#8220;1&#160;+&#160;1&#160;&gt;&#160;2&#8221; bactericidal efficacy and superior performance in sepsis mouse models with good biocompatibility. Furthermore, the strategy can quickly diagnose blood infections of clinical blood samples. This simple and accurate strategy provides a promising therapeutic platform for rapid pathogen detection and point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnosis. Moreover, it presents a new method for expanding the library of antibacterial drugs to develop new strain identification and improve infectious disease treatment, thereby demonstrating strong translational potential.

         <title>Interfacial Instability&#8208;Induced (3I) Adhesives through &#8220;Mediator&#8221; Solvent Diffusion for Robust Underoil Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A principle of interfacial instability&#8208;induced liquid replacement is proposed by innovatively introducing dual&#8208;soluble &#8220;mediator&#8221; solvents to develop new&#8208;type 3I adhesives, realizing instant and robust adhesion on different substrates and in diverse&#160;oils/organic solvents. This principle can be generally applied to different kinds of &#8220;mediator&#8221; solvents and adhesive polymers, shedding new light on the design of new&#8208;generation adhesives facing complex environments.








Abstract
Underoil adhesives are intensively needed in case of oil spill caused by pipeline rupture, but remain a challenge owing to the obstruction of oil layer or their swelling in oil. Herein, a general solvent diffusion principle is demonstrated by introducing dual&#8208;soluble &#8220;mediator&#8221; solvents to develop a new type of interfacial instability&#8208;induced (3I) adhesives, achieving effective underoil adhesion on various substrates and blocking the oil leakage within seconds. Microscopic characterization reveals a fast and dynamic solvent exchange process that destroys the oil layer by liquid&#8211;liquid interfacial diffusion between the &#8220;mediator&#8221; solvent and oil, enabling 3I adhesives to contact the solid surfaces directly. The principle of interfacial instability&#8208;induced liquid replacement is quite different from typical immiscible liquid replacement and is not restricted by the surface tension of solvents, surface energy, and roughness of solid surfaces, successfully directing the construction of a series of effective 3I adhesives with commercially available feedstocks. This study provides a unique clue for the design of next&#8208;generation adhesives in complex environments.

The principle of interfacial instability-induced liquid replacement is quite different from typical immiscible liquid replacement and is not restricted by the surface tension of solvents, surface energy, and roughness of solid surfaces, successfully directing the construction of a series of effective 3I adhesives with commercially available feedstocks. This study provides a unique clue for the design of next-generation adhesives in complex environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Simple screen&#8208;printing technology is used to fabricate a user&#8208;friendly, high&#8208;performance stamp&#8208;like paper&#8208;based TEG and TE array infrared display. The stamp&#8208;like paper&#8208;based TEG can be torn apart by hands with specific TE pairs, making it possible to fit different size of heat source surface. The TE infrared display realizes the encryption and decryption of information.








Abstract
Thermoelectric (TE) devices exhibit considerable application potential in Internet of Things and personal health monitoring systems. However, TE self&#8208;powered devices are expensive and their fabrication process is complex. Therefore, large&#8208;scale preparation of the TE devices remains challenging. In this work, simple screen&#8208;printing technology is used to fabricate a user&#8208;friendly and high&#8208;performance paper&#8208;based TE device, which can be used in both stamp&#8208;like paper&#8208;based TE generators and infrared displays. When used as a paper&#8208;based TE generator, an output power of 940.8 &#181;W is achieved with a temperature difference of 40 K. The programmable infrared pattern based on the TE array display could be used to realize encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting properties. Moreover, a visual extraction algorithm is used to develop a mobile application for processing and decoding the infrared quick response code information. These findings offer an exciting approach to using paper&#8208;based TEGs in applications such as energy harvesting devices, optical encryption, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and dynamic infrared display.

         <title>Mechanical Janus Structures by Soft&#8211;Hard Material Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile engineering strategy of designing soft&#8211;hard materials integrated mechanical Janus structures by leveraging distinct mechanical properties between soft and hard phase materials is provided. Harnessing the unique rotation behavior of mechanical Janus structures leads to the assembly of superstructures with well&#8208;ordered organizations, opening an avenue for the future exploration of functional structures and devices with seamless soft&#8211;hard material integration.








Abstract
Engineering Janus structures that possess anisotropic features in functions have attracted growing attention for a wide range of applications in sensors, catalysis, and biomedicine, and are yet usually designed at the nanoscale with distinct physical or chemical functionalities in their opposite sides. Inspired by the seamless integration of soft and hard materials in biological structures, here a mechanical Janus structure composed of soft and hard materials with a dramatic difference in mechanical properties at an additively manufacturable macroscale is presented. In the combination of extensive experimental, theoretical, and computational studies, the design principle of soft&#8211;hard materials integrated mechanical Janus structures is established and their unique rotation mechanism is addressed. The systematic studies of assembling the Janus structure units into superstructures with well&#8208;ordered organizations by programming the local rotations are further shown, providing a direct route of designing superstructures by leveraging mechanical Janus structures with unique soft&#8211;hard material integration. Applications are conducted to demonstrate the features and functionalities of assembled superstructures with local ordered organizations in regulating and filtering acoustic wave propagations, thereby providing exemplification applications of mechanical Janus design in functional structures and devices.

         <title>The Use of Exchange Coupled Atom Qubits as Atomic&#8208;Scale Magnetic Field Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron spin qubits in silicon are shown to serve as magnetic field sensors at the atomic scale. The work presents a novel spectroscopy technique where a pair of exchange&#8208;coupled electron spins on phosphorus qubits in silicon is used to probe the local magnetic fields to determine the exact location of nuclear spins within the silicon chip.








Abstract
Phosphorus atoms in silicon offer a rich quantum computing platform where both nuclear and electron spins can be used to store and process quantum information. While individual control of electron and nuclear spins has been demonstrated, the interplay between them during qubit operations has been largely unexplored. This study investigates the use of exchange&#8208;based operation between donor bound electron spins to probe the local magnetic fields experienced by the qubits with exquisite precision at the atomic scale. To achieve this, coherent exchange oscillations are performed between two electron spin qubits, where the left and right qubits are hosted by three and two phosphorus donors, respectively. The frequency spectrum of exchange oscillations shows quantized changes in the local magnetic fields at the qubit sites, corresponding to the different hyperfine coupling between the electron and each of the qubit&#8208;hosting nuclear spins. This ability to sense the hyperfine fields of individual nuclear spins using the exchange interaction constitutes a unique metrology technique, which reveals the exact crystallographic arrangements of the phosphorus atoms in the silicon crystal for each qubit. The detailed knowledge obtained of the local magnetic environment can then be used to engineer hyperfine fields in multi&#8208;donor qubits for high&#8208;fidelity two&#8208;qubit&#160;gates.

         <title>A Molecular Engineering Strategy for Achieving Blue Phosphorescent Carbon Dots with Outstanding Efficiency above 50%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a molecular engineering strategy, more functional groups are modified on the surface of carbon dots embedded in the rigid silica network, which not only greatly boosts the spin&#8208;orbit coupling, improves the intersystem crossing rate, but also stabilizes the triplet excited state, resulting in efficient blue phosphorescence.








Abstract
Highly efficient emission has been a long&#8208;lasting pursuit for carbon dots (CDs) owing to their enormous potential in optoelectronic applications. Nevertheless, their room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) performance still largely lags behind their outstanding fluorescence emission, especially in the blue&#160;spectral region. Herein, high&#8208;efficiency blue RTP CDs have been designed and constructed via a simple molecular engineering strategy, enabling CDs with an unprecedented phosphorescence quantum efficiency of to 50.17% and a long lifetime of 2.03 s. This treating route facilitates the formation of high&#8208;density (n, &#960;*) configurations in the CD &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugate system through the introduction of abundant functional groups, which can evoke a strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling and further promote the intersystem crossing from singlet to triplet excited states and radiative recombination from triplet excited states to ground state. With blue phosphorescent CDs as triplet donors, green, red, and white afterglow composites are successfully fabricated via effective phosphorescence F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. Importantly, the color temperature of the white afterglow emission can be widely and facilely tuned from cool white to pure white and warm white. Moreover, advanced information encryption, light illumination, and afterglow/dynamic visual display have been demonstrated when using these multicolor&#8208;emitting CD&#8208;based afterglow systems.

         <title>A Highly Efficacious Electrical Biofilm Treatment System for Combating Chronic Wound Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficacious electrical biofilm treatment system is developed for combating chronic wound bacterial infections. This system applies 75 mA cm&#8722;2 current to completely debride biofilm above the wound surface and enhance antibiotic delivery into biofilm&#8208;infected wounds simultaneously. As a result, this system can rapidly reduce biofilm density by 4&#8211;5 log10 scales using only 65 min treatment.








Abstract
Biofilm infection has a high prevalence in chronic wounds and can delay wound healing. Current treatment using debridement and antibiotic administration imposes a significant burden on patients and healthcare systems. To address their limitations, a highly efficacious electrical antibiofilm treatment system is described in this paper. This system uses high&#8208;intensity current (75&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) to completely debride biofilm above the wound surface and enhance antibiotic delivery into biofilm&#8208;infected wounds simultaneously. Combining these two effects, this system uses short treatments (&#8804;2&#160;h) to reduce bacterial count of methicillin&#8208;resistant S.&#160;aureus (MRSA) biofilm&#8208;infected ex vivo skin wounds from 1010 to 105.2 colony&#8208;forming&#160;units&#160;(CFU) g&#8722;1. Taking advantage of the hydrogel ionic circuit design, this system enhances the in vivo safety of high&#8208;intensity current application compared to conventional devices. The in vivo antibiofilm efficacy of the system is tested using a diabetic mouse&#8208;based wound infection model. MRSA biofilm bacterial count decreases from 109.0 to 104.6 CFU g&#8722;1 at 1 day post&#8208;treatment and to 103.3 CFU g&#8722;1 at 7 days post&#8208;treatment, both of which are below the clinical threshold for infection. Overall, this novel technology provides a quick, safe, yet highly efficacious treatment to chronic wound biofilm infections.

     alt="A Highly Efficacious Electrical Biofilm Treatment System for Combating Chronic Wound Bacterial Infections"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly efficacious electrical biofilm treatment system is developed for combating chronic wound bacterial infections. This system applies 75 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; current to completely debride biofilm above the wound surface and enhance antibiotic delivery into biofilm-infected wounds simultaneously. As a result, this system can rapidly reduce biofilm density by 4&#8211;5 log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; scales using only 65 min treatment.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biofilm infection has a high prevalence in chronic wounds and can delay wound healing. Current treatment using debridement and antibiotic administration imposes a significant burden on patients and healthcare systems. To address their limitations, a highly efficacious electrical antibiofilm treatment system is described in this paper. This system uses high-intensity current (75&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) to completely debride biofilm above the wound surface and enhance antibiotic delivery into biofilm-infected wounds simultaneously. Combining these two effects, this system uses short treatments (&#8804;2&#160;h) to reduce bacterial count of methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;S.&#160;aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA) biofilm-infected ex vivo skin wounds from 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;5.2&lt;/sup&gt; colony-forming&#160;units&#160;(CFU) g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Taking advantage of the hydrogel ionic circuit design, this system enhances the in vivo safety of high-intensity current application compared to conventional devices. The in vivo antibiofilm efficacy of the system is tested using a diabetic mouse-based wound infection model. MRSA biofilm bacterial count decreases from 10&lt;sup&gt;9.0&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;4.6&lt;/sup&gt; CFU g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 day post-treatment and to 10&lt;sup&gt;3.3&lt;/sup&gt; CFU g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 7 days post-treatment, both of which are below the clinical threshold for infection. Overall, this novel technology provides a quick, safe, yet highly efficacious treatment to chronic wound biofilm infections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable Zn Anodes with Triple Gradients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;gradient electrode that well integrates gradient conductivity, zincophilicity, and porosity is facilely constructed for a dendrite&#8208;free Zn anode. The triple&#8208;gradient design synergistically optimizes the electric field distribution, Zn2+ ion flux, and Zn deposition behavior, thus preventing dendrite growth and achieving long&#8208;term cycling stability.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are highly desirable for sustainable energy storage, but the undesired Zn dendrites growth severely shortens the cycle life. Herein, a triple&#8208;gradient electrode that simultaneously integrates gradient conductivity, zincophilicity, and porosity is facilely constructed for a dendrite&#8208;free Zn anode. The simple mechanical rolling&#8208;induced triple&#8208;gradient design effectively optimizes the electric field distribution, Zn2+ ion flux, and Zn deposition paths in the Zn anode, thus synergistically achieving a bottom&#8208;up deposition behavior for Zn metals and preventing the short circuit from top dendrite growth. As a result, the electrode with triple gradients delivers a low overpotential of 35&#160;mV and operates steadily over 400&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8208;2/2.5&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8208;2 and 250&#160;h at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8208;2/1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8208;2, far surpassing the non&#8208;gradient, single&#8208;gradient and dual&#8208;gradient counterparts. The well&#8208;tunable materials and structures with the facile fabrication method of the triple&#8208;gradient strategy will bring inspiration for high&#8208;performance energy storage devices.

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordinated Pd Site within Amorphous Palladium Selenide for Active, Selective, and Stable H2O2 Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous PdSe2 nanoparticles (a&#8208;PdSe2 NPs) with low&#8208;coordinated Pd sites have been successfully prepared and applied as highly efficient catalysts for H2O2 electrosynthesis. The low&#8208;coordinated Pd sites with disordered arrangement in a&#8208;PdSe2 NPs canoptimize the adsorption toward oxygenated intermediate and suppress the cleavage of O&#8211;O bond, leading to&#160;significant enhancement on the catalytic performance toward H2O2 electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability are essential for the practical applications of H2O2 electrosynthesis technology, but it is still formidably challenging. It is reported that the low&#8208;coordinated structure of Pd sites in amorphous PdSe2 nanoparticles (a&#8208;PdSe2 NPs) can significantly boost the electrocatalytic synthesis of H2O2. Detailed investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that the disordered arrangement of Pd atoms in a&#8208;PdSe2 NPs can promote the activity, while the Pd sites with low&#8208;coordinated environment can optimize the adsorption toward oxygenated intermediate and suppress the cleavage of O&#8211;O bond, leading to a significant enhancement in both the H2O2 selectivity and productivity. Impressively, a&#8208;PdSe2 NPs/C exhibits high H2O2 selectivity over 90% in different pH electrolytes. H2O2 productivities with &#8776;3245.7, 1725.5, and 2242.1&#160;mmol gPd&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in 0.1&#160;m KOH, 0.1&#160;m HClO4, and 0.1&#160;m Na2SO4 can be achieved, respectively, in an H&#8208;cell electrolyzer, being a pH&#8208;universal catalyst for H2O2 electrochemical synthesis. Furthermore, the produced H2O2 can reach 1081.8&#160;ppm in a three&#8208;phase flow cell reactor after 2&#160;h enrichment in 0.1&#160;m Na2SO4, showing the great potential of a&#8208;PdSe2 NPs/C for practical H2O2 electrosynthesis.

         <title>Fast, Multi&#8208;Bit, and Vis&#8208;Infrared Broadband Nonvolatile Optoelectronic Memory with MoS2/2D&#8208;Perovskite Van der Waals Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique organic/inorganic alternating chain structure of 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite enables the combination of the advantages of floating gate and charge trap memories to achieve fast, multi&#8208;bit, and vis&#8208;infrared broadband nonvolatile optoelectronic memory.








Abstract
Nonvolatile optoelectronic memory (NVOM) integrating the functions of optical sensing and long&#8208;term memory can efficiently process and store a large amount of visual scene information, which has become the core requirement of multiple intelligence scenarios. However, realizing NVOM with vis&#8208;infrared broadband response is still challenging. Herein, the room temperature vis&#8208;infrared broadband NVOM based on few&#8208;layer MoS2/2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite (2D&#8208;RPP) van der Waals heterojunction is realized. It is found that the 2D&#8208;RPP converts the initial n&#8208;type MoS2 into p&#8208;type and facilitates hole transfer between them. Furthermore, the 2D&#8208;RPP rich in interband states serves as an effective electron trapping layer as well as broadband photoresponsive layer. As a result, the dielectric&#8208;free MoS2/2D&#8208;RPP heterojunction enables the charge to transfer quickly under external field, which enables a large memory window (104&#160;V), fast write speed of 20 &#181;s, and optical programmable characteristics from visible light (405&#160;nm) to telecommunication wavelengths (i.e., 1550&#160;nm) at room temperature. Trapezoidal optical programming can produce up to 100 recognizable states (&gt;6 bits), with operating energy as low as 5.1 pJ per optical program. These results provide a route to realize fast, low power, multi&#8208;bit optoelectronic memory from visible to the infrared wavelength.

         <title>Rapid Melt&#8208;Quenching Enables General Synthesis of High&#8208;Loading Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Bicontinuous Nanoporous Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile approach is developed for synthesizing nanoporous metal compound supported single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with high metal loadings, representing a several&#8208;fold improvement of metal loading compared to benchmarks. Libraries of SACs can be synthesized by choosing various combinations of supporting matrixes and single atoms, thus achieving the synergistic catalysis.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts have attracted extensive attention due to their unique atomic structures and extraordinary activities in catalyzing chemical reactions. However, the lack of general and efficient approaches for producing high&#8208;density single atoms on suitably tailored supporting matrixes hinders their industrial applications. Here, a rapid melt&#8208;quenching strategy with high throughput to synthesize single atoms with high metal&#8208;atom loadings of up to 9.7 wt% or 2.6 at% on nanoporous metal compounds is reported, representing several&#8208;fold improvements compared to benchmarks in the literature. Mechanism characterizations reveal that the high&#8208;temperature melting provides the essential liquid environment and activation energy to achieve the atomization of metals, while the following rapid&#8208;quenching pins the isolated metal atoms and stabilizes the coordination environment. In comparison with carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts, various collaboration combinations of single atoms and nanoporous metal compounds can be synthesized using the strategy, thus achieving efficient hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted H2 production. This synthesis protocol is highly compatible with automatic operation, which provides a feasible and general route to design and manufacture specific single&#8208;atom catalysts with tunable atomic metal components and supporting matrixes, thus promoting the deployment of single&#8208;atom catalysts for various energy technology applications.

         <title>Synthesis of MAPbBr3&#8208;Polymer Composite Films by Photolysis of DMF: Toward Transparent and Flexible Optical Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) with Hierarchical Multilevel Complexity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent optical PUFs with hierarchical patterns are prepared by the top&#8208;down photolithography in combination with the bottom&#8208;up phase separation process on MAPbBr3&#8208;PMMA/PS composite films. The hierarchical patterns consist of random&#8208;sized spot patterns (higher&#8208;level patterns) confined within randomly oriented bicontinuous patterns (lower&#8208;level patterns). To achieve such multilevel complex patterns, a synthetic method of MAPbBr3 NPs based on the photolysis of DMF is newly developed.








Abstract
Physical entities with inherent randomness have been investigated as anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs). Herein, a transparent and flexible optical PUF label associated with multilevel complexity is demonstrated by taking advantage of the optical properties of hierarchical morphologies of the composite film composed of metal halide perovskite nanoparticles (MAPbBr3 NPs) and the intrinsic spinodal&#8208;decomposition&#8208;like phase separation of polymer blend (PMMA/PS blend). Due to the combinatorial effects of the photolysis synthesis of MAPbBr3 and the thermodynamic instability of the PMMA/PS blend, randomized patterns emerge at two&#8208;level scales. These patterns are intrinsically non&#8208;deterministic, and therefore, the PUF labels from the multilevel random patterns are challenging to replicate. This is mainly attributed to random spot patterns (higher&#8208;level patterns) confined within intricate bicontinuous patterns (lower&#8208;level patterns).

         <title>Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Syngas Evolution with Molecular Catalyst Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly active, durable, and selective catalysts for light&#8208;driven CO2 and water conversion to value&#8208;adding products are key toward a sustainable energy cycle. Such an all&#8208;in&#8208;one material is showcased, consisting of a metal&#8208;organic framework co&#8208;hosting two molecular catalysts. This assembly (nanozyme) harvests light, funnels energy to molecular sites, and enhances charge separation, thereby unlocking high photon efficiencies and adjustable syngas evolution.








Abstract
Syngas, a mixture of CO and H2, is a high&#8208;priority intermediate for producing several commodity chemicals, e.g., ammonia, methanol, and synthetic hydrocarbon fuels. Accordingly, parallel sunlight&#8208;driven catalytic conversion of CO2 and protons to syngas is a key step toward a sustainable energy cycle. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalytic systems and materials often fall short as application&#8208;oriented concurrent CO and H2 evolution requires challenging reaction conditions which can hamper stability, selectivity, and efficiency. Here a light&#8208;harvesting metal&#8208;organic framework hosting two molecular catalysts is engineered to yield colloidal, water&#8208;stable, versatile nanoreactors for photocatalytic syngas generation with highly controllable product ratios. In&#8208;depth fluorescence, X&#8208;ray, and microscopic studies paired with kinetic analysis show that the host delivers energy efficiently to active sites, conceptually yielding nanozymes. This unlocked sustained CO2 reduction and H2 evolution with benchmark turnover numbers and record incident photon conversions up to 36%, showcasing a highly active and durable all&#8208;in&#8208;one material toward application in solar energy&#8208;driven syngas generation.

Most reported self&#8208;healable batteries possess limited stretchability and unable to achieve full&#8208;device self&#8208;healability. Herein, an all&#8208;component self&#8208;bonding strategy is presented to obtain an all&#8208;eutectogel soft battery (AESB) that simultaneously achieves full&#8208;cell autonomous self&#8208;healability and omnidirectional intrinsic stretchability (&gt;1000% areal strain) even at &#8211;20&#160;&#176;C. The present work provides a general soft electronic material platform for fabricating next&#8208;generation self&#8208;healing stretchable electronics.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation energy storage devices should be soft, stretchable, and self&#8208;healable. Previously reported self&#8208;healable batteries mostly possess limited stretchability and rely on healable electrodes or electrolytes rather than achieving full&#8208;device self&#8208;healability. Herein, an all&#8208;component self&#8208;bonding strategy is reported to obtain an all&#8208;eutectogel soft battery (AESB) that simultaneously achieves full&#8208;cell autonomous self&#8208;healability and omnidirectional intrinsic stretchability (&gt;1000% areal strain) over a broad temperature range (&#8722;20~60&#160;&#176;C). Without requiring any external stimulus, the five&#8208;layered soft battery can efficiently recover both its mechanical and electrochemical performance at full&#8208;cell level. The developed AESB can be easily configured into various 3D architectures with highly interfacial compatible eutectogel electrodes, electrolyte, and substrate, presenting an excellent opportunity for the development of embodied energy technologies. The present work provides a general and user&#8208;friendly soft electronic material platform for fabricating a variety of intrinsic self&#8208;healing stretchable multi&#8208;layered electronics, which are promising beyond the field of energy storage, such as displays, sensors, circuits, and soft robots.

         <title>Towards Efficient and Stable Donor&#8208;Acceptor Luminescent Radicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of tri(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl(TTM) radical derivatives have been designed and synthesized. Donor substituents vary depending on the extent of conjugation and the number of nitrogen atoms. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that the key to maximize photoluminescent quantum efficiency(PLQE) is to tune the right balance of the charge transfer energy with respect to both the ground&#8208;state and local&#8208;excitation state energies.








Abstract
In contrast to closed&#8208;shell luminescent molecules, the electronic ground state and lowest excited state in organic luminescent radicals are both spin doublet, which results in spin&#8208;allowed radiative transitions. Most reported luminescent radicals with high photoluminescent quantum efficiency (PLQE) have a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A&#8226;) chemical structure where an electron&#8208;donating group is covalently attached to an electron&#8208;withdrawing radical core (A&#8226;). Understanding the main factors that define the efficiency and stability of D&#8208;A&#8226; type luminescent radicals remains challenging. Here, we&#160;designed and synthesized a series of tri(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical derivatives with donor substituents varying by their extent of conjugation and their number of imine&#8208;type nitrogen atoms. The experimental results suggest that the luminescence efficiency and stability of the radicals are proportional to the degree of conjugation but inversely proportional to the number of imine nitrogen atoms in the substituents. These experimental trends are very well reproduced by density functional theory calculations. The theoretical results indicate that both the luminescence efficiency and radical stability are related to the energy difference between the charge transfer (CT) and local&#8208;excitation (LE) states, which decreases as either the number of imine nitrogen atoms in the substituent increases or its conjugation length decreases.

     alt="Towards Efficient and Stable Donor-Acceptor Luminescent Radicals"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of tri(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl(TTM) radical derivatives have been designed and synthesized. Donor substituents vary depending on the extent of conjugation and the number of nitrogen atoms. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that the key to maximize photoluminescent quantum efficiency(PLQE) is to tune the right balance of the charge transfer energy with respect to both the ground-state and local-excitation state energies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to closed-shell luminescent molecules, the electronic ground state and lowest excited state in organic luminescent radicals are both spin doublet, which results in spin-allowed radiative transitions. Most reported luminescent radicals with high photoluminescent quantum efficiency (PLQE) have a donor-acceptor (D&#8211;A&#8226;) chemical structure where an electron-donating group is covalently attached to an electron-withdrawing radical core (A&#8226;). Understanding the main factors that define the efficiency and stability of D-A&#8226; type luminescent radicals remains challenging. Here, we&#160;designed and synthesized a series of tri(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical derivatives with donor substituents varying by their extent of conjugation and their number of imine-type nitrogen atoms. The experimental results suggest that the luminescence efficiency and stability of the radicals are proportional to the degree of conjugation but inversely proportional to the number of imine nitrogen atoms in the substituents. These experimental trends are very well reproduced by density functional theory calculations. The theoretical results indicate that both the luminescence efficiency and radical stability are related to the energy difference between the charge transfer (CT) and local-excitation (LE) states, which decreases as either the number of imine nitrogen atoms in the substituent increases or its conjugation length decreases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast Coherent THz Lattice Dynamics Coupled to Spins in the van der Waals Antiferromagnet FePS3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A step toward the optical generation and control of coherent THz spin and lattice dynamics in 2D antiferromagnets. A coherent hybrid phonon&#8211;magnon mode is triggered in the 2D antiferromagnet FePS3 by pumping below the band gap in the presence of an external magnetic field.








Abstract
Coherent THz optical lattice and hybridized phonon&#8211;magnon modes are triggered by femtosecond laser pulses in the antiferromagnetic van der Waals semiconductor FePS3. The laser&#8208;driven lattice and spin dynamics are investigated in a bulk crystal as well as in a 380&#160;nm&#8208;thick exfoliated flake as a function of the excitation photon energy, sample temperature and applied magnetic field. The pump&#8208;probe magneto&#8208;optical measurements reveal that the amplitude of a coherent phonon mode oscillating at 3.2&#160;THz decreases as the sample is heated up to the N&#233;el temperature. This signal eventually vanishes as the phase transition to the paramagnetic phase occurs, thus revealing its connection to the long&#8208;range magnetic order. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the optically triggered 3.2&#160;THz phonon hybridizes with a magnon mode, which is utilized to excite the hybridized phonon&#8211;magnon mode optically. These findings open a pathway toward the optical control of coherent THz photo&#8211;magnonic dynamics in a van der Waals antiferromagnet, which can be scaled down to the 2D limit.

         <title>Fibrillization of Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors Enables 19% Efficiency Pseudo&#8208;Bulk Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fibrillization of non&#8208;fullerene acceptor L8&#8208;BO is realized by employing a conjugated fused&#8208;ring solvent additive 1&#8208;fluoronaphtalene that acts as the molecular bridge, which contributes to realize a power conversion efficiency of 19% in the pseudo&#8208;bulk heterojunction D18/L8&#8208;BO binary organic solar cell, featuring a high fill factor of 80% with improved charge transport.








Abstract
The structural order and aggregation of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFA) are critical toward light absorption, phase separation, and charge transport properties of their photovoltaic blends with electron donors, and determine the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the corresponding organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, the fibrillization of small molecular NFA L8&#8208;BO with the assistance of fused&#8208;ring solvent additive 1&#8208;fluoronaphthalene (FN) to substantially improve device PCE is demonstrated. Molecular dynamics simulations show that FN attaches to the backbone of L8&#8208;BO as the molecular bridge to enhance the intermolecular packing , inducing 1D self&#8208;assembly of L8&#8208;BO into fine fibrils with a compact polycrystal structure. The L8&#8208;BO fibrils are incorporated into a pseudo&#8208;bulk heterojunction (P&#8208;BHJ) active layer with D18 as a donor, and show enhanced light absorption, charge transport, and collection properties, leading to enhanced PCE from 16.0% to an unprecedented 19.0% in the D18/L8&#8208;BO binary P&#8208;BHJ OSC, featuring a high fill factor of 80%. This work demonstrates a strategy for fibrillating NFAs toward the enhanced performance of OSCs.

         <title>Time&#8208;Dependent Polychrome Stereoscopic Luminescence Triggered by Resonance Energy Transfer between Carbon Dots&#8208;in&#8208;Zeolite Composites and Fluorescence Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique time&#8208;dependent polychrome stereoscopic luminescence system is successfully constructed by designing an efficient resonance energy transfer system in a 3D space, in which carbon dots&#8208;in&#8208;zeolite composites act as energy donors and fluorescence quantum dots act as energy acceptors. The luminescence system can carry eight layers of luminescence information involving four dimensions, realizing advanced time&#8211;space division multiplexing.








Abstract
Luminescence multiplexing shows promising application prospects in information security, yet even outstanding time division multiplexing can only carry limited luminescence information. Time&#8211;space division multiplexing can greatly expand the information capacity by simultaneously transferring luminescence information in both time and space dimensions. Herein, time&#8208;dependent polychrome stereoscopic luminescence system has been successfully developed by designing a 3D luminescence system based on resonance energy transfer (RET), in which afterglow lifetime easily regulated carbon dots&#8208;in&#8208;zeolite composites are used as energy donors and multicolor fluorescence quantum dots (QDs) as energy acceptors. Taking perovskite QDs (PeQDs) as example, by matching the energy donors with different afterglow lifetimes and the energy acceptors with different fluorescence colors, tunable afterglow emission of PeQDs with wavelength within 463&#8211;614&#160;nm and lifetime within 232&#8211;1500&#160;ms can be realized, in which the maximal RET efficiency reaches 95%. As a proof of concept, such novel luminescence system that carries eight layers of luminescence information involving four dimensions (time and 3D space) is successfully applied in advanced time&#8211;space division multiplexing. This work opens a new perspective for the application of time&#8208;space integrated luminescence systems in advanced information multiplexing.

         <title>Bionic Engineered Protein Coating Boosting Anti&#8208;Biofouling in Complex Biological Fluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel engineered BSA@PSBMA protein (bovine serum albumin, BSA and poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate), PSBMA) is developed for surface&#8208;independent coating and to remove the intrinsic limitation of native proteins as antifouling coatings in complex biological environments. High&#8208;efficient resistance to various biofoulants in complex conditions is achieved through using a bionic &#8220;vine&#8208;thorn&#8221; design to tune the interfacial interactions at the molecular scale.








Abstract
Implantable medical devices have been widely applied in diagnostics, therapeutics, organ restoration, and other biomedical areas, but often suffer from dysfunction and infections due to irreversible biofouling. Inspired by the self&#8208;defensive &#8220;vine&#8208;thorn&#8221; structure of climbing thorny plants, a zwitterion&#8208;conjugated protein is engineered via grafting sulfobetaine methacrylate (SBMA) segments on native bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein molecules for surface coating and antifouling applications in complex biological fluids. Unlike traditional synthetic polymers of which the coating operation requires arduous surface pretreatments, the engineered protein BSA@PSBMA (PolySBMA conjugated BSA) can achieve facile and surface&#8208;independent coating on various substrates through a simple dipping/spraying method. Interfacial molecular force measurements and adsorption tests demonstrate that the substrate&#8208;foulant attraction is significantly suppressed due to strong interfacial hydration and steric repulsion of the bionic structure of BSA@PSBMA, enabling coating surfaces to exhibit superior resistance to biofouling for a broad spectrum of species including proteins, metabolites, cells, and biofluids under various biological conditions. This work provides an innovative paradigm of using native proteins to generate engineered proteins with extraordinary antifouling capability and desired surface properties for bioengineering applications.

         <title>Single Zinc Atom Aggregates: Synergetic Interaction to Boost Fast Polysulfide Conversion in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The uniform dispersal of the high&#8208;loading Zn single atoms with short atomic spacing (&lt;1&#160;nm) on ordered N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube arrays (ZnN4&#8208;NC) are synthesized as the sulfur host for fast redox conversion in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. The cubes composed of arrayed carbon nanotubes provide channels for fast mass transfer in Li&#8208;S batteries under high&#8208;load conditions. Moreover, the synergistic enhancement effect induced by adjacent single atoms further promotes the rapid multi&#8208;step reaction of sulfur at high sulfur loadings. Consequently, the obtained Li&#8208;S batteries exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) pave new possibilities to improve the utilization efficiency of sulfur electrodes arising from polysulfide shuttle effects and sluggish kinetics due to their excellent applicability in atomic&#8208;scale reaction mechanisms and structure&#8208;activity relationships. Herein, nitrogen (N)&#8208;anchored SACs on the highly ordered N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube arrays are reported as the sulfur host for fast redox conversion in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. The cube structure of the aligned carbon nanotubes can promote the rapid mass transfer under high sulfur loadings, and abundant single&#8208;atom active sites further accelerate the conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). The synergistic enhancement effect induced by adjacent single atoms with interatomic distances &lt;1&#160;nm further accelerates the rapid multi&#8208;step reaction of sulfur at high sulfur loadings. As a result, the obtained Li&#8208;S batteries exhibit outstanding cycle stability with a high areal capacity of 5.6&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 after 100 cycles under a high sulfur loading of 7.2&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 (electrolyte to sulfur ratio is &#8776;3.7&#160;mL&#160;g&#8722;1). Even assembled into a pouch cell, it still delivers a high capacity of 953.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.1&#160;C, contributing to the development of the practically viable Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Checkpoint Nano&#8208;PROTACs for Activatable Cancer Photo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The checkpoint nano&#8208;proteolysis targeting chimeras (nano&#8208;PROTACs, NPRO) with phototherapeutic tumor regression and immunosuppressive protein degradation are developed for activatable cancer photo&#8208;immunotherapy. NPRO&#8208;mediated therapy can not only improve tumor immunogenicity but also degrade SHP2 to block the immunosuppressive checkpoint signaling pathways (CD47/SIRP&#945; and PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1), resulting in the activation of a synergistic antitumor immune response.








Abstract
Checkpoint immunotherapy holds great potential to treat malignancies via blocking the immunosuppressive signaling pathways, which however suffers from inefficiency and off&#8208;target adverse effects. Herein, checkpoint nano&#8208;proteolysis targeting chimeras (nano&#8208;PROTACs) in combination with photodynamic tumor regression and immunosuppressive protein degradation to block checkpoint signaling pathways for activatable cancer photo&#8208;immunotherapy are reported. These nano&#8208;PROTACs are composed of a photosensitizer (protoporphyrin IX, PpIX) and an Src homology 2 domain&#8208;containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2)&#8208;targeting PROTAC peptide (aPRO) via a caspase 3&#8208;cleavable segment. aPRO is activated by the increased expression of caspase 3 in tumor cells after phototherapeutic treatment and induces targeted degradation of SHP2 via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. The persistent depletion of SHP2 blocks the immunosuppressive checkpoint signaling pathways (CD47/SIRP&#945; and PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1), thus reinvigorating antitumor macrophages and T cells. Such a checkpoint PROTAC strategy synergizes immunogenic phototherapy to boost antitumor immune response. Thus, this study represents a generalized PROTAC platform to modulate immune&#8208;related signaling pathways for improved anticancer therapy.

A series of conjugated polymers by side chain engineering and used as additive, which enable a record power conversion efficiency of 19.10% and decent high FF of 80.5% in layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer processed organic solar cells.








Abstract
The morphology plays a key role in determining the charge generation and collection process, thus impacting the performances of organic solar cells (OSCs). The limited selection pool of additives to optimize the morphology of OSCs, especially for the emerging layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) OSCs, impeding the improvements of photovoltaic performances. Herein, a new method of using conjugated polymers as the additives to optimize the morphology for improving the photovoltaic performances of LbL&#8208;OSCs is reported. Four polymers of P&#63743;H, P&#63743;S, P&#63743;F, and P&#63743;Cl are developed with different side chains. These polymers exhibit poor performances as donor materials and additives in the BHJ devices, due to the unsuitable energy level alignment and unfavorable molecular interactions. By contrast, they can be served as efficient additives to optimize the PM6 fibril matrix for facilitating the penetration of BTP&#8208;eC9 and forming an intertwined D/A bicontinuous network with a vertical segregation. Such morphology is optimized by side chain engineering, which enables the progressive improvement of the charge separation and collection. As a result, adding a small amount of P&#63743;Cl as the additive, the optimized morphology contributes to a champion PCE of 19.10% with a high FF of 80.5%.

Heterostructural Nanolattice Capacitors
In article number 2208409, Julia R. Greer, Bong&#8208;Joong Kim, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate density&#8208;variant nanolattices that exhibit bi&#8208;phase deformation by which the lower&#8208;density region protects the higher&#8208;density region. This deformation improves the electrical breakdown strength by &#8776;3.3 fold of the uniform&#8208;density nanolattice, while maintaining the ultralow&#8208;k of &#8776;1.2 with complete electric and dielectric stability and recoverability during 100 cyclic compressions to 62.5% strain.

Microfabrication of Biodegradable Sensors
In article number 2207081, Levent Beker and co&#8208;workers report a photolithography&#8208;based microfabrication process for bioresorbable devices. Consecutive application of sacrificial, adhesion and protection layers enable the use of delicate conductive and insulating bioresorbable materials through standard microfabrication processes. Using this approach, high&#8208;density passive electric components and chemical sensors critical for transient electronics and implant applications are developed.

Photocatalytic Nanozymes
Highly active, efficient, and durable catalysts for light&#8208;driven carbon dioxide and water conversion to fuels are pivotal for a sustainable energy cycle. In article number 2207380, Philip M. Stanley, Julien Warnan, Roland A. Fischer, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a photocatalytic nanozyme that stems from the synergy between a metal&#8211;organic framework and two molecular catalysts to deliver enzyme&#8208;reminiscent behavior toward controllable syngas evolution and artificial photosynthesis.

Inter&#8208;Qubit Coupling
Due to their atomic nature, qubits based on electrons bound to phosphorus&#8208;doped silicon quantum dots have demonstrated strong inter&#8208;qubit coupling. In article number 2201625, Ludwik Kranz, Michelle Y. Simmons, and co&#8208;workers show how the inter&#8208;qubit coupling can be used as a metrology tool to determine the arrangement of phosphorus donors in two quantum dots. This technique allows for the optimization of two&#8208;qubit gates and is applicable for other dopant&#8208;based systems.

         <title>Stabilization and Performance Enhancement Strategies for Halide Perovskite Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insight into the recently emerged stability and activity enhancement strategies, widely applicable to the design and development of high&#8208;performance halide perovskite photocatalysts for H2 evolution reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, and organic synthesis reactions, is provided.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;energy&#8208;powered photocatalytic fuel production and chemical synthesis are widely recognized as viable technological solutions for a sustainable energy future. However, the requirement of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts is a major bottleneck. Halide perovskites, a category of diversified semiconductor materials with suitable energy&#8208;band&#8208;enabled high&#8208;light&#8208;utilization efficiencies, exceptionally long charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;diffusion&#8208;length&#8208;facilitated charge transport, and readily tailorable compositional, structural, and morphological properties, have emerged as a new class of photocatalysts for efficient hydrogen evolution, CO2 reduction, and various organic synthesis reactions. Despite the noticeable progress, the development of high&#8208;performance halide perovskite photocatalysts (HPPs) is still hindered by several key challenges: the strong ionic nature and high hydrolysis tendency induce instability and an unsatisfactory activity due to the need for a coactive component to realize redox processes. Herein, the recently developed advanced strategies to enhance the stability and photocatalytic activity of HPPs are comprehensively reviewed. The widely applicable stability enhancement strategies are first articulated, and the activity improvement strategies for fuel production and chemical synthesis are then explored. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives associated with the application of HPPs in efficient production of fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals are presented, indicating the irreplaceable role of the HPPs in the field of photocatalysis.

         <title>A Review of Scalable Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h&#8208;BN) Synthesis for Present and Future Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable approaches of high&#8208;quality mono/multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) synthesis are reviewed, the challenges and opportunities for each method are discussed, and their relevance to emerging applications is contextualized. Maintaining stoichiometric balance B:N = 1 in the growing crystal and enabling stacking order between layers emerge as the main challenges. Advances in these aspects will inform/guide the synthesis of other 2D materials with &gt;1 constituent element.








Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) is a layered inorganic synthetic crystal exhibiting high temperature stability and high thermal conductivity. As a ceramic material it has been widely used for thermal management, heat shielding, lubrication, and as a filler material for structural composites. Recent scientific advances in isolating atomically thin monolayers from layered van der Waals crystals to study their unique properties has propelled research interest in mono/few layered h&#8208;BN as a wide bandgap insulating support for nanoscale electronics, tunnel barriers, communications, neutron detectors, optics, sensing, novel separations, quantum emission from defects, among others. Realizing these futuristic applications hinges on scalable cost&#8208;effective high&#8208;quality h&#8208;BN synthesis. Here, the authors&#160;review scalable approaches of high&#8208;quality mono/multilayer h&#8208;BN synthesis, discuss the challenges and opportunities for each method, and contextualize their relevance to emerging applications. Maintaining a stoichiometric balance B:N = 1 as the atoms incorporate into the growing layered crystal and maintaining stacking order between layers during multi&#8208;layer synthesis emerge as some of the main challenges for h&#8208;BN synthesis and the development of processes to address these aspects can inform and guide the synthesis of other layered materials with more than one constituent element. Finally, the authors contextualize h&#8208;BN synthesis efforts along with quality requirements for emerging applications via a technological roadmap.

         <title>Reaction Site Designation by Intramolecular Electric Field in Tr&#246;ger's Base Derived Conjugated Microporous Polymer for Near&#8208;Unity Selectivity of CO2 Photo&#8208;conversion</title>

Abstract
To facilitate solar&#8208;driven overall CO2 and H2O conversion into fuels and O2, a series of Tr&#246;ger's base derived covalent microporous polymers are synthesized featuring flexural backbone and unusual charge transfer properties. The incorporation of rigid structural twist Tr&#246;ger's base unit grants polymers enhanced microporosity and CO2 adsorption/activation capacity. Density function theory calculations and photoelectrochemical analyses reveal that an electric dipole moment (from negative to positive) directed to the Tr&#246;ger's base unit is formed across two obliquely opposed molecular fragments and induced an intramolecular electric field. The Tr&#246;ger's base unit located at folding point becomes an electron trap to attract photogenerated electrons in the molecular network, which brings about carrier recombination suppression and designates the reaction site in synergy with the conjugated network. In response to the discrepancy in reaction pathways across the reaction sites, the product allocation in the catalytic reaction is hereby regulated. Optimally, CMP&#8208;nTB achieved the highest photocatalytic CO production of 163.53&#160;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with approximately unity selectivity, along with H2O oxidation to O2 in the absence of any photosensitizer or co&#8208;catalyst. This work provides a new insight for developing specialized artificial organic photocatalysts.

         <title>Formation and Applications in Electronic Devices of Lattice&#8208;Aligned Gallium Oxynitride Nanolayer on Gallium Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ &#8220;oxidation&#8211;reconfiguration&#8221; process is developed to form lattice&#8208;aligned gallium oxynitride (GaON) epitaxial nanolayer on gallium nitride (GaN) substrate. Two metastable GaON phases are formed through oxygen segregation following kinetic&#8211;thermodynamic reaction pathways. The GaN&#8208;derived GaON nanolayer is a tailored structure for surface reinforcement and can be leveraged to enhance the performance of GaN&#8208;based devices in various applications.








Abstract
Gallium nitride (GaN), a promising alternative semiconductor to Si, is widely used in photoelectronic and electronic technologies. However, the vulnerability of the GaN surface is a critical restriction that hinders the development of GaN&#8208;based devices, especially in terms of device stability and reliability. In this study, this challenge is overcome by converting the GaN surface into a gallium oxynitride (GaON) epitaxial nanolayer through an in situ two&#8208;step &#8220;oxidation&#8211;reconfiguration&#8221; process. The O plasma treatment overcomes the chemical inertness of the GaN surface, and sequential thermal annealing manipulates the kinetic&#8211;thermodynamic reaction pathways to create a metastable GaON nanolayer with a wurtzite lattice. The GaN&#8208;derived GaON nanolayer is a tailored structure for surface reinforcement and possesses several advantages, including a wide bandgap, high thermodynamic stability, and large valence band offset with a GaN substrate. These physical properties can be further leveraged to enhance the performance of GaN&#8208;based devices in various applications, such as power systems, complementary logic integrated circuits, photoelectrochemical water splitting, and ultraviolet photoelectric&#160;conversion.

         <title>Tunable Photochromism of Spirooxazine in the Solid State: A New Design Strategy Based on the Hypochromic Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy based on the hypochromic effect is proposed to develop photochromic spirooxazine in the solid state, and tunable solid photochromism for spirooxazine is realized under mild conditions.








Abstract
As an important organic photofunctional material, spirooxazine (SO) usually does not exhibit photochromism in the solid state since the intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking impedes photoisomerization. Developing photochromic SO in the solid state is crucial for practical applications but is still full of challenges. Here, a series of spirooxazine derivatives (SO1&#8211;SO4) with bulky aromatic substituents at the 4&#8208; and 7&#8208;positions of the skeleton, which provide them with a large volume with which to undergo solid&#8208;state photochromism under mild conditions, is designed and synthesized. All the compounds SO1&#8211;SO4 exhibit tunable solid photochromism without ground colors, excellent fatigue resistance, and high thermal stability. Notably, it takes only 15&#160;s for SO4 to reach the saturation of absorption intensity, thought to represent the fastest solid&#8208;state photoresponse of spirooxazines. X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the intermediate compound SO0 and the products SO1&#8211;SO2 as well as computational studies suggest that the bulky aromatic groups can lead to a hypochromic effect, allowing for the photochromism of SO in the solid state. The ideal photochromic properties of these spirooxazines open a new avenue for their applications in UV printing, quick response code, and related fields.

Notably, it takes only 15&#160;s for &lt;b&gt;SO4&lt;/b&gt; to reach the saturation of absorption intensity, thought to represent the fastest solid-state photoresponse of spirooxazines. X-ray crystal structures of the intermediate compound &lt;b&gt;SO0&lt;/b&gt; and the products &lt;b&gt;SO1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;SO2&lt;/b&gt; as well as computational studies suggest that the bulky aromatic groups can lead to a hypochromic effect, allowing for the photochromism of SO in the solid state. The ideal photochromic properties of these spirooxazines open a new avenue for their applications in UV printing, quick response code, and related fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Backbone Engineering Enables Highly Efficient Polymer Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new pyridine&#8208;based polymer hole&#8208;transporting material is developed through backbone engineering strategy to simultaneously modulate the interface and crystallinity of inverted perovskite solar cells, resulting in a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 24.89% (certified 24.50%) with outstanding stability.








Abstract
The interface and crystallinity of perovskite films play a decisive role in determining the device performance, which is significantly influenced by the bottom hole&#8208;transporting material (HTM) of inverted perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Herein, a simple design strategy of polymer HTMs&#160;is&#160;reported, which can modulate the wettability and promote the anchoring by introducing pyridine units into the polyarylamine backbone, so as to realize efficient and stable inverted PVSCs. The HTM properties can be effectively modified by varying the linkage sites of pyridine units, and 3,5&#8208;linked PTAA&#8208;P1&#160;particularly demonstrates a more regulated molecular configuration for interacting with perovskites, leading to highly crystalline perovskite films with uniform back contact and reduced defect density. Dopant&#8208;free PTAA&#8208;P1&#8208;based inverted PVSCs have realized remarkable efficiencies of 24.89% (certified value: 24.50%) for small&#8208;area (0.08&#160;cm2) as well as 23.12% for large&#8208;area (1&#160;cm2) devices. Moreover, the unencapsulated device maintains over 93% of its initial efficiency after 800&#160;h of maximum power point tracking under simulated AM 1.5G illumination.

         <title>Control of Host&#8208;Matrix Morphology Enables Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixing a sterically bulky, electron&#8208;transporting host material into a conventional single host&#8211;guest emissive layer&#160;is&#160;demonstrated&#160;to suppress phase separation of the host matrix while increasing the efficiency by 120% and the&#160;operational lifetime of deep&#8208;blue phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with chromaticity coordinates of (0.14, 0.15).








Abstract
Mixing a sterically bulky, electron&#8208;transporting host material into a conventional single host&#8211;guest emissive layer is&#160;demonstrated&#160;to&#160;suppress phase separation of the host matrix while increasing the efficiency and operational lifetime of deep&#8208;blue phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PHOLEDs) with chromaticity coordinates of (0.14, 0.15). The bulky host enables homogenous mixing of the molecules comprising the emissive layer while suppressing single host aggregation; a significant loss channel of nonradiative recombination. By controlling the amorphous phase of the host&#8208;matrix morphology, the mixed&#8208;host device achieves a significant reduction in nonradiative exciton decay, resulting in 120 &#177; 6% increase in external quantum efficiency relative to an analogous, single&#8208;host device. In contrast to single host PHOLEDs where electrons are transported by the host and holes by the dopants, both charge carriers are conducted by the mixed host, reducing the probability of exciton annihilation, thereby doubling of the deep&#8208;blue PHOLED operational lifetime. These findings demonstrate that the host matrix morphology affects almost every aspect of PHOLED performance.

         <title>Scaled&#8208;Up Synthesis of Freestanding Molybdenum Disulfide Membranes for Nanopore Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to scale up freestanding synthesis of MoS2 sheets on 100 mm&#8208;diameter silicon wafers that have hundreds of nanoapertures is proposed. The MoS2 sheets cover the apertures to form ultrathin membranes that are useful in nanopore sensing.








Abstract
2D materials are ideal for nanopores with optimal detection sensitivity and resolution. Among these, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has gained traction as a less hydrophobic material than graphene. However, experiments using 2D nanopores remain challenging due to the lack of scalable methods for high&#8208;quality freestanding membranes. Herein, a site&#8208;directed, scaled&#8208;up synthesis of MoS2 membranes on predrilled nanoapertures on 4&#8208;inch wafer substrates with 75% yields is reported. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which introduces sulfur and molybdenum dioxide vapors across the sub&#8208;100 nm nanoapertures results in exclusive formation of freestanding membranes that seal the apertures. Nucleation and growth near the nanoaperture edges is followed by nanoaperture decoration with MoS2, which proceeds until a critical flake curvature is achieved, after which fully spanning freestanding membranes form. Intentional blocking of reagent flow through the apertures inhibits MoS2 nucleation around the nanoapertures, promoting the formation of large&#8208;crystal monolayer MoS2 membranes. The in situ grown membranes along with facile membrane wetting and nanopore formation using dielectric breakdown enables the recording of dsDNA translocation events at an unprecedentedly high 1 MHz bandwidth. The methods presented here are important steps toward the development of scalable single&#8208;layer membrane manufacture for 2D nanofluidics and nanopore applications.

         <title>Toward the Speed Limit of Phase&#8208;Change Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The operation speeds of elemental Sb devices are explored by both&#160;theoretical calculations and experiments. It is directly demonstrated that the fastest speed of elemental Sb is &#8776;242&#160;ps, which is also the fastest operation speed as found among known phase&#8208;change memory.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;change memory (PCM) is one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation data&#8208;storage technology, the programming speed of which has enhanced within a timescale from milliseconds to sub&#8208;nanosecond (&#8776;500 ps) through decades of effort. As the potential applications of PCM strongly depend on the switching speed, namely, the time required for the recrystallization of amorphous chalcogenide media, the finding of the ultimate crystallization speed is of great importance both theoretically and practically. In&#160;this&#160;work, through systematic analysis of discovered phase&#8208;change materials and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, elemental Sb&#8208;based PCM is predicted to have a superfast crystallization speed. Indeed, such cells experimentally present extremely fast crystallization speeds within 360&#160;ps. Remarkably, the recrystallization process is further sped up as the device shrinks, and a record&#8208;fast crystallization speed of only 242&#160;ps is achieved in 60&#160;nm&#8208;size devices. These findings open opportunities for dynamic random&#8208;access memory (DRAM)&#8208;like and even cache&#8208;like PCM using appropriate storage materials.

         <title>Prominent Free Charges Tunneling Through Organic Interlayer of 2D Perovskites</title>

Abstract
The diversity of organic cations greatly enriched the species of 2D perovskites; traditional 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) and Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ) perovskites are synthesized by two different organic amines. Here, according to the difference in pKa values between conjugated acids of monoprotonated and biprotonated 4&#8208;(2&#8208;Aminoethyl)pyridine (4AEPy) ions, we report the 2D perovskites of RP (4AEPy)2PbI4 and DJ (4AEPy)PbI4 from same organic amine, which can realize reversible transformation under the treatment of HI and NH3, respectively. The interaction of N&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N hydrogen bond between adjacent organic molecules in (4AEPy)2PbI4 leads to the bending conformation of ethylamine groups, which results in a 2.4 &#197; reduction in layer spacing compared to typical phenylethylamine lead iodine ((PEA)2PbI4) 2D perovskite. Besides, the ethylamine groups of organic layers in (4AEPy)PbI4 are deeply inserted into octahedral cavities and directly participate in the construction of the conduction band minimum, which leads to a small exciton binding energy of 27.3 meV. The stronger coupling between the organic and inorganic layers and the minor exciton binding energy can promote the DJ phase to possess a more stable structure and better optoelectronic properties. We further compared their optoelectronic performance of single crystal counterparts, and (4AEPy)PbI4 device displays better light response and X&#8208;ray detection capability with a high sensitivity of 5627 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1cm&#8722;2 and the lowest detectable dose rate of 20 nGyairs&#8722;1.

&lt;p&gt;The diversity of organic cations greatly enriched the species of 2D perovskites; traditional 2D Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) and Dion-Jacobson (DJ) perovskites are synthesized by two different organic amines. Here, according to the difference in pKa values between conjugated acids of monoprotonated and biprotonated 4-(2-Aminoethyl)pyridine (4AEPy) ions, we report the 2D perovskites of RP (4AEPy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and DJ (4AEPy)PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; from same organic amine, which can realize reversible transformation under the treatment of HI and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. The interaction of N-H&#183;&#183;&#183;N hydrogen bond between adjacent organic molecules in (4AEPy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; leads to the bending conformation of ethylamine groups, which results in a 2.4 &#197; reduction in layer spacing compared to typical phenylethylamine lead iodine ((PEA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) 2D perovskite. Besides, the ethylamine groups of organic layers in (4AEPy)PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are deeply inserted into octahedral cavities and directly participate in the construction of the conduction band minimum, which leads to a small exciton binding energy of 27.3 meV. The stronger coupling between the organic and inorganic layers and the minor exciton binding energy can promote the DJ phase to possess a more stable structure and better optoelectronic properties. We further compared their optoelectronic performance of single crystal counterparts, and (4AEPy)PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; device displays better light response and X-ray detection capability with a high sensitivity of 5627 &#956;C Gy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and the lowest detectable dose rate of 20 nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Bimetallic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Biomimetic Nanoplatform Enhances Anti&#8208;Leukemia Immunity Via Synchronizing DNA Demethylation and RNA Hypermethylation</title>

Abstract
Despite considerable progress achieved by immunotherapy against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) over the past decades, most patients relapse within 6 months. Epigenetic alterations&#8208;mediated antigenicity reducing in leukemic blasts (LBs) is one of the critical mechanisms of immune escape and resistance to T cell&#8211;based immunotherapy. Herein, we fabricated a bimetallic Mn2+/Fe3+ metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based biomimetic nanoplatform (termed as AFMMB) that consists of DNA hypomethylating agent, leukemia stem cells (LSCs) membrane and pro&#8208;autophagic Beclin&#8208;1 peptide. These AFMMB particles selectively targeted not only LBs but also LSCs due to the homing effect and immune compatibility of the LSC membrane, and induced autophagy by binding to the Golgi apparatus&#8208;associated protein. The autophagy&#8208;triggered dissolution of AFMMB released active components, resulting in the restoration of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway by inhibiting DNA methylation, upregulation of MHC&#8208;I molecules, and induction of RNA methylation&#8208;mediated decay of PD&#8208;L1 transcripts. These dual epigenetic changes eventually enhance T cell&#8208;mediated immune response due to increased antigenicity of AML cells. AFMMB also could suppress growth and metastases of solid tumor, which was suggestive of a pan&#8208;cancer effect. These findings demonstrated that AFMMB may serve as a promising new nanoplatform for dual epigenetic therapy against cancer and warrants clinical validation.

         <title>Assessing Biomaterial&#8208;induced Stem Cell Lineage Fate by Machine Learning&#8208;based Artificial Intelligence</title>

Abstract
Current functional assessment of biomaterial&#8208;induced stem cell lineage fate in vitro mainly relies on biomarker&#8208;dependent methods with limited accuracy and efficiency. Here we report a &#8220;Mesenchymal stem cell Differentiation Prediction (MeD&#8208;P)&#8221; framework for biomaterial&#8208;induced cell lineage fate prediction. MeD&#8208;P contains a cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific gene expression profile as a reference by integrating public RNA&#8208;seq data related to tri&#8208;lineage differentiation (osteogenesis, chondrogenesis, and adipogenesis) of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and a predictive model for classifying hMSCs differentiation lineages using the k&#8208;nearest neighbors (kNN) strategy. We show that MeD&#8208;P exhibits an overall accuracy of 90.63% on testing datasets, which is significantly higher than the model constructed based on canonical marker genes (80.21%). Moreover, evaluations of multiple biomaterials show that MeD&#8208;P provides accurate prediction of lineage fate on different types of biomaterials as early as the first week of hMSCs culture. In summary, we demonstrate that MeD&#8208;P is an efficient and accurate strategy for stem cell lineage fate prediction and preliminary biomaterial functional evaluation.

         <title>Exciton Manipulation for Enhancing Photo&#8208;electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Wrinkled 2D Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
2D materials&#8217; junctions have demonstrated capabilities as metal&#8208;free alternatives for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). To date, HER has been limited to heterojunctions of different compositions or structures. The potential of local strain modulation based on wrinkled 2D heterostructures is demonstrated here that helps to realize photoelectrocatalytically active junctions. By forming wrinkled regions of high and low tensile strain in WS2 monolayers, local modification of its band structure and internal electric field due to piezoelectricity are created in the lateral direction. This structure produced efficient electron&#8208;hole pair generation due to light trapping and exciton funneling towards the crest of the WS2 wrinkles and enhanced exciton separation. Additionally, the formation of wrinkles induces an air gap in&#8208;between the 2D layer and substrate which reduces the interface scattering effect and consequently enhances the charge carrier mobility. A detailed study of the strain&#8208;dependence of photocatalytic HER demonstrates a two&#8208;fold enhancement in the Tafel slope and a 30&#8208;fold enhancement in exchange current density. Finally, optimization of the light absorption through functionalization with quantum dots and 2D heterojunction produces unprecedented photo&#8208;electrocatalytic performance and provides a route towards the scalable formation of strain&#8208;modulated WS2 nano&#8208;junctions for future energy generation.

         <title>Interface Engineering Toward Expedited Li2S Deposition in Lithium&#8208;sulfur Batteries: a Critical Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) with superior energy density are among the most promising candidates of next&#8208;generation energy storage techniques. As the key step contributing to 75% of the overall capacity, Li2S deposition remains a formidable challenge for LSBs applications because of its sluggish kinetics. The severe kinetic issue originates from the huge interfacial impedances, indicative of the interface&#8208;dominated nature of Li2S deposition. Accordingly, increasing efforts have been devoted to interface engineering for efficient Li2S deposition, which has attained inspiring success to date. However, a systematic overview and in&#8208;depth understanding of this critical field is still absent. In this review, the principles of interface&#8208;controlled Li2S precipitation are presented, clarifying the pivotal roles of electrolyte&#8208;substrate and electrolyte&#8208;Li2S interfaces in regulating Li2S depositing behavior. For the optimization of electrolyte&#8208;substrate interface, efforts on the design of substrates including metal compounds, functionalized carbons, and organic compounds are systematically summarized. Regarding the regulation of electrolyte&#8208;Li2S interface, the progress of applying polysulfides catholytes, redox mediators, and high&#8208;donicity/polarity electrolytes is overviewed in detail. Finally, the challenges and possible solutions aiming at optimizing Li2S deposition are given for further development of practical LSBs. This review would inspire more insightful works and, more importantly, may enlighten other electrochemical areas concerning heterogeneous deposition processes.

         <title>Electrically Switchable Polarization in Bi2O2Se Ferroelectric Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switchable ferroelectric polarization in Bi2O2Se semiconductors is experimentally and theoretically investigated. The interplay between ferroelectricity and semiconducting characteristics of Bi2O2Se is explored on device&#8208;level operation. Leveraging its ferroelectric polarization, the fabricated device exhibits &#8220;smart&#8221; photoresponse tunability. This research provides valuable insights into the synergistic effect of ferroelectricity with semiconducting characteristics in 2D ferroelectric semiconductors, toward device simplification and miniaturization.








Abstract
Atomically 2D layered ferroelectric semiconductors, in which the polarization switching process occurs within the channel material itself, offer a new material platform that can drive electronic components toward structural simplification and high&#8208;density integration. Here, a room&#8208;temperature 2D layered ferroelectric semiconductor, bismuth oxychalcogenides (Bi2O2Se), is investigated with a thickness down to 7.3&#160;nm (&#8776;12 layers) and piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of 4.4 &#177; 0.1 pm V&#8722;1. The random orientations and electrically dependent polarization of the dipoles in Bi2O2Se are separately uncovered owing to the structural symmetry&#8208;breaking at room temperature. Specifically, the interplay between ferroelectricity and semiconducting characteristics of Bi2O2Se is explored on device&#8208;level operation, revealing the hysteresis behavior and memory window (MW) formation. Leveraging the ferroelectric polarization originating from Bi2O2Se, the fabricated device exhibits &#8220;smart&#8221; photoresponse tunability and excellent electronic characteristics, e.g., a high on/off current ratio &gt;&#160;104 and a large MW to the sweeping range of 47% at VGS&#160;=&#160;&#177;5&#160;V. These results demonstrate the synergistic combination of ferroelectricity with semiconducting characteristics in Bi2O2Se, laying the foundation for integrating sensing, logic, and memory functions into a single material system that can overcome the bottlenecks in von Neumann architecture.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomically 2D layered ferroelectric semiconductors, in which the polarization switching process occurs within the channel material itself, offer a new material platform that can drive electronic components toward structural simplification and high-density integration. Here, a room-temperature 2D layered ferroelectric semiconductor, bismuth oxychalcogenides (Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se), is investigated with a thickness down to 7.3&#160;nm (&#8776;12 layers) and piezoelectric coefficient (d&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt;) of 4.4 &#177; 0.1 pm V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The random orientations and electrically dependent polarization of the dipoles in Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se are separately uncovered owing to the structural symmetry-breaking at room temperature. Specifically, the interplay between ferroelectricity and semiconducting characteristics of Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se is explored on device-level operation, revealing the hysteresis behavior and memory window (MW) formation. Leveraging the ferroelectric polarization originating from Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se, the fabricated device exhibits &#8220;smart&#8221; photoresponse tunability and excellent electronic characteristics, e.g., a high on/off current ratio &amp;gt;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and a large MW to the sweeping range of 47% at V&lt;sub&gt;GS&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;&#177;5&#160;V. These results demonstrate the synergistic combination of ferroelectricity with semiconducting characteristics in Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se, laying the foundation for integrating sensing, logic, and memory functions into a single material system that can overcome the bottlenecks in von Neumann architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrical Manipulation of Topological Phases in a Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;gated Cr&#8208;doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 magnetic topological insulator devices are fabricated by combining molecular beam epitaxial growth and&#160;2D transfer methods. The large gate&#8208;tunability using mica as the gate dielectric leads to the observation of the reversible transition between two distinct topological phases, namely the quantum anomalous Hall and the anomalous Hall insulator, via electric field tuning.








Abstract
Quantum anomalous Hall phases arising from the inverted band topology in magnetically doped topological insulators have emerged as an important subject of research for quantization at zero magnetic fields. Though necessary for practical implementation, sophisticated electrical control of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)&#8208;grown quantum anomalous Hall matter have been stymied by growth and fabrication challenges. Here, a novel procedure is demonstrated, employing a combination of thin&#8208;film deposition and 2D&#160;material stacking techniques, to create dual&#8208;gated devices of the MBE&#8208;grown quantum anomalous Hall insulator, Cr&#8208;doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3. In these devices, orthogonal control over the field&#8208;induced charge density and the electric displacement field is demonstrated. A thorough examination of material responses to tuning along each control axis is presented, realizing magnetic property control along the former and a novel capability to manipulate the surface exchange gap along the latter. Through electrically addressing the exchange gap, the capabilities to either strengthen the quantum anomalous Hall state or suppress it entirely and drive a topological phase transition to a trivial state are demonstrated. The experimental result is explained using first principle theoretical calculations, and establishes a practical route for in situ control of quantum anomalous Hall states and topology.

         <title>Seeding and Emergence of Composite Skyrmions in a van der Waals Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Composite skyrmions with non&#8208;unitary topological charge are imaged in exfoliated flakes of the 2D magnet Fe3GeTe2. Transitions between skyrmion, skyrmionium, skyrmion bag, and skyrmion sack states reveal details concerning the topological protection of the observed objects. The general nature of the seeding and emergence formation mechanism highlights that composite skyrmions may await discovery in both well&#8208;known and future skyrmion materials.








Abstract
Topological charge plays a significant role in a range of physical systems. In particular, observations of real&#8208;space topological objects in magnetic materials have been largely limited to skyrmions &#8211; states with a unitary topological charge. Recently, more exotic states with varying topology, such as antiskyrmions, merons, or bimerons and 3D states such as skyrmion strings, chiral bobbers, and hopfions, have been experimentally reported. Along these lines, the realization of states with higher&#8208;order topology has the potential to open new avenues of research in topological magnetism and its spintronic applications. Here, real&#8208;space imaging of such spin textures, including skyrmion, skyrmionium, skyrmion bag, and skyrmion sack states, observed in exfoliated flakes of the van der Waals magnet Fe3&#8722;xGeTe2 (FGT) is reported. These composite skyrmions may emerge from seeded, loop&#8208;like states condensed into the stripe domain structure, demonstrating the possibility to realize spin textures with arbitrary integer topological charge within exfoliated flakes of 2D magnets. The general nature of the formation mechanism motivates the search for composite skyrmion states in both well&#8208;known and new magnetic materials, which may yet reveal an even richer spectrum of higher&#8208;order topological&#160;objects.

         <title>Bioinspired Self&#8208;Growing Hydrogels by Harnessing Interfacial Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the self&#8208;growing behaviors of keratin proteins, the fabrication of synthetic hydrogels by harnessing free radical polymerization at the interface between a&#160;monomer precursor solution and a&#160;liquid metal is reported, which can be further exploited for functional actuators and soft robotics.








Abstract
The production of natural materials is achieved through a bottom&#8208;up approach, in which materials spontaneously grow and adapt to the external environment. Synthetic materials are specifically designed and fabricated as engineered materials; however, they are far away from these natural self&#8208;growing attributes. Thus, design and fabrication of synthetic material systems to replicate the self&#8208;growing characteristics of those natural prototypes (i.e., hairs and nails) remains challenging. Inspired by the self&#8208;growing behaviors of keratin proteins, here the fabrication of synthetic hydrogels (i.e., polyacrylamide (PAAm)) from the free radical polymerization at the interface between AAm precursor solution and liquid metals (i.e., eutectic gallium&#8211;indium (EGaIn)) is reported. The newly formed hydrogel materials at the EGaIn/AAm precursor interface gradually push the whole hydrogel upward, enabling the self&#8208;growing of these synthetic hydrogel materials. This work not only endows the fabrication of synthetic materials with unprecedented self&#8208;growing characters, but also broadens the potential applications of self&#8208;growing materials in actuation and soft robotics.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Transfer of Freestanding Large&#8208;Area Conjugated Polymer Films for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A technique to enable deposition of large&#8208;area, freestanding, ultra&#8208;thin, conjugated polymer films, which can be transferred to a desired substrate without using solvents, is demonstrated. The quality of these films is assessed by a variety of techniques, and limiting factors and strategies are identified.








Abstract
Conventional processes for depositing thin films of conjugated polymers are restricted to those based on vapor, liquid, and solution&#8208;phase precursors. Each of these methods bear some limitations. For example, low&#8208;bandgap polymers with alternating donor&#8211;acceptor structures cannot be deposited from the vapor phase, and solution&#8208;phase deposition is always subject to issues related to the incompatibility of the substrate with the solvent. Here, a technique to enable deposition of large&#8208;area, ultra&#8208;thin films (&#8776;20 nm or more), which are transferred from the surface of water, is demonstrated. From the water, these pre&#8208;solidified films can then be transferred to a desired substrate, circumventing limitations such as solvent orthogonality. The quality of these films is characterized by a variety of imaging and electrochemical measurements. Mechanical toughness is identified as a limiting property of polymer compatibility, along with some strategies to address this limitation. As a demonstration, the films are used as the hole&#8208;transport layer in perovskite solar cells, in which their performance is shown to be comparable to controls formed by&#160;spin&#8208;coating.

         <title>An Ultrasound&#8208;Driven Bioadhesive Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Instant Wound Sealing and Electrically Accelerated Healing in Emergencies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy of instant wound sealing and electrically assisted wound healing by an ultrasound&#8208;driven bioadhesive triboelectric nanogenerator is used to treat wounds in an emergency, to avoid serving hemostasis and infection, and the electrical stimulation driven by ultrasound promotes skin wound healing significantly via cell migration and proliferation, being a potential first&#8208;aid rescue and self&#8208;help method of portable medical devices.








Abstract
A bioadhesive triboelectric nanogenerator (BA&#8208;TENG), as a first&#8208;aid rescue for instant and robust wound sealing and ultrasound&#8208;driven accelerated wound healing, is designed. This BA&#8208;TENG is fabricated with biocompatible materials, and integrates a flexible TENG as the top layer and bioadhesive as the bottom layer, resulting in effective electricity supply and strong sutureless sealing capability on wet tissues. When driven by ultrasound, the BA&#8208;TENG can produce a stable voltage of 1.50&#160;V and current of 24.20&#160;&#181;A underwater. The ex vivo porcine colon organ models show that the BA&#8208;TENG seals defects instantly (&#8776;5 s) with high interfacial toughness (&#8776;150 J m&#8722;2), while the rat bleeding liver incision model confirms that the BA&#8208;TENG performs rapid wound closure and hemostasis, reducing the blood loss by about 82%. When applied in living rats, the BA&#8208;TENG not only seals skin injuries immediately but also produces a strong electric field (E&#8208;field) of about 0.86&#160;kV m&#8722;1 stimulated by ultrasound to accelerate skin wound healing significantly. The in vitro studies confirm that these effects are attributed to the E&#8208;field&#8208;accelerated cell migration and proliferation.

     alt="An Ultrasound-Driven Bioadhesive Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Instant Wound Sealing and Electrically Accelerated Healing in Emergencies"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel strategy of instant wound sealing and electrically assisted wound healing by an ultrasound-driven bioadhesive triboelectric nanogenerator is used to treat wounds in an emergency, to avoid serving hemostasis and infection, and the electrical stimulation driven by ultrasound promotes skin wound healing significantly via cell migration and proliferation, being a potential first-aid rescue and self-help method of portable medical devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bioadhesive triboelectric nanogenerator (BA-TENG), as a first-aid rescue for instant and robust wound sealing and ultrasound-driven accelerated wound healing, is designed. This BA-TENG is fabricated with biocompatible materials, and integrates a flexible TENG as the top layer and bioadhesive as the bottom layer, resulting in effective electricity supply and strong sutureless sealing capability on wet tissues. When driven by ultrasound, the BA-TENG can produce a stable voltage of 1.50&#160;V and current of 24.20&#160;&#181;A underwater. The ex vivo porcine colon organ models show that the BA-TENG seals defects instantly (&#8776;5 s) with high interfacial toughness (&#8776;150 J m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), while the rat bleeding liver incision model confirms that the BA-TENG performs rapid wound closure and hemostasis, reducing the blood loss by about 82%. When applied in living rats, the BA-TENG not only seals skin injuries immediately but also produces a strong electric field (E-field) of about 0.86&#160;kV m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; stimulated by ultrasound to accelerate skin wound healing significantly. The in vitro studies confirm that these effects are attributed to the E-field-accelerated cell migration and proliferation. In addition, these TENG adhesives can be applied to not only wound treatment, nerve stimulation and regeneration, and charging batteries in implanted devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Fabrication of Benzoquinone Crystal Layer on the Surface of Nest&#8208;Structural Ionohydrogel for Flexible &#8220;All&#8208;in&#8208;One&#8221; Supercapattery</title>

         <dc:description>
A benzoquinone crystal&#8211;gel interface (CGI) membrane is fabricated on the surface of nest&#8208;structural ionohydrogel through the in situ electrochemical deposition of benzoquinone. Thus, an integrated CGI&#8208;gel platform with a middle body as electrolyte and the surficial redox&#8208;active CGI membrane for electrochemical energy conversion and storage is achieved. This CGI&#8208;gel platform greatly simplifies the fabrication of flexible energy&#8208;storage devices and dramatically improves its electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Flexible energy&#8208;storage devices lay the foundation for a convenient, advanced, fossil fuel&#8208;free society. However, the fabrication of flexible energy&#8208;storage devices remains a tremendous challenge due to the intrinsic dissimilarities between electrode and electrolyte. In this study, a strategy is proposed for fabricating a flexible electrode and electrolyte entirely inside a matrix. First, a nest&#8208;structural and redox&#8208;active ionohydrogel with excellent stretchability (up to 3000%) and conductivity (167.9 mS cm&#8722;1) is designed using a hydrated ionic liquid (HIL) solvent and chemical foaming strategy. The nest&#8208;structure ionohydrogel provides sufficient &#8220;highways&#8221; and &#8220;service area&#8221;, and the cation in HIL facilitates the reaction, transportation, and deposition of benzoquinone. Subsequently, in situ, a novel benzoquinone crystal&#8211;gel interface (CGI) is in situ fabricated on the surface of the ionohydrogel through electrochemical deposition of benzoquinone. Thus, an integrated CGI&#8208;gel platform is successfully achieved with a middle body as an electrolyte and the surficial redox&#8208;active CGI membrane for electrochemical energy conversion and storage. Based on the CGI&#8208;gel platform, an extreme simple and effective &#8220;stick&#8208;to&#8208;use&#8221; strategy is proposed for constructing flexible energy&#8208;storage devices and then a series of flexible supercapatteries are fabricated with high stretchability and capacitance (5222.1 mF cm&#8722;2 at 600% strain), low self&#8208;discharge and interfacial resistance and a wearable, self&#8208;power and intelligent display.

         <title>Enhanced Moisture Stability of Lithium&#8208;Rich Antiperovskites for Sustainable All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hygroscopicity of lithium&#8208;rich antiperovskites (LiRAPs) is successfully suppressed by weakening the intermolecular hydrogen bond between LiRAPs and H2O with fluorine doping. Based on the high moisture resistivity and the low melting point of LiRAPs, two prototypes of all ceramic lithium batteries (ACLBs) are assembled in ambient air by means of co&#8208;coating sintering and melt&#8208;infiltration, respectively.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich antiperovskites (LiRAPs) solid electrolytes have attracted extensive interest due to their advantages of structural tunability, mechanical flexibility, and low cost. However, LiRAPs are instinctively hygroscopic and suffer from decomposition in air, which not only diversifies their electrochemical performances in present reports but also hinders their application in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). Herein, the origin of the hygroscopicity, and also the effect of the hygroscopicity on the electrochemical performances of Li3&#8722;x(OHx)Cl are systematically investigated. Li3&#8722;x(OHx)Cl is demonstrated to be unstable in the air and prone to decompose into LiOH and LiCl. Nevertheless, with fluorine doping on chlorine sites, the hygroscopicity of LiRAPs is suppressed by weakening the intermolecular hydrogen bond between LiRAPs and H2O, forming a moisture&#8208;resistive Li3&#8722;x(OHx)Cl0.9F0.1. Taking advantage of its low melting point (274&#160;&#176;C), two prototypes of ASSLBs are assembled in the ambient air by means of co&#8208;coating sintering and melt&#8208;infiltration. With LiRAPs as the solder, low&#8208;temperature sintering of the ASSLBs with low interfacial resistance is demonstrated as feasible. The understanding of the hygroscopic behavior of LiRAPs and the integration of the moisture&#8208;resistive LiRAPs with ASSLBs provide an effective way toward the fabrication of the ASSLBs.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;crosslinked, highly entangled hydrogels with excellent mechanical properties but ultra&#8208;low solid content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ordinary hydrogels are brittle and weak for many reasons, but their low solid content is the ultimate one. Their mechanical properties usually worsen sharply with decreasing solid content. Here by combining two recently developed approaches, hydrogels with ultra&#8208;low solid content but good mechanical properties were successfully synthesized. The gels were synthesized using high monomer concentrations and low crosslinker/monomer ratios to obtain highly entangled structure. Peptide chains were introduced by using a poly(L&#8208;lysine)&#8208;based peptide crosslinker. Compared with hydrogel crosslinked with common crosslinker BIS, the peptide&#8208;crosslinked one has a larger swelling degree in water, leading to fully swollen gel with ultra&#8208;low solid content (5.8%). However, it still exhibits excellent mechanical properties, including high stretchability (440%), high tensile strength (220 KPa), superb resilience (99%), high fracture toughness (2100 J/m2), excellent fatigue resistance (720 J/m2), low friction (0.0059) and high wear resistance. These properties are comparable to or even better than the BIS&#8208;crosslinked hydrogel, despite that the former has much lower solid content. The excellent mechanical properties of the peptide&#8208;crosslinked gel are attributed to its highly entangled structure and also the introduction of a novel mechanism for energy dissipation, i.e, energy dissipation via breakage of intramolecular hydrogen bonds stabilizing the helical structure of peptide.

         <title>Inhibited cracks development by compressive strain in perovskite solar cells with improved mechanical stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are promising as next&#8208;generation photovoltaic materials, but stability issues are still a huge obstacle to their commercialization. Here, we investigate the formation and evolution of cracks in perovskite films during thermal cycling, which affects their mechanical stability. We employ compressive strain to suppress cracks and delamination in situ formed polymers with low elastic modulus during crystal growth. The resultant devices passed the thermal cycling qualification (IEC61215:2016), retaining 95% of the initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) and compressive strain after 230 cycles. Meanwhile, the p&#8208;i&#8208;n devices delivered PCEs of 23.91% (0.0805 cm2) and 23.27% (1 cm2). Our findings shed light on strain engineering with respect to their evolution, which enables mechanically stable perovskite solar cells.

         <title>A Matrix Metalloproteinase&#8208;Responsive Hydrogel System for Modulating the Immune Microenvironment in Myocardial Infarction</title>

Abstract
Injectable hydrogels carrying therapeutic factors to modulate the infarct immune microenvironment show great potential in the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI). However, conventional injectable hydrogels release therapeutic factors in an uncontrolled manner, which leads to poor treatment efficacy and acute side effects on normal tissues. Here, a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2/9&#8208;responsive hydrogel system (MPGC4) was developed considering the characteristics of the post&#8208;MI microenvironment. MPGC4 consists of tetra&#8208;polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogels and a composite gene nanocarrier (CTL4) that is composed of carbon dots (CDots) coupled with interleukin&#8208;4 plasmid DNA (IL4&#8208;pDNA) via electrostatic interactions. MPGC4 can be automatically triggered to release CTL4 on demand after MI to regulate the infarct immune microenvironment. In addition, due to the photoluminescence properties of CDots, a large amount of viscoelastic MPGC4 was found to be retained in situ after injection into the infarct region without leakage. The in vitro results demonstrated that CTL4 promotes proinflammatory M1 macrophage polarization to the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 subtype and contributes to cardiomyocyte survival through macrophage transition. In a rat model of MI, MPGC4 cleared MMPs and precisely targeted CTL4 to the infarcted region. In particular, MPGC4 improves cardiac function by modulating macrophage transition to reduce early inflammatory responses and proangiogenic activity.

         <title>Reprocessable and Chemically Recyclable Hard Vitrimers Based on Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Epoxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;crystalline epoxy vitrimers (LCEVs) are synthesized using imine and ester moieties as dynamic covalent bonds. The cured products are reprocessed by imine metathesis and transesterification. Moreover, the imine group is chemically decomposed and resin recycling is achieved via recombination. Repeated reprocessing and recycling are realized, and the products exhibit excellent thermal and mechanical properties owing to their LC nature.








Abstract
The rapid increase in demand for recyclable and reusable thermosets has necessitated the development of materials with chemical structures that exhibit these features. Thus, functional mesogenic epoxide monomers bearing both ester and imine groups that can be vitrimerized and recycled are reported herein. The compounds show mesophase characteristics at 100&#8211;200&#160;&#176;C and can be converted into hard epoxides by a common curing reaction. The obtained hard epoxides have high isotropic thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.64 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), which is derived from their highly ordered microstructures. The cured products can be easily reprocessed through imine metathesis and transesterification, and decomposed products can be obtained through imine hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions and subsequently be re&#8208;cured. Surprisingly, recycled materials can be repeatedly reprocessed or chemically decomposed. The reprocessed materials retain the properties of their pristine counterparts, and the recycled products preserve the advantages of the hard thermosets without alteration to any of their unique properties. A dehydration reaction occurs between the residual hydroxyl groups during the re&#8208;hardening, which dramatically increases the glass transition temperature by &#8776;60&#160;&#176;C. These reprocessable and recyclable vitrimers demonstrate the effectiveness and environmental friendliness of the molecular design strategy reported herein.

         <title>Triplet Fusion Upconversion for Photocuring 3D&#8208;Printed Particle&#8208;Reinforced Composite Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct&#8208;ink&#8208;write printing and photocuring of opaque hydrogel composites are enabled by multiexciton triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion. Low energy red light is used for better penetration into opaque hydrogels and the upconverted blue light induces the free radical photopolymerization process. This method allows conventional photoinitiation systems to modify objects that block high energy photons.








Abstract
High energy photons (&#955;&#160;&lt;&#160;400&#160;nm) are frequently used to initiate free radical polymerizations to form polymer networks, but are only effective for transparent objects. This phenomenon poses a major challenge to additive manufacturing of particle&#8208;reinforced composite networks since deep light penetration of short&#8208;wavelength photons limits the homogeneous modification of physicochemical and mechanical properties. Herein, the unconventional, yet versatile, multiexciton process of triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) is employed for curing opaque hydrogel composites created by direct&#8208;ink&#8208;write (DIW) 3D printing. TTA&#8208;UC converts low energy red light (&#955;max&#160;=&#160;660&#160;nm) for deep penetration into higher&#8208;energy blue light to initiate free radical polymerizations within opaque objects. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, hydrogels containing up to 15&#160;wt.% TiO2 filler particles and doped with TTA&#8208;UC chromophores are readily cured with red light, while composites without the chromophores and TiO2 loadings as little as 1&#8211;2&#160;wt.% remain uncured. Importantly, this method has wide potential to modify the chemical and mechanical properties of complex DIW 3D&#8208;printed composite polymer networks.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Hole Coherence and Spatial Self&#8208;Phase Modulation in the Anisotropic 3D Weyl Semimetal TaAs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatial self&#8208;phase modulation (SSPM), a third&#8208;order nonlinear optical response is observed in a Weyl semimetal TaAs. This extends previous SSPM discoveries in 0D, 1D, and 2D materials into 3D materials. Also amazing is that it reveals the long&#8208;sought laser&#8208;induced hole coherence. Furthermore, SSPM in a topological semimetal is reported.








Abstract
Laser&#8208;induced electron coherence is a fascinating topic in manipulating quantum materials. Recently, it has been shown that laser&#8208;induced electron coherence in 2D materials can produce a third&#8208;order nonlinear optical response spatial self&#8208;phase modulation (SSPM), which has been used to develop a novel all&#8208;optical switching scheme. However, such investigations have mainly focused on electron coherence, whereas laser&#8208;induced hole coherence is rarely explored. Here, the observation of the optical Kerr effect in 3D Weyl semimetal TaAs flakes is reported. The nonlinear susceptibility (&#967;(3)) is obtained, which exhibits a surprisingly high value (with &#967;one&#8722;layer(3)\[{\bm{\chi }}_{{\bf one}{\bm{ - }}{\bf layer}}^{{\bf (3)}}\] = 9.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;9 e.s.u. or 1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;16&#160;m2&#160;V&#8722;2 at 532&#160;nm). This cannot be explained by the conventional electron mobility, but can be well understood by the unique high anisotropic hole mobility of TaAs. The wind&#8208;chime model and &#967;(3) carrier mobility correlation adequately explain the results, suggesting the crucial role of laser&#8208;induced nonlocal ac hole coherence. These observations extend the understanding of SSPM from 2D to 3D quantum materials with anisotropic carrier mobility and from electron coherence to hole coherence.

         <title>High&#8208;Gain of NdIII Complex Doped Optical Waveguide Amplifiers at 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#181;m Wavelengths Based on Intramolecular Energy Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on intramolecular energy transfer mechanism, high gains of 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#181;m are achieved simultaneously in complex Nd (TTA)3(XPO)&#8208;doped polymer waveguides by utilizing light&#8208;emitting diodes(LEDs) rather than semiconductor lasers as pumping sources. The novel complex is a high&#8208;gain material that can be easily spin&#8208;coated on different types of waveguides and is expected to have a critical role in planar photonic integration.








Abstract
Chelate phosphine oxide ligand (9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;xanthene&#8208;4,5&#8208;diyl) bis (diphenylphosphineoxide) (XPO) is prepared as a neutral ligand to synthesize complex Nd (TTA)3 (XPO) (TTA = 2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetone). An appropriate energy gap between the XPO and TTA ligands, which can support two additional energy transfer routines from the first excited triplet state (T1) energy level of the XPO to that of the TTA, improves energy transfer in the Nd complex. Based on intramolecular energy transfer mechanism, optical gains at 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#181;m are demonstrated in Nd (TTA)3 (XPO)&#8208;doped polymer waveguides with the excitation of low&#8208;power light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) instead of semiconductor lasers as pump sources. Using the vertical top&#8208;pumping mode of a 365&#160;nm LED, relative gains of 22.5 and 8.4&#160;dB&#160;cm&#8722;1 are obtained at 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#181;m, respectively, in a 0.2 cm long embedded waveguide with a cross&#8208;section of 8&#160;&#215;&#160;5&#160;&#181;m2. The active core layer is Nd (TTA)3 (XPO)&#8208;doped SU&#8208;8 polymer. Moreover, relative gains are achieved in evanescent&#8208;field waveguide with a cross&#8208;section of 6&#160;&#215;&#160;4&#160;&#181;m2. The 21.0 and 5.6&#160;dB&#160;cm&#8722;1 relative gains are achieved at 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#181;m, respectively, with a net gain of 13.8&#160;&#177;&#160;0.3&#160;dB&#160;cm&#8722;1 obtained at 1.06&#160;&#181;m in a 0.9 cm long SU&#8208;8 waveguide with Nd (TTA)3 (XPO)&#8208;doped polymethylmethacrylate as upper cladding.

&lt;p&gt;Based on intramolecular energy transfer mechanism, high gains of 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#181;m are achieved simultaneously in complex Nd (TTA)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(XPO)-doped polymer waveguides by utilizing light-emitting diodes(LEDs) rather than semiconductor lasers as pumping sources. The novel complex is a high-gain material that can be easily spin-coated on different types of waveguides and is expected to have a critical role in planar photonic integration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chelate phosphine oxide ligand (9,9-dimethyl-9H-xanthene-4,5-diyl) bis (diphenylphosphineoxide) (XPO) is prepared as a neutral ligand to synthesize complex Nd (TTA)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (XPO) (TTA = 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone). An appropriate energy gap between the XPO and TTA ligands, which can support two additional energy transfer routines from the first excited triplet state (T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) energy level of the XPO to that of the TTA, improves energy transfer in the Nd complex. Based on intramolecular energy transfer mechanism, optical gains at 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#181;m are demonstrated in Nd (TTA)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (XPO)-doped polymer waveguides with the excitation of low-power light-emitting diodes (LEDs) instead of semiconductor lasers as pump sources. Using the vertical top-pumping mode of a 365&#160;nm LED, relative gains of 22.5 and 8.4&#160;dB&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; are obtained at 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#181;m, respectively, in a 0.2 cm long embedded waveguide with a cross-section of 8&#160;&#215;&#160;5&#160;&#181;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The active core layer is Nd (TTA)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (XPO)-doped SU-8 polymer. Moreover, relative gains are achieved in evanescent-field waveguide with a cross-section of 6&#160;&#215;&#160;4&#160;&#181;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The 21.0 and 5.6&#160;dB&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; relative gains are achieved at 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#181;m, respectively, with a net gain of 13.8&#160;&#177;&#160;0.3&#160;dB&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; obtained at 1.06&#160;&#181;m in a 0.9 cm long SU-8 waveguide with Nd (TTA)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (XPO)-doped polymethylmethacrylate as upper cladding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Fabrication of Size&#8208;Controlled Pickering Emulsions, Colloidosomes, and Air&#8208;Coated Particles via Clog&#8208;Free Jetting of Suspensions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clog&#8208;free jetting of dense nanoparticle suspension and polymer solution is successfully realized by "jetting through&#160;a&#160;liquid layer" (JetALL). This technique&#160;enables the scalable jetting fabrication of size&#8208;controlled microcapsules with hydrophobic shells that form stable antibubbles (droplets encapsulated by a thin air shell underwater) for better controlled release. JetALL plays a key role in microencapsulation for drug delivery, preservation of food ingredients, and gas sensing.








Abstract
Microcapsules with a liquid core and a solid shell composed of hydrophobic nanoparticles are broadly applied in food, pharmaceutics, and biotechnologies. For example, Pickering emulsions, colloidosomes, or antibubbles (droplets surrounded by air layers in water) enable controlled release of active agents, biocompatibility, and contact&#8208;less liquid transportation. However, producing controlled nanoparticle&#8208; or polymer&#8208;laden hydrophobic shells at scale is highly challenging, since bulk methods are polydisperse and microfluidic chips are prone to clogging and slow. Here, clog&#8208;free coating of an aqueous jet with silica nanoparticle suspensions with concentrations up to 10% (w/v), as well as high concentrations of polymers (30% (w/v) poly(lactic acid) (PLA)), is demonstrated, enabling continuous generation of microcapsules at flow rates up to 4&#160;mL&#160;min&#8722;1. Pickering emulsions are converted into capsules, providing hydrophobic shells consisting of nanoparticles for controlled release. As a highlight, the scalable fabrication of&#160;air&#8208;coated capsules (antibubbles) in the sub&#8208;millimeter range is demonstrated. The shell contains an air film that protects the liquid core for days yet enables ultrasound&#8208;induced release within 3 min. By enabling rapid fabrication of controlled Pickering emulsions, colloidosomes, antibubbles, and biodegradable capsules, jetting through a liquid layer (JetALL) provides a versatile platform for advanced applications in food, pharmacy, and life science.

         <title>Dense Arrays of Nanohelices: Raman Scattering from Achiral Molecules Reveals the Near&#8208;Field Enhancements at Chiral Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metasurfaces manipulate light at the nanoscale for ultrathin optical devices. In this work, dense arrays of plasmonic nanohelices (&#8776;100 nm in length) that are of interest for many advanced nanophotonics applications are investigated; they present excellent surface enhanced Raman scattering properties. Two new ways to probe near&#8208;field enhancements generated with circular light polarization at chiral metasurfaces are demonstrated.








Abstract
Against the background of the current healthcare and climate emergencies, surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is becoming a highly topical technique for identifying and fingerprinting molecules, e.g., within viruses, bacteria, drugs, and atmospheric aerosols. Crucial for SERS is the need for substrates with strong and reproducible enhancements of the Raman signal over large areas and with a low fabrication cost. Here, dense arrays of plasmonic nanohelices (&#8776;100 nm in length), which are of interest for many advanced nanophotonics applications, are investigated, and they are shown to present excellent SERS properties. As an illustration, two new ways to probe near&#8208;field enhancement generated with circular polarization at chiral metasurfaces are presented, first using the Raman spectra of achiral molecules (crystal violet) and second using a single, element&#8208;specific, achiral molecular vibrational mode (i.e., a single Raman peak). The nanohelices can be fabricated over large areas at a low cost and they provide strong, robust and uniform Raman enhancement. It is anticipated that these advanced materials will find broad applications in surface enhanced Raman spectroscopies and material science.

         <title>Biomimetic In Vitro Lung Models: Current Challenges and Future Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chronic respiratory diseases are one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with a considerable disease burden. Current in vitro lung models must be evolved to replace inefficient animal models and enhance the translational power of preclinical studies. The current challenges of in vitro lung models are discussed, and the future perspectives for the evolution of these models for preclinical studies on cellular, material, and fabrication levels are outlined.








Abstract
As post&#8208;COVID complications, chronic respiratory diseases are one of the foremost causes of mortality. The quest for a cure for this recent global challenge underlines that the lack of predictive in vitro lung models is one of the main bottlenecks in pulmonary preclinical drug development. Despite rigorous efforts to develop biomimetic in vitro lung models, the current cutting&#8208;edge models represent a compromise in numerous technological and biological aspects. Most advanced in vitro models are still in the &#8220;proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept&#8221; phase with a low clinical translation of the findings. On the other hand, advances in cellular and molecular studies are mainly based on relatively simple and unrealistic in vitro models. Herein, the current challenges and potential strategies toward not only bioinspired but truly biomimetic lung models are discussed.

         <title>Machine&#8208;learning Assisted Electronic Skins Capable of Proprioception and Exteroception in Soft Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inspired by natural biological systems, soft robots have recently been developed, showing tremendous potential in real&#8208;world applications because of their intrinsic softness and deformability. The confluence of electronic skins and machine learning is extensively studied to create effective biomimetic robotic systems. Based on a differential piezoelectric matrix, this study presents a shape&#8208;sensing electronic skin (SSES) that can recognize surface conformations with minimal interference from pressing, stretching, or other surrounding stimuli. It is then integrated with soft robots to reconstruct their shape during movement, serving as a proprioceptive sense. Additionally, the robot could utilize machine learning to identify various terrains, demonstrating exteroception and pointing towards more advanced autonomous robots capable of performing real&#8208;world tasks in challenging environments.

         <title>Funnel Devices Based on Asymmetrically Strained Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The strain applied to transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) reduces their energy bandgap, and local strains results in a funnel&#8208;like band structure, in which funneled excitons move toward the most strained region. Herein, we report a funnel device based on asymmetrically strained WS2 and MoS2. Asymmetric strains were induced by transferring the TMD flakes onto a fork&#8208;shaped SU&#8208;8 microstructure. Raman and photoluminescence spectra peaks were shifted according to the morphology of the SU&#8208;8 microstructure, indicating application of asymmetric strains to the TMDs. To investigate whether funneled excitons can be converted to electrical currents, various devices were constructed by depositing symmetric and asymmetric electrodes onto the strained TMDs. The scanning photocurrent mapping (SPCM) images followed a fork&#8208;shaped pattern, indicating probable conversion of the funneled excitons into electrical currents. In the case of the funnel devices with asymmetric Au and Al electrodes, short&#8208;circuit current (ISC) of WS2 was enhanced by the strains, whereas ISC of MoS2 was suppressed because the Schottky barrier lowered with increasing strain for the MoS2, but not for the WS2. These results demonstrate that the funnel devices can be implemented using asymmetrically strained TMDs and the effect of strains on the Schottky barrier is dependent on the TMD used.

To investigate whether funneled excitons can be converted to electrical currents, various devices were constructed by depositing symmetric and asymmetric electrodes onto the strained TMDs. The scanning photocurrent mapping (SPCM) images followed a fork-shaped pattern, indicating probable conversion of the funneled excitons into electrical currents. In the case of the funnel devices with asymmetric Au and Al electrodes, short-circuit current (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;) of WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was enhanced by the strains, whereas &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt; of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was suppressed because the Schottky barrier lowered with increasing strain for the MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but not for the WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These results demonstrate that the funnel devices can be implemented using asymmetrically strained TMDs and the effect of strains on the Schottky barrier is dependent on the TMD used.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Microfluidics&#8208;enabled Serial Assembly of Lipid&#8208;siRNA&#8208;sorafenib Nanoparticles for Synergetic Hepatocellular Carcinoma Therapy</title>

Abstract
Multi&#8208;component nanoparticles (mNPs) hold great potential for disease prevention and treatment. However, a major barrier is the lack of versatile platforms to accommodate steps of assembly processes of mNPs. Here we present the microfluidics&#8208;enabled serial assembly (MESA) of mNPs. The microfluidic chip, as a mini&#8208;conveyor of initial materials, sequentially enables the assembly of sorafenib supramolecule, electrostatic adsorption of siRNA, and surface assembly of protective lipids. The produced lipid&#8208;siRNA&#8208;sorafenib nanoparticles (LSS NPs) have ultrahigh encapsulation efficiencies for sorafenib (&#8764;100%) and siRNA (&#8764;95%), which benefits from the accommodation of both fast and slow processes on the chip. Although carrying negative charges, LSS NPs enable cytosolic delivery of agents and high gene silencing efficiency within tumor cells. In vivo, the LSS NPs delivering hypoxia&#8208;induced factor (HIF1&#945;)&#8208;targeted siRNA efficiently regress tumors of Hep3B xenograft and hepatocellular carcinoma patient&#8208;derived primary cells xenograft (PDCX), and finally extend the average survival of PDCX mice to 68 days. Thus, our strategy is promising as a sorafenib/siRNA combination therapy and MESA can be a universal platform for fabricating complex nanosystems.

         <title>Formation Mechanism of Elemental Te Produced in Tellurite Glass Systems by Femtosecond Laser Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We discuss the formation of elemental trigonal Te on tellurite glass surfaces exposed to femtosecond laser pulses. Specifically, we investigate the underlying elemental crystallization phenomenon by altering laser parameters in common tellurite glass compositions under various ambient conditions. Elemental crystallization of t&#8208;Te by a single femtosecond laser pulse is unveiled by high&#8208;resolution imaging and analysis. The thermal diffusion model reveals the absence of lattice melting upon a single laser pulse, highlighting the complexity of the phase transformation. The typical cross&#8208;section displays three different crystallization morphology over its depth, in which the overall thickness increases with each subsequent pulse. The effect of various controlled atmospheres shows the suppressing nature of the elemental crystallization, whereas substrate temperature shows no significant impact on the nucleation of t&#8208;Te nanocrystals. This research gives new insight into the elemental crystallization of glass upon femtosecond laser irradiation and shows the potential to fabricate functional transparent electronic micro/nanodevices.

         <title>Controlling &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interactions of Highly Soluble Naphthalene Diimide Derivatives for Neutral pH Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic redox&#8208;active molecules are a promising platform for designing sustainable, cheap, and safe charge carriers for redox flow batteries. However, radical formation during the electron&#8208;transfer process causes severe side reactions and reduces cyclability. We mitigate this problem by using naphthalene diimide (NDI) molecules and regulating their &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. The long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;stacking of NDI molecules, which leads to precipitation, is disrupted by tethering four ammonium functionalities, and the solubility approaches 1.5&#160;M in water. The gentle &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions induce clustering and disassembling of the NDI molecules during the two&#8208;electron transfer processes. When the radical anion forms, the antiferromagnetic coupling develops tetramer and dimer and nullifies the radical character. In addition, short&#8208;range&#8208;order NDI clusters at 1&#160;M concentration are not precipitated but inhibit crossover. They are disassembled in the subsequent electron&#8208;transfer process, and the negatively charged NDI core strongly interacts with ammonium groups. These behaviors afford excellent RFB performance, demonstrating 98% capacity retention for 500 cycles at 25&#160;mA cm&#8208;2 and 99.5% Coulombic efficiency with 2&#160;M electron storage capacity.

         <title>Perspiring Soft Robotics Skin Constituted by Dynamic Polarity&#8208;Switching Porous Liquid Crystal Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic polarity switching liquid crystal polymer network membrane skin, which enables the exchange of apolar liquid with polar liquid, is developed. This is realized by incorporating a benzoic acid derivative into the original apolar polymer network. A number of applications based on this system from anti&#8208;icing, surface friction tuning, and drug release, to surface adhesion control are demonstrated.








Abstract
Secretion of functional fluids is essential for affecting surface properties in ecosystems. The existing polymer membranes that mimic human skin functions are limited to secreting, either apolar or polar, liquid. However, the development of membranes that grant exchange liquid with different polarities remains a grand challenge. This process is prohibited by the mismatch of the polarity between the carrier polymer and the loaded liquid. To conquer this limitation, an innovative strategy is reported to dynamically switch the polarity of the porous membrane, thereby empowering the exchange of apolar liquid with polar liquid and vice versa. This approach incorporates a benzoic acid derivative into the original apolar polymer network. The benzoic acid dimerizes and forms hydrogen bonds, which supports the molecular alignment, but can be broken into the ionic state when subjected to alkaline treatment, changing the polarity of themembrane. Consequently, the apolar liquid can be replaced with a more polar one. This polar liquid is ejected upon safe&#8208;dose UV illumination from the membrane. Reabsorption occurs on demand by illumination of visible light or when left in contact with the membrane, spontaneously in the dark. Based on this, the consumed membrane is replenished with the same or different exchanging liquid.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Assisted Compressed Flux Growth: A Universal and High&#8208;Yield Method for Dimension&#8208;Controlled Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;yield crystal growth method utilizing a polymer flux in a compressed growth space is invented to cast molecules or precursors into dimension&#8208;defined single crystals. This compressed flux growth is universally applicable to various materials and scalable to mass production, and the grown single crystals can be directly integrated into electronic devices.








Abstract
Single crystals possess the most perfect and stable morphology and represent the intrinsic and upper limits of performance when integrated into various application scenarios. However, for a large portion of the newly emerging low&#8208;dimensional and molecular materials, the mass production of crystals with a desirable shape is still challenging. Here, a universal and high&#8208;yield method to grow functional single crystals with controlled dimensions is provided that can be directly integrated into a device. By utilizing a polymeric flux in combination with a compressed growth space, numerous materials can be grown into size&#8208;controllable single crystalline flakes, with millions produced in one batch. This scalable growth method shows promise for the large&#8208;scale integration of micro&#8208;single&#8208;crystals as functional components, as exemplified by the construction of a 5 in. field&#8208;effect transistor array.

CO2 utilization and conversion are of great importance in alleviating the rising CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Here, a single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) is reported for electrochemical CO2 utilization in both aqueous and aprotic electrolytes. Specifically, atomically dispersed Mn&#8211;N4 sites are embedded in bowl&#8208;like mesoporous carbon particles with the functionalization of epoxy groups in the second coordination spheres. Theoretical calculations suggest that the epoxy groups near the Mn&#8211;N4 site adjust the electronic structure of the catalyst with reduced reaction energy barriers for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. The resultant Mn&#8208;single&#8208;atom carbon with N and O doped catalyst (MCs&#8208;(N,O)) exhibits extraordinary electrocatalytic performance with a high CO faradaic efficiency of 94.5%, a high CO current density of 13.7 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and a low overpotential of 0.44 V in the aqueous environment. Meanwhile, as a cathode catalyst for aprotic Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, the MCs&#8208;(N,O) with well&#8208;regulated active sites and unique mesoporous bowl&#8208;like morphology optimizes the nucleation behavior of discharge products. MCs&#8208;(N,O)&#8208;based batteries deliver a low overpotential and excellent cyclic stability of 1000&#160;h. The&#160;findings in this work provide a new avenue to design and fabricate SACs for various electrochemical CO2 utilization systems.

         <title>Nanocomposite Engineering of a High&#8208;Capacity Partially Ordered Cathode for Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multi&#8208;phase heterogeneous nature of ultrahigh&#8208;energy Mn&#8208;based partially disordered cathodes is revealed by combined experimental and computational studies. This fundamental understanding enables the novel nanocomposite design, which controls a phase fraction within a single particle. Consequently, T30 cathode via a nanocomposite engineering shows more reversible redox properties and a superior cycle retention, showing new insights into developing advanced Mn&#8208;based cathodes.








Abstract
Understanding the local cation order in the crystal structure and its correlation with electrochemical performances has advanced the development of high&#8208;energy Mn&#8208;rich cathode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries, notably Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered cathodes (LMR, e.g., Li1.2Ni0.13Mn0.54Co0.13O2) that are considered as nanocomposite layered materials with C2/m Li2MnO3&#8208;type medium&#8208;range order (MRO). Moreover, the Li&#8208;transport rate in high&#8208;capacity Mn&#8208;based disordered rock&#8208;salt (DRX) cathodes (e.g., Li1.2Mn0.4Ti0.4O2) is found to be influenced by the short&#8208;range order of cations, underlining the importance of engineering the local cation order in designing high&#8208;energy materials. Herein, the nanocomposite is revealed, with&#160;a&#160;heterogeneous nature (like MRO found in LMR) of ultrahigh&#8208;capacity partially ordered cathodes (e.g., Li1.68Mn1.6O3.7F0.3) made of distinct domains of spinel&#8208;, DRX&#8208; and layered&#8208;like phases, contrary to conventional single&#8208;phase DRX cathodes. This multi&#8208;scale understanding of ordering informs engineering the nanocomposite material via Ti doping, altering the intra&#8208;particle characteristics to increase the content of the rock&#8208;salt phase and heterogeneity within a particle. This strategy markedly improves the reversibility of both Mn&#8208; and O&#8208;redox processes to enhance the cycling stability of the partially ordered DRX cathodes (nearly &#8776;30% improvement of capacity retention). This work sheds light on the importance of nanocomposite engineering to develop ultrahigh&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost Li&#8208;ion cathode materials.

         <title>Pd&#8211;PdO Nanodomains on Amorphous Ru Metallene Oxide for High&#8208;Performance Multifunctional Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct heterostructure engineering on an ultrathin 2D platform of Pd&#8211;PdO nanodomains confined on amorphous RuO2 yields excellent catalytic activity toward pH&#8208;universal HER, alkaline oxygen electrochemistry, and overall water splitting. The enhanced multifunctional performance is attributed to the rational integration of novel nanostructures, including atomically thin morphology, coexisting amorphous and defect&#8208;rich crystalline phases, and multicomponent heterostructural features.








Abstract
Developing highly efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts is crucial for future sustainable energy &#160;pursuits, but remains a great challenge. Herein, a facile synthetic strategy is used to confine atomically thin Pd&#8211;PdO nanodomains to amorphous Ru metallene oxide (RuO2). The as&#8208;synthesized electrocatalyst (Pd2RuOx&#8208;0.5&#160;h) exhibits excellent catalytic activity toward the pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction (&#951;10&#160;=&#160;14&#160;mV in 1&#160;m KOH, &#951;10&#160;=&#160;12&#160;mV in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4, and &#951;10&#160;=&#160;22&#160;mV in 1&#160;m PBS), alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (&#951;10&#160;=&#160;225&#160;mV), and overall water splitting (E10&#160;=&#160;1.49&#160;V) with high mass activity and operational stability. Further reduction endows the material (Pd2RuOx&#8208;2&#160;h) with a promising alkaline oxygen reduction activity, evidenced by high halfway potential, four&#8208;electron selectivity, and excellent poison tolerance. The enhanced catalytic activity is attributed to the rational integration of favorable nanostructures, including 1) the atomically thin nanosheet morphology, 2) the coexisting amorphous and defective crystalline phases, and 3) the multi&#8208;component heterostructural features. These structural factors effectively regulate the material's electronic configuration and the adsorption of intermediates at the active sites for favorable reaction energetics.

Abstract
Personal thermal management can effectively manage the skin microenvironment, improve human comfort, and reduce energy consumption. In personal thermal&#8208;management technology, owing to the high latent heat of water evaporation in wet&#8208;response textiles, heat&#8208; and moisture&#8208;transfer coexist and interact with each other. In the last few years, with rapid advances in materials science and innovative polymers, humidity&#8208;sensitive textiles have been developed for personal thermal management. However, a large gap exists between the conceptual laboratory&#8208;scale design and actual textile. This paper reviews moisture&#8208;responsive textiles based on flap opening and closing, those based on yarn/fiber deformation, and sweat&#8208;evaporation regulation based on textile design for personal thermoregulation, and discusses the corresponding mechanisms and research progress. Finally, the existing engineering and scientific limitations and future developments have been discussed to resolve the existing issues and accelerate the practical application of moisture&#8208;responsive textiles and related technologies.

         <title>Inter&#8208;Metal Interaction with a Threshold Effect in NiCu Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigating the inter&#8208;metal site distance effect of dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) can not only promote the full potential of DACs, but also guide the design of advanced atomically&#160;dispersed catalysts. In this work a peripherally distributed NiCu DAC is employed as a case study to investigate the distance (d)&#8208;dependent inter&#8208;metal interaction, and a newly&#160;proposed macro&#8208;descriptor is provided as the guidance for future designing DACs.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have become an emerging platform to provide more flexible active sites for electrocatalytic reactions with multi&#8208;electron/proton transfer, such as the CO2&#160;reduction reaction (CRR). However, the introduction of asymmetric dual&#8208;atom sites causes complexity in structure, leaving an incomprehensive understanding of the inter&#8208;metal interaction and catalytic mechanism. Taking NiCu DACs as an example, herein, a more rational structural model is proposed, and the distance&#8208;dependent inter&#8208;metal interaction is investigated by combining theoretical simulations and experiments, including density functional theory computation, aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy, synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure, and Monte Carlo experiments. A distance threshold around 5.3&#160;&#197; between adjacent Ni&#63743;N4&#160;and Cu&#63743;N4&#160;moieties is revealed to trigger effective electronic regulation and boost CRR performance on both selectivity and activity. A universal macro&#8208;descriptor rigorously correlating the inter&#8208;metal distance and intrinsic material features (e.g., metal loading and thickness) is established to guide the rational design and synthesis of advanced DACs. This study highlights the significance of identifying the inter&#8208;metal interaction in DACs, and helps bridge the gap between theoretical study and experimental synthesis of atomically dispersed catalysts with highly correlated active sites.

     alt="Inter-Metal Interaction with a Threshold Effect in NiCu Dual-Atom Catalysts for CO2 Electroreduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigating the inter-metal site distance effect of dual-atom catalysts (DACs) can not only promote the full potential of DACs, but also guide the design of advanced atomically&#160;dispersed catalysts. In this work a peripherally distributed NiCu DAC is employed as a case study to investigate the distance (&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;)-dependent inter-metal interaction, and a newly&#160;proposed macro-descriptor is provided as the guidance for future designing DACs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dual-atom catalysts (DACs) have become an emerging platform to provide more flexible active sites for electrocatalytic reactions with multi-electron/proton transfer, such as the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;reduction reaction (CRR). However, the introduction of asymmetric dual-atom sites causes complexity in structure, leaving an incomprehensive understanding of the inter-metal interaction and catalytic mechanism. Taking NiCu DACs as an example, herein, a more rational structural model is proposed, and the distance-dependent inter-metal interaction is investigated by combining theoretical simulations and experiments, including density functional theory computation, aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, synchrotron-based X-ray absorption fine structure, and Monte Carlo experiments. A distance threshold around 5.3&#160;&#197; between adjacent Ni&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;and Cu&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;moieties is revealed to trigger effective electronic regulation and boost CRR performance on both selectivity and activity. A universal macro-descriptor rigorously correlating the inter-metal distance and intrinsic material features (e.g., metal loading and thickness) is established to guide the rational design and synthesis of advanced DACs. This study highlights the significance of identifying the inter-metal interaction in DACs, and helps bridge the gap between theoretical study and experimental synthesis of atomically dispersed catalysts with highly correlated active sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient, Color&#8208;Stable, and Long&#8208;Lived White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Utilizing Phosphorescent Molecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Development of single&#8208;stack hybrid white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (WOLEDs) uses amber&#8208;colored aggregate emission and blue fluorescence emission to achieve high efficiencies, long operational lifetimes, and excellent color stabilities under various driving conditions. As far as it is known, this is the most stable single&#8208;stack white OLED device among all reported white OLEDs on the public domain.








Abstract
Highly efficient and stable single&#8208;stack hybrid white organic light&#8208;emitting diode (WOLED) devices are developed using two emissive layers: one with amber&#8208;colored phosphorescent molecular&#8208;aggregate emission from the Pd(II) complex, Pd(II) 7&#8208;(3&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;&#954;N)phenoxy&#8208;&#954;C)(benzo&#8208;&#954;C)([c]benzo[4,5]imidazo&#8208;&#954;N)[1,2&#8208;a][1,5]naphthyridine, Pd3O8&#8208;Py5, and the other with blue fluorescence emission. An optimized device structure achieves high color stability under various current densities, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 45.5%, a power efficiency of 97.4 Lm W&#8722;1, and an estimated LT95 (operational time to 95% of the initial luminance) of 50 744 h at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>Blocking Spatiotemporal Crosstalk between Subcellular Organelles for Enhancing Anticancer Therapy with Nanointercepter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The spatiotemporal characterization of signaling crosstalk between subcellular organelles is crucial for the therapeutic effect of malignant tumors. Blocking interactive crosstalk in this fashion is significant but challenging. Herein, we report a communication interception strategy, which blocks spatiotemporal crosstalk between subcellular organelles for cancer therapy with underlying molecular mechanisms. Briefly, amorphous&#8208;core@crystalline&#8208;shell Fe@Fe3O4 nanoparticles (ACFeNPs) were fabricated to specifically block the crosstalk between lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by hydroxyl radicals generated along with their trajectory through heterogeneous Fenton reaction. ACFeNPs initially entered lysosomes and triggered autophagy, then continuous lysosomal damage blocked the generation of functional autolysosomes which mediated ER&#8208;lysosome crosstalk, thus the autophagy was paralyzed. Thereafter, released ACFeNPs from lysosomes induced ER stress. Without the alleviation by autophagy, ER stress&#8208;associated apoptotic pathway was fully activated, resulting in remarkable therapeutic effect. This strategy provides a wide venue for nanomedicine to exert biological advantages and confers new perspective for the design of novel anticancer drugs.

         <title>Fluorinated covalent organic framework with accelerated oxygen transfer nano&#8208;channels for high performance zinc&#8208;air batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The establishment of abundant three&#8208;phase interfaces with accelerated mass transfer in air cathodes is highly desirable for the development of high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;cycling rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) exhibits tailored nano&#8208;pore structures, facilitating the rational tuning of their specific properties. Here, by finely tuning the fluoridated nanopores of COF, we unprecedentedly designed and synthesized a novel high&#8208;performance air cathode for rechargeable ZABs. COF nanosheets were decorated with fluoridated alkyl chains, which shows high affinity to O2, in its nanopores (fluorinated COF). The fluorinated COF nanosheets are stacked into well&#8208;defined O2 transport channels, which were then assembled into aerophilic &#8220;nano&#8208;islands&#8221; on the hydrophilic FeNi layered&#8208;double&#8208;hydroxide (FeNi LDH) electro&#8208;catalyst surface. Therefore, the mass transport &#8220;highway&#8221; for O2 and water are segregated on the nanoscale, which significantly enlarges the area of three&#8208;phase boundaries and greatly promotes the mass&#8208;transfer therein. ZABs based on the COF modified air cathode deliver a small charge/discharge voltage gap (0.64&#160;V at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), a peak power density (118&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), and a stable cyclability, far exceeding the conventional FeNi LDH air cathode. This work provides a feasible approach for the design of the air cathodes for high performance ZABs, and will expand the new application of COF.

         <title>Topological Metal MoP Nanowire for Interconnect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The increasing resistance of Cu interconnects for decreasing dimensions is a major challenge in continued downscaling of integrated circuits beyond the 7&#8208;nm technology node as it leads to unacceptable signal delays and power consumption in computing. The resistivity of Cu increases due to electron scattering at surfaces and grain boundaries of the interconnects at the nanoscale. Topological semimetals, owing to their topologically protected surface states and suppressed electron backscattering, are promising material candidates to potentially replace current Cu interconnects as low&#8208;resistance interconnects. Here, we report the unprecedented resistivity scaling of topological metal MoP nanowires and show that the resistivity values are superior to those of nanoscale Cu interconnects below 500 nm2 cross&#8208;section areas. The calculated cohesive energy of MoP suggests better stability against electromigration, enabling a barrier&#8208;free design of MoP interconnects. MoP nanowires are more resistant to surface oxidation than the 20&#8208;nm thick Cu reference. The thermal conductivity of MoP is comparable to those of Ru and Co, which are considered prominent barrier&#8208;free interconnects. Most importantly, we demonstrate that the dimensional scaling of the MoP nanowires, in terms of line resistance versus total cross&#8208;sectional area, is competitive to those of effective Cu with barrier/liner and barrier&#8208;less Ru interconnects, suggesting MoP is an attractive alternative for the current scaling challenge of Cu interconnects.

         <title>DNA Nanocluster Combined with one&#8208;shot Radiotherapy Augment Cancer Immunotherapy Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Immunotherapy show immense promise for improving cancer treatment. Combining immunotherapy with radiotherapy provides conspicuous advantage due to its enhanced abscopal effect. However, established immune tolerance mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment can hamper the generation of sufficient abscopal effect. Herein, we designed a type of DNA nanocluster (DNAnc) that was self&#8208;assembled by CpG ODNs loaded Y&#8208;shaped double stranded DNA vector based on the unique complementary base&#8208;pairing rules. The unique structure of DNAnc made it load more than about 8125.5 &#177; 822.5 copies of CpG ODNs within one single nanostructure, which effectively increased resistance to nuclease degradation and elevated the efficiency of repolarizing macrophages to a M1&#8208;like phenotype. Mechanistic studies revealed that more DNAnc were endocytosed by macrophages at the cancer tissue and repolarize macrophages to elicit a robust abscopal effect with the accumulation of macrophages induced by radiotherapy, generating potent, long&#8208;term and durable antitumor immunity for the inhibition of tumor metastasis and the prevention of tumour recurrence, which provides a novel strategy to boost cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract
Manual intervention in the self&#8208;organization of soft matter to obtain a desired superstructure is a complex but significant project. Specifically, optical components made fully or partially from reconfigurable and stimuli&#8208;responsive soft materials, referred to as soft photonics, are poised to form versatile platforms in various areas; however, a limited scale, narrow spectral adaptability, and poor stability are still formidable challenges. Herein, we developed a facile way to program the optical jigsaw puzzle of nematic liquid crystals via pixelated holographic surface reliefs, leading to an era of manufacturing for programmable soft materials with tailored functions. Multiscale jigsaw puzzles are established and endowed with unprecedented stability and durability, further sketching a prospective framework towards customized adaptive photonic architectures. This work demonstrates a reliable and efficient approach for directly assembling soft matter, unlocking the long&#8208;sought full potential of stimuli&#8208;responsive soft systems and providing opportunities to inspire the next generation of soft photonics and relevant areas.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable FA&#8208;Based Quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells by the Incorporation of &#946;&#8208;Fluorophenylethanamine Cations</title>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (2D RP) perovskite, with attractive environmental and structural stability, has shown great application in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the relatively inferior photovoltaic efficiencies of 2D PSCs limit their further application. To address this issue, &#946;&#8208;&#8203;fluorophenylethanamine (&#946;&#8208;&#8203;FPEA) as a novel spacer cation is designed and employed to develop stable and efficient quasi&#8208;2D RP PSCs. The strong dipole moment of the &#946;&#8208;&#8203;FPEA enhances the interactions between the cations and [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedra, improving the charge dissociation of quasi&#8208;2D RP perovskite. Additionally, the introduction of the &#946;&#8208;&#8203;FPEA cation optimizes the energy level alignment, improves the crystallinity, stabilizes both the mixed phase and &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 phase of the quasi&#8208;2D RP perovskite film, prolongs the carrier diffusion length, increases the carrier lifetime and decreases the trap density. By incorporating the &#946;&#8208;&#8203;FPEA, the quasi&#8208;2D RP PSCs exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.77% (versus phenylethylammonium (PEA) based quasi&#8208;2D RP PSCs of 12.81%) on PEDOT:PSS substrate and achieve a champion PCE of 19.11% on the PTAA substrate. It's worth noting that the &#946;&#8208;&#8203;FPEA&#8208;based unencapsulated quasi&#8208;2D RP PSCs exhibit significant improvements in both thermal and moisture stability. These findings provide an effective strategy for developing novel spacer cations for high&#8208;performance 2D RP PSCs.

         <title>Dynamic Reconstitution Between Copper Single atoms and Clusters for Electrocatalytic Urea synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrocatalytic C&#8208;N coupling between carbon dioxide and nitrate emerges to meet comprehensive demands of carbon footprint closing, valorisation of waste and sustainable manufacture of urea. However, the identification of catalytic active sites and the design of efficient electrocatalysts remain a challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis of urea catalysed by copper single atoms decorated on a CeO2 support (denoted Cu1&#8208;CeO2). The catalyst exhibits an average urea yield rate of 52.84&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 gcat.&#8722;1 at &#8208;1.6&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectra demonstrate the reconstitution of copper single atoms (Cu1) to clusters (Cu4) during electrolysis. These electrochemically reconstituted Cu4 clusters are real active sites for electrocatalytic urea synthesis. Favourable C&#8208;N coupling reactions and urea formation on Cu4 are validated using operando synchrotron&#8208;radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Dynamic and reversible transformations of clusters to single&#8208;atom configurations occur when the applied potential is switched to an open&#8208;circuit potential, endowing catalyst with superior structural and electrochemical stabilities.

         <title>Piezoelectric Actuation Mechanism Involving Extrinsic Nanodomain Dynamics in Lead&#8208;Free Piezoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The piezoelectric actuation mechanism in pseudocubic structures is clarified by the calculation of extrinsic/intrinsic contribution. Although only intrinsic contributes to the piezoelectricity, it does not match the piezoelectricity of BiFeO3&#8211;BaTiO3. It is clarified that extrinsic effect on nanodomain rearrangements is revealed in BiFeO3&#8211;BaTiO3. Extrinsic effect on nanodomain rearrangement is involved in the actuation mechanism of piezoelectricity.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials play a key role in applications, while there are physically open questions. The physical origin of piezoelectricity is understood as the sum of contributions from intrinsic effects on lattice dynamics and those from extrinsic effects on ferroic&#8208;domain dynamics, but there is an incomplete understanding that all but intrinsic effects are classified as extrinsic effects. Therefore, the accurate classification of extrinsic effects is important for understanding&#160;the physical origin of piezoelectricity. In this work, high&#8208;energy synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray diffraction is utilized to measure the response of BiFeO3&#8722;BaTiO3 piezoelectrics and the intrinsic/extrinsic contribution to electric fields. It is found from crystal structure and intrinsic/extrinsic contribution, using the analysis involving structure refinement with various structural model and micromechanics&#8208;based calculations, that Bi3+&#8208;ion disordering is important for realization of piezoelectricity and nanodomains. Here, an extrinsic effect on the rearrangement of nanodomains is suggested. The nanodomains, which are formed by the locally distorted structure around the A&#8208;site by Bi&#8208;ion disordering, can significantly deform the material in the BiFeO3&#8722;BaTiO3 system, which contributes to the piezoelectric actuation mechanism apart from the extrinsic effect on ferroic&#8208;domain dynamics. Bi&#8208;ion disordering plays an important role in realizing piezoelectricity and nanodomains and can provide essential material design clues to develop next&#8208;generation Bi&#8208;based lead&#8208;free piezoelectric ceramics.

         <title>Dressing Bacteria With a Hybrid Immunoactive Nanosurface to Elicit Dual Anticancer and Antiviral Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Approaches capable of simultaneously treating cancer and protecting susceptible patients from lethal infections, such as coronavirus disease 2019, are highly desirable but prove to be difficult. Here, dressing bacteria with a combination of a checkpoint blocking antibody and a virus&#8208;specific antigen is reported to elicit dual anticancer and antiviral immunity.








Abstract
Approaches capable of simultaneously treating cancer and protecting susceptible patients from lethal infections such as coronavirus disease 2019, are highly desirable but prove to be difficult. Here, dressing bacteria with a hybrid immunoactive nanosurface is reported to elicit dual anticancer and antiviral immunity. A combination of a checkpoint blocking antibody and a virus&#8208;specific antigen is covalently conjugated to polydopamine nanoparticles, which can be anchored onto bacterial surface, by a one&#8208;step in situ polymerization of dopamine under a cell&#8208;friendly condition. By virtue of the ability to colonize and penetrate deep tumor tissue, dressed bacteria enable sustained release and expanded exposure of carried immunoactivators to stimulate immune cells. In addition to a carrier role, bacteria are able to further provoke innate immunity due to the native immunogenicity of the pathogen&#8208;associated molecular patterns. Immunization with dressed bacteria promotes the maturation, and activation of antigen&#8208;presenting cells, which induces robust humoral and cellular immune responses in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. As evidenced by efficient production of viral&#8208;antigen&#8208;specific immunoglobulin G antibody in serum and significantly suppressed tumor growth in different models, dressing bacteria with a hybrid immunoactive nanosurface paves an avenue to prepare next&#8208;generation therapeutics for synergistic treatment and prevention.

         <title>Stretchable Electrodes Based on Over&#8208;Layered Liquid Metal Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabrication of thin films with liquid metal is proposed using thermal evaporation. The oxide film on the liquid metal surface forms a unique structure as indium/oxide/gallium (InOG). The oxide film helps form conductivity and exhibits negative piezoresistivity by rupturing. InOG electrode exhibits controllable electrical properties and mechanical stability. InOG overcomes the limitations of conventional applications through unique properties.








Abstract
Liquid metals are attractive materials for stretchable electronics owing to their high electrical conductivity and near&#8208;zero Young's modulus. However, the high surface tension of liquid metals makes it difficult to form films. A novel stretchable film is proposed based on an over&#8208;layered liquid&#8208;metal network. An intentionally oxidized interfacial layer helps to construct uninterrupted indium and gallium nanoclusters and produces additional electrical pathways between the two metal networks under mechanical deformation. The films exhibit gigantic negative piezoresistivity (G&#8208;NPR), which decreased the resistance up to 85% during the first 50% stretching. This G&#8208;NPR property is due to the rupture of the metal oxides, which allows the formation of liquid eutectic gallium&#8208;indium (EGaIn) and the connection of the over&#8208;layered networks to build new electrical paths. The electrodes exhibiting G&#8208;NPR are complementarily combined with conventional electrodes to amplify their performance or achieve some unique operations.

         <title>Mitochondrial&#8208;Targeted Delivery of Polyphenol&#8208;Mediated Antioxidases Complexes against Pyroptosis and Inflammatory Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyphenols such as tannic acid (TA) are able to mediate the targeting of polyphenol/antioxidases complexes to mitochondria, stemming from the strong binding of TA to mitochondrial outer membrane proteins. Superoxide dismutase, catalase, and TA are assembled into complexes for efficiently scavenging excess mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and reversing mitochondrial depolarization, thereby inhibiting inflammasome&#8208;mediated pyroptosis and alleviate pyroptosis&#8208;related hepatitis.








Abstract
Excess accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) is a key target for inhibiting pyroptosis&#8208;induced inflammation and tissue damage. However, targeted delivery of drugs to mitochondria and efficient clearance of mtROS remain challenging. In current study, it is discovered that polyphenols such as tannic acid (TA) can mediate the targeting of polyphenol/antioxidases complexes to mitochondria. This affinity does not depend on mitochondrial membrane potential but stems from the strong binding of TA to mitochondrial outer membrane proteins. Taking advantage of the feasibility of self&#8208;assembly between TA and proteins, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and TA are assembled into complexes (referred to as TSC) for efficient enzymatic activity maintenance. In vitro fluorescence confocal imaging shows that TSC not only promoted the uptake of biological enzymes in hepatocytes but also highly overlapped with mitochondria after lysosomal escape. The results from an in vitro model of hepatocyte oxidative stress demonstrate that TSC efficiently scavenges excess mtROS and reverses mitochondrial depolarization, thereby inhibiting inflammasome&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. More interestingly, TSC maintain superior efficacy compared with the clinical gold standard drug N&#8208;acetylcysteine in both acetaminophen&#8208; and D&#8208;galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide&#8208;induced pyroptosis&#8208;related hepatitis mouse models. In conclusion, this study opens a new paradigm for targeting mitochondrial oxidative stress to inhibit pyroptosis and treat inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Perspectives of 2D MXene Tribology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The past two years have witnessed increased experimental and theoretical efforts toward studying MXenes&#8217; mechanical and tribological properties when used as lubricant additives, reinforcement phases in composites, or solid lubricant coatings.&#160;The most promising results in MXene tribology are summarized, future important problems to be pursued further are outlined, and methodological recommendations are provided.








Abstract
The large and rapidly growing family of 2D early transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides (MXenes) raises significant interest in the materials science and chemistry of materials communities. Discovered a little more than a decade ago, MXenes have already demonstrated outstanding potential in various applications ranging from energy storage to biology and medicine. The past two years have witnessed increased experimental and theoretical efforts toward studying MXenes&#8217; mechanical and tribological properties when used as lubricant additives, reinforcement phases in composites, or solid lubricant coatings. Although research on the understanding of the friction and wear performance of MXenes under dry and lubricated conditions is still in its early stages, it has experienced rapid growth due to the excellent mechanical properties and chemical reactivities offered by MXenes that make them adaptable to being combined with other materials, thus boosting their tribological performance. In this perspective, the most promising results in the area of MXene tribology are summarized, future important problems to be pursued further are outlined, and methodological recommendations&#160;that could be useful for experts as well as newcomers to MXenes research, in particular, to the emerging area of MXene tribology, are provided.

         <title>Chemical Tuning Meets 2D Molecular Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical tuning including lithiation control and solvent coordination can significantly modify magnetic interaction in molecule&#8208;based magnets for high&#8208;temperature magnetic order and large coercivity. Through those technical routes and processing, 2D molecule&#8208;based magnets with an applicable magnetic performance of ferrites are demonstrated. The considerable energy product evidences its worth for obtaining practical molecule&#8208;based magnets.








Abstract
2D magnets provoke a surge of interest in large anisotropy in reduced dimensions and are promising for next&#8208;generation information technology where dynamic magnetic tuning is essential. Until recently, the crucial metal&#8208;organic magnet Cr(pyz)2&#183;xLiCl&#183;yTHF with considerable high coercivity and high&#8208;temperature magnetic order opens up a new platform to control magnetism in metal&#8208;organic materials at room temperature. Here, an in&#8211;situ chemical tuning route is reported to realize the controllable transformation of low&#8208;temperature magnetic order into room&#8208;temperature hard magnetism in Cr(pyz)2&#183;xLiCl&#183;yTHF. The chemical tuning via electrochemical lithiation and solvation/desolvation exhibits continuously variable magnetic features from cryogenic magnetism to the room&#8208;temperature optimum performance of coercivity (Hc) of 8500&#160;Oe and energy product of 0.6 MGOe. Such chemically flexible tunability of room&#8208;temperature magnetism is ascribed to the different degrees of lithiation and solvation that modify the stoichiometry and Cr&#8208;pyrazine coordination framework. Furthermore, the additively manufactured hybrid magnets show air stability and electromagnetic induction, providing potential applications. The findings here suggest chemical tuning as a universal approach to control the anisotropy and magnetism of 2D hybrid magnets at room temperature, promising for data storage, magnetic refrigeration, and spintronics.

         <title>Manipulating Charge&#8208;Transfer Kinetics of Lithium&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathodes in Halide All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) cathode theoretically enables all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with high energy density owing to its high capacity. However, the low electronic conductivity and highly reactive lattice oxygen impede its application. By introducing conductive additives in electrodes and modifying the surface chemistry of LLO, high&#8208;efficiency electronic networks and stable LLO/electrolyte interfaces can be obtained, thus boosting the charge&#8208;transfer kinetics.








Abstract
Employing lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) as the cathode of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) is highly desired for realizing high energy density. However, the poor kinetics of LLO, caused by its low electronic conductivity and significant oxygen&#8208;redox&#8208;induced structural degradation, has impeded its application in ASSBs. Here, the charge transfer kinetics of LLO is enhanced by constructing high&#8208;efficiency electron transport networks within solid&#8208;state electrodes, which considerably minimizes electron transfer resistance. In addition, an infusion&#8208;plus&#8208;coating strategy is introduced to stabilize the lattice oxygen of LLO, successfully suppressing the interfacial oxidation of solid electrolyte (Li3InCl6) and structural degradation of LLO. As a result, LLO&#8208;based ASSBs exhibit a high discharge capacity of 230.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C and ultra&#8208;long cycle stability over 400 cycles. This work provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the kinetics of LLO in solid&#8208;state electrodes, and affords a practically feasible strategy to obtain high&#8208;energy&#8208;density ASSBs.

Here, the charge transfer kinetics of LLO is enhanced by constructing high-efficiency electron transport networks within solid-state electrodes, which considerably minimizes electron transfer resistance. In addition, an infusion-plus-coating strategy is introduced to stabilize the lattice oxygen of LLO, successfully suppressing the interfacial oxidation of solid electrolyte (Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;InCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and structural degradation of LLO. As a result, LLO-based ASSBs exhibit a high discharge capacity of 230.7 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1 C and ultra-long cycle stability over 400 cycles. This work provides an in-depth understanding of the kinetics of LLO in solid-state electrodes, and affords a practically feasible strategy to obtain high-energy-density ASSBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Visualization of Magnetic Correlations in Frustrated Spinel ZnFe2O4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single crystal diffuse neutron scattering data on the frustrated magnet ZnFe2O4 are used to calculate the 3D magnetic difference pair distribution function, which provide a model&#8208;free reconstruction of the local magnetic correlations. Analysis of the correlation intensities gives insight into the possible underlying exchange mechanisms and a preferred spin&#8208;cluster model.








Abstract
Magnetic materials with the spinel structure (A2+B3+2O4) form the core of numerous magnetic devices, and ZnFe2O4 constitutes a peculiar example where the nature of the magnetism is still unresolved. Susceptibility measurements revealed a cusp around Tc&#160;= 13 K resembling an antiferromagnetic transition, despite the positive Curie&#8211;Weiss temperature determined to be &#920;CW&#160;= 102.8(1) K. Bifurcation of field&#8208;cooled and zero&#8208;field&#8208;cooled data below Tc in conjunction with a frequency dependence of the peak position and a non&#8208;zero imaginary component below Tc shows it is in fact associated with a spin&#8208;glass transition. Highly structured magnetic diffuse neutron scattering from single crystals develops between 50&#160;K and 25&#160;K revealing the presence of magnetic disorder which is correlated in nature. Here, the 3D&#8208;m&#916;PDF method is used to visualize the local magnetic ordering preferences, and ferromagnetic nearest&#8208;neighbor and antiferromagnetic third nearest&#8208;neighbor correlations are shown to be dominant. Their temperature dependence is extraordinary with some flipping in sign and a strongly varying correlation length. The correlations can be explained by orbital interaction mechanisms for the magnetic pathways and a preferred spin cluster. This study demonstrates the power of the 3D&#8208;m&#916;PDF method in visualizing complex quantum phenomena thereby providing a way to obtain an atomic&#8208;scale understanding of magnetic frustration.

         <title>Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells via Improved Sequential Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) via the two&#8208;step sequential deposition show advantages of easy fabrication and decent performance repeatability. Whereas, it is still challenging to implement this technique in the inverted PSCs. Here, an improved sequential two&#8208;step method for inverted PSCs is demonstrated by a binary modulation system and a champion efficiency of 23.4% is realized with remarkable device stability.








Abstract
Inverted&#8208;structure metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attractive advantages like low&#8208;temperature processability and outstanding device stability. The two&#8208;step sequential deposition method shows the benefits of easy fabrication and decent performance repeatability. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to achieve high&#8208;performance inverted PSCs with similar or equal power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) compared to the regular&#8208;structure counterparts via this deposition method. Here, an improved two&#8208;step sequential deposition technique is demonstrated via treating the bottom organic hole&#8208;selective layer with the binary modulation system composed of a polyelectrolyte and an ammonium salt. Such improved sequential deposition method leads to the spontaneous refinement of up and buried interfaces for the perovskite films, contributing to high film quality with significantly reduced defect density and better charge transportation. As a result, the optimized PSCs show a large enhancement in the open&#8208;circuit voltage by 100&#160;mV and a dramatic lift in the PCE from 18.1% to 23.4%, delivering the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performances for inverted PSCs. Moreover, good operational and thermal stability is achieved upon the improved inverted PSCs. This innovative strategy helps gain a deeper insight into the perovskite crystal growth and defect modulation in the inverted PSCs based on the two&#8208;step sequential deposition method.

         <title>A MgFe&#8208;LDH Nanosheet&#8208;Incorporated Smart Thermo&#8208;Responsive Hydrogel with Controllable Growth Factor Releasing Capability for Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart injectable thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogel composed of bone morphogenetic protein 2&#8208;functionalized MgFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide&#160;nanosheets and platelet&#8208;derived growth factor&#8208;BB&#8208;loaded chitosan/silk fibroin hydrogel is designed and constructed to achieve the sequential release of dual growth factors and sustained release of bioactive Mg2+/Fe3+ ions for highly efficient bone regeneration.








Abstract
Although growth factor (GF)&#8208;loaded hydrogels have been explored as promising materials in repairing bone defects, it still remains challenging to construct smart hydrogels with excellent gelation/mechanical properties as well as controllable GF releasing capability. Herein, the incorporation of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP&#8208;2)&#8208;functionalized MgFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets into chitosan/silk fibroin (CS) hydrogels loaded with platelet&#8208;derived growth factor&#8208;BB (PDGF&#8208;BB) to construct a smart injectable thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogel (denoted as CSP&#8208;LB), which can achieve a burst release of PDGF&#8208;BB and a sustained release of BMP&#8208;2, for highly efficient bone regeneration is reported. The incorporation of MgFe&#8208;LDH in CS hydrogel not only shortens the gelation time and decreases sol&#8211;gel transition temperature, but also enhances the mechanical property of the hydrogel. Because of the sequential release of dual&#8208;GFs and sustained release of bioactive Mg2+/Fe3+ ions, the in vitro experiments prove that the CSP&#8208;LB hydrogel exhibits excellent angiogenic and osteogenic properties compared with the CS hydrogel. In vivo experiments further prove that the CSP&#8208;LB hydrogel can significantly enhance bone regeneration with higher bone volume and mineral density than that of the CS hydrogel. This smart thermo&#8208;sensitive CSP&#8208;LB hydrogel possesses excellent gelation capability and angiogenic and osteogenic properties, thus providing a promising minimally invasive solution for bone defect treatment.

         <title>Ultrahigh Strain&#8208;Insensitive Integrated Hybrid Electronics Using Highly Stretchable Bilayer Liquid Metal Based Conductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;high strain&#8208;insensitive hybrid integrated electronics constructed by a self&#8208;formed amphiphilic bilayer highly stretchable conductor is reported based on liquid metal composite and peeling strategy. The amphiphilic bilayer conductor can self&#8208;solder its interface with rigid electronics, anchor well with substrates, and shows ultrahigh conductivity, stretchability, self&#8208;healability, and interconnect functions. The unique materials hold the potential for strain&#8208;resilient integrated bioelectronics and wearables.








Abstract
Human&#8208;interfaced electronic systems require strain&#8208;resilient circuits. However, present integrated stretchable electronics easily suffer from electrical deterioration and face challenges in forming robust multilayered soft&#8208;rigid hybrid configurations. Here, a bilayer liquid&#8208;solid conductor (b&#8208;LSC) with amphiphilic properties is introduced to reliably interface with both rigid electronics and elastomeric substrates. The top liquid metal can self&#8208;solder its interface with rigid electronics at a resistance 30% lower than the traditional tin&#8208;soldered rigid interface. The bottom polar composite comprising liquid metal particles and polymers can not only reliably interface with elastomers but also help the b&#8208;LSC heal after breakage. The b&#8208;LSC can be scalably fabricated by printing and subsequent peeling strategies, showing ultra&#8208;high strain&#8208;insensitive conductivity (maximum 22&#160;532&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1), extreme stretchability (2260%), and negligible resistance change under ultra&#8208;high strain (0.34 times increase under 1000% strain). It can act as stretchable vertical interconnect access for connecting multilayered layouts and can be scalably and universally fabricated on various substrates with a resolution of &#8776;200&#160;&#181;m. It is demonstrated that it can construct stretchable sensor arrays, multi&#8208;layered stretchable displays, highly integrated haptic user&#8208;interactive optoelectric E&#8208;skins, visualized heaters, robot touch sensing systems, and wireless powering for wearable electronics.

The b-LSC can be scalably fabricated by printing and subsequent peeling strategies, showing ultra-high strain-insensitive conductivity (maximum 22&#160;532&#160;S&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), extreme stretchability (2260%), and negligible resistance change under ultra-high strain (0.34 times increase under 1000% strain). It can act as stretchable vertical interconnect access for connecting multilayered layouts and can be scalably and universally fabricated on various substrates with a resolution of &#8776;200&#160;&#181;m. It is demonstrated that it can construct stretchable sensor arrays, multi-layered stretchable displays, highly integrated haptic user-interactive optoelectric E-skins, visualized heaters, robot touch sensing systems, and wireless powering for wearable electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Electronics for Prognostic Monitoring of Methylated Circulating Tumor DNAs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable device with self&#8208;healing electronics is developed for highly sensitive and cost&#8208;effective analysis of methylated ctDNAs from transdermal extracted interstitial fluid (ISF), which is demonstrated as a skin patch device for monitoring the disease indicative biomarker. Especially, the device is featured with a flexible construction and remains electrically functional significant structural defects are induced by bending or distortion from everyday usage.








Abstract
Methylated circulating DNAs (ctDNAs) have recently been reported as a promising biomarker for early cancer diagnostics, but limited tools are currently available for continuous and dynamic profiling of ctDNAs and their methylation levels, especially when such assays need to be conducted in point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) scenarios. Here, a self&#8208;healing bioelectronic patch (iMethy) is developed that combines transdermal interstitial fluid (ISF) extraction and field effect transistor&#8208;based (FET&#8208;based) biosensing for dynamic monitoring of methylated ctDNAs as a prognostic approach for cancer risk management. The projection micro&#8208;stereolithography&#8208;based 3D patterning of an Eutectic Gallium&#8208;Indium (EGaIn) circuit with an unprecedented 10&#160;&#181;m resolution enables the construction of self&#8208;healing EGaIn microfluidic circuits that remain conductive under 100% strain and self&#8208;healing under severe destruction. In combination with continuous transdermal ISF sampling of methylated ctDNAs, iMethy can detect ctDNAs as low as 10&#8722;16&#160;m in cellular models and is capable of phenotypic analysis of tumor growth in rodent animals. As the first demonstration of a wearable device for real&#8208;time in vivo analysis of disease&#8208;indicative biomarkers, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study well demonstrated the potential of the iMethy platform for cancer risk management based on dynamic transdermal surveillance of methylated ctDNAs via a painless and self&#8208;administrable procedure.

         <title>Unlock the Potassium Storage Behavior of Single&#8208;Phased Tungsten Selenide Nanorods via Large Cation Insertion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, in/ex situ experiments and theoretical calculations are performed to investigate the role of tunnel cations in governing the charge storage performances of electrodes by focusing on K&#8208;ions in layer&#8208;structured WSe2. It clearly reveals that the pre&#8208;intercalated K&#8208;ions inside interlayers of WSe2 increases the electronic conductivity, and improves K&#8208;ion diffusivity, having fast kinetics response during the K&#8208;ion (de)insertion.








Abstract
Metal chalcogenide anodes with a layered structure have been regarded as potential K&#8208;based electrochemical energy storage devices with high energy density for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications. However, their development is impeded by the slow K&#8208;ion transport kinetics and poor structural stability. In this work, the energy&#8208;storage behavior is investigated first and decisively associated them with the capacity&#8208;degradation of the promising layer&#8208;structured WSe2 from an integrated chemical and physical point of view. Then, a single&#8208;phased WSe2 with pre&#8208;intercalated high K content (SP&#8208;KxWSe2) is designed to overcome the capacity&#8208;degradation issue fundamentally. Theoretical calculations clarify the beneficial effect of K&#8208;ions inside the interlayer of WSe2 on boosting its electrochemical performance, including increasing the electronic conductivity, promoting the K&#8208;ion diffusivity, and improving the structural stability. The novel design enables the K&#8208;ions pre&#8208;intercalated WSe2 anode material to exhibit a high reversible specific capacity of 211 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1 and superior cycling stability (89.3% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1). Especially, the K&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor, assembled from the anode of SP&#8208;KxWSe2 and the cathode of porous activated carbon, delivers superior energy&#8208;density up to 175&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, high power&#8208;density as well as exceptional cycling stability.

         <title>Zn&#8208;Doped P&#8208;Type InAs Nanocrystal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;synthesis doping of InAs nanocrystals with Zn enables the fabrication of heavy metal free, RoHS compliant nanocrystal&#8208;based field effect transistors, which exhibit either n&#8208; or p&#8208;type characteristics. Advanced structural characterization of the doped nanocrystals highlights the importance of Zn dopant chemistry on the doping efficiency. This study sets the stage for future development of nanocrystals&#8208;based opto&#8208;electronics applications.








Abstract
Doped heavy metal&#8208;free III&#8211;V semiconductor nanocrystal quantum dots (QDs) are of great interest both from the fundamental aspects of doping in highly confined structures, and from the applicative side of utilizing such building blocks in the fabrication of p&#8211;n homojunction devices. InAs nanocrystals (NCs), that are of particular relevance for short&#8208;wave IR detection and emission applications, manifest heavy n&#8208;type character poising a challenge for their transition to p&#8208;type behavior. The p&#8208;type doping of InAs NCs is presented with Zn &#8211; enabling control over the charge carrier type in InAs QDs field effect transistors. The post&#8208;synthesis doping reaction mechanism is studied for Zn precursors with varying reactivity. Successful p&#8208;type doping is achieved by the more reactive precursor, diethylzinc. Substitutional doping by Zn2+ replacing In3+ is established by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis. Furthermore, enhanced near infrared&#160;photoluminescence is observed due to surface passivation by Zn as indicated from elemental mapping utilizing high&#8208;resolution electron microscopy corroborated by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy study. The demonstrated ability to control the carrier type, along with the improved emission characteristics, paves the way towards fabrication of optoelectronic devices active in the short&#8208;wave infrared region utilizing heavy&#8208;metal free nanocrystal building blocks.

         <title>Precisely Constructed Metal Sulfides with Localized Single&#8208;Atom Rhodium for Photocatalytic C&#8722;H Activation and Direct Methanol Coupling to Ethylene Glycol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalyst composed of alternately lined wurtzite and zinc&#8208;blende segments in one dimension and single&#8208;atom Rh selectively located on the wurtzite segment demonstrates record&#8208;breaking performances for the selective conversion of methanol to ethylene glycol via preferential C&#8722;H activation. The regularly lined heterojunctions facilitate the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers, and the single&#8208;atom Rh catalyzes methanol adsorption and activation.








Abstract
Although there are many studies on photocatalytic environmental remediation, hydrogen evolution, and chemical transformations, less success has been achieved for the synthesis of industrially important and largely demanded bulk chemicals using semiconductor photocatalysis, which holds great potential to drive unique chemical reactions that are difficult to implement by the conventional heterogeneous catalysis. The performance of semiconductors used for photochemical synthesis is, however, usually unsatisfactory due to limited efficiencies in light harvesting, charge&#8208;carrier separation, and surface reactions. The precise construction of heterogeneous photocatalysts to facilitate these processes is an attractive but challenging goal. Here, single&#8208;atom rhodium&#8208;doped metal sulfide nanorods composed of alternately stacked wurtzite/zinc&#8208;blende segments are successfully designed and fabricated, which demonstrate record&#8208;breaking efficiencies for visible light&#8208;driven preferential activation of C&#8722;H bond in methanol to form ethylene glycol (EG), a key bulk chemical used for the production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) polymer. The wurtzite/zinc&#8208;blende heterojunctions lined regularly in one dimension accelerate the charge&#8208;carrier separation and migration. Single&#8208;atom rhodium selectively deposited onto the wurtzite segment with photogenerated holes accumulated facilitates methanol adsorption and C&#8722;H activation. The present work paves the way to harnessing photocatalysis for bulk chemical synthesis with structure&#8208;defined semiconductors.

         <title>Quenching&#8208;Induced Defects Liberate the Latent Reversible Capacity of Lithium Titanate Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsic defects in quenched lithium titanate anodes enable reversible extraction of Li ions that are unextractable in pristine state, thus facilitating these native Li ions to participate in electrochemical cycling, which leads to a sustained capacity of 202 mAh g&#8722;1 in the 1.0&#8211;2.5&#160;V range with excellent rate capability and cycling stability.








Abstract
Interest in defect engineering for lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) materials is sparked by its ability to tailor electrical conductivity and introduce extra active sites for electrochemical reactions. However, harvesting excessive intrinsic defects in the bulk of the electrodes rather than near their surface remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, a versatile strategy of quenching is demonstrated, which is exercised in lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12, LTO), a renowned anode for LIBs, to achieve off&#8208;stoichiometry in the interior region. In situ synchrotron analysis and atomic&#8208;resolution microscopy reveal the enriched oxygen vacancies and cation redistribution after ice&#8208;water quenching, which can facilitate the native unextractable Li ions to participate in reversible cycling. The fabricated LTO anode delivers a sustained capacity of 202 mAh g&#8722;1 in the 1.0&#8211;2.5&#160;V range with excellent rate capability and overcomes the poor cycling stability seen in conventional defective electrodes. The feasibility of tuning the degree of structural defectiveness via quenching agents is also proven, which can open up an intriguing avenue of research to harness the intrinsic defects for improving the energy density of rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Partially Nitrided Ni Nanoclusters Achieve Energy&#8208;Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CO at Ultralow Overpotential</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes supported partially nitrided Ni nanoclusters catalyst achieves the lowest onset overpotential of 16&#160;mV for CO2RR to CO, and reaches CO Faraday efficiency &#8805; 99.0% at overpotential of only 166&#160;mV, much lower than of the isolated Ni single&#8208;atom catalyst, with the highest cathode energy efficiency of 86.9%.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a promising strategy to lower CO2 emission while producing value&#8208;added chemicals. A great challenge facing CO2RR is how to improve energy efficiency by reducing overpotentials. Herein, partially nitrided Ni nanoclusters (NiNx) immobilized on N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) for CO2RR are reported, which achieves the lowest onset overpotential of 16&#160;mV for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO and the highest cathode energy efficiency of 86.9% with CO Faraday efficiency &gt;99.0% to date. Interestingly, NiNx/NCNT affords a CO generation rate of 43.0&#160;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at a low potential of &#8722;0.572&#160;V (vs RHE). DFT calculations reveal that the NiNx nanoclusters favor *COOH formation with lower Gibbs free energy than isolated Ni single&#8208;atom, hence lowering CO2RR overpotential. As NiNx/NCNT is applied to a membrane electrode assembly system coupled with oxygen evolution reaction, a cell voltage of only 2.13&#160;V is required to reach 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, with total energy efficiency of 62.2%.

         <title>Low&#8208;Voltage Intrinsically Stretchable Organic Transistor Amplifiers for Ultrasensitive Electrophysiological Signal Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a van der Waals&#8208;controlling elastomer/carbon quantum dot interfacial polarization methodology is developed to fabricate intrinsically stretchable organic thin&#8208;film transistors (ISOTFTs) with low operating voltage below 5 V, 100% strain tolerance, and excellent operational stability. Further, the transistor amplifier shows a high gain of 90 V V&#8722;1 and ultrasensitive detection for human electro&#8208;oculogram signals.








Abstract
Stretchability is a prerequisite for electronic skin devices. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art stretchable thin&#8208;film transistors do not possess sufficiently low operating voltages and good stability, significantly limiting their use in real&#8208;world biomedical applications. Herein, a van der Waals&#8208;controlling elastomer/carbon quantum dot interfacial polarization methodology is proposed to form a hybrid polymer dielectric with 620% tensile strain and large&#8208;area film uniformity (&gt;A4 paper size). Using the hybrid polymer dielectrics, the prepared intrinsically stretchable organic thin&#8208;film transistors demonstrate a low operating voltage below 5&#160;V, 100% strain tolerance, and excellent operational stability, as well as a high on&#8208;current/off&#8208;current ratio of 105 and a steep subthreshold slope of 500&#160;mV dec&#8722;1. Based on this device technology, an amplifier with a high gain of 90&#160;V V&#8722;1 among the highest values of reported stretchable transistors is realized. This amplifier is at the first time applied to detect human electrophysical signals with an output signal amplitude of over 0.2&#160;V, which even outperforms other types of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic amplifiers for human electrophysiology monitoring. This stretchable device technology sufficiently meets the safety and portability requirements of wearable biomedical applications, opening a new opportunity to e&#8208;skin with signal control and amplification capabilities.

         <title>Shape Morphing Directed by Spatially Encoded, Dually Responsive Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Micro&#8208;Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape morphing from nonresponsive elastomer films can be preprogrammed by spatially embedding anisotropic shape&#8208;changing micro&#8208;actuators with certain orientations and height distributions, offering a robust pathway to simultaneously control in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane bending. This work will broaden the material palette for shape&#8208;morphing&#8208;based applications such as soft robotics, smart wearables, displays, and sensors.








Abstract
Liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) with intrinsic molecular anisotropy can be programmed to morph shapes under external stimuli. However, it is difficult to program the position and orientation of individual mesogenic units separately and locally, whether in&#8208;plane or out&#8208;of&#8208;plane, since each mesogen is linked to adjacent ones through the covalently bonded polymer chains. Here, dually responsive, spindle&#8208;shaped micro&#8208;actuators are synthesized from LCE composites, which can reorient under a magnetic field and change the shape upon heating. When the discrete micro&#8208;actuators are embedded in a conventional and nonresponsive elastomer with programmed height distribution and in&#8208;plane orientation in local regions, robust and complex shape morphing induced by the cooperative actuations of the locally distributed micro&#8208;actuators, which corroborates with finite element analysis, are shown. The spatial encoding of discrete micro&#8208;actuators in a nonresponsive matrix allows to decouple the actuators and the matrix, broadening the material palette to program local and global responses to stimuli for applications including soft robotics, smart wearables, and sensors.

         <title>Embedded 3D Printing of Multimaterial Polymer Lattices via Graph&#8208;Based Print Path Planning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graph theory&#8208;based algorithm, termed Automated Eulerian Route Optimization (AERO), is developed to automate the embedded 3D printing of periodic and stochastic lattices with hundreds of struts. This integrated method is used to construct multi&#8208;material polymer lattices with tailored mechanical properties.








Abstract
Recent advances in computational design and 3D printing enable the fabrication of polymer lattices with high strength&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio and tailored mechanics. To date, 3D lattices composed of monolithic materials have primarily been constructed due to limitations associated with most commercial 3D printing platforms. Here, freeform fabrication of multi&#8208;material polymer lattices via embedded three&#8208;dimensional (EMB3D) printing is demonstrated. An algorithm is developed first that generates print paths for each target lattice based on graph theory. The effects of ink rheology on filamentary printing and the effects of the print path on resultant mechanical properties are then investigated. By co&#8208;printing multiple materials with different mechanical properties, a broad range of periodic and stochastic lattices with tailored mechanical responses can be realized opening new avenues for constructing architected matter.

         <title>Elucidating the Origins of High Preferential Crystal Orientation in Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleation process to form quasi&#8208;2D&#160;perovskites is thermodynamically controlled using the methylammonium chloride additive to achieve films with a degree of preferential orientation of 94%, capable of withstanding 97% relative humidity for 10&#160;h without degradation. Combining microscopic, macroscopic, and spectrographic observations, the thermodynamics enabling preferential crystal growth are inferred.








Abstract
Incorporating large organic cations to form&#160;2D&#160;and mixed 2D/3D structures significantly increases the stability of perovskite solar cells. However, due to their low electron mobility, aligning the organic sheets to ensure unimpeded charge transport is critical to rival the high performances of pure 3D systems. While additives such as methylammonium chloride (MACl) can enable this preferential orientation, so far, no complete description exists explaining how they influence the nucleation process to grow highly aligned crystals. Here, by investigating the initial stages of the crystallization, as well as partially and fully formed perovskites grown using MACl, the origins underlying this favorable alignment are inferred. This mechanism is studied by employing 3&#8208;fluorobenzylammonium in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite solar cells. Upon assisting the crystallization with MACl, films with a degree of preferential orientation of 94%, capable of withstanding moisture levels of 97% relative humidity for 10&#160;h without significant changes in the crystal structure are achieved. Finally, by combining macroscopic, microscopic, and spectroscopic studies, the nucleation process leading to highly oriented perovskite films is elucidated. Understanding this mechanism will aid in the rational design of future additives to achieve more defect tolerant and stable perovskite optoelectronics.

         <title>Merging Passivation in Synthesis Enabling the Lowest Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Loss for PbS Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic passivation is performed in the direct synthesis of conductive lead sulfide colloidal quantum dot (PbS CQD) inks. The improved passivation effect is intactly delivered to the final photovoltaic device, leading a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc)) of 0.71&#160;V and efficiency of 13.3%, which results in the lowest Voc loss (0.35&#160;eV) for the reported PbS CQD solar cells.








Abstract
The high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) loss arising from insufficient surface passivation is the main factor that limits the efficiency of current lead sulfide colloidal quantum dots (PbS CQDs) solar cell. Here, synergistic passivation is performed in the direct synthesis of conductive PbS CQD inks by introducing multifunctional ligands to well coordinate the complicated CQDs surface with the thermodynamically optimal configuration. The improved passivation effect is intactly delivered to the final photovoltaic device, leading to an order lower surface trap density and beneficial doping behavior compared to the control sample. The obtained CQD inks show the highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 24% for all photovoltaic PbS CQD inks, which is more than twice the reported average PLQY value of &#8776;10%. As a result, a high Voc of 0.71&#160;V and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.3% is achieved, which results in the lowest Voc loss (0.35&#160;eV) for the reported PbS CQD solar cells with PCE &gt;10%, comparable to that of perovskite solar cells. This work provides valuable insights into the future CQDs passivation strategies and also demonstrates the great potential for the direct&#8208;synthesis protocol of PbS CQDs.

         <title>A Gate Programmable van der Waals Metal&#8208;Ferroelectric&#8208;Semiconductor Vertical Heterojunction Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prototypical gate&#8208;programmable memory that seamlessly integrates the functionality of both ferroelectric memristor and metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor field effect transistor (MOS&#8208;FET), in a vertical fashion is demonstrated. Its memristive characteristics can be quenched (enabled), by setting the Fermi level of MoS2 inside (outside) of its band gap via a top gate, yielding a gate programmable non&#8208;volatile memory for multi&#8208;bit data storage and more.








Abstract
Ferroelectricity, one of the keys to realize non&#8208;volatile memories owing to the remanent electric polarization, is an emerging phenomenon in the 2D limit. Yet the demonstrations of van der Waals (vdW) memories using 2D ferroelectric materials as an ingredient are very limited. Especially, gate&#8208;tunable ferroelectric vdW memristive device, which holds promises in future multi&#8208;bit data storage applications, remains challenging. Here, a gate&#8208;programmable multi&#8208;state memory is shown by vertically assembling graphite, CuInP2S6, and MoS2 layers into a metal(M)&#8208;ferroelectric(FE)&#8208;semiconductor(S) architecture. The resulted devices seamlessly integrate the functionality of both FE&#8208;memristor (with ON&#8211;OFF ratios exceeding 105 and long&#8208;term retention) and metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor field effect transistor (MOS&#8208;FET). Thus, it yields a prototype of gate tunable giant electroresistance with multi&#8208;levelled ON&#8208;states in the FE&#8208;memristor in the vertical vdW assembly. First&#8208;principles calculations further reveal that such behaviors originate from the specific band alignment between the FE&#8208;S interface. Our&#160;findings pave the way for the engineering of ferroelectricity&#8208;mediated memories in future implementations of 2D&#160;nanoelectronics.

         <title>Conversion of Classical Light Emission from a Nanoparticle&#8208;Strained WSe2 Monolayer into Quantum Light Emission via Electron Beam Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectrally overlapping mid&#8208;gap emitters from deterministically positioned, nanoparticle&#8208;strained WSe2 monolayers are converted into isolatable, anti&#8208;bunched emitters using electron beam irradiation. The localized emission before and after irradiation are compared as a function of strain magnitude to assign the spectral transformation to the suppression of weakly coupled mid&#8208;gap state&#8208;strain pairs through strongly coupled mid&#8208;gap state&#8208;strain pairs introduced through electron beam irradiation.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state single photon emitters (SPEs) within atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently attracted interest as scalable quantum light sources for quantum photonic technologies. Among TMDs, WSe2 monolayers (MLs) are promising for the deterministic fabrication and engineering of SPEs using local strain fields. The ability to reliably produce isolatable SPEs in WSe2 is currently impeded by the presence of numerous spectrally overlapping states that occur at strained locations. Here nanoparticle (NP) arrays with precisely defined positions and sizes are employed to deterministically create strain fields in WSe2 MLs, thus enabling the systematic investigation and control of SPE formation. Using this platform, electron beam irradiation at NP&#8208;strained locations transforms spectrally overlapped sub&#8208;bandgap emission states into isolatable, anti&#8208;bunched quantum emitters. The dependence of the emission spectra of WSe2 MLs as a function of strain magnitude and exposure time to electron beam irradiation is quantified and provides insight into the mechanism for SPE production. Excitons selectively funnel through strongly coupled sub&#8208;bandgap states introduced by electron beam irradiation, which suppresses spectrally overlapping emission pathways and leads to measurable anti&#8208;bunched behavior.

     alt="Conversion of Classical Light Emission from a Nanoparticle-Strained WSe2 Monolayer into Quantum Light Emission via Electron Beam Irradiation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spectrally overlapping mid-gap emitters from deterministically positioned, nanoparticle-strained WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monolayers are converted into isolatable, anti-bunched emitters using electron beam irradiation. The localized emission before and after irradiation are compared as a function of strain magnitude to assign the spectral transformation to the suppression of weakly coupled mid-gap state-strain pairs through strongly coupled mid-gap state-strain pairs introduced through electron beam irradiation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state single photon emitters (SPEs) within atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently attracted interest as scalable quantum light sources for quantum photonic technologies. Among TMDs, WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monolayers (MLs) are promising for the deterministic fabrication and engineering of SPEs using local strain fields. The ability to reliably produce isolatable SPEs in WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is currently impeded by the presence of numerous spectrally overlapping states that occur at strained locations. Here nanoparticle (NP) arrays with precisely defined positions and sizes are employed to deterministically create strain fields in WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; MLs, thus enabling the systematic investigation and control of SPE formation. Using this platform, electron beam irradiation at NP-strained locations transforms spectrally overlapped sub-bandgap emission states into isolatable, anti-bunched quantum emitters. The dependence of the emission spectra of WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; MLs as a function of strain magnitude and exposure time to electron beam irradiation is quantified and provides insight into the mechanism for SPE production. Excitons selectively funnel through strongly coupled sub-bandgap states introduced by electron beam irradiation, which suppresses spectrally overlapping emission pathways and leads to measurable anti-bunched behavior. The findings provide a strategy to generate isolatable SPEs in 2D materials with a well-defined energy range.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Agglomeration of Single&#8208;Atom Platinum in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt single atoms (SAs) supported on TiO2 surfaces form clusters and undergo reduction (by photogenerated electrons) to a metallic state over the course of a photocatalytic reaction. Although this process affects &gt;90% of the loaded Pt SAs, Pt SA&#8208;TiO2 photocatalysts show stable H2 production. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations suggest Pt SA interaction with H adatom as a destabilizing factor.








Abstract
With recent advances in the field of single&#8208;atoms (SAs) used in photocatalysis, an unprecedented performance of atomically dispersed co&#8208;catalysts has been achieved. However, the stability and agglomeration of SA co&#8208;catalysts on the semiconductor surface may represent a critical issue in potential applications. Here, the photoinduced destabilization of Pt SAs on the benchmark photocatalyst, TiO2, is described. In aqueous solutions within illumination timescales ranging from few minutes to several hours, light&#8208;induced agglomeration of Pt SAs to ensembles (dimers, multimers) and finally nanoparticles takes place. The kinetics critically depends on the presence of sacrificial hole scavengers and the used light intensity. Density&#8208;functional theory&#160;calculations attribute the light induced destabilization of the SA Pt species to binding of surface&#8208;coordinated Pt with solution&#8208;hydrogen (adsorbed H atoms), which consequently weakens the Pt SA bonding to the TiO2 surface. Despite the gradual aggregation of Pt SAs into surface clusters and their overall reduction to metallic state, which involves &gt;90% of Pt SAs, the overall photocatalytic H2 evolution remains virtually unaffected.

         <title>Targeting Theranostics of Atherosclerosis by Dual&#8208;Responsive Nanoplatform via Photoacoustic Imaging and Three&#8208;In&#8208;One Integrated Lipid Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theranostic nanoplatform PLCDP@PMH is constructed with atherosclerosis&#8208;targeting accumulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS)/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) dual&#8208;responsiveness, which indicates a plaque&#8208;specific photoacoustic diagnosis and a three&#8208;in&#8208;one therapeutic strategy of integrated lipid management via reducing lipid uptake, enhancing lipid efflux, and actuating lipid removal. PLCDP@PMH provides a candidate for the diagnosis of early&#8208;stage plaques, the inhibition of atherosclerosis progression, and the reversal of formed lesions.








Abstract
Atherosclerosis, as a life&#8208;threatening cardiovascular disease with chronic inflammation and abnormal lipid enrichment, is often difficult to treat timely due to the lack of obvious symptoms. In this work, a theranostic nanoplatform is constructed for the noninvasive in vivo diagnosis, plaque&#8208;formation inhibition, and the lesion reversal of atherosclerosis. A three&#8208;in&#8208;one therapeutic complex is constructed and packaged along with a polymeric photoacoustic probe into nanoparticles named as PLCDP@PMH, which indicates an atherosclerosis&#8208;targeting accumulation and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) dual&#8208;responsive degradation. The photoacoustic probe suggests a lesion&#8208;specific imaging on atherosclerotic mice with an accurate and distinct recognition of plaques. At the same time, the three&#8208;in&#8208;one complex performs an integrated lipid management through the inhibition of macrophages M1&#8208;polarization, liver X receptor (LXR)&#8208;mediated up&#8208;regulation of ATP&#8208;binding cassette transporter A1/G1 (ABCA1/G1) and the cyclodextrin&#8208;assisted lipid dissolution, which lead to the reduced lipid uptake, enhanced lipid efflux, and actuated lipid removal. The in vivo evaluations reveal that PLCDP@PMH can suppress the lesion progression and further reverse the formed plaques under a diet without high fat. Hence, PLCDP@PMH provides a candidate for the theranostics of early&#8208;stage atherosclerosis and delivers an impressive potential on the reversal of formed atherosclerotic lesions.

         <title>Modulating the Site Density of Mo Single Atoms to Catch Adventitious O Atoms for Efficient H2O2 Oxidation with Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mo single atoms (SAs) on red polymeric carbon nitrides (RPCN) catch the adventitious O atoms in air, forming the O coordination around SAs. The site density of O&#8208;Covered Mo&#8208;SAs can be modulated by the dopants of carbon source with different structures and amounts. Such O coordination of Mo&#8208;SAs endows RPCN surface with the enrich electrons under irradiation, promoting the advanced oxidation process with photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition.








Abstract
Coordination environment and site density have great impacts on the catalytic performance for single atoms (SAs). Herein, the site density of Mo&#8208;SAs on red polymeric carbon nitrides (RPCN) is modulated via a local carbonization strategy to controllably catch adventitious O atoms from open environment. The addition of melamine derivants with hydrocarbyl chains induces local carbonization during RPCN pyrolysis. These local carbonization regions bring abundant graphitic N3C to anchor Mo&#8208;SAs, and most of Mo&#8208;SAs catch the O atoms in air, forming the O2&#8208;covered Mo&#8208;N3 coordination. The dopants of carbon source with different structures and amounts can modulate the site density of Mo&#8208;SAs, therefore controlling the amounts of coordinated O atoms. Furthermore, coordinated O atoms around Mo&#8208;SAs construct the catalytic environment with Lewis base and gather photo&#8208;generated electrons under light. Such O&#8208;covered Mo&#8208;SAs endow RPCN materials (Mo&#8208;RPCN) with a strong ability for hydrogen abstraction, leading to the 99.51% ratio (28.8&#160;mmol&#160;min&#8722;1&#160;g&#8722;1) rate for thioanisole conversion with H2O2 assisted advance oxidation technology. This work brings a new sight on the coordinated atoms dominant oxidation process.

         <title>Carbon Nanocage with Maximum Utilization of Atomically Dispersed Iron as Efficient Oxygen Electroreduction Nanoreactor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical meso&#8208;/microporous N/S co&#8208;doped carbon nanocage with atomically dispersed Fe&#63743;N4 is prepared via nano&#8208;emulsion induced polymerization self&#8208;assembly method, and employed as efficient oxygen electroreduction nanoreactor. The significance of well&#8208;developed nanostructure and porosity toward maximizing utilization of active sites and ensuring fast mass transfer is addressed for highly efficient single&#8208;atom catalyst by systematical experiments and in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy technology.








Abstract
As key parameters of electrocatalysts, the density and utilization of active sites determine the electrocatalytic performance toward oxygen reduction reaction. Unfortunately, prevalent oxygen electrocatalysts fail to maximize the utilization of active sites due to inappropriate nanostructural design. Herein, a nano&#8208;emulsion induced polymerization self&#8208;assembly strategy is employed to prepare hierarchical meso&#8208;/microporous N/S co&#8208;doped carbon nanocage with atomically dispersed Fe&#63743;N4 (denoted as Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC). In situ scanning electrochemical microscopy technology reveals the density of available active sites for Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC reach to 3.57&#160;&#215;&#160;1014 sites cm&#8722;2, representing more than threefold improvement compared to micropore&#8208;dominant Micro&#8208;FeNSC counterpart (1.07&#160;&#215;&#160;1014 sites cm&#8722;2). Additionally, the turnover frequency of Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC is also improved to 0.69 from 0.50 e&#8722; site&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for Micro&#8208;FeNSC. These properties motivate Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC as efficient oxygen electroreduction electrocatalyst, in terms of outstanding half&#8208;wave potential (0.91&#160;V), remarkable kinetic mass specific activity (68.65 A g&#8722;1), and excellent robustness. The assembled Zn&#8211;air batteries with Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC deliver high peak power density (264.34&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), large specific capacity (814.09&#160;mA h g&#8722;1), and long cycle life (&gt;200&#160;h). This work sheds lights on quantifying active site density and the significance of maximum utilization of active sites for rational design of advanced catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;Hierarchical meso-/microporous N/S co-doped carbon nanocage with atomically dispersed Fe&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is prepared via nano-emulsion induced polymerization self-assembly method, and employed as efficient oxygen electroreduction nanoreactor. The significance of well-developed nanostructure and porosity toward maximizing utilization of active sites and ensuring fast mass transfer is addressed for highly efficient single-atom catalyst by systematical experiments and in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy technology.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As key parameters of electrocatalysts, the density and utilization of active sites determine the electrocatalytic performance toward oxygen reduction reaction. Unfortunately, prevalent oxygen electrocatalysts fail to maximize the utilization of active sites due to inappropriate nanostructural design. Herein, a nano-emulsion induced polymerization self-assembly strategy is employed to prepare hierarchical meso-/microporous N/S co-doped carbon nanocage with atomically dispersed Fe&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (denoted as Meso/Micro-FeNSC). In situ scanning electrochemical microscopy technology reveals the density of available active sites for Meso/Micro-FeNSC reach to 3.57&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; sites cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, representing more than threefold improvement compared to micropore-dominant Micro-FeNSC counterpart (1.07&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; sites cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Additionally, the turnover frequency of Meso/Micro-FeNSC is also improved to 0.69 from 0.50 e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; site&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for Micro-FeNSC. These properties motivate Meso/Micro-FeNSC as efficient oxygen electroreduction electrocatalyst, in terms of outstanding half-wave potential (0.91&#160;V), remarkable kinetic mass specific activity (68.65 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and excellent robustness. The assembled Zn&#8211;air batteries with Meso/Micro-FeNSC deliver high peak power density (264.34&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), large specific capacity (814.09&#160;mA h g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and long cycle life (&amp;gt;200&#160;h). This work sheds lights on quantifying active site density and the significance of maximum utilization of active sites for rational design of advanced catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Impermeable Atomic Layer Deposition for Sputtering Buffer Layer in Efficient Semi&#8208;Transparent and Tandem Solar Cells via Activating Unreactive Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic layer deposition (ALD) growth mode on the commonly used electron transportation layer (ETL) PCBM is activated from island growth to layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth mode by introducing reaction sites. As a result, the excellent stability, efficient semi&#8208;transparent device, and perovskite/silicon tandem device with reaction sites are available.








Abstract
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) turns out to be particularly attractive technology for the sputtering buffer layer when preparing the semi&#8208;transparent (ST) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and the tandem solar cells. ALD process turns to be island growth when the substrate is unreactive with the ALD reactants, resulting in the pin&#8208;hole layer, which causes an adverse effect on anti&#8208;sputtering. Here, p&#8211;i&#8211;n structured PSCs with ALD SnOx as sputtering buffer layer are conducted. The commonly used electron transportation layer (ETL) PCBM in the p&#8211;i&#8211;n structured PVK solar cell is an unreactive substrate that prevents the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth for the ALD SnOx. PCBM layer is activated by introducing reaction sites to form impermeable ALD layers. By introducing reaction sites/ALD SnOx as sputtering buffer layer, the authors succeed to fabricate ST&#8208;PSCs and perovskite/silicon (double&#8208;side polished) tandem solar cells with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.25% and 23.31%, respectively. Besides, the unencapsulated device with reaction sites maintains more than 99% of the initial PCE after aging over 5100 h. This work opens a promising avenue to prepare impermeable layer for stable PSCs, ST&#8208;PSCs, tandem solar cells, and the related scale&#8208;up solar cells.

         <title>Strategic Synthesis of 2D and&#160;3D Conducting Polymers and Derived Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategic synthesis technique based on a bicontinuous microemulsion system is developed to design nanostructures of conducting polymers including 2D, 3D, and nanocomposites with tailored electrical properties and morphologies.








Abstract
In recent decades, there has been a great deal of interest in conducting polymers due to their broad applications. At the same time, various synthetic techniques have been developed to produce various nanostructures of the conducting polymers with their fascinating properties. However, the techniques for the manufacture of 2D nanosheets are either complex or expensive. No comprehensive approach for constructing 2D and 3D materials or their composites has been documented. Herein, a simple and scalable synthetic protocol is reported for the design of 2D, 3D, and related conducting polymer nanocomposites by interface manipulation in a bicontinuous microemulsion system. In this method, diverse bicontinuous thin layers of oil and water are employed to produce 2D nanosheets of conducting polymers. For the fabrication of 3D polypyrrole (PPY) and their composites, specially designed linkers of the monomers are applied to lock the 3D networks of the conducting polymers and their composites. The technique can be extended to the fabrication of most conducting polymer composites, being cost&#8208;effective and easily scalable. The optimum electrical conductivity obtained for 2D PPY nanosheets is 219&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, the highest literature value reported to date to the best of knowledge.

         <title>Extracellular Matrix Secretion Mechanically Reinforces Interlocking Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a bioinspired interlocking interface produced by electrostatic flocking. Such an interface can sustain cell growth, and the perpendicularly aligned flocked fibers can mitigate cell death caused by compression. In addition, the secreted extracellular matrix from seeded cells significantly enhances the mechanical properties of the interface.








Abstract
Drawing inspiration for biomaterials from biological systems has led to many biomedical innovations. One notable bioinspired device, Velcro, consists of two substrates with interlocking ability. Generating reversibly interlocking biomaterials is an area of investigation, as such devices can allow for modular tissue engineering, reversibly interlocking biomaterial interfaces, or friction&#8208;based coupling devices. Here, a biaxially interlocking interface generated using electrostatic flocking is reported. Two electrostatically flocked substrates are mechanically and reversibly interlocked with the ability to resist shearing and compression forces. An initial high&#8208;throughput screen of polyamide flock fibers with varying diameters and fiber lengths is conducted to elucidate the roles of different fiber parameters on scaffold mechanical properties. After determining the most desirable parameters via weight scoring, polylactic acid (PLA) fibers are used to emulate the ideal scaffold for in vitro use. PLA flocked scaffolds are populated with osteoblasts and interlocked. Interlocked flocked scaffolds improved cell survivorship under mechanical compression and sustained cell viability and proliferation. Additionally, the compression and shearing resistance of cell&#8208;seeded interlocking interfaces increased with increasing extracellular matrix deposition. The introduction of extracellular matrix&#8208;reinforced interlocking interfaces may serve as binders for modular tissue engineering, act as scaffolds for engineering tissue interfaces, or enable friction&#8208;based couplers for biomedical applications.

         <title>Intrinsic Charge Polarization in Bi19S27Cl3 Nanorods Promotes Selective C&#63743;C Coupling Reaction during Photoreduction of CO2 to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of intrinsic charge polarization has been efficiently exploited for the C&#63743;C coupling reaction. The selected catalyst, Bi19S27Cl3&#160;has three suitably arranged Bi centers with asymmetric charge distribution. The charge polarized Bi centers facilitate the formation of COCOH* intermediate which has been realized as the crucial step for synthesizing ethanol from CO2.








Abstract
Obtaining multi&#8208;carbon products via CO2&#160;photoreduction is a major catalytic challenge involving multielectron&#8208;mediated C&#63743;C bond formation. Complex design of multicomponent interfaces that are exploited to achieve this chemical transformation, often leads to untraceable deleterious changes in the interfacial chemical environment affecting CO2&#160;conversion efficiency and product selectivity. Alternatively, robust metal centers having asymmetric charge distribution can effectuate C&#63743;C coupling reaction through the stabilization of intermediates, for desired product selectivity. However, generating inherent charge distribution in a single component catalyst is a difficult material design challenge. Here, a novel photocatalyst, Bi19S27Cl3, is presented which selectively converts CO2&#160;to a C2&#160;product, ethanol, in high yield under visible light irradiation. Structural analysis through transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveals the presence of charge polarized bismuth centers in Bi19S27Cl3. The intrinsic electric field induced by charge polarized bismuth centers renders better separation efficiency of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pair. Furthermore, charge polarized centers yield better adsorption of CO* intermediate and accelerate the rate determining C&#63743;C coupling step through the formation of OCCOH intermediate. Formation of these intermediates is experimentally mapped by in&#160;situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy and further confirmed by theoretical calculation.

Here, a novel photocatalyst, Bi&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is presented which selectively converts CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;to a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;product, ethanol, in high yield under visible light irradiation. Structural analysis through transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals the presence of charge polarized bismuth centers in Bi&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The intrinsic electric field induced by charge polarized bismuth centers renders better separation efficiency of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pair. Furthermore, charge polarized centers yield better adsorption of CO* intermediate and accelerate the rate determining C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C coupling step through the formation of OCCOH intermediate. Formation of these intermediates is experimentally mapped by in&#160;situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and further confirmed by theoretical calculation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Asperities for Pressure&#8208;Tunable Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many applications require on&#8208;demand control of adhesion at an interface without significant power consumption. In this work, a new form of adhesive termed &#8220;pressure&#8208;tunable adhesive&#8221; (PTA) is presented. PTAs are elastomeric surfaces patterned with stiff, axisymmetric asperities. The adhesive force of the PTA increases with increasing applied preload. The pressure&#8208;tunable adhesion is demonstrated for pick&#8208;and&#8208;place material handling.








Abstract
Control of adhesion is important in a host of applications including soft robotics, pick&#8208;and&#8208;place manufacturing, wearable devices, and transfer printing. While there are adhesive systems with discrete switchability between states of high and low adhesion, achieving continuously variable adhesion strength remains a challenge. In this work, a pressure&#8208;tunable adhesive (PTA) that is based on the self&#8208;assembly of stiff microscale asperities on an elastomeric substrate is presented. It is demonstrated that the adhesion strength of the PTA increases with the applied compressive preload due to the unique contact formation mechanism caused by the asperities. Additionally, a contact mechanics model is developed to explain the resulting trends. For a specific PTA design, the critical pull&#8208;off force can be increased from 0.4 to 30&#160;mN by increasing the applied preload from 1 to 30&#160;mN. Finally, the applicability of precision control of adhesion strength is demonstrated by utilizing the PTA for pick&#8208;and&#8208;place material handling. The approach in pressure&#8208;tunable adhesive design based on self&#8208;assembly of asperities presents a scalable and versatile approach that is applicable to a variety of material systems having different mechanical or surface properties.

         <title>New Method for Preparing ZnO Layer for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and environmentally friendly method, through boric acid, to remove the residual amine in zinc oxide (ZnO) without decomposing ZnO is reported. Consequently, the optimized tandem organic solar cells (OSCs) output of 19.56% power conversion efficiency and long&#8208;term illumination stability of OSCs are significantly improved.








Abstract
Owing to outstanding optoelectronic properties and simple preparation, zinc oxide (ZnO) has widely been used in organic solar cells (OSCs). Although versatile cathode interface materials have been designed in past, ZnO remains indispensable owing to its excellent overall performance. Therefore, solving the persistent problem of residual amine reacting with non&#8208;fullerene acceptors will make ZnO superior over other materials, and thus improve the performance and energy budget of OSCs. Herein, a simple, effective, and economical method for removing residual amine in ZnO without distorting ZnO is reported. By accurately comparing the alkalinities of ZnO and residual amine, boric acid (BA) is selected as the amine&#8208;removing agent because of its suitable acidic dissociation constant. Moreover, the high water solubility of BA ensures that the post&#8208;cleaning process can be easily performed. The work function, electron extraction, and stability of cathode interface layer are optimized through rinsing them with BA. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of OSCs under long&#8208;term illumination are significantly improved. The optimal 0.04&#160;and 1.00&#160;cm2&#160;single&#8208;junction OSCs are based on PBDB&#8208;TF:HDO&#8208;4Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9&#160;bulk heterojunction output 18.40% and 17.42% efficiencies, respectively. Furthermore, tandem OSCs based on the BA&#8208;treated ZnO exhibit a 19.56% PCE, demonstrating the reliability of this method.

         <title>Manipulating the Formation of 2D/3D Heterostructure in Stable High&#8208;Performance Printable CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ X&#8208;ray scattering is applied to investigate the structure evolution pathway of the 2D phase atop 3D perovskite. By manipulating the phase transition pathway, the gradient distribution from 3D to n&#160;= 2 and n&#160;= 1 phase is realized in final films which helps charge separation and extraction, finally concurrently boosted the device stability and efficiency.








Abstract
Manipulating the formation process of the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure, including its nucleation/growth dynamics and phase transition pathway, plays a critical role in controlling the charge transport between 2D and 3D crystals, and consequently, the scalable fabrication of efficient and stable perovskite solar cells. Herein, the structural evolution and phase transition pathways of the ligand&#8208;dependent 2D perovskite atop the 3D surface are revealed using time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray scattering. The results show that the ligand size and shape have a critical influence on the final 2D structure. In particular, ligands with smaller sizes and more reactive sites tend to form the n&#160;= 1 phase. Increasing the ligand size and decreasing the reactive sites promote the transformation from 3D to n&#160;= 3 and n&#160;&lt; 3 phases. These findings are useful for the rational design of the phase distribution in 2D perovskites to balance the charge transport and stability of the perovskite films. Finally, solar cells based on ambient&#8208;printed CsPbI3 with n&#8208;butylammonium iodide treatment achieve an improved efficiency of 20.33%, which is the highest reported value for printed inorganic perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Chiral&#8208;Selective Antigen&#8208;Presentation by Supramolecular Chiral Polymer Micelles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral polymer micelles are prepared by complexing antigens with chiral amino acid modified polyethyleneimine. D&#8208;chiral micelles present the lowest cytotoxicity while promoting the highest activation levels of dendritic cells and antigen&#8208;specific cytotoxic T cells compared to those of L&#8208;chiral and achiral micelles. Immunoactivation mediated by D&#8208;chirality opens a window to prepare potent nanotherapeutics for disease prevention and treatment.








Abstract
Chirality is ubiquitous in biological systems, which is closely related to biological functions, life processes, and even the pathogenesis of diseases. However, the interface between the chirality of synthetic materials and organisms, particularly the immune system, remains poorly understood. Here, supramolecular chiral polymer micelles (SCPMs) are prepared by complexing antigenic proteins with chiral amino acid&#8208;modified polyethyleneimine. The introduction of chirality not only reduces the toxicity of cationic polymer, but also benefits cell uptake and antigen presentation. Especially, D&#8208;chirality presents the lowest cytotoxicity, while promoting the highest expression level of costimulatory molecules on dendritic cells compared to L&#8208;chirality and achirality. The superiority of D&#8208;chirality to stimulate dendritic cell maturation is supported by immunization with D&#8208;SCPMs, which achieves significant antigen&#8208;specific proliferation of T cells in the spleen, lymph nodes, and tumor of mice. Chirality&#8208;mediated antigen processing and presentation are demonstrated by D&#8208;SCPMs self&#8208;assembled from chiral alkaline histidine or neutral phenylalanine modified polyethyleneimine and tumor associated ovalbumin or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike 1 antigenic protein. Immunoactivation enabled by D&#8208;chirality opens a window to prepare potent nanotherapeutics for disease prevention and treatment.

         <title>A Molecularly Tailored Photosensitizer with an Efficiency of 13.2% for Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>

Dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) is demonstrated as an efficient &#960;&#8208;linker for copper&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells. Endowed with the hexyloxy&#8208;substituted diphenylquinoxaline (HPQ) acceptor, ZS4 shows more efficient electron injection and charge collection based on substantially reduced interfacial charge recombination, yielding a record power conversion efficiency of 13.2% and an outstanding stability under continuous light soaking for 1000&#160;h.








Abstract
Photosensitizers yielding superior photocurrents are crucial for copper&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based highly efficient dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Herein, two molecularly tailored organic sensitizers are presented, coded ZS4 and ZS5, through judiciously employing dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8243;,3&#8243;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) as the &#960;&#8208;linker and hexyloxy&#8208;substituted diphenylquinoxaline (HPQ) or naphthalene&#8208;fused&#8208;quinoxaline (NFQ) as the auxiliary electron&#8208;accepting unit, respectively. Endowed with the HPQ acceptor, ZS4 shows more efficient electron injection and charge collection based on substantially reduced interfacial charge recombination as compared to ZS5. As a result, ZS4&#8208;based DSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.2% under standard AM1.5G sunlight, with a high short&#8208;circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 16.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, an open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.05&#160;V and a fill factor (FF) of 77.1%. Remarkably, DSCs sensitized with ZS4 exhibit an outstanding stability, retaining 95% of their initial PCE under continuous light soaking for 1000&#160;h. It is believed that&#160;this is a new record efficiency reported so far for copper&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based DSCs using a single sensitizer. The work highlights the importance of developing molecularly tailored photosensitizers for highly efficient DSCs with copper electrolyte.

         <title>Sulfonium&#8208;Cations&#8208;Assisted Intermediate Engineering for Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of sulfonium cation on the evolution of intermediates in quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites are investigated. It is found that the undesired intermediate can be suppressed with a favorable intermediate promoted after treatment, leading to improved film quality and enhanced device performance with superior photovoltaic efficiency and stability.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D&#160;Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites with superior stability are admirable candidates for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) toward commercialization. However, the device performance remains unsatisfactory due to the disordered crystallization of perovskites. In this work, the effects of sulfonium cations on the evolution of intermediates and photovoltaic properties of 2D RP perovskites are investigated. The introduction of sulfonium cations leads to preferred intermediate transformation and improved film quality of perovskites. The resulting devices deliver a champion efficiency of 19.08% at room temperature and 20.52% at 180&#160;K, due to reduced recombination and enhanced charge transport. More importantly, the unencapsulated device maintains 84% of the initial efficiency under maximum power point (MPP) tracking at 40&#160;&#176;C for 1000&#160;h. This work helps to gain a comprehensive understanding of the crystallization process of quasi&#8208;2D perovskites and provides a simple strategy to modulate the intermediates of perovskites.

         <title>Discovery of Type II Interlayer Trions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first observation of Type II interlayer trions by exploring band alignments and choosing an atomically thin organic&#8211;inorganic system&#8208;monolayer WSe2/bilayer pentacene heterostructure is reported. Both positive and negative Type II interlayer trions are electrically tuned. In particular, Type II interlayer trions exhibit in&#8208;plane anisotropic emission, possibly caused by their unique spatial structure and anisotropic charge interactions.








Abstract
In terms of interlayer trions, electronic excitations in van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) can be classified into Type I (i.e., two identical charges in the same layer) and Type II (i.e., two identical charges in the different layers). Type I interlayer trions are investigated theoretically and experimentally. By contrast, Type II interlayer trions remain elusive in vdWHs, due to inadequate free charges, unsuitable band alignment, reduced Coulomb interactions, poor interface quality, etc. Here, the first observation of Type II interlayer trions is reported by exploring band alignments and choosing an atomically thin organic&#8211;inorganic system&#8212;monolayer WSe2/bilayer pentacene heterostructure (1L&#160;+&#160;2L HS). Both positive and negative Type II interlayer trions are electrically tuned and observed via PL spectroscopy. In particular, Type II interlayer trions exhibit in&#8208;plane anisotropic emission, possibly caused by their unique spatial structure and anisotropic charge interactions, which is highly correlated with the transition dipole moment of pentacene. The results pave the way to develop excitonic devices and all&#8208;optical circuits using atomically thin organic&#8211;inorganic bilayers.

         <title>Ultrastable Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Fuel Cell Electrocatalysts by Eliminating Non&#8208;Coordinating Nitrogen and Regulating Coordination Structures at High Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrastable Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C electrocatalyst for the oxygen electroreduction in proton exchange membrane fuel cells is developed by virtue of high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis chemistry at above 1100&#160;&#176;C, which enables the regulation of atomic coordination structures of Fe centers and the elimination of non&#8208;coordinating nitrogen dopants producing detrimental peroxide byproduct.








Abstract
Pyrolyzed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C materials have attracted considerable interest as one of the most active noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Despite significant progress is made in improving their catalytic activity during past decades, the Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts still suffer from fairly poor electrochemical and storage stability, which greatly hurdles their practical application. Here, an effective strategy is developed to greatly improve their catalytic stability in PEMFCs and storage stability by virtue of previously unexplored high&#8208;temperature synthetic chemistry between 1100 and 1200&#160;&#176;C. Pyrolysis at this rarely adopted temperature range not only enables the elimination of less active nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon sites that generate detrimental peroxide byproduct but also regulates the coordination structure of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C from less stable D1 (O&#8211;FeN4C12) to a more stable D2 structure (FeN4C10). The optimized Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits excellent stability in PEMFCs (&gt;80% performance retention after 30&#160;h under H2/O2 condition) and no activity loss after 35 day storage while maintaining a competitive ORR activity and PEMFC performance.

         <title>Controlled Desiccation of Preprinted Hydrogel Scaffolds Toward Complex 3D Microarchitectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By printing highly shrinkable hydrogel scaffolds as templates via a low&#8208;resolution extrusion 3D printer, complex 3D architectures with micron&#8208;level resolution are successfully fabricated. This technique is capable of manufacturing a wider range of material types and reveals the opportunity for hydrogel to assist 3D microfabrication.








Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) is the key to creating a wide variety of 3D structures with unique and programmable functionalities. Direct ink writing is one of the widely used AM technologies with numerous printable materials. However, the extrude&#8208;based method is limited by low fabrication resolution, which is confined to printing macrostructures. Herein, a new AM strategy is reported, using a low&#8208;cost extrusion 3D printer, to create 3D microarchitectures at the macroscopic level through controlled desiccation of preprinted hydrogel scaffolds followed by infilling objective components. A printable hydrogel with a high&#8208;water content ensures maximum shrinkage (&#8776;99.5% in volume) of the printed scaffolds to achieve high resolution. Stable covalent cross&#8208;linking and a suitable drying rate enable uniform shrinkage of the scaffolds to retain their original architectures. Particularly, this method can be adapted to produce liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based 3D circuits and nanocomposite&#8208;based microrobots, indicating its capability to fabricate functional and complex 3D architectures with micron&#8208;level resolution from different material systems.

         <title>Hofmeister Effect&#8208;Enhanced Hydration Chemistry of Hydrogel for High&#8208;Efficiency Solar&#8208;Driven Interfacial Desalination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid hydrogel (PMH) judiciously integrated by modified needle coke as solar absorber with polyvinyl alcohol as hydratable matrix and its implementation as evaporator for solar desalination are reported. The Hofmeister chaotropic ions can interfere hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks of PMH and strengthen corresponding hydration chemistry, thus delivering a lowered water vaporization enthalpy and an elevated evaporation performance of PMH in brine.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven water evaporation technology holds great potential for mitigating the global water scarcity due to its high energy conversion efficiency. Lowering the vaporization enthalpy of water is key to boost the performance of solar&#8208;driven desalination. Herein, a highly hydratable hydrogel (PMH) network, consisting of modified needle coke as photothermal material and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as hydratable matrix, is crafted via simple physical cross&#8208;linking method. When capitalizing on the PMH as evaporator for 3.5&#160;wt% NaCl solution, a high evaporation rate of 3.18&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;under one sun illumination is deliver ed, unexpectedly outperforming that in pure water (2.53&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1). More importantly, the PMH shows a robust desalination durability, thus enabling a self&#8208;cleaning system. Further investigations reveal that the outstanding evaporation performance of PMH in brine roots in its hydrability tuned by chaotropic Cl&#8722;, wherein the Cl&#8722; can mediate the hydration chemistry of PVA in PMH and suppress related crystallinity, thus contributing to the increased content of intermediate water and the lowered vaporization enthalpy of brine. This work first scrutinizes the Hofmeister effect on the evaporation behavior of PMH evaporator in brine and provides insights for high&#8208;efficiency solar&#8208;driven interfacial desalination.

         <title>Intrinsic Interfacial Dynamic Engineering of Zincophilic Microbrushes via Regulating Zn Deposition for Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel structural and chemical design is proposed to anchor zincophilic microbrushes uniformly on zinc plates. By the interfacial engineering of guiding layer, zinc ion deposition is efficiently regulated, resulting in suppressed dendrite formation and hindered side reactions. These rational coverings consequently lead to satisfactory anode stability for aqueous zinc ion battery.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable zinc ion batteries are promising efficient energy storage systems due to remarkable safety and satisfactory capacity. However, zinc metal anode instability including dendrite growth and side reactions severely hinders widespread applications. Herein, zincophilic microbrushes have been in situ anchored on zinc plates through simple freeze&#8208;drying and mild reduction of graphene oxide, successfully overcoming these thorny issues. By introducing suitable oxygen&#8208;containing groups, the microbrushes exhibit a good affinity for zinc ions, thereby providing sufficient depositing sites, promoting zinc plating and stripping during cycling, and suppressing side reactions. The delicate zincophilic microbrushes can not only function as protective layer to guide the deposition of zinc ions, but also act as high&#8208;speed pathways to redistribute the zinc ion flux for rapid kinetics. Consequently, the microbrushes&#8208;covered zinc anode displays long lifespan and good durability, whenever in symmetric cell or full battery tests. This work paves a feasible bridge to design advanced aqueous anodes by architecting both structures and compositions of metal coverings.

         <title>Janus Microdroplets with Tunable Self&#8208;Recoverable and Switchable Reflective Structural Colors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Janus microdroplets consisting of chiral nematic liquid crystals and silicone oil are synthesized, showing a large area of reflective colors compared with the spherical microdroplets. The reflective colors can be tuned by the chiral dopant concentration, the viewing angle, and magnetic field&#8208;responsive orientation of the droplets. Their suspension can be applied to&#160;self&#8208;recoverable displays, magnetic tracking, and data encryption.








Abstract
Microdroplets made from chiral liquid crystals (CLCs) can display reflective structural colors. However, the small area of reflection and their isotropic shape limit their performance. Here, Janus microdroplets are synthesized through phase separation between CLCs and silicone oil. The as&#8208;synthesized Janus microdroplets show primary structural colors with &#8776;14 times larger area compared to their spherical counterparts at a specific orientation; the orientation and thus the colored/transparent states can be switched by applying a magnetic field. The color of the Janus microdroplets can be tuned ranging from red to violet by varying the concentration of the chiral dopant in the CLC phase. Due to the density difference between the two phases, the Janus microdroplets prefer to orientate the silicone oil side up vertically, enabling the self&#8208;recoverable structural color after distortion. The Janus microdroplets can be dispersed in aqueous media to track the configuration and speed of magnetic objects. They can also be patterned as multiplexed labels for data encryption. The magnetic field&#8208;responsive Janus CLC microdroplets presented here offer new insights to generate and switch reflective colors with high color saturation. It also paves the way for broader applications of CLCs, including anti&#8208;counterfeiting, data encryption, display, and untethered speed sensors.

         <title>Full&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Luminescence of CsPbX3 Nanocrystals Triggered by Chiral Carbon Dots</title>

         <dc:description>
Chiral carbon dots (Ch&#8208;CDs) trigger circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of CsPbBr3&#160;nanocrystals. Ch&#8208;CDs&#8208;CsPbBr3&#160;retains emission characteristics of the CsPbBr3&#160;with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, and meanwhile has special CPL. By anion exchange, CPL can cover almost the entire visible light band. This is the first report of chiral perovskite which is induced by other chiral nanomaterials.








Abstract
Chiral carbon dots (Ch&#8208;CDs) trigger the full&#8208;color circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of CsPbX3&#160;nanocrystals (NCs). Ch&#8208;CDs&#8208;CsPbBr3&#160;NCs are successfully synthesized via simple ligand&#8208;assisted coprecipitation of Ch&#8208;CDs and metal halides precursors at room temperature. Ch&#8208;CDs&#8208;CsPbBr3&#160;retains emission characteristics of the CsPbBr3&#160;with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, and meanwhile has special CPL, with a maximum luminescence dissymmetric factor (glum) of &#8722;3.1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, which is induced by Ch&#8208;CDs. This is the first report of chiral perovskite which is induced by other chiral nanomaterials. By anion exchange, CPL can cover almost the entire visible light band. Surprisingly, the chiral signal of Ch&#8208;CDs&#8208;CsPbBr3&#160;NCs is in&#8208;versed under excitation state, which can be induced by the charge transfers between Ch&#8208;CDs and perovskite NCs. The combination of perovskites and Ch&#8208;CDs pave away for the design of new chiral perovskite on multifunctional applications.

Ch-CDs-CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;NCs are successfully synthesized via simple ligand-assisted coprecipitation of Ch-CDs and metal halides precursors at room temperature. Ch-CDs-CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;retains emission characteristics of the CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;with near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield, and meanwhile has special CPL, with a maximum luminescence dissymmetric factor (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;) of &#8722;3.1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which is induced by Ch-CDs. This is the first report of chiral perovskite which is induced by other chiral nanomaterials. By anion exchange, CPL can cover almost the entire visible light band. Surprisingly, the chiral signal of Ch-CDs-CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;NCs is in-versed under excitation state, which can be induced by the charge transfers between Ch-CDs and perovskite NCs. The combination of perovskites and Ch-CDs pave away for the design of new chiral perovskite on multifunctional applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Long&#8208;Life Regenerated LiFePO4 from Spent Cathode by Elevating the d&#8208;Band Center of Fe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#63743;O bonding is strengthened by elevating the d&#8208;band center of Fe in regenerated LiFePO4 (RSLFP@NC), which effectively restrains Fe migration and the formation of antisite defects during cycling. Therefore, the regenerated LFP shows excellent cycling performance with &#8776;80% retention after 1000&#160;cycles, which is better than the cycling performance of pristine LiFePO4.








Abstract
A large amount of spent LiFePO4 (LFP) has been produced in recent years because it is one of the most widely used cathode materials for electric vehicles. The traditional hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical recycling methods are doubted because of the economic and environmental benefits; the direct regeneration method is considered a promising way to recycle spent LFP. However, the performance of regenerated LFP by direct recycling is not ideal due to the migration of Fe ions during cycling and irreversible phase transition caused by sluggish Li+ diffusion. The key to addressing the challenge is to immobilize Fe atoms in the lattice and improve the Li+ migration capability during cycling. In this work, spent LFP is regenerated by using environmentally friendly ethanol, and its cycling stability is promoted by elevating the d&#8208;band center of Fe atoms via construction of a heterogeneous interface between LFP and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon. The Fe&#63743;O bonding is strengthened and the migration of Fe ions during cycling is suppressed due to the elevated d&#8208;band center. The Li+ diffusion kinetics in the regenerated LFP are improved, leading to an excellent reversibility of the phase transition. Therefore, &#160;the regenerated LFP exhibits an ultrastable cycling performance at a high rate of 10&#160;C with &#8776;80% capacity retention after 1000&#160;cycles.

Perovskite Solar Cells
In article 2208061, Lukas E. Lehner, Martin Kaltenbrunner, and co&#8208;workers report the controlled nucleation of quasi&#8208;2D perovskites at the liquid&#8211;air interface of the precursor solution. Restricting the initial crystal growth to the surface of the liquid results in highly aligned perovskite thin films with improved charge transport, enabling efficient solar cells with excellent stability.

All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries
The application of a lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) has been hampered by its low electronic conductivity and the high reactivity of its lattice oxygen. In article number 2207234, Ruizhi Yu, Jiantao Wang, Xifei Li, Chandra Veer Singh, Xueliang Sun, and co&#8208;workers successfully address this by introducing an appropriate amount of conductive additives to the solid&#8208;state electrodes and manipulating the surface chemistry, realizing long&#8208;cycle&#8208;life LLO&#8208;based ASSBs.

Cathode Materials
The cycling performance of regenerated LiFePO4 by the direct recycling method is generally not ideal due to the migration of iron (Fe) ions during cycling. In article number 2208034, Zheng Liang, Guangmin Zhou, Hui&#8208;Ming Cheng, and co&#8208;workers report long&#8208;life regenerated LiFePO4 from the spent cathode. Fe&#8211;O bonding is strengthened and the migration of Fe ions is suppressed by elevating the d&#8208;band center of the Fe. Therefore, excellent cycle performance of LiFePO4 is realized and this strategy provides a guideline for achieving good performance of regenerated LiFePO4.

Pressure&#8208;Tunable Adhesives
In article number 2207337, Chelsea Davis and co&#8208;workers show that pressure&#8208;tunable adhesives (PTAs) demonstrate variable adhesive separation forces depending on the application pressure used to form the interface. PTAs are formed by annealing a polymer film on a silicone surface so that it dewets, forming polygonal clusters. The large gray circle is the flat face of a cylindrical probe about to make contact with the PTA during a probe&#8208;tack adhesion experiment.

         <title>The Promise of Soft&#8208;Matter&#8208;Enabled Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite recent rapid growth, traditional synthetic approaches to quantum materials have limited architectural control beyond the atomic scale. By contrast, soft matter self&#8208;assembly can tailor structures over a wide range of length scales. This review explores opportunities for soft matter to impact quantum material synthesis, highlighting existing work at the interface, and offering perspectives on soft&#8208;matter&#8208;enabled quantum materials.








Abstract
The field of quantum materials has experienced rapid growth over the past decade, driven by exciting new discoveries with immense transformative potential. Traditional synthetic methods to quantum materials have, however, limited the exploration of architectural control beyond the atomic scale. By contrast, soft matter self&#8208;assembly can be used to tailor material structure over a large range of length scales, with a vast array of possible form factors, promising emerging quantum material properties at the mesoscale. This review explores opportunities for soft matter science to impact the synthesis of quantum materials with advanced properties. Existing work at the interface of these two fields is highlighted, and perspectives are provided on possible future directions by discussing the potential benefits and challenges which can arise from their bridging.

         <title>Block Copolymer Self&#8208;Assembly Directed Synthesis of Porous Materials with Ordered Bicontinuous Structures and Their Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article overviews the progress of the studies on block copolymer self&#8208;assembly guided synthesis of bicontinuous porous materials, with the emphases on their synthetic strategies, structural control, and potential applications in energy storage and conversion, metamaterials, photonic crystals, cargo delivery and release, nanoreactors, and biomolecule selection.








Abstract
Porous materials with their ordered bicontinuous structures have attracted great interest owing to ordered periodic structures as well as 3D interconnected network and pore channels. Bicontinuous structures may favor efficient mass diffusion to the interior of materials, thus increasing the utilization ratio of active sites. In addition, ordered bicontinuous structures confer materials with exceptional optical and magnetic properties, including tunable photonic bandgap, negative refraction, and multiple equivalent magnetization configurations. The attractive structural advantages and physical properties have inspired people to develop strategies for preparing bicontinuous&#8208;structured porous materials. Among a few synthetic approaches, the self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers represents a versatile strategy to prepare various bicontinuous&#8208;structured functional materials with pore sizes and lattice parameters ranging from 1 to 500&#160;nm. This article overviews progress in this appealing area, with an emphasis on the synthetic strategies, the structural control (including topologies, pore sizes, and unit cell parameters), and their potential applications in energy storage and conversion, metamaterials, photonic crystals, cargo delivery and release, nanoreactors, and biomolecule selection.

         <title>Pivotal Routes for Maximizing Semitransparent Perovskite Solar Cell Performance: Photon Propagation Management and Carrier Kinetics Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic understanding of the mechanism of photon propagation and carrier kinetics of semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST&#8208;PSCs) is critical for the development of high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;PSCs. In this paper, the key factors affecting the high light utilization of ST&#8208;PSCs are deeply discussed from the theoretical analysis, and the recent advances from the view of photon propagation management and carrier kinetics regulation of ST&#8208;PSCs are summarized, which provides guidance for promoting the rapid development and further commercialization of ST&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
Semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST&#8208;PSCs) are ideal candidates for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and tandem solar cells (TSCs) owing to their tunable bandgap and high visible transparency. The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ST&#8208;PSCs is close to 15% with an average visible transmittance of over 20%, which still lags far behind the PCE of normal opaque PSCs. This can be attributed to the poor light utilization efficiency (LUE) of ST&#8208;PSCs. Herein, the pivotal routes for maximizing LUE of ST&#8208;PSCs in terms of photon propagation management and carrier kinetics regulation are systematically rationalized. First, the fundamental theoretical analyses on optical processes and electronic properties are provided. Then, insights on photon propagation management measures and carrier kinetics regulation strategies are provided. Furthermore, a summary of the promising commercial application of ST&#8208;PSCs in BIPV and TSCs is provided. Finally, the main progress of ST&#8208;PSCs is briefly summarized, and the directions for the commercialization of ST&#8208;PSCs are proposed.
