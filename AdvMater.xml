         <title>Water Transport&#8208;Induced Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation Facilitates Gelation for Controllable and Facile Fabrication of Physically Crosslinked Microgels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water transport within the emulsion system is found to be able to trigger not only the liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation within aqueous droplets, but also a consecutive sol&#8211;gel transition. This phenomenon enables the invention of a physically crosslinked microgel fabrication system, which is controllable, facile, and possesses high potential for biomedical applications.








Abstract
Physically crosslinked microgels (PCMs) offer a biocompatible platform for various biomedical applications. However, current PCM fabrication methods suffer from their complexity and poor controllability, due to their reliance on altering physical conditions to initiate gelation and their dependence on specific materials. To address this issue, a novel PCM fabrication method is devised, which employs water transport&#8208;induced liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) to trigger the intermolecular interaction&#8208;supported sol&#8211;gel transition within aqueous emulsion droplets. This method enables the controllable and facile generation of PCMs through a single emulsification step, allowing for the facile production of PCMs with various materials and sizes, as well as controllable structures and mechanical properties. Moreover, this PCM fabrication method holds great promise for diverse biomedical applications. The interior of the PCM not only supports the encapsulation and proliferation of bacteria but also facilitates the encapsulation of eukaryotic cells after transforming the system into an all&#8208;aqueous emulsion. Furthermore, through appropriate surface functionalization, the PCMs effectively activate T cells in vitro upon coculturing. This work represents an advancement in PCM fabrication and offers new insights and perspectives for microgel engineering.

         <title>A Highly Stretchable, Conductive, and Transparent Bioadhesive Hydrogel as a Flexible Sensor for Enhanced Real&#8208;Time Human Health Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elastic, skin&#8208;adhesive, biocompatible, and biodegradable hydrogel&#8208;based wearable sensor has been developed for human health monitoring, inspired by pseudo&#8208;slide&#8208;ring hydrogels. This novel hydrogel&#8208;based sensor offers high accuracy and mechanical strength, 3D printability, passive cooling, UV resistance, self&#8208;healing, and durability. With tunable properties, biocompatibility, and biodegradability, the engineered hydrogel&#8208;based sensor shows significant potential for real&#8208;time healthcare monitoring in human movement and motor dysfunction applications.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time continuous monitoring of non&#8208;cognitive markers is crucial for the early detection and management of chronic conditions. Current diagnostic methods are often invasive and not suitable for at&#8208;home monitoring. An elastic, adhesive, and biodegradable hydrogel&#8208;based wearable sensor with superior accuracy and durability for monitoring real&#8208;time human health is developed. Employing a supramolecular engineering strategy, a pseudo&#8208;slide&#8208;ring hydrogel is synthesized by combining polyacrylamide (pAAm), &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD), and poly 2&#8208;(acryloyloxy)ethyltrimethylammonium chloride (AETAc) bio ionic liquid (Bio&#8208;IL). This novel approach decouples conflicting mechano&#8211;chemical effects arising from different molecular building blocks and provides a balance of mechanical toughness (1.1 &#215; 106 Jm&#8722;3), flexibility, conductivity (&#8776;0.29 S m&#8722;1), and tissue adhesion (&#8776;27&#160;kPa), along with rapid self&#8208;healing and remarkable stretchability (&#8776;3000%). Unlike traditional hydrogels, the one&#8208;pot synthesis avoids chemical crosslinkers and metallic nanofillers, reducing cytotoxicity. While the pAAm provides mechanical strength, the formation of the pseudo&#8208;slide&#8208;ring structure ensures&#160;high stretchability and flexibility. Combining pAAm with &#946;&#8208;CD and pAETAc enhances biocompatibility and biodegradability, as confirmed by in vitro and in vivo studies. The hydrogel also offers transparency, passive&#8208;cooling, ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;shielding, and 3D printability, enhancing its practicality for everyday use. The engineered sensor demonstratesimproved efficiency, stability, and sensitivity in motion/haptic sensing, advancing real&#8208;time human healthcare monitoring.

         <title>A Superparamagnetic Composite Hydrogel Scaffold as In Vivo Dynamic Monitorable Theranostic Platform for Osteoarthritis Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theranostic material, composite hydrogel scaffold (CHS), is synthesized based on glycidyl methacrylate modified hyaluronic acid (GMHA) and hollow porous magnetic hydroxyapatite&#8208;Fe3O4 microspheres. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)&#8208;loaded CHS exhibits subchondral bone repair function and achieves high cartilage repair scores. Its process can dynamically monitor using MRI. The CHS provides a versatile platform for osteoarthritis (OA) treatment.








Abstract
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent disease, characterized by subchondral fractures in its initial stages, which has no precise and specific treatment now. Here, a novel multifunctional scaffold is synthesized by photopolymerizing glycidyl methacrylate&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid (GMHA) as the matrix in the presence of hollow porous magnetic microspheres based on hydroxyapatite. In vivo subchondral bone repairing results demonstrate that the scaffold's meticulous design has most suitable properties for subchondral bone repair. The porous structure of inorganic particles within the scaffold facilitates efficient transport of loaded exogenous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The Fe3O4 nanoparticles assembled in microspheres promote the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and accelerate the new bone generation. These features enable the scaffold to exhibit favorable subchondral bone repair properties and attain high cartilage repair scores. The therapy results prove that the subchondral bone support considerably influences the upper cartilage repair process. Furthermore, magnetic resonance imaging monitoring demonstrates that Fe3O4 nanoparticles, which are gradually replaced by new bone during osteochondral defect repair, allow a noninvasive and radiation&#8208;free assessment to track the newborn bone during the OA repair process. The composite hydrogel scaffold (CHS) provides a versatile platform for biomedical applications in OA treatment.

         <title>A General Approach to Activate Second&#8208;Scale Room Temperature Photoluminescence in Organic Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultralong room temperature phosphorescence, thought only to be accessible in a small number of compounds, is ubiquitously activated in 22 common organic chromophores. Dispersing them as submicron aggregates in a rigid polymer matrix suppresses nonradiative recombination by limiting intramolecular motion and minimizes triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation typically seen in the bulk. These films can glow for up to 10 s after ceasing excitation.








Abstract
Organic small molecules that exhibit second&#8208;scale phosphorescence at room temperature are of interest for potential applications in sensing, anticounterfeiting, and bioimaging.

&lt;p&gt;Ultralong room temperature phosphorescence, thought only to be accessible in a small number of compounds, is ubiquitously activated in 22 common organic chromophores. Dispersing them as submicron aggregates in a rigid polymer matrix suppresses nonradiative recombination by limiting intramolecular motion and minimizes triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation typically seen in the bulk. These films can glow for up to 10 s after ceasing excitation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic small molecules that exhibit second-scale phosphorescence at room temperature are of interest for potential applications in sensing, anticounterfeiting, and bioimaging. However, such materials systems are uncommon&#8212;requiring millisecond to second-scale triplet lifetimes, efficient intersystem crossing, and slow rates of nonradiative recombination. Here, a simple and scalable approach is demonstrated to activate long-lived phosphorescence in a wide variety of molecules by suspending them in rigid polymer hosts and annealing them above the polymer's glass transition temperature.

         <title>Optically Mediated Nonvolatile Resistive Memory Device Based on Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a light&#8208;mediated resistive memory device based on a highly oriented porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks film, in which the resistance state of the memristor is modulated by light, realizing the integration of the perception and storage of optical information. The memristor shows excellent performance with a wide light range of 405&#8211;785&#160;nm and a persistent photoconductivity phenomenon up to 8.3 &#215; 103 s.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), characterized by tunable porosity, high surface area, and diverse chemical compositions, offer unique prospects for applications in optoelectronic devices. However, the prevailing research on thin&#8208;film devices utilizing MOFs has predominantly focused on aspects such as information storage and photosensitivity, often neglecting the integration of the advantages inherent in both photonics and electronics to enhance optical memory. This work demonstrates a light&#8208;mediated resistive memory device based on a highly oriented porphyrin&#8208;based MOFs film, in which the resistance state of the memristor is modulated by light, realizing the integration of the perception and storage of optical information. The memristor shows excellent performance with a wide light range of 405&#8211;785&#160;nm and a persistent photoconductivity phenomenon up to 8.3 &#215; 103 s. Further mechanistic studies have revealed that the resistive switching effect in the memristor is primarily associated with the reversible formation and annihilation of Ag conductive filaments.

         <title>Consistent Thermal Conductivities of Spring&#8208;Like Structured Polydimethylsiloxane Composites under Large Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spring&#8208;like thermal conduction pathways of AgNW effectively improve the thermal conductivity of PDMS composites and endow them with consistent thermal conduction performance during deformation.








Abstract
Flexible and highly thermally conductive materials with consistent thermal conductivity (&#955;) during large deformation are urgently required to address the heat accumulation in flexible electronics. In this study, spring&#8208;like thermal conduction pathways of silver nanowire (S&#8208;AgNW) fabricated by 3D printing are compounded with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to prepare S&#8208;AgNW/PDMS composites with excellent and consistent &#955; during deformation. The S&#8208;AgNW/PDMS composites exhibit a &#955; of 7.63&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at an AgNW amount of 20 vol%, which is &#8776;42 times that of PDMS (0.18&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) and higher than that of AgNW/PDMS composites with the same amount and random dispersion of AgNW (R&#8208;AgNW/PDMS) (5.37&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1). Variations in the &#955; of 20 vol% S&#8208;AgNW/PDMS composites are less than 2% under a deformation of 200% elongation, 50% compression, or 180&#176; bending, which benefits from the large deformation characteristics of S&#8208;AgNW. The heat&#8208;transfer coefficient (0.29&#160;W cm&#8722;2 K&#8722;1) of 20 vol% S&#8208;AgNW/PDMS composites is &#8776;1.3 times that of the 20 vol% R&#8208;AgNW/PDMS composites, which reduces the temperature of a full&#8208;stressed central processing unit by 6.8&#160;&#176;C compared to that using the 20 vol% R&#8208;AgNW/PDMS composites as a thermally conductive material in the central processing unit.

         <title>Protein Interfacial Gelation toward Shuttle&#8208;Free and Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn&#8211;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silk protein is introduced as electrolyte additive to trigger the interfacial gelation at both cathode and anode interface, which functions to suppress the shuttle effect and improve the Zn reversibility concurrently. Therefore, a 500 mAh zinc&#8211;iodine pouch cell with high&#8208;loading cathode (37.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and limited Zn supplementation (20% utilization) delivers excellent lifespan for 1000 cycles.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries hold potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage but struggle with shuttle effects of I2 cathodes and poor reversibility of Zn anodes. Here, an interfacial gelation strategy is proposed to suppress the shuttle effects and improve the Zn reversibility simultaneously by introducing silk protein (SP) additive. The SP can migrate bidirectionally toward cathode and anode interfaces driven by the periodically switched electric field direction during charging/discharging. For I2 cathodes, the interaction between SP and polyiodides forms gelatinous precipitate to avoid the polyiodide dissolution, evidenced by excellent electrochemical performance, including high specific capacity and Coulombic efficiency (CE) (215 mAh g&#8722;1 and 99.5% at 1 C), excellent rate performance (&#8776;170 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50 C), and extended durability (6000 cycles at 10 C). For Zn anodes, gelatinous SP serves as protective layer to boost the Zn reversibility (99.7% average CE at 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and suppress dendrites. Consequently, a 500 mAh Zn&#8211;I2 pouch cell with high&#8208;loading cathode (37.5 mgiodine cm&#8722;2) and high&#8208;utilization Zn anode (20%) achieves remarkable energy density (80&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and long&#8208;term durability (&gt;1000 cycles). These findings underscore the simultaneous modulation of both cathode and anode and demonstrate the potential for practical applications of Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.

         <title>Biodegradable Ferroelectric Molecular Plastic Crystal HOCH2(CF2)7CH2OH Structurally Inspired by Polyvinylidene Fluoride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular ferroelectric crystal PFND with a 2D hydrogen bond network structure is discovered following the construction idea of ferroelectric PVDF. By decreasing the number of &#8722;CF2&#8722; groups from &#8776;5&#160;000 in PVDF to seven in PFND, this ferroelectric compound only needs simple solution processing and has exceptional in vitro biocompatibility, along with remarkable in vivo biodegradation and biosafety.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials, traditionally comprising inorganic ceramics and polymers, are commonly used in medical implantable devices. However, their nondegradable nature often necessitates secondary surgeries for removal. In contrast, ferroelectric molecular crystals have the advantages of easy solution processing, lightweight, and good biocompatibility, which are promising candidates for transient (short&#8208;term) implantable devices. Despite these benefits, the discovered biodegradable ferroelectric materials remain limited due to the absence of efficient design strategies. Here, inspired by the polar structure of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), a ferroelectric molecular crystal 1H,1H,9H,9H&#8208;perfluoro&#8208;1,9&#8208;nonanediol (PFND), which undergoes a cubic&#8208;to&#8208;monoclinic ferroelectric plastic phase transition at 339 K, is discovered. This transition is facilitated by a 2D hydrogen bond network formed through O&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions among the oriented PFND molecules, which is crucial for the manifestation of ferroelectric properties. In this sense, by reducing the number of &#8722;CF2&#8722; groups from &#8776;5&#160;000 in PVDF to seven in PFND, it is demonstrated that this ferroelectric compound only needs simple solution processing while maintaining excellent biosafety, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. This work illuminates the path toward the development of new biodegradable ferroelectric molecular crystals, offering promising avenues for biomedical applications.

In this sense, by reducing the number of &#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722; groups from &#8776;5&#160;000 in PVDF to seven in PFND, it is demonstrated that this ferroelectric compound only needs simple solution processing while maintaining excellent biosafety, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. This work illuminates the path toward the development of new biodegradable ferroelectric molecular crystals, offering promising avenues for biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A H2S&#8208;evolving alternately&#8208;catalytic bio&#8208;heterojunction enzyme (AC&#8208;BioHJzyme) is proposed, which is consisted of CuFe2S3 and lactate oxidase (LOD) named as CuFe2S3@LOD with circular enzyme&#8208;mimetic antibacterial (EMA) activity and macrophage re&#8208;rousing capability. The system exhibits favorable POD&#8208;/GPx&#8208;/CAT&#8208;mimetic activities against bacteria, which can be further activated by NIR&#8208;II light. Moreover, the AC&#8208;BioHJzyme remarkably facilitate the infectious cutaneous regeneration by boosting collagen deposition, angiogenesis, and reprogramming macrophages.








Abstract
The disorder of the macrophage phenotype and the hostile by&#8208;product of lactate evoked by pathogenic infection in hypoxic deep wound inevitably lead to the stagnant skin regeneration. In this study, hydrogen sulfide (H2S)&#8208;evolving alternately catalytic bio&#8208;heterojunction enzyme (AC&#8208;BioHJzyme) consisting of CuFe2S3 and lactate oxidase (LOD) named as CuFe2S3@LOD is developed. AC&#8208;BioHJzyme exhibits circular enzyme&#8208;mimetic antibacterial (EMA) activity and macrophage re&#8208;rousing capability, which can be activated by near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) light. In this system, LOD exhausts lactate derived from bacterial anaerobic respiration and generated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which provides an abundant stock for the peroxidase&#8208;mimetic activity to convert the produced H2O2 into germicidal &#8226;OH. The GPx&#8208;mimetic activity endows AC&#8208;BioHJzyme with a glutathione consumption property to block the antioxidant systems in bacterial metabolism, while the O2 provided by the CAT&#8208;mimetic activity can generate 1O2 under the NIR&#8208;II irradiation. Synchronously, the H2S gas liberated from CuFe2S3@LOD under the infectious micromilieu allows the reduction of Fe(III)/Cu(II) to Fe(II)/Cu(&#1030;), resulting in sustained circular EMA activity. In vitro and in vivo assays indicate that the CuFe2S3@LOD AC&#8208;BioHJzyme significantly facilitates the infectious cutaneous regeneration by killing bacteria, facilitating epithelialization/collagen deposition, promoting angiogenesis, and reprogramming macrophages. This study provides a countermeasure for deep infectious wound healing via circular enzyme&#8208;mimetic antibiosis and macrophage re&#8208;rousing.

         <title>Polymorphic Localized Heterostructure Design for High&#8208;Performance Amorphous/Nanocrystalline Composite Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymorphic localized heterostructure (including nanocrystalline region with long&#8208;range order, Si&#8208;rich transition region, and amorphous region with locally ultra&#8208;short&#8208;range ordered structure) design is proposed to optimize the polarization behavior and breakdown strength in amorphous perovskite&#8208;based dielectrics for high&#8208;performance energy storage capacitor.








Abstract
Analogous to linear dielectric, amorphous perovskite dielectrics characterized of high breakdown strength and low remanent polarization possess in&#8208;depth application in the sea, land, and air fields. Amorphous engineering is a common approach to balance the inverse relationship between polarization and breakdown strength in dielectric ceramic capacitor, however, the low polarization is the major barrier limiting the improvement of energy storage density. To address this concern, the polymorphic localized heterostructure confirmed by high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscope (HR&#8208;TEM) and HADDF images is constructed in BaTiO3&#8208;Bi(Ni0.5Zr0.5)O3 amorphous/nanocrystalline composite film with SiO2 addition (BT&#8208;BNZ&#8208;xS, x = 3, 5, 7, 10 mol%). The stability of nanocrystalline region achieved by Si&#8208;rich transition region and the enhancive ultra&#8208;short&#8208;range ordering in the amorphous region synergistically result in large breakdown strength and nonhysteretic polarized response. This polymorphic localized heterostructure optimizes the thermal stability in a wide temperature range and contributes ultrahigh energy storage density of 149.9 J cm&#8722;3 with markedly enhanced efficiency of 79.0%. This study provides a universal strategy to design the polarization behavior in other amorphous perovskite&#8208;based dielectrics.

         <title>Surface Gradient Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode for Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;rich cathode with a surface gradient is synthesized via a low&#8208;cost and scalable ammoniacal leaching method based on coordination dissolution and redox reactions. This cathode allows a full cell to exhibit impressive capacity retention and fast charging capability. Moreover, a 1.2&#160;Ah pouch cell that lasts over 500 cycles with only an 8% capacity loss is successfully demonstrated.








Abstract
Nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode material LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NCM) has emerged as a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). These cathode materials possess high theoretical specific capacity, fast electron/ion transfer rate, and high output voltage. However, their potential is impeded by interface instability, irreversible phase transition, and the resultant significant capacity loss, limiting their practical application in LIBs. In this work, a simple and scalable approach is proposed to prepare gradient cathode material (M&#8208;NCM) with excellent structural stability and rate performance. Taking advantage of the strong coordination of Ni2+ with ammonia and the reduction reaction of KMnO4, the elemental compositions of the Ni&#8208;rich cathode are reasonably adjusted. The resulted gradient compositional design plays a crucial role in stabilizing the crystal structure, which effectively mitigates Li/Ni mixing and suppresses unwanted surficial parasitic reactions. As a result, the M&#8208;NCM cathode maintains 98.6% capacity after 200 cycles, and a rapid charging ability of 107.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 15 C. Furthermore, a 1.2 Ah pouch cell configurated with graphite anode demonstrates a lifespan of over 500 cycles with only 8% capacity loss. This work provides a simple and scalable approach for the in situ construction of gradient cathode materials via cooperative coordination and deposition reactions.

         <title>Ductile P&#8208;Type AgCu(Se,S,Te) Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via systematically investigating the phase composition, crystal structure, mechanical, and thermoelectric properties of about 60 AgCu(Se,S,Te) pseudoternary solid solutions, the comprehensive composition&#8211;structure&#8211;property phase diagrams of the AgCuSe&#8208;AgCuS&#8208;AgCuTe pseudoternary system is constructed. By mapping the complex phases, the &#8220;ductile&#8208;brittle&#8221; and &#8220;n&#8208;p&#8221; transition boundaries are determined and the composition ranges with high thermoelectric performance and inherent ductility are illustrated.








Abstract
Ductile inorganic thermoelectric (TE) materials open a new approach to develop high&#8208;performance flexible TE devices. N&#8208;type Ag2(S,Se,Te) and p&#8208;type AgCu(Se,S,Te) pseudoternary solid solutions are two typical categories of ductile inorganic TE materials reported so far. Comparing with the Ag2(S,Se,Te) pseudoternary solid solutions, the phase composition, crystal structure, and physical properties of AgCu(Se,S,Te) pseudoternary solid solutions are more complex, but their relationships are still ambiguous now. In this work, via systematically investigating the phase composition, crystal structure, mechanical, and TE properties of about 60 AgCu(Se,S,Te) pseudoternary solid solutions, the comprehensive composition&#8211;structure&#8211;property phase diagrams of the AgCuSe&#8208;AgCuS&#8208;AgCuTe pseudoternary system is constructed. By mapping the complex phases, the &#8220;ductile&#8208;brittle&#8221; and &#8220;n&#8208;p&#8221; transition boundaries are determined and the composition ranges with high TE performance and inherent ductility are illustrated. On this basis, high performance p&#8208;type ductile TE materials are obtained, with a maximum zT of 0.81 at 340 K. Finally, flexible in&#8208;plane TE devices are prepared by using the AgCu(Se,S,Te)&#8208;based ductile TE materials, showing high output performance that is superior to those of organic and inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid flexible devices.

By mapping the complex phases, the &#8220;ductile-brittle&#8221; and &#8220;n-p&#8221; transition boundaries are determined and the composition ranges with high TE performance and inherent ductility are illustrated. On this basis, high performance p-type ductile TE materials are obtained, with a maximum &lt;i&gt;zT&lt;/i&gt; of 0.81 at 340 K. Finally, flexible in-plane TE devices are prepared by using the AgCu(Se,S,Te)-based ductile TE materials, showing high output performance that is superior to those of organic and inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid flexible devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic Cations Texture Zinc Metal Anodes for Deep Cycling Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The imidazolium&#8208;based cations featuring oriented adsorption on the Zn&#8208;(002) plane enable the non&#8208;epitaxial electrodeposition fabrication of (002)&#8208;textured Zn metal electrodes. Moreover, the exemplified 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cation (Bmim+) as an electrolyte additive for working Zn batteries can well sustain the (002) texture of the as&#8208;prepared (002)&#8208;Zn electrode even under deep cycling conditions.








Abstract
Manipulating the crystallographic orientation of zinc (Zn) metal to expose more (002) planes is promising to stabilize Zn anodes in aqueous electrolytes. However, there remain challenges involving the non&#8208;epitaxial electrodeposition of highly (002) textured Zn metal and the maintenance of (002) texture under deep cycling conditions. Herein, a novel organic imidazolium cations&#8208;assisted non&#8208;epitaxial electrodeposition strategy to texture electrodeposited Zn metals is developed. Taking the 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cation (Bmim+) as a paradigm additive, the as&#8208;prepared Zn film ((002)&#8208;Zn) manifests a compact structure and a highly (002) texture without containing (100) signal. Mechanistic studies reveal that Bmim+ featuring oriented adsorption on the Zn&#8208;(002) plane can reduce the growth rate of (002) plane to render the final exposure of (002) texture, and homogenize Zn nucleation and suppress H2 evolution to enable the compact electrodeposition. In addition, the formulated Bmim+&#8208;containing ZnSO4 electrolyte effectively sustains the (002) texture even under deep cycling conditions. Consequently, the combination of (002) texture and Bmim+&#8208;containing electrolyte endows the (002)&#8208;Zn electrode with superior cycling stability over 350&#160;h under 20 mAh cm&#8722;2 with 72.6% depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge, and assures the stable operation of full Zn batteries with both coin&#8208;type and pouch&#8208;type configurations, significantly outperforming the (002)&#8208;Zn and commercial Zn&#8208;based batteries in Bmim+&#8208;free electrolytes.

         <title>New Engineering Science Insights into the Electrode Materials Pairing of Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports how combining experiments and machine learning provides a new, practical approach to pairing the two electrodes in an electrochemical energy storage device for optimal cell&#8208;level performance under various operating conditions. This approach and the new engineering science insights in this work are vital for translating breakthrough energy materials into optimal cell&#8208;level performance for practical applications.








Abstract
Pairing the positive and negative electrodes with their individual dynamic characteristics at a realistic cell level is essential to the practical optimal design of electrochemical energy storage devices. However, the complex relationship between the performance data measured for individual electrodes and the two&#8208;electrode cells used in practice often makes an optimal pairing experimentally challenging. Taking advantage of the developed tunable graphene&#8208;based electrodes with controllable structure, experiments with machine learning are successfully united to generate a large pool of capacitance data for graphene&#8208;based electrode materials with varied slit pore sizes, thicknesses, and charging rates and numerically pair them into different combinations for two&#8208;electrode cells. The results show that the optimal pairing parameters of positive and negative electrodes vary considerably with the operation rate of the cells and are even influenced by the thickness of inactive components. The best&#8208;performing individual electrode does not necessarily result in optimal cell&#8208;level performance. The machine learning&#8208;assisted pairing approach presents much higher efficiency compared with the traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach for the optimal design of supercapacitors. The new engineering science insights observed in this work enable the adoption of artificial intelligence techniques to efficiently translate well&#8208;developed high&#8208;performance individual electrode materials into real energy storage devices.

         <title>Unlocking Efficient Hydrogen Production: Nucleophilic Oxidation Reactions Coupled with Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleophilic oxidation (NOR) has great potential as an alternative to OER. NOR offers faster kinetics, generates high&#8208;value products, and reduces energy consumption. By coupling NOR with hydrogen evolution reaction, hydrogen production efficiency can be enhanced while yielding valuable by&#8208;products or degrading pollutants. Focusing on the reaction mechanisms and reaction paths of different NORs in anodic oxidation reactions. The review is intended to provide theoretical guidance for future research on NOR&#8208;coupled HER hydrogen production.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic water splitting driven by sustainable energy is a clean and promising water&#8208;chemical fuel conversion technology for the production of high&#8208;purity green hydrogen. However, the sluggish kinetics of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) pose challenges for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production, limiting its efficiency and safety. Recently, the anodic OER has been replaced by a nucleophilic oxidation reaction (NOR) with biomass as the substrate and coupled with a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which has attracted great interest. Anode NOR offers faster kinetics, generates high&#8208;value products, and reduces energy consumption. By coupling NOR with hydrogen evolution reaction, hydrogen production efficiency can be enhanced while yielding high&#8208;value oxidation products or degrading pollutants. Therefore, NOR&#8208;coupled HER hydrogen production is another new green electrolytic hydrogen production strategy after electrolytic water hydrogen production, which is of great significance for realizing sustainable energy development and global decarbonization. This review explores the potential of nucleophilic oxidation reactions as an alternative to OER and delves into NOR mechanisms, guiding future research in NOR&#8208;coupled hydrogen production. It assesses different NOR&#8208;coupled production methods, analyzing reaction pathways and catalyst effects. Furthermore, it evaluates the role of electrolyzers in industrialized NOR&#8208;coupled hydrogen production and discusses future prospects and challenges. This comprehensive review aims to advance efficient and economical large&#8208;scale hydrogen production.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Incorporation of Precipitants into High&#8208;Strength Bulk Aluminum Alloys Enables Life&#8208;Long Extraordinary Corrosion Resistance in Diverse Aqueous Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nature&#8208;inspired incorporation of precipitants into high&#8208;strength bulk aluminum alloys using the inner cavity of opened carbon nanotubes enables extraordinary corrosion resistance in diverse aqueous environments. Such superior corrosion resistance is life&#8208;long and self&#8208;healing due to the on&#8208;demand minimal self&#8208;supply of precipitants dispersed throughout bulk metals. This strategy could be readily expanded to develop other corrosion&#8208;resistant high&#8208;strength metallic materials.








Abstract
The safe service and wide applications of lightweight high&#8208;strength aluminum alloys are seriously challenged by diverse environmental corrosion, since high strength and corrosion resistance are mutually exclusive for metals while surface protection cannot provide life&#8208;long corrosion resistance. Here, inspired by fish secreting slime from glands to resist external changes, a strategy of incorporating precipitants as the slime into bulk metals using the inner cavity of opened carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the glands is developed to enable high&#8208;strength aluminum alloys with life&#8208;long superior corrosion resistance. The resulting material has ultrahigh tensile strength (&#8776;700&#160;MPa) and extraordinary corrosion resistance in acidic, neutral and alkaline media. Notably, it has the highest resistance to intergranular corrosion, exfoliation corrosion and stress&#8208;corrosion cracking, compared with all previously reported aluminum alloys, and its corrosion rate is even much lower than that of corrosion&#8208;resistant pure aluminum, which results from the pronounced surface enrichment of precipitants released (secreted) from exposed CNTs forming a protective surface film. Such high corrosion resistance is life&#8208;long and self&#8208;healing due to the on&#8208;demand minimal self&#8208;supply of the precipitants dispersed throughout the bulk material. This strategy can be readily expanded to other aluminum alloys, and could pave the way for developing corrosion&#8208;resistant high&#8208;strength metallic materials.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

By virtue of the oxophilicity and electrochemical stability of ceria, this work designs a high&#8208;performance hierarchical ceria&#8208;based electrocatalyst for water oxidation, effectively breaking the tradeoff between activity and stability. The investigation into the activity origin&#160;reveals that the oxyphilic interface brought by ceria promotes both the phase transition from hydroxide to oxyhydroxide and the adsorption of OH&#8722; ions.








Abstract
The utilization of rare earth elements to regulate the interaction between catalysts and oxygen&#8208;containing species holds promising prospects in the field of oxygen electrocatalysis. Through structural engineering and adsorption regulation, it is possible to achieve high&#8208;performance catalytic sites with a broken activity&#8208;stability tradeoff. Herein, this work fabricates a hierarchical CeO2/NiCo hydroxide for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This material exhibits superior overpotentials and enhanced stability. Multiple potential&#8208;dependent experiments reveal that CeO2 promotes oxygen&#8208;species exchange, especially OH&#8722; ions, between catalyst and environment, thereby optimizing the redox transformation of hydroxide and the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates during OER. This is attributed to the reduction in the adsorption energy barrier of Ni to *OH facilitated by CeO2, particularly the near&#8208;interfacial Ni sites. The less&#8208;damaging adsorbate evolution mechanism and the CeO2 hierarchical shell significantly enhance the structural robustness, leading to exceptional stability. Additionally, the observed &#8220;self&#8208;healing&#8221; phenomenon provides further substantiation for the accelerated oxygen exchange. This work provides a neat strategy for the synthesis of ceria&#8208;based complex hollow electrocatalysts, as well as an in&#8208;depth insight into the co&#8208;catalytic role of CeO2 in terms of oxygen transfer.

         <title>Interplay of Cooper Pairs and Zero&#8208;Energy Quasiparticles in a Gapless Superconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a gapless superconductor, abundant zero&#8208;energy quasiparticles Anderson&#8208;localize and bifurcate into regions of high and low zero&#8208;energy quasiparticle density of states.&#160;The enriched zero&#8208;energy quasiparticles&#160;interact with the Cooper pairs condensed at the Fermi level and&#160;induce puddled superconductivity and Josephson vortices even at low disorder.








Abstract
The interplay between Cooper pairs and Bogoliubov&#8208;de Gennes (BdG) quasiparticles is a topic of considerable interest in the quantum properties of solids, but its important ingredient, the sufficient amount of low&#8208;energy quasiparticles to interact with Cooper pairs remains elusive in conventional superconductors. Here a gapless superconductor with coupled paramagnetic atomic layers is used to generate a significant amount of zero&#8208;energy quasiparticles that Anderson&#8208;localize and bifurcate into regions of high and low zero&#8208;energy quasiparticle density of states. The enriched zero&#8208;energy quasiparticles induce puddled superconductivity and Josephson vortices. This discovery not only advances the understanding of the mutual interaction of Cooper pairs and BdG quasiparticles but also opens a new avenue for exploring and controlling exotic quantum phenomena where superconductivity, disorder, and spin degrees of freedom are entangled.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Strategy: Novel Borohydride&#8208;Based Solid Electrolytes Extracted from Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by peach tree secreting gum to prevent further damages, which is like generation of cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) to prevent side reaction, a strategy to obtain solid electrolyte from CEI is proposed. Born from the borohydride, the Li&#8208;B&#8208;H&#8208;Se solid electrolyte inherits the intrinsic advantages and also exhibits improved ion conductivity, air stability and cathode compatibility due to the self&#8208;regulation effect.








Abstract
As the core component of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, current solid&#8208;state electrolytes fail to simultaneously meet multiple demands, such as their own high performance, the chemical, electrochemical and mechanical compatibility of electrode interface. A fresh perspective is rather desired to guide the development of novel solid electrolytes with comprehensive performance. Herein, this work proposes a novel strategy to synthesize solid electrolytes extracted from cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI), which is inspired by peach trees secreting peach gum to prevent further damage. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, using LiBH4&#8208;Se and LiBH4&#8208;S as prototypes, confirms that as&#8208;synthesized electrolytes inherited and improved up the advantages of LiBH4 with unexpected compatibility toward multiple cathodes. It is believed that the family of new electrolytes will be continuously expanded under the guidance of this CEI&#8208;derived concept.

         <title>Bionic Artificial Skin Based on Self&#8208;Healable Ionogel Composites with Tailored Mechanics and Robust Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionogel composite with skin&#8208;like mechanical anisotropy, nonlinear mechanical response, crack growth resistance, self&#8208;healing ability, as well as high sensitivity is prepared. Direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing 3D printing technology is utilized to construct the rigid skeleton with specific structure, and the ionogel resin is then infiltrated into the skeleton, resulting in the ionogel composite through co&#8208;curing of the skeleton and the matrix resin.








Abstract
Bionic artificial skin which imitates the features and functions of human skin, has broad applications in wearable human&#8208;machine interfaces. However, equipping artificial materials with skin&#8208;like mechanical properties, self&#8208;healing ability, and high sensitivity remains challenging. Here, inspired by the structure of human skin, an artificial skin based on ionogel composites with tailored mechanical properties and robust interface is prepared. Combining finite element analysis and direct ink writing (DIW) 3D printing technology, an ionogel composite with a rigid skeleton and an ionogel matrix is precisely designed and fabricated, realizing the mechanical anisotropy and nonlinear mechanical response that accurately mimic human skin. Robust interface is created through co&#8208;curing of the skeleton and matrix resins, significantly enhancing the stability of the composite. The realization of self&#8208;healing ability and resistance to crack growth further ensure the remarkable durability of the artificial skin for sensing application. In summary, the bionic artificial skin mimics the characteristics of human skin, including mechanical anisotropy, nonlinear mechanical response, self&#8208;healing capability, durability and high sensitivity when applied as flexible sensors. These strategies provide strong support for the fabrication of tissue&#8208;like materials with adaptive mechanical behaviors.

         <title>In&#8208;Sensor Tactile Fusion and Logic for Accurate Intention Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A location and pressure intelligent tactile sensor with an innovative layered structure is developed to realize efficient ultrahigh resolution intention interaction through in&#8208;sensor sensing, computing, and logic. It achieves outstanding resolution in location (&lt;400 &#181;m) and pressure (75 Pa) with minimal data dimension. Various touch&#8208;intention interactions are explored in logic, encryption, and interaction intelligence.








Abstract
Touch control intention recognition is an important direction for the future development of human&#8211;machine interactions (HMIs). However, the implementation of parallel&#8208;sensing functional modules generally requires a combination of different logical blocks and control circuits, which results in regional redundancy, redundant data, and low efficiency. Here, a location&#8208;and&#8208;pressure intelligent tactile sensor (LPI tactile sensor) unprecedentedly combined with sensing, computing, and logic is proposed, enabling efficient and ultrahigh&#8208;resolution action&#8211;intention interaction. The LPI tactile sensor eliminates the need for data transfer among the functional units through the core integration design of the layered structure. It actuates in&#8208;sensor perception through feature transmission, fusion, and differentiation, thereby revolutionizing the traditional von Neumann architecture. While greatly simplifying the data dimensionality, the LPI tactile sensor achieves outstanding resolution sensing in both location (&lt;400&#160;&#181;m) and pressure (75&#160;Pa). Synchronous feature fusion and decoding support the high&#8208;fidelity recognition of action and combinatorial logic intentions. Benefiting from location and pressure synergy, the LPI tactile sensor demonstrates robust privacy as an encrypted password device and interaction intelligence through pressure enhancement. It can recognize continuous touch actions in real time, map real intentions to target events, and promote accurate and efficient intention&#8208;driven HMIs.

This work illustrating a developed synaptic neuroelectronic device using Bi2Se2Te quantum topological insulator marks a significant advancement in neuromorphic technology for rehabilitating neurological disorders through brain&#8211;computer interfaced neuroprosthetics. It demonstrates controlled brain synchronization and enhanced memory functions, offering a novel approach to mitigating the effects of aging and neurological disorders.








Abstract
Aging and genetic&#8208;related disorders in the human brain lead to impairment of daily cognitive functions. Due to their neural synaptic complexity and the current limits of knowledge, reversing these disorders remains a substantial challenge for brain&#8211;computer interfaces (BCI). In this work, a solution is provided to potentially override aging and neurological disorder&#8208;related cognitive function loss in the human brain through the application of the authors&#8217; quantum synaptic device. To illustrate this point, a quantum topological insulator (QTI) Bi2Se2Te&#8208;based synaptic neuroelectronic device, where the electric field&#8208;induced tunable topological surface edge states and quantum switching properties make them a premier option for establishing artificial synaptic neuromodulation approaches, is designed and developed. Leveraging these unique quantum synaptic properties, the developed synaptic device provides the capability to neuromodulate distorted neural signals, leading to the reversal of age&#8208;related disorders via BCI. With the synaptic neuroelectronic characteristics of this device, excellent efficacy in treating cognitive neural dysfunctions through modulated neuromorphic stimuli is demonstrated. As a proof of concept, real&#8208;time neuromodulation of electroencephalogram (EEG) deduced distorted event&#8208;related potentials (ERP) is demonstrated by modulation of the synaptic device array.

         <title>Photostrictive Actuators Based on Freestanding Ferroelectric Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work demonstrates the application of photostriction to wirelessly drive freestanding ferroelectric membranes as resonators/actuators. Photoexcited electrons screen the ferroelectric polarization generating an in&#8208;plane strain: the underlying mechanism behind photostriction. Consequently, ferroelectric membranes exhibit orders of magnitude larger responses than non&#8208;ferroelectric ones. The findings provide significant insight for future applications in optical micro&#8208;electromechanical systems and&#160;sensors using ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Complex oxides offer a wide range of functional properties, and recent advances in the fabrication of freestanding membranes of these oxides are adding new mechanical degrees of freedom to this already rich functional ecosystem. Here, photoactuation is demonstrated in freestanding thin film resonators of ferroelectric Barium Titanate (BaTiO3) and paraelectric Strontium Titanate (SrTiO3). The free&#8208;standing films, transferred onto perforated supports, act as nano&#8208;drums, oscillating at their natural resonance frequency when illuminated by a frequency&#8208;modulated laser. The light&#8208;induced deflections in the ferroelectric BaTiO3 membranes are two orders of magnitude larger than in the paraelectric SrTiO3 ones. Time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray micro&#8208;diffraction under illumination and temperature&#8208;dependent holographic interferometry provide combined evidence for the photostrictive strain in BaTiO3 originating from a partial screening of ferroelectric polarization by photo&#8208;excited carriers, which decreases the tetragonality of the unit cell. These findings showcase the potential of photostrictive freestanding ferroelectric films as wireless actuators operated by&#160;light.

         <title>Simple Sol&#8208;Gel Protein Stabilization toward Rainbow and White Lighting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a new synthetic method for the production of silica&#8208;encapsulated protein nanomaterials without the use of organic solvents or surfactants is reported. The new pathway simplifies the procedure, allowing for less stable proteins to be used. Single&#8208;layer coatings based on several fluorescent proteins for white/rainbow lighting applications are fabricated, with improved efficiencies and stabilities.








Abstract
Fluorescent proteins (FPs) are heralded as a paradigm of sustainable materials for photonics/optoelectronics. However, their stabilization under non&#8208;physiological environments and/or harsh operation conditions is the major challenge. Among the FP&#8208;stabilization methods, classical sol&#8208;gel is the most effective, but less versatile, as most of the proteins/enzymes are easily degraded due to the need of multi&#8208;step processes, surfactants, and mixed water/organic solvents in extreme pH. Herein, sol&#8208;gel chemistry with archetypal FPs (mGreenLantern; mCherry) is revisited, simplifying the method by one&#8208;pot, surfactant&#8208;free, and aqueous media (phosphate buffer saline pH&#160;=&#160;7.4). The synthesis mechanism involves the direct reaction of the carboxylic groups at the FP surface with the silica precursor, generating a positively charged FP intermediate that acts as a seed for the formation of size&#8208;controlled mesoporous FP@SiO2 nanoparticles. Green&#8208;/red&#8208;emissive (single&#8208;FP component) and dual&#8208;emissive (multi&#8208;FPs component; kinetic studies not required) FP@SiO2 are prepared without affecting the FP photoluminescence and stabilities (&gt;6&#160;months) under dry storage and organic solvent suspensions. Finally, FP@SiO2 color filters are applied to rainbow and white bio&#8208;hybrid light&#8208;emitting diodes featuring up to 15&#8208;fold enhanced stabilities without reducing luminous efficacy compared to references with native FPs. Overall, an easy, versatile, and effective FP&#8208;stabilization method is demonstrated in FP@SiO2 toward sustainable protein lighting.

         <title>Glycocalyx&#8208;Mimicking Nanoparticles with Differential Organ Selectivity for Drug Delivery and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (GlyNPs) is constructed as a platform enabling identification of organ&#8208;targeting drug delivery by systematic in vivo screening. The identified GlyNP hits show preferential accumulation in the target organ as well as cellular tropism within the target organ. When liver&#8208;, kidney&#8208;, and spleen&#8208;targeting GlyNP hits are equipped with therapeutics, the formulations effectively alleviate symptoms in organ&#8208;associated disease models.








Abstract
Organ&#8208;selective drug delivery is expected to maximize the efficacy of various therapeutic modalities while minimizing their systemic toxicity. Lipid nanoparticles and polymersomes can direct the organ&#8208;selective delivery of mRNAs or gene editing machineries, but their delivery is limited to mostly liver, spleen, and lung. A platform that enables delivery to these and other target organs is urgently needed. Here, a library of glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (GlyNPs) comprising five randomly combined sugar moieties is generated, and direct in vivo library screening is used to identify GlyNPs with preferential biodistribution in liver, spleen, lung, kidneys, heart, and brain. Each organ&#8208;targeting GlyNP hit show cellular tropism within the organ. Liver, kidney, and spleen&#8208;targeting GlyNP hits equipped with therapeutics effectively can alleviate the symptoms of acetaminophen&#8208;induced liver injury, cisplatin&#8208;induced kidney injury, and immune thrombocytopenia in mice, respectively. Furthermore, the differential organ targeting of GlyNP hits is influenced not by the protein corona but by the sugar moieties displayed on their surface. It is envisioned that the GlyNP&#8208;based platform may enable the organ&#8208; and cell&#8208;targeted delivery of therapeutic cargoes.

         <title>In&#8208;Synthesis Se&#8208;Stabilization Enables Defect and Doping Engineering of HgTe Colloidal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;synthesis Se&#8208;stabilization strategy is developed for HgTe colloidal quantum dots (CQDs), enabling enhanced colloidal stability, doping tuning and improved passivation. This translated into greatly improved device performance and stability.








Abstract
Colloidal Quantum Dots (CQDs) of mercury telluride (HgTe) hold particular appeal for infrared photodetection due to their widely tunable infrared absorption and good compatibility with silicon electronics. While advances in surface chemistry have led to improved CQD solids, the chemical stability of HgTe material is not fully emphasized. In this study, it is aimed to address this issue and identifies a Se&#8208;stabilization strategy based on the surface coating of Se on HgTe CQDs via engineering in the precursor reactivity. The presence of Se&#8208;coating enables HgTe CQDs with improved colloidal stability, passivation, and enhanced degree of freedom in doping tuning. This enables the construction of optimized p&#8208;i&#8208;n HgTe CQD infrared photodetectors with an ultra&#8208;low dark current 3.26 &#215; 10&#8722;6 A&#160;cm&#8315;2 at &#8722;0.4&#160;V and room&#8208;temperature specific detectivity of 5.17 &#215; 1011 Jones at wavelength &#8776;2 um, approximately one order of magnitude improvement compared to that of the control device. The stabilizing effect of Se is well preserved in the thin film state, contributing to much improved device stability. The in&#8208;synthesis Se&#8208;stabilization strategy highlights the importance of the chemical stability of materials for the construction of semiconductor&#8208;grade CQD solids and may have important implications for other high&#8208;performance CQD optoelectronic devices.

In this study, it is aimed to address this issue and identifies a Se-stabilization strategy based on the surface coating of Se on HgTe CQDs via engineering in the precursor reactivity. The presence of Se-coating enables HgTe CQDs with improved colloidal stability, passivation, and enhanced degree of freedom in doping tuning. This enables the construction of optimized &lt;i&gt;p-i-n&lt;/i&gt; HgTe CQD infrared photodetectors with an ultra-low dark current 3.26 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt; A&#160;cm&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;0.4&#160;V and room-temperature specific detectivity of 5.17 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; Jones at wavelength &#8776;2 um, approximately one order of magnitude improvement compared to that of the control device. The stabilizing effect of Se is well preserved in the thin film state, contributing to much improved device stability. The in-synthesis Se-stabilization strategy highlights the importance of the chemical stability of materials for the construction of semiconductor-grade CQD solids and may have important implications for other high-performance CQD optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Room Temperature Polariton Condensation from Whispering Gallery Modes in CsPbBr3 Microplatelets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The room temperature polariton condensate presents unprecedented prospects for the development of novel photonics devices. Using perovskite materials offers distinct advantages including ease of synthesis, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and compatibility with existing semiconductor technologies. Synthesizing CsPbBr3 microplatelets using low&#8208;cost capillary bridge methods enables not only the formation of whispering gallery modes, but also the onset of polariton condensation at low thresholds.








Abstract
Room temperature (RT) polariton condensate holds exceptional promise for revolutionizing various fields of science and technology, encompassing optoelectronics devices to quantum information processing. Using perovskite materials, like all&#8208;inorganic cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) single crystal, provides additional advantages, such as ease of synthesis, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and compatibility with existing semiconductor technologies. In this work, the formation of whispering gallery modes (WGM) in CsPbBr3 single crystals with controlled geometry is shown, synthesized using a low&#8208;cost and efficient capillary bridge method. Through the implementation of microplatelets geometry, enhanced optical properties and performance are achieved due to the presence of sharp edges and a uniform surface, effectively avoiding non&#8208;radiative scattering losses caused by defects. This allows not only to observe strong light matter coupling and formation of whispering gallery polaritons, but also to demonstrate the onset of polariton condensation at RT. This investigation not only contributes to the advancement of the knowledge concerning the exceptional optical properties of perovskite&#8208;based polariton systems, but also unveils prospects for the exploration of WGM polariton condensation within the framework of a 3D perovskite&#8208;based platform, working at RT. The unique characteristics of polariton condensate, including low excitation thresholds and ultrafast dynamics, open up unique opportunities for advancements in photonics and optoelectronics&#160;devices.

         <title>Robust Chemiresistive Behavior in Conductive Polymer/MOF Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described in this study is a hybridization strategy combining conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and polymers for improved gas sensing. Significant enhancements in sensor recovery kinetics, cycling stability, and dynamic range at room temperature are demonstrated. Mechanistic insights into energy band alignments and sorbate&#8211;analyte interactions reported here are promising toward future high&#8208;performance chemiresistors as well as novel electronic devices based on polymer/MOF composites.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for gas sensing but are often limited to single&#8208;use detection. A hybridization strategy is demonstrated synergistically deploying conductive MOFs (cMOFs) and conductive polymers (cPs) as two complementary mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors in high&#8208;performing stand&#8208;alone chemiresistors. This work presents significant improvement in i) sensor recovery kinetics, ii) cycling stability, and iii) dynamic range at room temperature. The effect of hybridization across well&#8208;studied cMOFs is demonstrated based on 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) and 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaiminotriphenylene (HITP) ligands with varied metal nodes (Co, Cu, Ni). A comprehensive mechanistic study is conducted to relate energy band alignments at the heterojunctions between the MOFs and the polymer with sensing thermodynamics and binding kinetics. The findings reveal that hole enrichment of the cMOF component upon hybridization leads to selective enhancement in desorption kinetics, enabling significantly improved sensor recovery at room temperature, and thus long&#8208;term response retention. This mechanism is further supported by density functional theory calculations on sorbate&#8211;analyte interactions. It is also found that alloying cPs and cMOFs enables facile thin film co&#8208;processing and device integration, potentially unlocking the use of these hybrid conductors in diverse electronic applications.

         <title>Dismantlable Coronated Nanoparticles for Coupling the Induction and Perception of Immunogenic Cell Death</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dismantlable coronated nanoparticles are fabricated as spatiotemporally controlled nanocarriers for coupling immunogenic cell death (ICD) induction to immune perception. The covalently cross&#8208;linked antibody corona shell disassembles in the tumor microenvironment, enables dual ICD modulations within tumor cells and on dendritic cell surfaces, promotes cytotoxic T cell recruitment, and sensitizes tumors to immune checkpoint blockade in breast and colorectal cancers.








Abstract
Therapy&#8208;induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) can initiate both innate and adaptive immune responses for amplified anti&#8208;tumor efficacy. However, dying cell&#8208;released ICD signals are prone to being sequestered by the TIM&#8208;3 receptors on dendritic cell (DC) surfaces, preventing immune surveillance. Herein, dismantlable coronated nanoparticles (NPs) are fabricated as a type of spatiotemporally controlled nanocarriers for coupling tumor cell&#8208;mediated ICD induction to DC&#8208;mediated immune sensing. These NPs are loaded with an ICD inducer, mitoxantrone (MTO), and wrapped by a redox&#8208;labile anti&#8208;TIM&#8208;3 (&#945;TIM&#8208;3) antibody corona, forming a separable core&#8211;shell structure. The antibody corona disintegrates under high levels of extracellular reactive oxygen species in the tumor microenvironment, exposing the MTO&#8208;loaded NP core for ICD induction and releasing functional &#945;TIM&#8208;3 molecules for DC sensitization. Systemic administration of the coronated NPs augments DC maturation, promotes cytotoxic T cell recruitment, enhances tumor susceptibility to immune checkpoint blockade, and prevents the side effects of MTO. This study develops a promising nanoplatform to unleash the potential of host immunity in cancer therapy.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Pressure&#8208;Dependent Programmable Mechanical Metamaterial with Self&#8208;Sealing Ability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;sealing is a fascinating function in living systems, essential for immediate response to damage. The self&#8208;sealing principle found in the plant model of Delosperma cooperi has inspired the design of mechanical metamaterial that can react autonomously to induced damage. By harnessing the internal pressure, the presented metamaterial is capable of closing cracks, facilitating favorable conditions for a potential subsequent self&#8208;healing process.








Abstract
Self&#8208;sealing is one of the fascinating functions in nature that enables living material systems to respond immediately to damage. A prime plant model is Delosperma cooperi, which can rapidly self&#8208;seal damaged succulent leaves by systematically deforming until the wound closes. Inspired by this self&#8208;sealing principle, a novel programmable mechanical metamaterial has been developed to mimic the underlying damage management concept. This material is able to react autonomously to changes in its physical condition caused by an induced damage. To design this ability into the programmable metamaterial, a permeable unit cell design has been developed that can change size depending on the internal pressure. The parameter space and associated mechanical functionality of the unit cell design is simulated and analyzed under periodic boundary conditions and various pressures. The principles of self&#8208;sealing behavior in designed metamaterials are investigated, crack closure efficiency is identified for different crack lengths, the limitations of the proposed approach are discussed, and successful crack closure is experimentally demonstrated in the fabricated metamaterial. Although this study facilitates the first step on the way of integrating new bio&#8208;inspired principles in the metamaterials, the results show how programmable mechanical metamaterials might extend materials design space from pure properties to life&#8208;like&#160;abilities.

         <title>A Ligand&#8208;Directed Spatial Regulation to Structural and Functional Tunability in Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen&#8208;Functionalized Organic&#8211;Inorganic Nanoassemblies</title>

Here, a facile and general emulsion self&#8208;assembly tactic is proposed for synthesizing well&#8208;defined AIEgen&#8208;functionalized organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanoparticles (OINPs) by coassembling alkane chain&#8208;functionalized inorganic nanoparticles with hydrophobic organic AIEgens. By varying the alkane ligand length and density on the surface of inorganic nanoparticles, the ligand&#8208;directed spatial regulation tailored structures, properties, and functionalities, thus championing the progressive development of AIEgen&#8208;functionalized OINPs are successfully achieved.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;functionalized organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanoparticles (OINPs) are an emerging category of multifunctional nanomaterials with vast potential applications. The spatial arrangement and positioning of AIEgens and inorganic compounds in AIEgen&#8208;functionalized OINPs determine the structures, properties, and functionalities of the self&#8208;assembled nanomaterials. In this work, a facile and general emulsion self&#8208;assembly tactic for synthesizing well&#8208;defined AIEgen&#8208;functionalized OINPs is proposed by coassembling alkane chain&#8208;functionalized inorganic nanoparticles with hydrophobic organic AIEgens. As a proof of concept, the self&#8208;assembly and structural evolution of plasmonic&#8208;fluorescent hybrid nanoparticles (PFNPs) from concentric circle to core shell and then to Janus structures is demonstrated by using alkane chain&#8208;modified AuNPs and AIEgens as building blocks. The spatial position of AuNPs in the signal nanocomposite is controlled by varying the alkane ligand length and density on the AuNP surface. The mechanism behind the formation of various PFNP nanostructures is also elucidated through experiments and theoretical simulation. The obtained PFNPs with diverse structures exhibit spatially tunable optical and photothermal properties for advanced applications in multicolor and multimode immunolabeling and photothermal sterilization. This work presents an innovative synthetic approach of constructing AIEgen&#8208;functionalized OINPs with diverse structures, compositions, and functionalities, thereby championing the progressive development of these OINPs.

         <title>Structurally Aligned Multifunctional Neural Probe (SAMP) Using Forest&#8208;Drawn CNT Sheet onto Thermally Drawn Polymer Fiber for Long&#8208;Term In Vivo Operation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Structurally Aligned Multifunctional neural Probe (SAMP), which integrates forest&#8208;drawn CNT sheets integrated onto thermally drawn polymer fibers, is presented with an emphasis on its manufacturing novelty and in vivo capabilities: 1) Easy fabrication techniques resulting in structurally aligned fiber implants; 2) Versatile and reliable in vivo performance; 3) Robust long&#8208;term operation in vivo system.








Abstract
Neural probe engineering is a dynamic field, driving innovation in neuroscience and addressing scientific and medical demands. Recent advancements involve integrating nanomaterials to improve performance, aiming for sustained in vivo functionality. However, challenges persist due to size, stiffness, complexity, and manufacturing intricacies. To address these issues, a neural interface utilizing freestanding CNT&#8208;sheets drawn from CNT&#8208;forests integrated onto thermally drawn functional polymer fibers is proposed. This approach yields a device with structural alignment, resulting in exceptional electrical, mechanical, and electrochemical properties while retaining biocompatibility for prolonged periods of implantation. This Structurally Aligned Multifunctional neural Probe (SAMP) employing forest&#8208;drawn CNT sheets demonstrates in vivo capabilities in neural recording, neurotransmitter detection, and brain/spinal cord circuit manipulation via optogenetics, maintaining functionality for over a year post&#8208;implantation. The straightforward fabrication method's versatility, coupled with the device's functional reliability, underscores the significance of this technique in the next&#8208;generation carbon&#8208;based implants. Moreover, the device's longevity and multifunctionality position it as a promising platform for long&#8208;term neuroscience research.

         <title>Self&#8208;Lubricating, Living Contact Lenses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A living hydrogel with embedded biofactories of hyaluronic acid allows the development of contact lens prototypes with permanent self&#8208;lubrication and full transparency. Lubricant release is adjusted by the mechanical and diffusional properties of the hydrogel and regulated by the availability of nutrients in simulated tear fluid.








Abstract
The increasing prevalence of dry eye syndrome in aging and digital societies compromises long&#8208;term contact lens (CL) wear and forces users to regular eye drop instillation to alleviate discomfort. Here a novel approach with the potential to improve and extend the lubrication properties of CLs is presented. This is achieved by embedding lubricant&#8208;secreting biofactories within the CL material. The self&#8208;replenishable reservoirs autonomously produce and release hyaluronic acid (HA), a natural lubrication and wetting agent, long term. The hydrogel matrix regulates the growth of the biofactories and the HA production, and allows the diffusion of nutrients and HA for at least 3 weeks. The continuous release of HA sustainably reduces the friction coefficient of the CL surface. A self&#8208;lubricating CL prototype is presented, where the functional biofactories are contained in a functional ring at the lens periphery, outside of the vision area. The device is cytocompatible and fulfils physicochemical requirements of commercial CLs. The fabrication process is compatible with current manufacturing processes of CLs for vision correction. It is envisioned that the durable&#8208;by&#8208;design approach in living CL could enable long&#8208;term wear comfort for CL users and minimize the need for lubricating eye drops.

         <title>A Biohybrid Self&#8208;Dispersing Miniature Machine Using Wild Oat Fruit Awns for Reforestation and Precision Agriculture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plant&#8208;inspired, miniaturized, autonomous hybrid machine mimicking Avena fruits (called HybriBot) is proposed. It combines a biodegradable cargo capsule with two natural humidity&#8208;driven sister awns as biological actuators. HybriBot can navigate soil irregularities, achieving forces comparable to natural counterparts, and is functionalized with fertilizers and seeds, successfully germinating diaspores for applications in reforestation and precision agriculture.








Abstract
Advances in bioinspired and biohybrid robotics are enabling the creation of multifunctional systems able to explore complex unstructured environments. Inspired by Avena fruits, a biohybrid miniaturized autonomous machine (HybriBot) composed of a biomimetic biodegradable capsule as cargo delivery system and natural humidity&#8208;driven sister awns as biological motors is reported. Microcomputed tomography, molding via two&#8208;photon polymerization and casting of natural awns into biodegradable materials is employed to fabricate multiple HybriBots capable of exploring various soil and navigating soil irregularities, such as holes and cracks. These machines replicate the dispersal movements and biomechanical performances of natural fruits, achieving comparable capsule drag forces up to &#8776;0.38 N and awns torque up to &#8776;100 mN mm&#8722;1. They are functionalized with fertilizer and are successfully utilized to germinate selected diaspores. HybriBots function as self&#8208;dispersed systems with applications in reforestation and precision agriculture.

         <title>A Versatile Synthesis Platform Based on Polymer Cubosomes for a Library of Highly Ordered Nanoporous Metal Oxides Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of ordered nanoporous metal oxide particles with different compositions and periodicity is designed and synthesized via a general and flexible polymer cubosome templating strategy. Due to their favorable porosity and rich active sites, the obtained nanoporous metal oxides, for example, tungsten oxides exhibit excellent gas sensing performances to low&#8208;concentration H2S.








Abstract
Polymer cubosomes (PCs) have well&#8208;defined inverse bicontinuous cubic mesophases formed by amphiphilic block copolymer bilayers. The open hydrophilic channels, large periods, and robust physical properties of PCs are advantageous to many host&#8211;guest interactions and yet not fully exploited, especially in the fields of functional nanomaterials. Here, the self&#8208;assembly of poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;block&#8208;polystyrene block copolymers is systematically investigated and a series of robust PCs is developed via a cosolvent method. Ordered nanoporous metal oxide particles are obtained by selectively filling the hydrophilic channels of PCs via an impregnation strategy, followed by a two&#8208;step thermal treatment. Based on this versatile PC platform, the general synthesis of a library of ordered porous particles with different pore structures 3&#175;$\bar{3}$ 3&#175;$\bar{3}$, tunable large pore size (18&#8211;78&#160;nm), high specific surface areas (up to 123.3&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1 for WO3) and diverse framework compositions, such as transition and non&#8208;transition metal oxides, rare earth chloride oxides, perovskite, pyrochlore, and high&#8208;entropy metal oxides is demonstrated. As typical materials obtained via this method, ordered porous WO3 particles have the advantages of open continuous structure and semiconducting properties, thus showing superior gas sensing performances toward hydrogen sulfide.

Due to their favorable porosity and rich active sites, the obtained nanoporous metal oxides, for example, tungsten oxides exhibit excellent gas sensing performances to low-concentration H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymer cubosomes (PCs) have well-defined inverse bicontinuous cubic mesophases formed by amphiphilic block copolymer bilayers. The open hydrophilic channels, large periods, and robust physical properties of PCs are advantageous to many host&#8211;guest interactions and yet not fully exploited, especially in the fields of functional nanomaterials. Here, the self-assembly of poly(ethylene oxide)-&lt;i&gt;block&lt;/i&gt;-polystyrene block copolymers is systematically investigated and a series of robust PCs is developed via a cosolvent method. Ordered nanoporous metal oxide particles are obtained by selectively filling the hydrophilic channels of PCs via an impregnation strategy, followed by a two-step thermal treatment. Based on this versatile PC platform, the general synthesis of a library of ordered porous particles with different pore structures 3&#175;$\bar{3}$ 3&#175;$\bar{3}$, tunable large pore size (18&#8211;78&#160;nm), high specific surface areas (up to 123.3&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and diverse framework compositions, such as transition and non-transition metal oxides, rare earth chloride oxides, perovskite, pyrochlore, and high-entropy metal oxides is demonstrated. As typical materials obtained via this method, ordered porous WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; particles have the advantages of open continuous structure and semiconducting properties, thus showing superior gas sensing performances toward hydrogen sulfide.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Eliminating the Adverse Impact of Composition Modulation in Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes toward Ultra&#8208;High Brightness and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The component modulation&#8208;induced ion doping of perovskite emitters and the underlying mechanism of the nature instability are revealed for FAPbI3&#8208;based NIR PeLEDs with excess organic halides. By eliminating adverse effects of the excessively incorporated organoammonium halides using a surface clean&#8208;assisted crosslinking strategy, a high efficiency of 23.6%, a high radiance of 964 W&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2, and an excellent half&#8208;lifetime of 106.1 h are achieved simultaneously.








Abstract
Excess ammonium halides as composition additives are widely employed in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), aiming to achieve high performance by controlling crystallinity and passivating defects. However, an in&#8208;depth understanding of whether excess organoammonium components affect the film physical/electrical properties and the resultant device instability is still lacking. Here, the trade&#8208;off between the performance and stability in high&#8208;efficiency formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3)&#8208;based PeLEDs with excess ammonium halides is pointed, and the underlying mechanism is explored. Systematic experimental and theoretical studies reveal that excess halide salt&#8208;induced ion&#8208;doping largely alters the PeLEDs properties (e.g., carrier injection, field&#8208;dependent ion&#8208;drifting, defect physics, and phase stability). A surface clean assisted cross&#8208;linking strategy is demonstrated to eliminate the adverse impact of composition modulation and boost the operational stability without sacrificing the efficiency, achieving a high efficiency of 23.6%, a high radiance of 964 W&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 (The highest value for FAPbI3 based PeLEDs), and a prolong lifetime of 106.1 h at large direct current density (100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), concurrently. The findings uncovered an important link between excess halide salts and the device performance, providing a guideline for rational design of stable, bright, and high efficiency PeLEDs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Charging Aqueous Zn//COF Battery with UltraHigh Self&#8208;Charging Efficiency and Rate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient air self&#8208;charging Zn//COF&#8208;PTO battery is developed. COF&#8208;PTO spontaneously forms metal heterocyclic complexes with zinc ions (step 2) to promote the self&#8208;charging reaction (step 1), which is a mechanism similar to Le Chatelier's principle in chemical reactions. Therefore, Zn//COF&#8208;PTO batteries exhibit excellent self&#8208;charging efficiency (&#951;) and average self&#8208;charging rate (&#957;).








Abstract
Self&#8208;charging zinc batteries that combine energy harvesting technology with batteries are candidates for reliable self&#8208;charging power systems. However, the lack of rational materials design results in unsatisfactory self&#8208;charging performance. Here, a covalent organic framework containing pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone groups (COF&#8208;PTO) is reported as a cathode material for aqueous self&#8208;charging zinc batteries. The ordered channel structure of the COF&#8208;PTO provides excellent capacity retention of 98% after 18 000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1 and ultra&#8208;fast ion transfer. To visually assess the self&#8208;charging performance, two parameters, namely self&#8208;charging efficiency (self&#8208;charging discharge capacity/galvanostatic discharge capacity, &#951;) and average self&#8208;charging rate (total discharge capacity after cyclic self&#8208;charging/total cyclic self&#8208;charging time, &#957;), are proposed for performance evaluation. COF&#8208;PTO achieves an impressive &#951; of 96.9% and an &#957; of 30&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 self&#8208;charge capacity per hour in 100 self&#8208;charging cycles, surpassing the previous reports. Mechanism studies reveal the co&#8208;insertion of Zn2+ and H+ double ions in COF&#8208;PTO of self&#8208;charging zinc batteries. In addition, the C&#9552;N and C&#9552;O (on the benzene) in COF&#8208;PTO are ortho structures to each other, which can easily form metal heterocycles with Zn ions, thereby driving the forward progress of the self&#8208;charging reaction and enhancing the self&#8208;charging performance.

         <title>Entangled Mesh Hydrogels with Macroporous Topologies via Cryogelation for Rapid Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal network engineering is proposed to develop the entangled&#8208;mesh hydrogels (EMHs) with a distinct aerogel&#8208;like macroporous topology, exhibiting a significantly improved mass transport property compared with the conventional dense hydrogels&#160;by regular polymerization. As such, the hygroscopic EMHs deliver remarkably faster moisture sorption and solar&#8208;driven water desorption kinetics, achieving high&#8208;performance sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting.








Abstract
Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) is a promising technology to alleviate freshwater scarcity. Recently, hygroscopic salt&#8208;hydrogel composites (HSHCs) have emerged as attractive candidates with their high water uptake, versatile designability, and scale&#8208;up fabrication. However, achieving high&#8208;performance SAWH applications for HSHCs has been challenging because of their sluggish kinetics, attributed to their limited mass transport properties. Herein, a universal network engineering of hydrogels using a cryogelation method is presented, significantly improving the SAWH kinetics of HSHCs. As a result of the entangled mesh confinements formed during cryogelation, a stable macroporous topology is attained and maintained within the obtained entangled&#8208;mesh hydrogels (EMHs), leading to significantly enhanced mass transport properties compared to conventional dense hydrogels (CDHs). With it, corresponding hygroscopic EMHs (HEMHs) simultaneously exhibit faster moisture sorption and solar&#8208;driven water desorption. Consequently, a rapid&#8208;cycling HEMHs&#8208;based harvester delivers a practical freshwater production of 2.85 Lwater kgsorbents&#8722;1 day&#8722;1 via continuous eight sorption/desorption cycles, outperforming other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hydrogel&#8208;based sorbents. Significantly, the generalizability of this strategy is validated by extending it to other hydrogels used in HSHCs. Overall, this work offers a new approach to efficiently address long&#8208;standing challenges of sluggish kinetics in current HSHCs, promoting them toward the next&#8208;generation SAWH applications.

         <title>Stabilization of Lattice Oxygen Evolution Reactions in Oxophilic Ce&#8208;Mediated Bi/BiCeO1.8H Electrocatalysts for Efficient Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Bi/BiCeO1.8H containing under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms is proposed and demonstrated for lattice oxygen redox&#8208;catalyzed oxygen evolution electrocatalysts using a simple electrosynthesis. Bi/BiCeO1.8H&#8208;based anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.79 V and catalytic stability for 100 h at a practically high current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) offers an efficient reaction pathway for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) in energy storage and conversion systems. Owing to the involvement of active lattice oxygen enhancing electrochemical activity, addressing the structural and electrochemical stabilities of LOM materials is crucial. Herein, a heterostructure (Bi/BiCeO1.8H) containing abundant under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms having oxygen nonbonding states is synthesized by a simple electrochemical deposition method. Given the difference in reduction potentials between Bi and Ce, partially reduced Bi nanoparticles and surrounding under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms are generated in BiCeO1.8H. It is found that the lattice oxygen can be activated as a reactant of the OER when the valence state of Bi increases to Bi5+, leading to increased metal&#8211;oxygen covalency and that the oxophilic Ce3+/4+ redox couple can maintain the Bi nanoparticles and surrounding under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms by preventing over&#8208;oxidation of Bi.

&lt;p&gt;A novel Bi/BiCeO&lt;sub&gt;1.8&lt;/sub&gt;H containing under-coordinated oxygen atoms is proposed and demonstrated for lattice oxygen redox-catalyzed oxygen evolution electrocatalysts using a simple electrosynthesis. Bi/BiCeO&lt;sub&gt;1.8&lt;/sub&gt;H-based anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.79 V and catalytic stability for 100 h at a practically high current density of 1 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) offers an efficient reaction pathway for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) in energy storage and conversion systems. Owing to the involvement of active lattice oxygen enhancing electrochemical activity, addressing the structural and electrochemical stabilities of LOM materials is crucial. Herein, a heterostructure (Bi/BiCeO&lt;sub&gt;1.8&lt;/sub&gt;H) containing abundant under-coordinated oxygen atoms having oxygen nonbonding states is synthesized by a simple electrochemical deposition method. Given the difference in reduction potentials between Bi and Ce, partially reduced Bi nanoparticles and surrounding under-coordinated oxygen atoms are generated in BiCeO&lt;sub&gt;1.8&lt;/sub&gt;H. It is found that the lattice oxygen can be activated as a reactant of the OER when the valence state of Bi increases to Bi&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt;, leading to increased metal&#8211;oxygen covalency and that the oxophilic Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; redox couple can maintain the Bi nanoparticles and surrounding under-coordinated oxygen atoms by preventing over-oxidation of Bi. The anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer with Bi/BiCeO&lt;sub&gt;1.8&lt;/sub&gt;H exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.79 V even at a high practical current density of 1.0 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, the cell performance remains significantly stable over 100 h with only a 2.2% increase in the initial cell voltage, demonstrating sustainable lattice oxygen redox.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Comprehensive Strategy Based on High Clinical Translational Nanosystem for Programmable Immunotherapy of Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic of the multifunctional nanosystem (FeSH NPs) with high clinical translational potential preparation with sodium hyaluronate (HA), salvianolic acid B (SAB) and Fe3+, and their application in photothermal&#8208;immunotherapy are demonstrated. In particular, combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody is shown for comprehensive procedural therapy of immunologically cold tumors triple negative breast cancer (TNBCs).








Abstract
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBCs), known as an immunologically cold tumor, is difficult to completely eliminate with existing monotherapies, let alone metastasis and recurrence. It is urgent to design a rational combination of multiple therapies to programmatically reconstitute tumor microenvironment (TME) and reverse the immune &#8220;cold&#8221; into &#8220;hot&#8221; inflammatory tumors to improve the therapeutic effect. Hence, in this work, a multifunctional nanosystem (FeSH NPs) that integrates metal&#8208;polyphenol coordination complex as a photothermal agent and polyphenol, salvianolic acid B (SAB) as immunomodulator is designed and fabricated for synergistic photothermal&#8208;immunotherapy of TNBCs combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody. Guided by photothermal/photoacoustic dual&#8208;mode imaging, photothermal therapy (PTT) caused by FeSH NPs induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation. Subsequently, the loaded SAB is released with the addition of deferoxamine mesylate (DFO) to remodel TME, specifically TGF&#8208;&#946; inhibition and PD&#8208;L1 upregulation, and eliminate the primary tumors. The combination of PTT and TME reprogramming by FeSH NPs further synergizes with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody to eradicate recurrence and inhibit metastasis of TNBCs concurrently. Given the biosafety of FeSH NPs throughout the lifecycle, this work provides a protocol with high clinical translational promise for comprehensive programmed therapeutics of immunologically cold tumors TNBCs.

         <title>Intrahippocampal Supramolecular Assemblies Directed Bioorthogonal Liberation of Neurotransmitters to Suppress Seizures in Freely Moving Mice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An imbalance between neuronal inhibition and excitation may lead to the onset of epilepsy. In this study, bioorthogonal decaging reactions and photolysis enable on&#8208;demand drug release to address the deficiency of an inhibitory neurotransmitter (GABA) during seizure symptoms. Such a spatiotemporal&#8208;controlled drug delivery system is applicable for managing epileptic seizures with an unprovoked nature.








Abstract
The precise delivery of anti&#8208;seizure medications (ASM) to epileptic loci remains the major challenge to treat epilepsy without causing adverse drug reactions. The unprovoked nature of epileptic seizures raises the additional need to release ASMs in a spatiotemporal controlled manner. Targeting the oxidative stress in epileptic lesions, here the reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced in situ supramolecular assemblies that synergized bioorthogonal reactions to deliver inhibitory neurotransmitter (GABA) on&#8208;demand, are developed. Tetrazine&#8208;bearing assembly precursors undergo oxidation and selectively self&#8208;assemble under pathological conditions inside primary neurons and mice brains. Assemblies induce local accumulation of tetrazine in the hippocampus CA3 region, which allows the subsequent bioorthogonal release of inhibitory neurotransmitters. For induced acute seizures, the sustained release of GABA extends the suppression than the direct supply of GABA. In the model of permanent damage of CA3, bioorthogonal ligation on assemblies provides a reservoir of GABA that behaves prompt release upon 365&#160;nm irradiation. Incorporated with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art microelectrode arrays, it is elucidated that the bioorthogonal release of GABA shifts the neuron spike waveforms to suppress seizures at the single&#8208;neuron precision. The strategy of in situ supramolecular assemblies&#8208;directed bioorthogonal prodrug activation shall be promising for the effective delivery of ASMs to treat epilepsy.

         <title>Observation of Omnidirectional Exchange Bias at All&#8208;Antiferromagnetic Polycrystalline Heterointerface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exchange bias effect at an all&#8208;antiferromagnetic polycrystalline heterointerface is observed. The chiral antiferromagnet Mn3Sn works as the active layer, replacing conventional ferromagnets. The unidirectional magnetic anisotropy can be determined omnidirectionally due to the absence of the shape anisotropy. These findings are significant for developing various antiferromagnetic spintronic devices, including antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions, essential for ultrafast and ultra&#8208;power&#8208;efficient computing.








Abstract
Due to promising functionalities that may dramatically enhance spintronics performance, antiferromagnets are the subject of intensive research for developing the next&#8208;generation active elements to replace ferromagnets. In particular, the recent experimental demonstration of tunneling magnetoresistance and electrical switching using chiral antiferromagnets has sparked expectations for the practical integration of antiferromagnetic materials into device architectures. To further develop the technology to manipulate the magnetic anisotropies in all&#8208;antiferromagnetic devices, it is essential to realize exchange bias through the interface between antiferromagnetic multilayers. Here, the first observation on the omnidirectional exchange bias at an all&#8208;antiferromagnetic polycrystalline heterointerface is reported. This experiment demonstrates that the interfacial energy causing the exchange bias between the chiral&#8208;antiferromagnet Mn3Sn/collinear&#8208;antiferromagnet MnN layers is comparable to those found at the conventional ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interface at room temperature. In sharp contrast with previous reports using ferromagnets, the magnetic field control of the unidirectional anisotropy is found to be omnidirectional due to the absence of the shape anisotropy in the antiferromagnetic multilayer. The realization of the omnidirectional exchange bias at the interface between polycrystalline antiferromagnets on amorphous templates, highly compatible with existing Si&#8208;based devices, paves the way for developing ultra&#8208;low power and ultra&#8208;high speed memory devices based on antiferromagnets.

         <title>Multiphase Under&#8208;Liquid Biofabrication With Living Soft Matter: A Route to Customize Functional Architectures With Microbial Nanocellulose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under&#8208;liquid biofabrication utilizes oxygen transport through an oil phase to sustain aerobic bacterial activity at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces. This technique combines multiphase systems with living matter to open new opportunities to advance cellulose&#8208;based architectures through soft templating, including those based on capsules, porous materials, filaments, layered film composites, and Janus membranes.








Abstract
The growth of aerobic microbes at air&#8211;water interfaces typically leads to biofilm formation. Herein, a fermentative alternative that relies on oil&#8211;water interfaces to support bacterial activity and aerotaxis is introduced. The process uses under&#8208;liquid biofabrication by structuring bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) to achieve tailorable architectures. Cellulose productivity in static conditions is first evaluated using sets of oil homologues, classified in order of polarity. The oils are shown for their ability to sustain bacterial growth and BNC production according to air transfer and solubilization, both of which impact the physiochemical properties of the produced biofilms. The latter are investigated in terms of their morphological (fibril size and network density), structural (crystallinity) and physical&#8211;mechanical (surface area and strength) features. The introduced under&#8208;liquid biofabrication is demonstrated for the generation of BNC&#8208;based macroscale architectures and compartmentalized soft matter. This can be accomplished following three different routes, namely, 3D under&#8208;liquid networking (multi&#8208;layer hydrogels/composites), emulsion templating (capsules, emulgels, porous materials), and anisotropic layering (Janus membranes). Overall, the proposed platform combines living matter and multi&#8208;phase systems as a robust option for material development with relevance in biomedicine, soft robotics, and bioremediation, among others.

The latter are investigated in terms of their morphological (fibril size and network density), structural (crystallinity) and physical&#8211;mechanical (surface area and strength) features. The introduced under-liquid biofabrication is demonstrated for the generation of BNC-based macroscale architectures and compartmentalized soft matter. This can be accomplished following three different routes, namely, 3D under-liquid networking (multi-layer hydrogels/composites), emulsion templating (capsules, emulgels, porous materials), and anisotropic layering (Janus membranes). Overall, the proposed platform combines living matter and multi-phase systems as a robust option for material development with relevance in biomedicine, soft robotics, and bioremediation, among others.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Knotted Artificial Muscles for Bio&#8208;Mimetic Actuation under Deepwater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of artificial muscles is proposed from intricately knotted liquid crystal elastomer fibers, capable of high stroke, and fast linear contractions. These muscles remain functional even when significantly damaged or submerged at depths of 3000 meters underwater, mirroring the remarkable robustness and adaptability of their natural counterparts.








Abstract
Muscles featuring high frequency and high stroke linear actuation are essential for animals to achieve superior maneuverability, agility, and environmental adaptability. Artificial muscles are yet to match their biological counterparts, due to inferior actuation speed, magnitude, mode, or adaptability. Inspired by the hierarchical structure of natural muscles, artificial muscles are created that are powerful, responsive, robust, and adaptable. The artificial muscles consist of knots braided from 3D printed liquid crystal elastomer fibers and thin heating threads. The unique hierarchical, braided knot structure offers amplified linear stroke, force rate, and damage&#8208;tolerance, as verified by both numerical simulations and experiments. In particular, the square knotted artificial muscle shows reliable cycles of actuation at 1Hz in 3000m depth underwater. Potential application is demonstrated by propelling a model boat. Looking ahead, the knotted artificial muscles can empower novel biomedical devices and soft robots to explore various environments, from inside human body to the mysterious deep&#160;sea.

         <title>An Encapsulation&#8208;Free and Hierarchical Porous Triboelectric Scaffold with Dynamic Hydrophilicity for Efficient Cartilage Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes the concept of triboelectric scaffolds (TESs). During degradation, the TESs exhibit hydrophilicity on the surface for tissue regeneration while hydrophobicity in interior micropores for triboelectric therapy. TESs provide a new platform technology for tissue engineering. The device design successfully addresses the challenge of encapsulation&#8208;free triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) in vivo and will broaden their applications.








Abstract
Tissue engineering and electrotherapy are two promising methods to promote tissue repair. However, their integration remains an underexplored area, because their requirements on devices are usually distinct. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have shown great potential to develop self&#8208;powered devices. However, due to their susceptibility to moisture, TENGs have to be encapsulated in vivo. Therefore, existing TENGs cannot be employed as tissue engineering scaffolds, which require direct interaction with surrounding cells. Here, the concept of triboelectric scaffolds (TESs) is proposed. Poly(glycerol sebacate), a biodegradable and relatively hydrophobic elastomer, is selected as the matrix of TESs. Each hydrophobic micropore in multi&#8208;hierarchical porous TESs efficiently serves as a moisture&#8208;resistant working unit of TENGs. Integration of tons of micropores ensures the electrotherapy ability of TESs in vivo without encapsulation. Originally hydrophobic TESs are degraded by surface erosion and transformed into hydrophilic surfaces, facilitating their role as tissue engineering scaffolds. Notably, TESs seeded with chondrocytes obtain dense and large matured cartilages after subcutaneous implantation in nude mice. Importantly, rabbits with osteochondral defects receiving TES implantation show favorable hyaline cartilage regeneration and complete cartilage healing. This work provides a promising electronic biomedical device and will inspire a series of new in vivo applications.

         <title>Disorder&#8208;Broadened Phase Boundary with Enhanced Amorphous Superconductivity in Pressurized In2Te5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
According to the Gibbs phase rule, the degree of freedom at conventional phase boundaries is 1 (F = 1). By introducing an intermediate amorphous phase, a rare crystalline&#8211;amorphous&#8211;crystalline transition is achieved and the sharp phase boundary is successfully expanded into a broad region (F = 2) in which the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is significantly enhanced.








Abstract
As an empirical tool in materials science and engineering, the iconic phase diagram owes its robustness and practicality to the topological characteristics rooted in the celebrated Gibbs phase law free variables (F) = components (C) &#8211; phases (P) + 2. When crossing the phase diagram boundary, the structure transition occurs abruptly, bringing about an instantaneous change in physical properties and limited controllability on the boundaries (F = 1). Here, the sharp phase boundary is expanded to an amorphous transition region (F = 2) by partially disrupting the long&#8208;range translational symmetry, leading to a sequential crystalline&#8211;amorphous&#8211;crystalline (CAC) transition in a pressurized In2Te5 single crystal. Through detailed in situ synchrotron diffraction, it is elucidated that the phase transition stems from the rotation of immobile blocks [In2Te2]2+, linked by hinge&#8208;like [Te3]2&#8722; trimers. Remarkably, within the amorphous region, the amorphous phase demonstrates a notable 25% increase of the superconducting transition temperature (Tc), while the carrier concentration remains relatively constant. Furthermore, a theoretical framework is proposed revealing that the unconventional boost in amorphous superconductivity might be attributed to an intensified electron correlation, triggered by a disorder&#8208;augmented multifractal behavior. These findings underscore the potential of disorder and prompt further exploration of unforeseen phenomena on the phase boundaries.

         <title>Synergizing Fe2O3 Nanoparticles on Single Atom Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C for Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia at Industrial Current Densities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>

Here, the effectiveness of a novel active particle&#8208;active support Fe2O3/Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst is demonstrated for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR). In situ X&#8208;ray absorption elucidates a reduction in surface Fe3+ to Fe0, during a pre&#8208;reduction activation step, significantly enhancing the NO3RR activity, enabling a partial current density up to 2 A cm&#8722;2 at near 100% efficiency.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of nitrates (NO3&#8722;) enables a pathway for the carbon neutral synthesis of ammonia (NH3), via the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), which has been demonstrated at high selectivity. However, to make NH3 synthesis cost&#8208;competitive with current technologies, high NH3 partial current densities (jNH3) must be achieved to reduce the levelized cost of NH3. Here, the high NO3RR activity of Fe&#8208;based materials is leveraged to synthesize a novel active particle&#8208;active support system with Fe2O3 nanoparticles supported on atomically dispersed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C. The optimized 3&#215;Fe2O3/Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst demonstrates an ultrahigh NO3RR activity, reaching a maximum jNH3 of 1.95 A cm&#8722;2 at a Faradaic efficiency (FE) for NH3 of 100% and an NH3 yield rate over 9 mmol hr&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. Operando XANES and post&#8208;mortem XPS reveal the importance of a pre&#8208;reduction activation step, reducing the surface Fe2O3 (Fe3+) to highly active Fe0 sites, which are maintained during electrolysis. Durability studies demonstrate the robustness of both the Fe2O3 particles and Fe&#8211;Nx sites at highly cathodic potentials, maintaining a current of &#8722;1.3 A cm&#8722;2 over 24 hours. This work exhibits an effective and durable active particle&#8208;active support system enhancing the performance of the NO3RR, enabling industrially relevant current densities and near 100% selectivity.

This work exhibits an effective and durable active particle-active support system enhancing the performance of the NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR, enabling industrially relevant current densities and near 100% selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Universal Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts by Direct Thermal Decomposition of Molten Salts for Boosting Acidic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of noble metal single atoms embedded in non&#8208;noble metal oxides are simply synthesized through the direct thermal decomposition of molten salts. The resultant single&#8208;atom catalysts exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic activity and durability for both of the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions in acidic media.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are considered prominent materials in the field of catalysis due to their high metal atom utilization and selectivity. However, the wide&#8208;ranging applications of SACs remain a significant challenge due to their complex preparation processes. Here, a universal strategy is reported to prepare a series of noble metal single atoms on different non&#8208;noble metal oxides through a facile one&#8208;step thermal decomposition of molten salts. By using a mixture of non&#8208;noble metal nitrate and a small&#8208;amount noble metal chloride as the precursor, noble metal single atoms can be easily introduced into the non&#8208;noble metal oxide lattice owing to the cation exchange in the in situ formed molten salt, followed by the thermal decomposition of nitrate anions during the heating process. Analyses using aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy confirm the formation of the finely dispersed single atoms. Specially, the as&#8208;synthesized Ir single atoms (10.97 wt%) and Pt single atoms (4.60 wt%) on the Co3O4 support demonstrate outstanding electrocatalytic activities for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Highly Stiff and Tough Shape Memory Polyurea with Unprecedented Energy Density by Precise Slight Cross&#8208;Linking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative approach utilizing a delicate balance of precise covalent bonds and hierarchical supramolecular interactions has resulted in an advanced shape memory polymer. This polymer boasts a unique combination of high stiffness, strength, and toughness, coupled with excellent resistance to humidity and heat, repairability, high energy density, and exceptional energy output, which allows for a wide range of potential applications.








Abstract
Shape memory polymers (SMPs) have attracted significant attention and hold vast potential for diverse applications. Nevertheless, conventional SMPs suffer from notable shortcomings in terms of mechanical properties, environmental stability, and energy density, significantly constraining their practical utility. Here, inspired by the structure of muscle fibers, an innovative approach that involves the precise incorporation of subtle, permanent cross&#8208;linking within a hierarchical hydrogen bonding supramolecular network is reported. This novel strategy has culminated in the development of covalent and supramolecular shape memory polyurea, which exhibits exceptional mechanical properties, including high stiffness (1347&#160;MPa), strength (82.4&#160;MPa), and toughness (312.7&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), ensuring its suitability for a wide range of applications. Furthermore, it boasts remarkable recyclability and repairability, along with excellent resistance to moisture, heat, and solvents. Moreover, the polymer demonstrates outstanding shape memory effects characterized by a high energy density (24.5&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), facilitated by the formation of strain&#8208;induced oriented nanostructures that can store substantial amounts of entropic energy. Simultaneously, it maintains a remarkable 96% shape fixity and 99% shape recovery. This delicate interplay of covalent and supramolecular bonds opens up a promising pathway to the creation of high&#8208;performance SMPs, expanding their applicability across various domains.

         <title>The Impact of Local Strain Fields in Noncollinear Antiferromagnetic Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The properties of noncollinear antiferromagnets are highly sensitive to strain, including large local strain fields generated by dislocations. The influence of these on the global magnetization and transport properties is examined, finding that they enhance the magnetization but are deleterious to intrinsic properties important for application. This analysis is timely as efforts are made to integrate these materials into multilayer devices.








Abstract
Antiferromagnets hosting structural or magnetic order that breaks time reversal symmetry are of increasing interest for &#8220;beyond von Neumann&#8221; computing applications because the topology of their band structure allows for intrinsic physical properties, exploitable in integrated memory and logic function. One such group are the noncollinear antiferromagnets. Essential for domain manipulation is the existence of small net moments found routinely when the material is synthesized in thin film form and attributed to symmetry breaking caused by spin canting, either from the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction or from strain. Although the spin arrangement of these materials makes them highly sensitive to strain, there is little understanding about the influence of local strain fields caused by lattice defects on global properties, such as magnetization and anomalous Hall effect. This premise is investigated by examining noncollinear antiferromagnetic films that are either highly lattice mismatched or closely matched to their substrate. In either case, edge dislocation networks are generated and for the former case, these extend throughout the entire film thickness, creating large local strain fields. These strain fields allow for finite intrinsic magnetization in seemingly structurally relaxed films and influence the antiferromagnetic domain state and the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect.

         <title>Tailored Fabrication of Full&#8208;Color Ultrastable Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Carbon Dots Composites with Unexpected Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Composites of carbon dots and urea that exhibit full&#8208;color, long&#8208;life, high&#8208;quantum yield, ultrastable, room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, along with thermosensitive delayed fluorescence, are developed, and these are applied to higher&#8208;level information encryption and in vivo imaging. The precise control of the singlet&#8211;triplet splitting of carbon dots through precursor engineering introduces a new method to realize smart dual&#8208;channel afterglow materials.








Abstract
The development of single&#8208;system materials that exhibit both multicolor room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with tunable after glow colors and channels is challenging. In this study, four metal&#8208;free carbon dots (CDs) are developed through structural tailoring, and panchromatic high&#8208;brightness RTP is achieved via strong chemical encapsulation in urea. The maximum lifetime and quantum yield reaches 2141 ms and 56.55%, respectively. Moreover, CDs&#8208;IV@urea, prepared via coreshell interaction engineering, exhibits a dual afterglow of red RTP and green TADF. The degree of conjugation and functional groups of precursors affects the binding interactions of the nitrogen cladding on CDs, which in turn stabilizes triplet energy levels and affects the energy gap between S1 and T1 (&#916;EST) to induce multicolor RTP. The enhanced wrapping interaction lowers the &#916;EST, promoting reverse intersystem crossing, which leads to phosphorescence and TADF. This strong coreshell interaction fully stabilizes the triplet state, thus stabilizing the material in water, even in extreme environments such as strong acids and oxidants. These afterglow materials are tested in multicolor, time, and temperature multiencryption as well as in multicolor in vivo bioimaging. Hence, these materials have promising practical applications in information security as well as biomedical diagnosis and treatment.

         <title>Thermal Radiation Annealing for Overcoming Processing Temperature Limitation of Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;thermal tolerance flexible perovskite solar cells with excellent mechanical stability are successfully achieved by a new thermal radiation annealing methodology, which aids in the vertical growth of perovskite grains, reduction of grain boundaries, and decrease of lattice mismatch. These microstructural improvements are essential in enhancing the performance of flexible perovskite photovoltaics.








Abstract
Common polymeric conductive electrodes, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) coated with indium tin oxide, face a major challenge due to their low processing&#8208;temperature limits, attributed to PET's low glass transition temperature (Tg) of (70&#8211;80&#160;&#176;C). This limitation significantly narrows the scope of material selection, limits the processing techniques applicable to the low Tg, and hinders the ripened technology transfer from glass substrates to them. Addressing the temperature constraints of the flexible substrates is impactful yet underexplored, with broader implications for fields beyond photovoltaics. Here, a new thermal radiation annealing methodology is introduced to address this issue. By applying the above Tg radiation annealing in conjunction with thermoelectric cooling, highly ordered molecular packing on PET substrates is successfully created, which is exclusively unachievable due to PET's low thermal tolerance. As a result, in the context of perovskite solar cells, this approach enables the circumvention of high&#8208;temperature annealing limitations of PET substrates, leading to a remarkable flexible device efficiency of 22.61% and a record fill factor of 83.42%. This approach proves especially advantageous for advancing the field of flexible optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Molten Guest&#8208;Mediated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Featuring Multi&#8208;Modal Supramolecular Interaction Sites for Flame&#8208;Retardant Superionic Conductor in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

A flame&#8208;retardant all&#8208;solid&#8208;state metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) superionic conductor is constructed, incorporating multiple supramolecular interactions through the embedding of molten polar crystalline organic electrolyte into the anionic nanochannels. The distinctive nanochannels exhibit selective acceleration of Li+ transport within various negative electrostatic chemical environments, concurrently suppressing movement of anions, enabling stable operation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state full cells under constrained conditions.








Abstract
The development of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with outstanding comprehensive performance is currently a critical challenge for achieving high energy density and safer solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs). In this study, a strategy of nano&#8208;confined in situ solidification is proposed to create a novel category of molten guest&#8208;mediated metal&#8211;organic frameworks, named MGM&#8211;MOFs. By embedding the newly developed molten crystalline organic electrolyte (ML20) into the nanocages of anionic MOF&#8211;OH, MGM&#8211;MOF&#8211;OH, characterized by multi&#8208;modal supramolecular interaction sites and continuous negative electrostatic environments within nano&#8208;channels, is achieved. These nanochannels promote ion transport through the successive hopping of Li+ between neighbored negative electrostatic environments and suppress anion movement through the chemical constraint of the hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized pore wall. This results in remarkable Li+ conductivity of 7.1 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 and high Li+ transference number of 0.81. Leveraging these advantages, the SSBs assembled with MGM&#8211;MOF&#8211;OH exhibit impressive cycle stability and a high specific energy density of 410.5&#160;Wh kganode + cathode + electrolyte&#8722;1 under constrained conditions and various working temperatures. Unlike flammable traditional MOFs, MGM&#8211;MOF&#8211;OH demonstrates high robustness under various harsh conditions, including ignition, high voltage, and extended to humidity.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly for Creating Vertically&#8208;Aligned Graphene Micro Helices with Monolayer Graphene as Chiral Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertically&#8208;aligned graphene helices are created through a dual&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly process, designed to generate optical chirality specifically in the terahertz (THz) range. The configuration of these vertical helices is predetermined and programmed prior to the assembly process. Once formed, the continuous monolayer graphene helices in this vertical alignment exhibit pronounced optical chirality, rendering them exceptionally suitable for applications within the THz spectrum.








Abstract
Graphene's emergence enables creating chiral metamaterials in helical shapes for terahertz (THz) applications, overcoming material limitations. However, practical implementation remains theoretical due to fabrication challenges. This paper introduces a dual&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly technique that enables creating vertically&#8208;aligned continuous monolayer graphene helices at microscale with great flexibility and high controllability. This assembly process not only facilitates the creation of 3D microstructures, but also positions the 3D structures from a horizontal to a vertical orientation, achieving an aspect ratio (height/width) of &#8776;2700. As a result, an array of vertically&#8208;aligned graphene helices is formed, reaching up to 4&#160;mm in height, which is equivalent to 4 million times the height of monolayer graphene. The benefit of these 3D chiral structures made from graphene is their capability to infinitely extend in height, interacting with light in ways that are not possible with traditional 2D layering methods. Such an impressive height elevates a level of interaction with light that far surpasses what is achievable with traditional 2D layering methods, resulting in a notable enhancement of optical chirality properties. This approach is applicable to various 2D materials, promising advancements in innovative research and diverse applications across fields.

         <title>Rapid Selenoprotein Activation by Selenium Nanoparticles to Suppresses Osteoclastogenesis and Pathological Bone Loss</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the prompt activation of selenoproteins by lentinan&#8208;functionalized selenium nanoparticles to suppress osteoclastogenesis and pathological bone loss through upregulating GPx1 to repolarize macrophages. Moreover, the utilization of bioactive selenium species presents a promising avenue for effectively managing bone disorders, with considerable potential for clinical translation.








Abstract
Osteoclast hyperactivation stands as a significant pathological factor contributing to the emergence of bone disorders driven by heightened oxidative stress levels. The modulation of the redox balance to scavenge reactive oxygen species emerges as a viable approach to addressing this concern. Selenoproteins, characterized by selenocysteine (SeCys2) as the active center, are crucial for selenium&#8208;based antioxidative stress therapy for inflammatory diseases. This study reveals that surface&#8208;active elemental selenium (Se) nanoparticles, particularly lentinan&#8208;Se (LNT&#8208;Se), exhibit enhanced cellular accumulation and accelerated metabolism to SeCys2, the primary active Se form in biological systems. Consequently, LNT&#8208;Se demonstrates significant inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, in vivo studies underscore the superior therapeutic efficacy of LNT&#8208;Se over SeCys2, potentially attributable to the enhanced stability and safety profile of LNT&#8208;Se. Specifically, LNT&#8208;Se effectively modulates the expression of the selenoprotein GPx1, thereby exerting regulatory control over osteoclastogenesis inhibition, and the prevention of osteolysis. In summary, these results suggest that the prompt activation of selenoproteins by Se nanoparticles serves to suppress osteoclastogenesis and pathological bone loss by upregulating GPx1. Moreover, the utilization of bioactive Se species presents a promising avenue for effectively managing bone disorders.

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of Ionic&#8208;Conductive Covalent Organic Framework Fibers for Capturing of Sustainable Osmotic Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D covalent organic framework (COF) fibers obtained by processing of COF dispersions using a wet spinning technique: Dispersions of 2D COFs are continuously processed into flexible solid fibers on a large scale using a wet spinning approach. These COF fibers with excellent tensile properties exhibit good performance for the capture of osmotic energy as ionic conductors.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance covalent organic framework (COF) fibers are demanded for an efficient capturing of blue osmotic power because of their excellent durability, simple integration, and large scalability. However, the scalable production of COF fibers is still very challenging due to the poor solubility and fragile structure of COFs. Herein, for the first time, it is reported that COF dispersions can be continuously processed into macroscopic, meter&#8208;long, and pure COF fibers using a wet spinning approach. The two presented COF fibers can be directly used for capturing of osmotic energy, avoiding the production of composite materials that require other additives and face challenges such as phase separation and environmental issues induced by the additives. A COF fiber exhibits power densities of 70.2 and 185.3 W m&#8722;2 at 50&#8208;fold and 500&#8208;fold salt gradients, respectively. These values outperform those of most reported systems, which indicate the high potential of COF fibers for capturing of blue osmotic energy.

&lt;p&gt;1D covalent organic framework (COF) fibers obtained by processing of COF dispersions using a wet spinning technique: Dispersions of 2D COFs are continuously processed into flexible solid fibers on a large scale using a wet spinning approach. These COF fibers with excellent tensile properties exhibit good performance for the capture of osmotic energy as ionic conductors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-performance covalent organic framework (COF) fibers are demanded for an efficient capturing of blue osmotic power because of their excellent durability, simple integration, and large scalability. However, the scalable production of COF fibers is still very challenging due to the poor solubility and fragile structure of COFs. Herein, for the first time, it is reported that COF dispersions can be continuously processed into macroscopic, meter-long, and pure COF fibers using a wet spinning approach. The two presented COF fibers can be directly used for capturing of osmotic energy, avoiding the production of composite materials that require other additives and face challenges such as phase separation and environmental issues induced by the additives. A COF fiber exhibits power densities of 70.2 and 185.3 W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 50-fold and 500-fold salt gradients, respectively. These values outperform those of most reported systems, which indicate the high potential of COF fibers for capturing of blue osmotic energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Annual Energy&#8208;Saving Smart Windows with Actively Controllable Passive Radiative Cooling and Multimode Heating Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This smart window not only achieves multistage passive radiative cooling (PRC) efficiency in hot climates but also possesses the capability to deal with complicated heating scenarios due to the combination of triple heating modes including passive radiative heating (PRH), solar heating (SH), and electric heating (EH), which provides a feasible way for on&#8208;demand thermal management and reducing year&#8208;round heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) energy loads.








Abstract
Smart windows with radiative heat management capability using the sun and outer space as zero&#8208;energy thermodynamic resources have gained prominence, demonstrating a minimum carbon footprint. However, realizing on&#8208;demand thermal management throughout all seasons while reducing fossil energy consumption remains a formidable challenge. Herein, an energy&#8208;efficient smart window that enables actively tunable passive radiative cooling (PRC) and multimode heating regulation is demonstrated by integrating the emission&#8208;enhanced polymer&#8208;dispersed liquid crystal (SiO2@PRC PDLC) film and a low&#8208;emission layer deposited with carbon nanotubes. Specifically, this device can achieve a temperature close to the chamber interior ambient under solar irradiance of 700&#160;W m&#8722;2, as well as a temperature drop of 2.3&#160;&#176;C at sunlight of 500&#160;W m&#8722;2, whose multistage PRC efficiency can be rapidly adjusted by a moderate voltage. Meanwhile, synchronous cooperation of passive radiative heating (PRH), solar heating (SH), and electric heating (EH) endows this smart window with the capability to handle complicated heating situations during cold weather. Energy simulation reveals the substantial superiority of this device in energy savings compared with single&#8208;layer SiO2@PRC PDLC, normal glass, and commercial low&#8208;E glass when applied in different climate zones. This work provides a feasible pathway for year&#8208;round thermal management, presenting a huge potential in energy&#8208;saving applications.

         <title>Tuneable Current Rectification Through a Designer Graphene Nanoribbon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of substitutional boron dopants inside a semiconducting graphene nanoribbon localizes a positive&#8208;ion resonance within its bandgap, creating a double&#8208;barrier resonant electronic device. Electric transport through this single&#8208;molecule device suspended between tip and sample of a scanning tunneling microscope reveals unipolar resonant hole tunneling and a peculiar diode effect that can be tuned and reversed with tip&#8208;sample distance.








Abstract
Unimolecular current rectifiers are fundamental building blocks in organic electronics. Rectifying behavior has been identified in numerous organic systems due to electron&#8208;hole asymmetries of orbital levels interfaced by a metal electrode. As a consequence, the rectifying ratio (RR) determining the diode efficiency remains fixed for a chosen molecule&#8208;metal interface. Here, a mechanically tunable molecular diode exhibiting an exceptionally large rectification ratio (&gt;105) and reversible direction is presented. The molecular system comprises a seven&#8208;armchair graphene nanoribbon (GNR) doped with a single unit of substitutional diboron within its structure, synthesized with atomic precision on a gold substrate by on&#8208;surface synthesis. The diboron unit creates half&#8208;populated in&#8208;gap bound states and splits the GNR frontier bands into two segments, localizing the bound state in a double barrier configuration. By suspending these GNRs freely between the tip of a low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscope and the substrate, unipolar hole transport is demonstrated through the boron in&#8208;gap state's resonance. Strong current rectification is observed, associated with the varying widths of the two barriers, which can be tuned by altering the distance between tip and substrate. This study introduces an innovative approach for the precise manipulation of molecular electronic functionalities, opening new avenues for advanced applications in organic&#160;electronics.

         <title>Design of Excellent Mechanical Performances and Magnetic Refrigeration via In Situ Forming Dual&#8208;Phase Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal and straightforward method for preparing high&#8208;performance magnetocaloric effect (MCE) materials is proposed in this study. By employing a direct melting approach, the magnetocaloric phase precipitates within MCE intermetallic compounds. The prepared dual&#8208;phase alloy achieves a commendable equilibrium between refrigeration capacity and mechanical properties. This strategy holds significant promise for the large&#8208;scale production of magnetic refrigeration materials.








Abstract
Magnetic refrigeration technology can achieve higher energy efficiency based on the magnetocaloric effect (MCE). However, the practical application of MCE materials is hindered by their poor mechanical properties, making them challenging to process into devices. Conventional strengthening strategies usually lead to a trade&#8208;off with refrigeration capacity reduction. Here, a novel design is presented to overcome this dilemma by forming dual&#8208;phase alloys through in situ precipitation of a tough magnetic refrigeration phase within an intermetallic compound with excellent MCE. In the alloy 87.5Gd&#8211;12.5Co, incorporating the interconnected tough phase Gd contributes to enhanced strength (&#8776;505&#160;MPa) with good ductility (&#8776;9.2%). The strengthening phase Gd simultaneously exhibits excellent MCE, enabling the alloy to achieve a peak refrigeration capacity of 720 J kg&#8722;1. Moreover, the alloy shows low thermal expansion induced by the synergistic effect of the two phases. It is beneficial for maintaining structural stability during heat exchange in magnetic refrigeration. The coupling interaction between the two magnetic phases can broaden the refrigeration temperature range and reduce hysteresis. This study guides the development of new high&#8208;performance materials with an excellent combination of mechanical and magnetic refrigeration properties as needed for gas liquefaction and refrigerators.

         <title>Two&#8208;Terminal Perovskite Optoelectronic Synapse for Rapid Trained Neuromorphic Computation with High Accuracy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the synergistic effect between ion migration barrier (Ea) and readout voltage (Vread), a stable, reconfigurable, and precisely controllable postsynaptic current is achieved in a dual&#8208;terminal perovskite synapse. The gradual ion accumulation during the training process induces photocurrent evolution, serving as a reference for the dynamic learning rate and boosting accuracy to 97.8% in just 10 epochs.








Abstract
Emerging neural morphological vision sensors inspired by biological systems that integrate image perception, memory, and information computing are expected to transform the landscape of machine vision and artificial intelligence. However, stable and reconfigurable light&#8208;induced synaptic behavior always relies on independent gateport modulation. Despite its potential, the limitations of uncontrollable defects and ionic characteristics have led to simpler, smaller, and more integration&#8208;friendly two&#8208;terminal devices being used as sidelines. In this work, the synergy between ion migration barriers and readout voltage is proven to be the key to realizing stable, reconfigurable, and precisely controllable postsynaptic current in two&#8208;terminal devices. Following the same mechanism, optical and electrical signal synchronous triggering is proposed to serve as a preprocessing method to achieve a recognition accuracy of 96.5%. Impressively, the gradual ion accumulation during the training process induces photocurrent evolution, serving as a reference for the dynamic learning rate and boosting accuracy to 97.8% in just 10 epochs. The PSC modulation potential under short optical pulse of 20 ns is also revealed. This optoelectronic device with perception, memory, and computation capabilities can promote the development of new devices for future photonic neural morphological circuits and artificial vision.

         <title>Toughening Hydrogels with Fibrillar Connected Double Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tough hydrogels with low plastic deformations based on fibrillar connected double networks (fc&#8208;DN) are presented. The efficient transfer of stress between the polyacrylamide and agarose fibril networks via chemical crosslinks and better fibril alignment under stretch result in high fracture strength and toughness (55 MJ m&#8722;3). The fc&#8208;DN provides a new toughening strategy and application potential for load&#8208;bearing soft devices.








Abstract
Biological tissues, such as tendons or cartilage, possess high strength and toughness with very low plastic deformations. In contrast, current strategies to prepare tough hydrogels commonly utilize energy dissipation mechanisms based on physical bonds that lead to irreversible large plastic deformations, thus limiting their load&#8208;bearing applications. This article reports a strategy to toughen hydrogels using fibrillar connected double networks (fc&#8208;DN), which consist of two distinct but chemically interconnected polymer networks, that is, a polyacrylamide network and an acrylated agarose fibril network. The fc&#8208;DN design allows efficient stress transfer between the two networks and high fibril alignment during deformation, both contributing to high strength and toughness, while the chemical crosslinking ensures low plastic deformations after undergoing high strains. The mechanical properties of the fc&#8208;DN network can be readily tuned to reach an ultimate tensile strength of 8 MPa and a toughness of above 55 MJ m&#8722;3, which is 3 and 3.5 times more than that of fibrillar double network hydrogels without chemical connections, respectively. The application potential of the fc&#8208;DN hydrogel is demonstrated as load&#8208;bearing damping material for a jointed robotic lander. The fc&#8208;DN design provides a new toughening mechanism for hydrogels that can be used for soft robotics or bioelectronic applications.

         <title>Boosting External Quantum Efficiency of Blue Perovskite QLEDs Exceeding 23% by Trifluoroacetate Passivation and Mixed Hole Transportation Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blue perovskite quantum dot&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diode (QLED) with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.5% at 490 nm is achieved through a combination of quantum dot (QD) passivated by trifluoroacetate and optimal device design through a mixed hole&#8208;transport layer. The work breaks through the EQE gap of 20% for blue perovskite&#8208;based QLEDs and significantly promotes their commercialization process.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dot&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) have been considered a promising display technology due to their wide color gamut for authentic color expression. Currently, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art blue perovskite QLEDs is about 15%, which still lags behind its green and red counterparts (&gt;25%) and blue film&#8208;based LEDs. Here, blue perovskite QLEDs that achieve an EQE of 23.5% at 490&#160;nm is presented, to the best knowledge, which is the highest value reported among blue perovskite&#8208;based LED fields. This impressive efficiency is achieved through a combination of quantum dot (QD) passivation and optimal device design. First, blue mixed halide perovskite CsPbCl3&#8722;xBrx QDs passivated by trifluoroacetate exhibit excellent exciton recombination behavior with a photoluminescence quantum yield of 84% due to reducing uncoordinated Pb surface defects. Furthermore, the device is designed by introducing a mixed hole&#8208;transport layer (M&#8208;HTL) to increase hole injection and transportation capacity and improve carrier balance. It is further found that M&#8208;HTL can decrease carrier leakage and increase radiative recombination in the device, evidenced by the visual electroluminescence spectrum at 2.0&#160;V. The work breaks through the EQE gap of 20% for blue perovskite&#8208;based QLEDs and significantly promotes their commercialization process.

         <title>Heterogeneous Nucleating Agent for High&#8208;Boiling&#8208;Point Nonhalogenated Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heterogeneous nucleating agent (BTO&#8208;BO) is developed to suppress the excessive aggregation of L8&#8208;BO in high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point nonhalogenated solvents processing, achieving the active layer with high crystallinity and nano&#8208;scaled phase separation morphology. The resultant OSCs achieve record power conversion efficiencies of 19.42% (0.062&#8208;cm2) and 16.35% (15. 03&#8208;cm2) with excellent operational stabilities.








Abstract
High&#8208;boiling&#8208;point nonhalogenated solvents are superior solvents to produce large&#8208;area organic solar cells (OSCs) in industry because of their wide processing window and low toxicity; while, these solvents with slow evaporation kinetics will lead excessive aggregation of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art small molecule acceptors (e.g. L8&#8208;BO), delivering serious efficiency losses. Here, a heterogeneous nucleating agent strategy is developed by grafting oligo (ethylene glycol) side&#8208;chains on L8&#8208;BO (BTO&#8208;BO). The formation energy of the obtained BTO&#8208;BO; while, changing from liquid in a solvent to a crystalline phase, is lower than that of L8&#8208;BO irrespective of the solvent type. When BTO&#8208;BO is added as the third component into the active layer (e.g. PM6:L8&#8208;BO), it easily assembles to form numerous seed crystals, which serve as nucleation sites to trigger heterogeneous nucleation and increase nucleation density of L8&#8208;BO through strong hydrogen bonding interactions even in high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point nonhalogenated solvents. Therefore, it can effectively suppress excessive aggregation during growth, achieving ideal phase&#8208;separation active layer with small domain sizes and high crystallinity. The resultant toluene&#8208;processed OSCs exhibit a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.42% (certificated 19.12%) with excellent operational stability. The strategy also has superior advantages in large&#8208;scale devices, showing a 15.03&#8208;cm2 module with a record PCE of 16.35% (certificated 15.97%).

         <title>Precise Capture and Dynamic Release of Circulating Liver Cancer Cells with Dual&#8208;Histidine&#8208;Based Cell Imprinted Hydrogels</title>

         <dc:description>
Targeting the sialylated glycans present on circulating tumor cells&#8217; (CTCs) surface, an ultrastrong affinity ligand His&#8208;His is designed and integrated into a cell&#8208;imprinting copolymer based on polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate. Precise size matching, specific interactions, and satisfactory biocompatibility endow the material with excellent capabilities for precise capture of CTCs and intact release, significantly facilitating liver cancer early diagnosis and single&#8208;cell multiproteomics analysis.








Abstract
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) detection presents significant advantages in diagnosing liver cancer due to its noninvasiveness, real&#8208;time monitoring, and dynamic tracking. However, the clinical application of CTCs&#8208;based diagnosis is largely limited by the challenges of capturing low&#8208;abundance CTCs within a complex blood environment while ensuring them alive. Here, an ultrastrong ligand, l&#8208;histidine&#8211;l&#8208;histidine (HH), specifically targeting sialylated glycans on the surface of CTCs, is designed. Furthermore, HH is integrated into a cell&#8208;imprinted polymer, constructing a hydrogel with precise CTCs imprinting, high elasticity, satisfactory blood compatibility, and robust anti&#8208;interference capacities. These features endow the hydrogel with excellent capture efficiency (&gt;95%) for CTCs in peripheral blood, as well as the ability to release CTCs controllably and alive. Clinical tests substantiate the accurate differentiation between liver cancer, cirrhosis, and healthy groups using this method. The remarkable diagnostic accuracy (94%), lossless release of CTCs, material reversibility, and cost&#8208;effectiveness ($6.68 per sample) make the HH&#8208;based hydrogel a potentially revolutionary technology for liver cancer diagnosis and single&#8208;cell analysis.

         <title>Li Promoting Long Afterglow Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistor for Memory Optocoupler Module</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low power consumption long afterglow organic light&#8208;emitting transistors are fabricated to simultaneously accomplish the functions of in&#8208;memory calculation, light&#8208;emission, and decision&#8208;making process. When combined with optically switchable transistors and photodiode amplifiers, the biological neurotransmitter transfer and biological firing action after spiking excess threshold are mimicked in the chip.








Abstract
The artificial brain is conceived as advanced intelligence technology, capable to emulate in&#8208;memory processes occurring in the human brain by integrating synaptic devices. Within this context, improving the functionality of synaptic transistors to increase information processing density in neuromorphic chips is a major challenge in this field. In this article, Li&#8208;ion migration promoting long afterglow organic light&#8208;emitting transistors, which display exceptional postsynaptic brightness of 7000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 under low operational voltages of 10&#160;V is presented. The postsynaptic current of 0.1&#160;mA operating as a built&#8208;in threshold switch is implemented as a firing point in these devices. The setting&#8208;condition&#8208;triggered long afterglow is employed to drive the photoisomerization process of photochromic molecules that mimic neurotransmitter transfer in the human brain for realizing a key memory rule, that is, the transition from long&#8208;term memory to permanent memory. The combination of setting&#8208;condition&#8208;triggered long afterglow with photodiode amplifiers is also processed to emulate the human responding action after the setting&#8208;training process. Overall, the successful integration in neuromorphic computing comprising stimulus judgment, photon emission, transition, and encoding, &#160;to emulate the complicated decision tree of the human brain is demonstrated.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable Organic Photovoltaic Cells for Underwater Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acceptor is designed and named ITO&#8208;4Cl and provides a comprehensive evaluation of its photovoltaic performance, stability, and pressure resistance when incorporated into organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Particularly, the OPV cells exhibit a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 25.6% at a depth of 1&#160;m underwater, confirming the promising prospects of OPV cells for underwater applications.








Abstract
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology holds tremendous promise as a sustainable power source for underwater off&#8208;grid systems. However, research on underwater OPV cells is relatively scarce. Here, this gap is addressed by focusing on the exploration and development of OPV cells specifically designed for underwater applications. An acceptor, named ITO&#8208;4Cl, with excellent water resistance, is rationally designed and synthesized. Benefiting from its low energetic disorder and an absorption spectrum well&#8208;suited to the underwater environment, the ITO&#8208;4Cl&#8208;based OPV cell achieves an unprecedented power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 25.6% at a water depth of 1&#160;m. Additionally, under 660&#160;nm laser irradiation, the cell demonstrates a notable PCE of 31.6%, indicating its potential for underwater wireless energy transfer. Due to the mitigation of thermal effects from solar irradiation, the lifetime of the ITO&#8208;4Cl&#8208;based OPV cell exceeds 7000&#160;h. Additionally, a flexible OPV cell is fabricated that maintains its initial PCE even under exposure to high pressures of 5&#160;MPa. A 32.5&#160;cm2 flexible module achieves an excellent PCE of 17%. This work fosters a deeper understanding of underwater OPV cells and highlights the promising prospects of OPV cells for underwater applications.

         <title>Immunogenic Material Vaccine for Cancer Immunotherapy by Structure&#8208;Dependent Immune Cell Trafficking and Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immunogenic material vaccines offer enormous prospects in treating cancer. Here we&#160;report how the structure of materials containing immunopotentiator manganese impacts the dynamic coordination of innate and adaptive immune response. The outperformed rod&#8208;shaped hollow manganese material with an aspect ratio of 4.5 demonstrates the highest competence in immune cell modulation and cellular immunity against cancer in multiple aggressive tumor models.








Abstract
Inherently immunogenic materials offer enormous prospects in enhancing vaccine efficacy. However, the understanding and improving material adjuvanticity remain elusive. Herein how the structural presentation of immunopotentiators in a material governs the dynamic dialogue between innate and adaptive immunity for enhanced cancer vaccination is reported. The immunopotentiator manganese into six differing structures that resemble the architectures of two types of pathogens (spherical viruses or rod&#8208;like bacteria) is precisely manipulated. The results reveal that innate immune cells accurately sense and respond to the architectures, of which two outperformed material candidates (151&#160;nm hollow spheres and hollow microrods with an aspect ratio of 4.5) show higher competence in creating local proinflammatory environment with promoted innate immune cell influx and stimulation on dendritic cells (DCs). In combination with viral peptides, model proteins, or cell lysate antigens, the outperformed microrod material remarkably primes antigen&#8208;specific CD8 cytolytic T cells. In prophylactic and therapeutic regimens, the microrod adjuvanted vaccines display optimal aptitude in tumor suppression in four aggressive murine tumor models, by promoting the infiltration of heterogeneous cytolytic effector cells while decreasing suppressive immunoregulatory populations in tumors. This study demonstrates that a rationally selected architecture of immunogenic materials potentially advances the clinical reality of cancer vaccination.

         <title>Chlorination Design for Highly Stable Electrolyte toward High Mass Loading and Long Cycle Life Sodium&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorination design strategy is proposed for sodium&#8208;based dual ion batteries, and as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the chlorinated electrolyte based on chloromethyl ethyl carbonate displays notably enhanced oxidative stability and highly reversible anion intercalation into the graphite cathode; meanwhile, the uniform and efficient plating/stripping of Na+ ions on the anode is also achieved.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;based dual ion batteries (SDIBs) have garnered significant attention as novel energy storage devices offering the advantages of high&#8208;voltage and low&#8208;cost. Nonetheless, conventional electrolytes exhibit low resistance to oxidation and poor compatibility with electrode materials, resulting in rapid battery failure. In this study, for the first time, a chlorination design of electrolytes for SDIB, is proposed. Using ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) as a representative, chlorine (Cl)&#8208;substituted EMC not only demonstrates increased oxidative stability ascribed to the electron&#8208;withdrawing characteristics of chlorine atom, electrolyte compatibility with both the cathode and anode is also greatly improved by forming Cl&#8208;containing interface layers. Consequently, a discharge capacity of 104.6 mAh g&#8722;1 within a voltage range of 3.0&#8211;5.0&#160;V is achieved for Na||graphite SDIB that employs a high graphite cathode mass loading of 5.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, along with almost no capacity decay after 900 cycles. Notably, the Na||graphite SDIB can be revived for an additional 900 cycles through the replacement of a fresh Na anode. As the mass loading of graphite cathode increased to 10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, Na||graphite SDIB is still capable of sustaining over 700 times with &#8776;100% capacity retention. These results mark the best outcome among reported SDIBs. This study corroborates the effectiveness of chlorination design in developing high&#8208;voltage electrolytes and attaining enduring cycle stability of Na&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>Enzymatic Mesoporous Metal Nanocavities for Concurrent Electrocatalysis of Nitrate to Ammonia Coupled with Polyethylene Terephthalate Upcycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic PdCu mesoporous nanocavities (MCs) are reported as an enzymatic bifunctional electrocatalyst for concurrent electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added NH3 and glycolic acid from waste pollutants (NO3&#8722; and polyethylene&#8208;terephthalate&#8208;derived alcohol). Thanks to structural synergies, the performance of PdCu MC nanozymes outperforms the most of the&#8208;state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Electrochemical upcycling of waste pollutants into high value&#8208;added fuels and/or chemicals is recognized as a green and sustainable solution that can address the resource utilization on earth. Despite great efforts, their progress has seriously been hindered by the lack of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. In this work, bimetallic PdCu mesoporous nanocavities (MCs) are reported as a new bifunctional enzymatic electrocatalyst that realizes concurrent electrocatalytic upcycling of nitrate wastewater and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste. Abundant metal mesopores and open nanocavities of PdCu MCs provide the enzymatic confinement of key intermediates for the deeper electroreduction of nitrate and accelerate the transport of reactants/products within/out of electrocatalyst, thus affording high ammonia Faradic efficiency (FENH3) of 96.6% and yield rate of 5.6&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;mg&#8722;1 at the cathode. Meanwhile, PdCu MC nanozymes trigger the selective electrooxidation of PET&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) into glycolic acid (GA) and formic acid with high FEs of &gt;90% by a facile regulation of potentials at the anode.

&lt;p&gt;Bimetallic PdCu mesoporous nanocavities (MCs) are reported as an enzymatic bifunctional electrocatalyst for concurrent electrosynthesis of value-added NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and glycolic acid from waste pollutants (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and polyethylene-terephthalate-derived alcohol). Thanks to structural synergies, the performance of PdCu MC nanozymes outperforms the most of the-state-of-the-art electrocatalysts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical upcycling of waste pollutants into high value-added fuels and/or chemicals is recognized as a green and sustainable solution that can address the resource utilization on earth. Despite great efforts, their progress has seriously been hindered by the lack of high-performance electrocatalysts. In this work, bimetallic PdCu mesoporous nanocavities (MCs) are reported as a new bifunctional enzymatic electrocatalyst that realizes concurrent electrocatalytic upcycling of nitrate wastewater and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste. Abundant metal mesopores and open nanocavities of PdCu MCs provide the enzymatic confinement of key intermediates for the deeper electroreduction of nitrate and accelerate the transport of reactants/products within/out of electrocatalyst, thus affording high ammonia Faradic efficiency (FE&lt;sub&gt;NH3&lt;/sub&gt;) of 96.6% and yield rate of 5.6&#160;mg&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at the cathode. Meanwhile, PdCu MC nanozymes trigger the selective electrooxidation of PET-derived ethylene glycol (EG) into glycolic acid (GA) and formic acid with high FEs of &amp;gt;90% by a facile regulation of potentials at the anode. Moreover, concurrent electrosynthesis of value-added NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and GA is disclosed in the two-electrode coupling system, further confirming the high efficiency of bifunctional PdCu MC nanozymes in producing value-added fuels and chemicals from waste pollutants in a sustainable manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Noncontact Microfluidics of Highly Viscous Liquids for Accurate Self&#8208;Splitting and Pipetting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the highly transparent PS platform, the liquids with viscosity as high as 15&#160;000&#160;mPa s (epoxy) can be noncontact split with the assistance of sunlight and a cooling source. Compared with commercial pipettes or droppers (&#8776;1.3% accuracy for pipetting polymer liquids), this accurate PS platform (&gt;83.5%) shows great potential in the quantification of highly viscous liquids.








Abstract
Accurate dosing for various liquids, especially for highly viscous liquids, is fundamental in wide&#8208;ranging from molecular crosslinking to material processing. Despite droppers or pipettes being widely used as pipetting devices, they are powerless for quantificationally splitting and dosing highly viscous liquids (&gt;100&#160;mPa s) like polymer liquids due to the intertwined macromolecular chains and strong cohesion energy. Here, a highly transparent photopyroelectric slippery (PS) platform is provided to achieve noncontact self&#8208;splitting for liquids with viscosity as high as 15&#160;000&#160;mPa s, just with the assistance of sunlight and a cooling source to provide a local temperature difference (&#916;T). Moreover, to guarantee the accuracy for pipetting liquids (&gt;80%), the ultrathin MXene film (within a thickness of 20&#160;nm) is self&#8208;assembled as the photo&#8208;thermal layers, overcoming the trade&#8208;off between transparency and photothermal property. Compared with traditional pipetting strategies (&#8776;1.3% accuracy for pipetting polymer liquids), this accurate microfluidic chip shows great potential in adhesive systems (bonding strength, twice than using the droppers or pipettes).

         <title>Anchored Cobalt Nanoparticles on Layered Perovskites for Rapid Peroxymonosulfate Activation in Antibiotic Degradation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for perovskite oxide catalysts is proposed to address two limiting factors in the development of advanced oxidation process (AOPs): the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and the cycling stability of metal catalysts. The comprehensive performance of the catalysts is tested to highlight the technical potential of the PMS heterogeneous reaction&#8208;activated in situ exsolved strategy.








Abstract
In the Fenton&#8208;like reaction, revealing the dynamic evolution of the active sites is crucial to achieve the activity improvement and stability of the catalyst. This study reports a perovskite oxide in which atomic (Co0) in situ embedded exsolution occurs during the high&#8208;temperature phase transition. This unique anchoring strategy significantly improves the Co3+/Co2+ cycling efficiency at the interface and inhibits metal leaching during peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. The Co@L&#8208;PBMC catalyst exhibits superior PMS activation ability and could achieve 99% degradation of tetracycline within 5&#160;min. The combination of experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidates that the electron&#8208;deficient oxygen vacancy accepts an electron from the Co 3d&#8208;orbital, resulting in a significant electron delocalization of the Co site, thereby facilitating the adsorption of the *HSO5/*OH intermediate onto the &#8220;metal&#8208;VO bridge&#8221; structure. This work provides insights into the PMS activation mechanism at the atomic level, which will guide the rational design of next&#8208;generation catalysts for environmental remediation.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Tuned Main&#8208;Group Sb&#8722;N&#8722;C Catalysts for Selective 2&#8208;Electron and 4&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of main&#8208;group Sb&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalysts are developed with varied oxidation states of the Sb sites via changing the contents of sulfur dopants, resulting in tunable ORR selectivity toward either the 4&#8208;electron or 2&#8208;electron pathway.








Abstract
The selective oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is important for various energy conversion processes such as the fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries for the 4e&#8722; pathway and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis for the 2e&#8722; pathway. However, it remains a challenge to tune the ORR selectivity of a catalyst in a controllable manner. Herein, an efficient strategy for introducing sulfur dopants to regulate the ORR selectivity of main&#8208;group Sb&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalysts&#160; is reported. Significantly, Sb&#8722;N&#8722;C with the highest sulfur content follows a 2e&#8722; pathway with high H2O2 selectivity (96.8%) and remarkable mass activity (96.1 A g&#8722;1 at 0.65&#160;V), while the sister catalyst with the lowest sulfur content directs a 4e&#8722; pathway with a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2 = 0.89&#160;V) that is more positive than commercial Pt/C. In addition, practical applications for these two 2e&#8722;/4e&#8722; ORR catalysts are demonstrated by bulk H2O2 electrosynthesis for the degradation of organic pollutants and a high&#8208;power zinc&#8208;air battery, respectively. Combined experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the excellent selectivity for the sulfurized Sb&#8722;N&#8722;Cs is attributed to the optimal adsorption&#8208;desorption of the ORR intermediates realized through the electronic structure modulation by the sulfur dopants.

         <title>Thermal Welding of Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep understanding of the assembly behavior of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) that are generated in situ at the oil&#8211;water interface through host&#8211;guest interactions is presented. Taking advantage of the temperature responsiveness of NPSs, thermal&#8208;controlled cargo release and welding of liquids can be achieved, opening a pathway to the construction of modular all&#8208;liquid fluidics.








Abstract
Welding of thermoplastics is a common practice in many industrial sectors, but it has yet to be realized with fluids. Here, the thermal welding of liquids by using the assembly and jamming of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces is reported. By fine&#8208;tuning the dynamic interaction strength within NPSs, the interfacial activity of NPSs, as well as the binding energy of NPSs to the interface can be precisely controlled, leading to a dynamic exchange of NPSs, maximizing the reduction in the interfacial energy. With NPSs jammed at the interface, the structures of liquids can be manipulated to complex geometries by applying an external force and, due to the temperature responsiveness of NPSs, when bringing liquids into contact and heating the system, welding of liquids can be achieved. This work provides a straightforward strategy for the construction of modular all&#8208;liquid fluidics, opening up numerous opportunities in fields like biotechnology, healthcare, and materials science.

         <title>Universal Design Strategy for Air&#8208;Stable Layered Na&#8208;Ion Cathodes toward Sustainable Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbon footprint of Na&#8208;ion batteries is significantly increased due to the air stability issue of layered cathodes. In this paper, the air degradation origins and mechanisms of O3 cathodes are investigated via combined first&#8208;principles and experimental approaches, and a universal design strategy is proposed for the rational design of air&#8208;stable Na&#8208;ion cathodes toward both elemental and manufactural sustainability.








Abstract
Na&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs) are sustainable alternatives to Li&#8208;ion technologies due to the abundant and widely&#8208;distributed resources. However, the most promising cathode materials of NIBs so far, O3 layered oxides, suffer from serious air instability issues, which significantly increases the manufactural cost and carbon footprint because of the long&#8208;term use of dry rooms. While some feasible strategies are proposed via case studies, universal design strategies for air&#8208;stable cathodes are yet to be established. Herein, the air degradation mechanisms of O3 cathodes are investigated via combined first&#8208;principles and experimental approaches, with bond dissociation energy proposed as an effective descriptor for predicting air stability. Experimental validations in various unary, binary, and ternary O3 cathodes confirm that the air stability can indeed be effectively improved via simple compositional design. Guided by the predictive model, the designed material can sustain 30&#8208;day air&#8208;storage without structural or electrochemical degradation. It is calculated that such air&#8208;stable cathodes can significantly reduce both energy consumption (&#8776;4&#8201;100&#8201;000&#160;kWh) and carbon footprint (&#8776;2200&#8208;ton CO2) annually for a 2 GWh NIBs manufactory. Therefore, the fundamental understandings and universal design strategy presented open an avenue for rational materials design of NIBs toward both elemental and manufactural sustainability.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Antisymmetric Magnetoresistance in van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;quality room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic material Fe3GaTe2 is synthesized by the chemical vapor transport method. An unconventional room&#8208;temperature antisymmetric magnetoresistance is observed in 2D Fe3GaTe2 devices with the planar symmetry breaking. This work provides new routes to achieve magnetic random storage and logic devices by utilizing the room&#8208;temperature thickness&#8208;controlled antisymmetric magnetoresistance.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetic materials have emerged as a promising platform for the development of 2D spintronic devices. However, studies to date are restricted to vdW ferromagnetic materials with low Curie temperature (Tc) and small magnetic anisotropy. Here, a chemical vapor transport method is developed to synthesize a high&#8208;quality room&#8208;temperature ferromagnet, Fe3GaTe2 (c&#8208;Fe3GaTe2), which boasts a high Tc = 356 K and large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Due to the planar symmetry breaking, an unconventional room&#8208;temperature antisymmetric magnetoresistance (MR) is first observed in c&#8208;Fe3GaTe2 devices with step features, manifesting as three distinctive states of high, intermediate, and low resistance with the sweeping magnetic field. Moreover, the modulation of the antisymmetric MR is demonstrated by controlling the height of the surface steps. This work provides new routes to achieve magnetic random storage and logic devices by utilizing the room&#8208;temperature thickness&#8208;controlled antisymmetric MR and further design room&#8208;temperature 2D spintronic devices based on the vdW ferromagnet c&#8208;Fe3GaTe2.

         <title>Harvesting Multicolor Photoluminescence in Nonaromatic Interpenetrated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanocrystals via Pressure&#8208;Modulated Carbonyls Aggregation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonaromatic interpenetrated Zn4O(ADC)4(Et3N)6 IRMOF&#8208;0 nanocrystals (NCs)&#160;show a photoluminescence&#160;turn&#8208;on behavior via pressure&#8208;induced aggregation effect, where aggregation of carbonyls&#160;results in O&#9472;O distances smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radii (3.04 &#197;). IRMOF&#8208;0 NCs exhibit an ultrabroad emission tunability, which mainly arises from the retention at varying degrees of through&#8208;space n&#8211;&#960;* interactions achieved by pressure&#8208;treated engineering.








Abstract
Interpenetrated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with nonaromatic ligands provide a unique platform for adsorption, catalysis, and sensing applications. However, nonemission and the lack of optical property tailoring make it challenging to fabricate smart responsive devices with nonaromatic interpenetrated MOFs based on ligand&#8208;centered emission. In this paper, the pressure&#8208;induced aggregation effect is introduced in nonaromatic interpenetrated Zn4O(ADC)4(Et3N)6 (IRMOF&#8208;0) nanocrystals (NCs), where carbonyl groups aggregation results in O&#9472;O distances smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radii (3.04 &#197;), triggering the photoluminescence turn&#8208;on behavior. It is noteworthy that the IRMOF&#8208;0 NCs display an ultrabroad emission tunability of 130&#160;nm from deep blue (440&#160;nm) to yellow (570&#160;nm) upon release to ambient conditions at different pressures. The eventual retention of through&#8208;space n&#8211;&#960;* interactions in different degrees via pressure treatment is primarily responsible for achieving a controllable multicolor emission behavior in initially nonemissive IRMOF&#8208;0 NCs. The fabricated multicolor phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the pressure&#8208;treated IRMOF&#8208;0 NCs exhibit excellent thermal, chromaticity, and fatigue stability. The proposed strategy not only imparts new vitality to nonaromatic interpenetrated MOFs but also offers new perspectives for advancements in the field of multicolor displays and daylight illumination.

         <title>Influence of Li Content on the Topological Inhibition of Oxygen Loss in Li&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Li&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes, the formation of a migration network of redox&#8208;active oxygen ions can be prevented when the transition metal ions occupy over 5/6 of the sites in the transition metal layer, and thereby, the oxidized oxygen species can be encaged in the lattice, leading to topological inhibition of oxygen loss during cycling.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich layer oxide cathodes are promising energy storage materials due to their high energy densities. However, the oxygen loss during cycling limits their practical applications. Here, the essential role of Li content on the topological inhibition of oxygen loss in lithium&#8208;rich cathode materials and the relationship between the migration network of oxygen ions and the transition metal (TM) component are revealed. Utilizing first&#8208;principles calculations in combination with percolation theory and Monte Carlo simulations, it is found that TM ions can effectively encage the oxidized oxygen species when the TM concentration in TM layer exceeds 5/6, which hinders the formation of a percolating oxygen migration network. This study demonstrates the significance of rational compositional design in lithium&#8208;rich cathodes for effectively suppressing irreversible oxygen release and enhancing cathode cycling performance.

         <title>Boosting Contact Electrification by Amorphous Polyvinyl Alcohol Endowing Improved Contact Adhesion and Electrochemical Capacitance</title>

The stronger binding to water molecules, and the consequent higher water uptake, is shown to be responsible for the improved electrical output of triboelectric generators and sensors based on an amorphous polyvinyl alcohol compared to the more common homopolymer derivative. The specific role played by the increased material softness, adhesive contact, and ionic conductivity on devices performance is highlighted.








Abstract
Ion conductive hydrogels are relevant components in wearable, biocompatible, and biodegradable electronics. Polyvinyl&#8208;alcohol (PVA) homopolymer is often the favored choice for integration into supercapacitors and energy harvesters as in sustainable triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). However, to further improve hydrogel&#8208;based TENGs, a deeper understanding of the impact of their composition and structure on devices performance is necessary. Here, it is shown how ionic hydrogels based on an amorphous&#8208;PVA (a&#8208;PVA) allow to fabricate TENGs that outperform the one based on the homopolymer. When used as tribomaterial, the Li&#8208;doped a&#8208;PVA allows to achieve a twofold higher pressure sensitivity compared to PVA, and to develop a conformable e&#8208;skin. When used as an ionic conductor encased in an elastomeric tribomaterial, 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 average power is obtained, providing 25% power increase compared to PVA. At the origin of such enhancement is the increased softness, stronger adhesive contact, higher ionic mobility (&gt; 3,5&#8208;fold increase), and long&#8208;term stability achieved with Li&#8208;doped a&#8208;PVA. These improvements are attributed to the high density of hydroxyl groups and amorphous structure present in the a&#8208;PVA, enabling&#160;a strong binding to water molecules. This work discloses novel insights on those&#160;parameters allowing to&#160;develop&#160;easy&#8208;processable,&#160;stable, and highly conductive hydrogels for integration in conformable, soft, and biocompatible TENGs.

&lt;p&gt;Ion conductive hydrogels are relevant components in wearable, biocompatible, and biodegradable electronics. Polyvinyl-alcohol (PVA) homopolymer is often the favored choice for integration into supercapacitors and energy harvesters as in sustainable triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). However, to further improve hydrogel-based TENGs, a deeper understanding of the impact of their composition and structure on devices performance is necessary. Here, it is shown how ionic hydrogels based on an amorphous-PVA (a-PVA) allow to fabricate TENGs that outperform the one based on the homopolymer. When used as tribomaterial, the Li-doped a-PVA allows to achieve a twofold higher pressure sensitivity compared to PVA, and to develop a conformable e-skin. When used as an ionic conductor encased in an elastomeric tribomaterial, 100&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; average power is obtained, providing 25% power increase compared to PVA. At the origin of such enhancement is the increased softness, stronger adhesive contact, higher ionic mobility (&amp;gt; 3,5-fold increase), and long-term stability achieved with Li-doped a-PVA. These improvements are attributed to the high density of hydroxyl groups and amorphous structure present in the a-PVA, enabling&#160;a strong binding to water molecules.

         <title>Ultimately Adaptive Fluid Interfacial Phospholipid Membranes Unveiled Unanticipated High Cellular Mechanical Work</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ideally adaptive cellular scaffold is developed by decorating a fluid interface with phospholipid membranes. In contrast to conventional solid or hydrogel scaffolds, cell adhesion behaviors thereon follow an adaptive wetting regime with surprisingly high mechanical work, which highlights an analogy of cell adhesion behaviors and droplet wetting on surfaces with a low Young's modulus.








Abstract
Living cells actively interact biochemically and mechanically with the surrounding extracellular matrices (ECMs) and undergo dramatic morphological and dimensional transitions, concomitantly remodeling ECMs. However, there is no suitable method to quantitatively discuss the contribution of mechanical interactions in such mutually adaptive processes. Herein, a highly deformable &#8220;living&#8221; cellular scaffold is developed to evaluate overall mechanical energy transfer between cell and ECMs. It is based on the water&#8211;perfluorocarbon interface decorated with phospholipids bearing a cell&#8208;adhesive ligand and fluorescent tag. The bioinert nature of the phospholipid membranes prevents the formation of solid&#8208;like protein nanofilms at the fluid interface, enabling to visualize and quantify cellular mechanical work against the ultimately adaptive model ECM. A new cellular wetting regime is identified, wherein interface deformation proceeds to cell flattening, followed by its eventual restoration. The cellular mechanical work during this adaptive wetting process is one order of magnitude higher than those reported with&#160;conventional elastic platforms. The behavior of viscous liquid drops at the air&#8211;water interface can simulate cellular adaptive wetting, suggesting that overall viscoelasticity of the cell body predominates the emergent wetting regime and regulates mechanical output. Cellular&#8208;force&#8208;driven high&#8208;energy states on the adaptive platform can be useful for cell fate manipulation.

         <title>Durable Perovskite Solar Cells with 24.5% Average Efficiency: The Role of Rigid Conjugated Core in Molecular Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dibenzo[g,p]chrysene, a non&#8208;planar double helicene, displays enhanced rigidity compared to tetraphenylethene, enabling the development of a molecular semiconductor with elevated cohesive energy density and hole mobility. Applied in high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cell fabrication, it exhibits remarkable operational stability at 45&#160;&#176;C and storage stability at 85&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Efficient and robust n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells necessitate superior organic hole&#8208;transport materials with both mechanical and electronic prowess. Deciphering the structure&#8211;property relationship of these materials is crucial for practical perovskite solar cell applications. Through direct arylation, two high glass transition temperature molecular semiconductors, DBC&#8208;ETPA (202&#160;&#176;C) and TPE&#8208;ETPA (180&#160;&#176;C) are synthesized, using dibenzo[g,p]chrysene (DBC) and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetraphenylethene (TPE) tetrabromides with triphenylene&#8211;ethylenedioxythiophene&#8208;dimethoxytriphenylamine (ETPA). In comparison to spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, both semiconductors exhibit shallower HOMO energy levels, resulting in increased hole densities (generated by air oxidation doping) and accelerated hole extraction from photoexcited perovskite. Experimental and theoretical studies highlight the more rigid DBC core, enhancing hole mobility due to reduced reorganization energy and lower energy disorder. Importantly, DBC&#8208;ETPA possesses a higher cohesive energy density, leading to lower ion diffusion coefficients and higher Young's moduli. Leveraging these attributes, DBC&#8208;ETPA is employed as the primary hole&#8208;transport layer component, yielding perovskite solar cells with an average efficiency of 24.5%, surpassing spiro&#8208;OMeTAD reference cells (24.0%). Furthermore, DBC&#8208;ETPA&#8208;based cells exhibit superior operational stability and 85&#160;&#176;C thermal storage stability.

         <title>A Glucose&#8208;Responsive Cannula for Automated and Electronics&#8208;Free Insulin Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a glucose&#8208;responsive cannula is presented for automated insulin delivery without the use of electronics. This cannula, composed of a resilient elastomer&#8208;hydrogel hybrid, changes its permeability in response to glucose levels. Tested in diabetic mice, it effectively maintains blood glucose levels within target ranges for &#8776;3&#160;d, offering a potential solution for user&#8208;centric insulin delivery.








Abstract
Automated delivery of insulin based on continuous glucose monitoring is revolutionizing the way insulin&#8208;dependent diabetes is treated. However, challenges remain for the widespread adoption of these systems, including the requirement of a separate glucose sensor, sophisticated electronics and algorithms, and the need for significant user input to operate these costly therapies. Herein, a user&#8208;centric glucose&#8208;responsive cannula is reported for electronics&#8208;free insulin delivery. The cannula&#8212;made from a tough, elastomer&#8208;hydrogel hybrid membrane formed through a one&#8208;pot solvent exchange method&#8212;changes permeability to release insulin rapidly upon physiologically relevant varying glucose levels, providing simple and automated insulin delivery with no additional hardware or software. Two prototypes of the cannula are evaluated in insulin&#8208;deficient diabetic mice. The first cannula&#8212;an ends&#8208;sealed, subcutaneously inserted prototype&#8212;normalizes blood glucose levels for 3&#160;d and controls postprandial glucose levels. The second, more translational version&#8212;a cannula with the distal end sealed and the proximal end connected to a transcutaneous injection port&#8212;likewise demonstrates tight, 3&#8208;d regulation of blood glucose levels when refilled twice daily. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study may aid in the development of &#8220;smart&#8221; cannulas and next&#8208;generation insulin therapies at a reduced burden&#8208;of&#8208;care toll and cost to end&#8208;users.

         <title>Boosting Formate Electrooxidation by Heterostructured PtPd Alloy and Oxides Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterostructured platinum&#8208;palladium alloy and oxides nanowires (PtPd&#8208;ox NWs) with abundant heterojunction interfaces and defect sites are synthesized through a facile self&#8208;template method. PtPd&#8208;ox NWs with optimal electronic structure achieve dual regulation via both regulating key intermediate adsorption behavior and coupling key reaction processes, demonstrating remarkable performance toward formate electrooxidation reaction.








Abstract
Direct formate fuel cells (DFFCs) receive increasing attention as promising technologies for the future energy mix and environmental sustainability, as formate can be made from carbon dioxide utilization and is carbon neutral. Herein, heterostructured platinum&#8208;palladium&#160;alloy and oxides nanowires (PtPd&#8208;ox NWs) with abundant defect sites are synthesized through a facile self&#8208;template method and demonstrated high activity toward formate electrooxidation reaction (FOR). The electronic tuning arising from the heterojunction between alloy and oxides influence the work function of PtPd&#8208;ox NWs. The sample with optimal work function reveals the favorable adsorption behavior for intermediates and strong interaction in the d&#8722;p orbital hybridization between Pt site and oxygen in formate, favoring the FOR direct pathway with a low energy barrier. Besides the thermodynamic regulation, the heterostructure can also provide sufficient hydroxyl species to facilitate the formation of carbon dioxide due to the ability of combining absorbed hydrogen and carbon monoxide at adjacent active sites, which contributes to the improvement of FOR kinetics on PtPd&#8208;ox NWs.

&lt;p&gt;Heterostructured platinum-palladium alloy and oxides nanowires (PtPd-ox NWs) with abundant heterojunction interfaces and defect sites are synthesized through a facile self-template method. PtPd-ox NWs with optimal electronic structure achieve dual regulation via both regulating key intermediate adsorption behavior and coupling key reaction processes, demonstrating remarkable performance toward formate electrooxidation reaction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct formate fuel cells (DFFCs) receive increasing attention as promising technologies for the future energy mix and environmental sustainability, as formate can be made from carbon dioxide utilization and is carbon neutral. Herein, heterostructured platinum-palladium&#160;alloy and oxides nanowires (PtPd-ox NWs) with abundant defect sites are synthesized through a facile self-template method and demonstrated high activity toward formate electrooxidation reaction (FOR). The electronic tuning arising from the heterojunction between alloy and oxides influence the work function of PtPd-ox NWs. The sample with optimal work function reveals the favorable adsorption behavior for intermediates and strong interaction in the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbital hybridization between Pt site and oxygen in formate, favoring the FOR direct pathway with a low energy barrier. Besides the thermodynamic regulation, the heterostructure can also provide sufficient hydroxyl species to facilitate the formation of carbon dioxide due to the ability of combining absorbed hydrogen and carbon monoxide at adjacent active sites, which contributes to the improvement of FOR kinetics on PtPd-ox NWs.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanometer Mono&#8208;Layered Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Nanosheets for Simulated Flue Gas Photoreduction</title>

         <dc:description>
A kind of sub&#8208;nanometer mono&#8208;layered nanosheets (Co&#8208;MOF MNSs) is successfully prepared with remarkable performance in selective CO2 photo&#8208;reduction into formic acid under simulated flue gas.








Abstract
The dilemma between the thickness and accessible active site triggers the design of porous crystalline materials with mono&#8208;layered structure for advanced photo&#8208;catalysis applications. Here, a kind of sub&#8208;nanometer mono&#8208;layered nanosheets (Co&#8208;MOF MNSs) through the exfoliation of specifically designed Co3 cluster&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is reported. The sub&#8208;nanometer thickness and inherent light&#8208;sensitivity endow Co&#8208;MOF MNSs with fully exposed Janus Co3 sites that can selectively photo&#8208;reduce CO2 into formic acid under simulated flue gas. Notably, the production efficiency of formic acid by Co&#8208;MOF MNSs (0.85&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) is &#8776;13 times higher than that of the bulk counterpart (0.065&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) under a simulated flue gas atmosphere, which is the highest in reported works up to date. Theoretical calculations prove that the exposed Janus Co3 sites with simultaneously available sites possess higher activity when compared with single Co site, validating the importance of mono&#8208;layered nanosheet morphology. These results may facilitate the development of functional nanosheet materials for CO2 photo&#8208;reduction in potential flue gas treatment.

         <title>Ultrathin High&#8208;Entropy Fe&#8208;Based Spinel Oxide Nanosheets with Metalloid Band Structures for Efficient Nitrate Reduction toward Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modified sol&#8211;gel method has developed to synthesize ultrathin high&#8208;entropy Fe&#8208;based spinel oxide (denotes A5Fe2O4) nanosheets. Theoretic and experimental results confirm that the high&#8208;Entropy A5Fe2O4 nanosheets have metalloid band structures with remarkedly enhanced performance for the electrochemical nitrate reduction toward ammonia.








Abstract
Spinel oxides with tunable chemical compositions have emerged as versatile electrocatalysts, however their performance is greatly limited by small surface area and low electron conductivity. Here, ultrathin high&#8208;entropy Fe&#8208;based spinel oxides nanosheets are rationally designed (i.e., (Co0.2Ni0.2Zn0.2Mg0.2Cu0.2)Fe2O4; denotes A5Fe2O4) in thickness of &#8776;4.3&#160;nm with large surface area and highly exposed active sites via a modified sol&#8211;gel method. Theoretic and experimental results confirm that the bandgap of A5Fe2O4 nanosheets is significantly smaller than that of ordinary Fe&#8208;based spinel oxides, realizing the transformation of binary spinel oxide from semiconductors to metalloids. As a result, such A5Fe2O4 nanosheets manifest excellent performance for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) to ammonia (NH3), with a NH3 yield rate of &#8776;2.1&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.5&#160;V versus Reversible hydrogen electrode, outperforming other spinel&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Systematic mechanism investigations reveal that the NO3&#8722;RR is mainly occurred on Fe sites, and introducing high&#8208;entropy compositions in tetrahedral sites regulates the adsorption strength of N and O&#8208;related intermediates on Fe for boosting the NO3&#8722;RR. The above findings offer a high&#8208;entropy platform to regulate the bandgap and enhance the electrocatalytic performance of spinel oxides.

         <title>Unraveling Paradoxical Effects of Large Current Density on Zn Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paradox between oriented Zn deposition and poor cell lifetime during large current operation is revealed to be relevant with the multiplied current density in the separator channels. Furthermore, this phenomenon is described as the separator permeation effect, which explains the rapid short circuit despite smooth Zn deposition.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries (ZBs) have been widely investigated owing to their intrinsic safety, low cost, and simple assembly. However, the actual behavior of Zn deposition under large current density is still a severe issue associated with obscure mechanism interpretation of ZBs under high loading. Here, differing from the conventional understanding that short circuit is induced by dendrite penetrating under large current density (10&#8211;100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), the separator permeation effect is unraveled to illustrate the paradox between smooth deposition and short lifespan. Generally, a dense plating morphology is achieved under large current density because of intensive nuclei and boosted plane growth. Nevertheless, in the scenes applying separators, the multiplied local current density derived from narrow separator channels leads to rapid Zn2+ exhaustion, converting the Zn deposition mode from nucleation control to concentration control, which eventually results in separator permeation and short circuit. This effect is validated in other aqueous metal anodes (Cu, Sn, Fe) and receives similar results. Based on the understanding, a micro&#8208;pore (150&#160;&#181;m) sponge foam is proposed as separators for large&#8208;current anodes to provide broader Zn2+ path and mitigate the separator permeation effect. This work provides unique perspectives on coordinating fast&#8208;charging ability and anode stability of ZBs.

         <title>Reverse Atom Capture on Perovskite Surface Enabling Robust and Efficient Cathode for Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced reverse atom capture technique is developed to capture surface segregated Ba and Sr cations from PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (PBSCF) perovskite, resulting in a unique (Ba/Sr)(Co/Fe/W)O3&#8722;&#948; (BSCFW)@PBSCF heterostructured cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cells. The single cell using such heterostructured cathode delivers an excellent peak power density of 1.32&#160;W cm&#8722;2 at 650&#160;&#176;C and a robust durability for 240&#160;h.








Abstract
Protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) hold potential for sustainable energy conversion, yet their widespread application is hindered by the sluggish kinetics and inferior stability of cathode materials. Here, a facile and efficient reverse atom capture technique is developed to manipulate the surface chemistry of PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (PBSCF) cathode for PCFCs. This method successfully captures segregated Ba and Sr cations on the PBSCF surface using W species, creating a (Ba/Sr)(Co/Fe/W)O3&#8722;&#948; (BSCFW)@PBSCF heterostructure. Benefiting from enhanced kinetics of proton&#8208;involved oxygen reduction reaction and strengthened chemical stability, the single cell using the optimized 2W&#8208;PBSCF cathode demonstrates an exceptional peak power density of 1.32&#160;W cm&#8722;2 at 650&#160;&#176;C and maintains durable performance for 240&#160;h. Theoretical calculations unveil that the BSCFW perovskite delivers lower oxygen vacancy formation energy, hydration energy, and proton transfer energy compared to the PBSCF perovskite.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) hold potential for sustainable energy conversion, yet their widespread application is hindered by the sluggish kinetics and inferior stability of cathode materials. Here, a facile and efficient reverse atom capture technique is developed to manipulate the surface chemistry of PrBa&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5+&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;/i&gt; (PBSCF) cathode for PCFCs. This method successfully captures segregated Ba and Sr cations on the PBSCF surface using W species, creating a (Ba/Sr)(Co/Fe/W)O&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;&#948;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; (BSCFW)@PBSCF heterostructure. Benefiting from enhanced kinetics of proton-involved oxygen reduction reaction and strengthened chemical stability, the single cell using the optimized 2W-PBSCF cathode demonstrates an exceptional peak power density of 1.32&#160;W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 650&#160;&#176;C and maintains durable performance for 240&#160;h. Theoretical calculations unveil that the BSCFW perovskite delivers lower oxygen vacancy formation energy, hydration energy, and proton transfer energy compared to the PBSCF perovskite.

Lignin derived ultrathin all&#8208;solid composite polymer electrolytes, which possess 3D nanofiber ionic bridge networks composed of single&#8208;ion lignin&#8208;based lithium salt&#160;and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene)&#160;as the framework, and poly(ethylene oxide)/lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide&#160;as the filler, is obtained through spinning/spraying and hot&#8208;pressing. It can be applied in dendrite&#8208;resistant and low&#8208;temperature lithium batteries.








Abstract
The lignin derived ultrathin all&#8208;solid composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) with a thickness of only 13.2&#160;&#181;m, which possess 3D nanofiber ionic bridge networks composed of single&#8208;ion lignin&#8208;based lithium salt (L&#8208;Li) and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) as the framework, and poly(ethylene oxide)/lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PEO/LiTFSI) as the filler, is obtained through electrospinning/spraying and hot&#8208;pressing. t. The Li&#8208;symmetric cell assembled with the CPE can stably cycle more than 6000&#160;h under 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with little Li dendrites growth. Moreover, the assembled Li||CPE||LiFePO4 cells can stably cycle over 700 cycles at 0.2 C with a super high initial discharge capacity of 158.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at room temperature, and a favorable capacity of 123 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C for 250 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the reason that the nanofiber ionic bridge network can afford uniformly dispersed single&#8208;ion L&#8208;Li through electrospinning, which synergizes with the LiTFSI well dispersed in PEO to form abundant and efficient 3D Li+ transfer channels. The ultrathin CPE induces uniform deposition of Li+ at the interface, and effectively inhibit the lithium dendrites. This work provides a promising strategy to achieve ultrathin biobased electrolytes for solid&#8208;state lithium ion batteries.

         <title>In Situ Polymerization Facilitating Practical High&#8208;Safety Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining the high&#8208;safety liquid electrolyte with in situ polymerization, the safety of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries is significantly enhanced. The in&#8208;depth investigation demonstrates that the thermally stable polymer skeleton covering the electrodes impedes various exothermic reactions at elevated temperatures, promoting the self&#8208;heating temperature (T1) and onset temperature (T2), and reducing the temperature rise rate (dT dt&#8722;1) during battery thermal runaway process.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (QSSBs) are gaining widespread attention as a promising solution to improve battery safety performance. However, the safety improvement and the underlying mechanisms of QSSBs remain elusive. Herein, a novel strategy combining high&#8208;safety ethylene carbonate&#8208;free liquid electrolyte and in situ polymerization technique is proposed to prepare practical QSSBs. The Ah&#8208;level QSSBs with LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 cathode and graphite&#8211;silicon anode demonstrate significantly improved safety features without sacrificing electrochemical performance. As evidenced by accelerating rate calorimetry tests, the QSSBs exhibit increased self&#8208;heating temperature and onset temperature (T2), and decreased temperature rise rate during thermal runaway (TR). The T2 has a maximum increase of 48.4&#160;&#176;C compared to the conventional liquid batteries. Moreover, the QSSBs do not undergo TR until 180&#160;&#176;C (even 200&#160;&#176;C) during the hot&#8208;box tests, presenting significant improvement compared to the liquid batteries that run into TR at 130&#160;&#176;C. Systematic investigations show that the in situ formed polymer skeleton effectively mitigates the exothermic reactions between lithium salts and lithiated anode, retards the oxygen release from cathode, and inhibits crosstalk reactions between cathode and anode at elevated temperatures. The findings offer an innovative solution for practical high&#8208;safety QSSBs and open up a new sight for building safer high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Super&#8208;Ionic Conductor Soft Filler Promotes Li+ Transport in Integrated Cathode&#8211;Electrolyte for Solid&#8208;State Battery at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on dipole interaction between super&#8208;ionic conductive soft filler (Li+ conductivity nanocellulose, Li&#8208;NC) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), a tough dual&#8208;channel Li+ transport electrolyte (TDCT) is constructed. The anchoring effect of Li&#8208;NC prevents local concentration polarization in TDCT. An integrated electrode design effectively enhances the Li+ transport at the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface.








Abstract
Composite polymer solid electrolytes (CPEs), possessing good rigid flexible, are expected to be used in solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries. The integration of fillers into polymer matrices emerges as a dominant strategy to improve Li+ transport and form a Li+&#8208;conducting electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface. However, challenges arise as traditional fillers: 1) inorganic fillers, characterized by high interfacial energy, induce agglomeration; 2) organic fillers, with elevated crystallinity, impede intrinsic ionic conductivity, both severely hindering Li+ migration. Here, a concept of super&#8208;ionic conductor soft filler, utilizing a Li+ conductivity nanocellulose (Li&#8208;NC) as a model, is introduced which exhibits super&#8208;ionic conductivity. Li&#8208;NC anchors anions, and enhances Li+ transport speed, and assists in the integration of cathode&#8211;electrolyte electrodes for room temperature solid&#8208;state batteries. The tough dual&#8208;channel Li+ transport electrolyte (TDCT) with Li&#8208;NC and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) demonstrates a high Li+ transfer number (0.79) due to the synergistic coordination mechanism in Li+ transport. Integrated electrodes&#8217; design enables stable performance in LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2|Li cells, with 720&#160;cycles at 0.5 C, and 88.8% capacity retention. Furthermore, the lifespan of Li|TDCT|Li cells over 4000&#160;h and Li&#8208;rich Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2|Li cells exhibits excellent performance, proving the practical application potential of soft filler for high energy density solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries at room temperature.

Glucan Materials Synthesized by Biocatalysis
Bottom&#8208;up enzymatically synthesized glucans are promising biomaterials of tunable structure and properties. In article number 2400436 by Chao Zhong and Bernd Nidetzky, they are reviewed with particular focus on the enzymes used in the polymerization reactions. Bottom&#8208;up approaches offer interesting opportunities of the preparation of hydrogels, fibers, supramolecular hybrids, non&#8208;natural glycans, and co&#8208;polymers. These resultant polymeric materials exhibit promise for applications in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and coating, emphasizing the important role of biocatalysis in the development of sustainable macromolecular materials.

Smart Contact Lenses
In article number 2313848, the groups around Ar&#225;nzazu del Campo and Christoph Wittmann present a new design concept for long&#8208;term, self&#8208;lubricating hydrogels based on embedded self&#8208;replenishable reservoirs that can autonomously produce and release a lubricating agent. The reservoirs are living biofactories programmed to produce and release hyaluronic acid. The release is passively regulated by the composition and crosslinking of the hydrogel network. The living hydrogel can be processed as a CL laboratory prototype with durable&#8208;by&#8208;design wetting and lubrication.

Vertically&#8208;Aligned Graphene Micro Helices
In article number 2401451, Jeong&#8208;Hyun Cho and co&#8208;workers introduce a dual&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly method that facilitates the creation of vertically&#8208;aligned monolayer graphene micro helices with heights in the millimeter range. The vertically aligned graphene helices enhance light interactions beyond what is achievable with chiral graphene realized by conventional 2D plane methods, resulting in greatly enhanced optical chiral properties.

Drug Delivery
In article number 2311283, Hee&#8208;Seung Lee, Sangyong Jon, and co&#8208;workers have develop an organ&#8208;selective drug delivery platform based on a library of glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (GlyNPs). Direct in vivo library screening enable identification of GlyNP hits targeting liver, spleen, lung, kidneys, heart, and brain and, moreover, each organ&#8208;selective GlyNP hit shows cellular tropism within the organ. When liver&#8208;, kidney&#8208;, and spleen&#8208;selective GlyNP hits are equipped with therapeutics, the formulations effectively alleviated symptoms in organ&#8208;associated disease models.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biofabrication of biomimetic architectures leveraging on cell&#8208;rich living inks matching human tissue cellular densities can lead to unprecedented advances in generating architectures with life&#8208;like features and biofunctionalities, thus moving far beyond conventional biofabricated constructs where biomaterial&#8208;to&#8208;cell ratios remain nonphysiologic. This review showcases recent advances in the design of cell&#8208;rich inks and discusses key challenges toward translation to mainstream clinical applications.








Abstract
Advancing biofabrication toward manufacturing living constructs with well&#8208;defined architectures and increasingly biologically relevant cell densities is highly desired to mimic the biofunctionality of native human tissues. The formulation of tissue&#8208;like, cell&#8208;dense inks for biofabrication remains, however, challenging at various levels of the bioprinting process. Promising advances have been made toward this goal, achieving relatively high cell densities that surpass those found in conventional platforms, pushing the current boundaries closer to achieving tissue&#8208;like cell densities. On this focus, herein the overarching challenges in the bioprocessing of cell&#8208;rich living inks into clinically grade engineered tissues are discussed, as well as the most recent advances in cell&#8208;rich living ink formulations and their processing technologies are highlighted. Additionally, an overview of the foreseen developments in the field is provided and critically discussed.

         <title>Engineering Triple&#8208;Phase Interfaces around the Anode toward Practical Alkali Metal&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali metal&#8211;air batteries promise ultrahigh gravimetric energy densities, while the inherent poor cycle stability hinders their practical application. In contrast to most previous efforts devoted to developing advanced air cathodes with high electrocatalytic activity, here the significance of addressing the challenge facing the complex triple&#8208;phase interface around the anodes from the perspective of materials system engineering is highlighted.








Abstract
Alkali metal&#8211;air batteries (AMABs) promise ultrahigh gravimetric energy densities, while the inherent poor cycle stability hinders their practical application. To address this challenge, most previous efforts are devoted to advancing the air cathodes with high electrocatalytic activity. Recent studies have underlined the solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas triple&#8208;phase interface around the anode can play far more significant roles than previously acknowledged by the scientific community. Besides the bottlenecks of uncontrollable dendrite growth and gas evolution in conventional alkali metal batteries, the corrosive gases, intermediate oxygen species, and redox mediators in AMABs cause more severe anode corrosion and structural collapse, posing greater challenges to the stabilization of the anode triple&#8208;phase interface. This work aims to provide a timely perspective on the anode interface engineering for durable AMABs. Taking the Li&#8211;air battery as a typical example, this critical review shows the latest developed anode stabilization strategies, including formulating electrolytes to build protective interphases, fabricating advanced anodes to improve their anti&#8208;corrosion capability, and designing functional separator to shield the corrosive species. Finally, the remaining scientific and technical issues from the prospects of anode interface engineering are highlighted, particularly materials system engineering, for the practical use of AMABs.

         <title>Hierarchically Ordered Pore Engineering of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Materials for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Progress on hierarchically ordered pore engineering of metal&#8211;organic frameworks&#8208;based materials for enhanced electrocatalysis is reviewed. Especially, the intensification of molecule and ion transport integrated with the optimized electron transfer and site exposure over the hierarchically ordered porous derivatives during the electrocatalytic applications is emphasized to clarify the directional transfer and integration effect endowed by ordered pore engineering.








Abstract
Ordered pore engineering that embeds uniform pores with periodic alignment in electrocatalysts opens up a new avenue for achieving further performance promotion. Hierarchically ordered porous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (HOP&#8208;MOFs) possessing multilevel pores with ordered distribution are the promising precursors for the exploration of ordered porous electrocatalysts, while the scalable acquisition of HOP&#8208;MOFs with editable components and adjustable pore size regimes is critical. This review presents recent progress on hierarchically ordered pore engineering of MOF&#8208;based materials for enhanced electrocatalysis. The synthetic strategies of HOP&#8208;MOFs with different pore size regimes, including the self&#8208;assembly guided by reticular chemistry, surfactant, nanoemulsion, and nanocasting, are first introduced. Then the applications of HOP&#8208;MOFs as the precursors for exploring hierarchically ordered porous electrocatalysts are summarized, selecting representatives to highlight the boosted performance. Especially, the intensification of molecule and ion transport integrated with optimized electron transfer and site exposure over the hierarchically ordered porous derivatives are emphasized to clarify the directional transfer and integration effect endowed by ordered pore engineering. Finally, the remaining scientific challenges and an outlook of this field are proposed. It is hoped that this review will guide the hierarchically ordered pore engineering of nanocatalysts for boosting the catalytic performance and promoting the practical applications.

         <title>Remote Control of Energy Transformation&#8208;Based Cancer Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article focuses on a detailed summary of the energy transformation remote control strategy design for efficient cancer targeting long&#8208;term imaging and therapy, thereby expanding the remote control energy transformation window. By reviewing current research progress, this review paves the way for remote control applications of energy transformation&#8208;based cancer imaging and therapy.








Abstract
Cancer treatment requires precise tumor&#8208;specific targeting at specific sites that allows for high&#8208;resolution diagnostic imaging and long&#8208;term patient&#8208;tailorable cancer therapy; while, minimizing side effects largely arising from non&#8208;targetability. This can be realized by harnessing exogenous remote stimuli, such as tissue&#8208;penetrative ultrasound, magnetic field, light, and radiation, that enable local activation for cancer imaging and therapy in deep tumors. A myriad of nanomedicines can be efficiently activated when the energy of such remote stimuli can be transformed into another type of energy. This review discusses the remote control of energy transformation for targetable, efficient, and long&#8208;term cancer imaging and therapy. Such ultrasonic, magnetic, photonic, radiative, and radioactive energy can be transformed into mechanical, thermal, chemical, and radiative energy to enable a variety of cancer imaging and treatment modalities. The current review article describes multimodal energy transformation where a serial cascade or multiple types of energy transformation occur. This review includes not only mechanical, chemical, hyperthermia, and radiation therapy but also emerging thermoelectric, pyroelectric, and piezoelectric therapies for cancer treatment. It also illustrates ultrasound, magnetic resonance, fluorescence, computed tomography, photoluminescence, and photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided cancer therapies. It highlights afterglow imaging that can eliminate autofluorescence for sustained signal emission after the excitation.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Synthesized Glucan Materials: Opportunities from Applied Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linear d&#8208;glucans, simple yet versatile polysaccharides, shape nanostructures crucial for biomaterial development. Shifting from top&#8208;down to bottom&#8208;up synthesis using natural and engineered enzymes provides meticulous control over polymer structures, fostering diversification for macromolecular materials. This review introduces advancements in non&#8208;natural glucans, copolymers, and supramolecular hybrids, obtained through bottom&#8208;up enzymatic approaches. It emphasizes the potential of enzyme biocatalysis in material development.








Abstract
Linear d&#8208;glucans are natural polysaccharides of simple chemical structure. They are comprised of d&#8208;glucosyl units linked by a single type of glycosidic bond. Noncovalent interactions within, and between, the d&#8208;glucan chains give rise to a broad variety of macromolecular nanostructures that can assemble into crystalline&#8208;organized materials of tunable morphology. Structure design and functionalization of d&#8208;glucans for diverse material applications largely relies on top&#8208;down processing and chemical derivatization of naturally derived starting materials. The top&#8208;down approach encounters critical limitations in efficiency, selectivity, and flexibility. Bottom&#8208;up approaches of d&#8208;glucan synthesis offer different, and often more precise, ways of polymer structure control and provide means of functional diversification widely inaccessible to top&#8208;down routes of polysaccharide material processing. Here the natural and engineered enzymes (glycosyltransferases, glycoside hydrolases and phosphorylases, glycosynthases) for d&#8208;glucan polymerization are described and the use of applied biocatalysis for the bottom&#8208;up assembly of specific d&#8208;glucan structures is shown. Advanced material applications of the resulting polymeric products are further shown and their important role in the development of sustainable macromolecular materials in a bio&#8208;based circular economy is discussed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin&#8208;polarization approach enhances spin&#8208;dependent electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) redox reactions by utilizing the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) phenomenon. This perspective provides the promising potential of CISS&#8208;driven EC and PEC systems involving various redox reactions, anticipating significant advancements in renewable energy conversion and storage.








Abstract
To facilitate the transition from a carbon&#8208;energy&#8208;dependent society to a sustainable society, conventional engineering strategies, which encounter limitations associated with intrinsic material properties, should undergo the paradigm shift. From a theoretical viewpoint, the spin&#8208;dependent feature of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) reveals the potential of a spin&#8208;polarization strategy in enhancing the performance of electrochemical (EC) reactions. The chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) phenomenon attracts unprecedented attention owing to its potential utility in achieving novel breakthroughs. This paper starts with the experimental results aimed at enhancing the efficiency of the spin&#8208;dependent OER focusing on the EC system based on the CISS phenomenon. The applicability of spin&#8208;polarization to EC system is verified through various analytical methodologies to clarify the theoretical groundwork and mechanisms underlying the spin&#8208;dependent reaction pathway. The discussion is then extended to effective spin&#8208;control strategies in photoelectrochemical system based on the CISS effect. Exploring the influence of spin&#8208;state control on the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects, this perspective also discusses the effect of spin polarization induced by the CISS phenomenon on spin&#8208;dependent OER. Lastly, future directions for enhancing the performance of spin&#8208;dependent redox systems are discussed, including expansion to various chemical reactions and the development of materials with spin&#8208;control capabilities.

         <title>Reversible Solar Heating and Radiative Cooling Devices via Mechanically Guided Assembly of 3D Macro/Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible solar heating and radiative cooling devices employing mechanically guided 3D architectures demonstrate dual&#8208;mode actuation with uniaxial strain. These devices, which are applicable on macro/microscales, utilize optimized 3D platforms that accommodate both rigid and soft materials. Heating/cooling layers achieve heating/cooling temperatures of 59.5 and &#8722;11.9&#160;&#176;C, respectively. The fabricated devices exhibit effective heating/cooling on diverse surfaces.








Abstract
Solar heating and radiative cooling are promising solutions for decreasing global energy consumption because these strategies use the Sun (&#8776;5800&#160;K) as a heating source and outer space (&#8776;3&#160;K) as a cooling source. Although high&#8208;performance thermal management can be achieved using these eco&#8208;friendly methods, they are limited by daily temperature fluctuations and seasonal changes because of single&#8208;mode actuation. Herein, reversible solar heating and radiative cooling devices formed via the mechanically guided assembly of 3D architectures are demonstrated. The fabricated devices exhibit the following properties: i) The devices reversibly change between solar heating and radiative cooling under uniaxial strain, called dual&#8208;mode actuation. ii) The 3D platforms in the devices can use rigid/soft materials for functional layers owing to the optimized designs. iii) The devices can be used for dual&#8208;mode thermal management on a macro/microscale. The devices use black paint&#8208;coated polyimide (PI) films as solar absorbers with multilayered films comprising thin layers of polydimethylsiloxane/silver/PI, achieving heating and cooling temperatures of 59.5 and &#8722;11.9&#160;&#176;C, respectively. Moreover, mode changes according to the angle of the 3D structures are demonstrated and the heating/cooling performance with skin, glass, steel, aluminum, copper, and PI substrates is investigated.

         <title>Heavy&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Colloidal Quantum Dots: Progress and Opportunities in Solar Technologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) show potential in solar technologies due to their photostability and adjustable properties. However, high&#8208;performing QDs often contain hazardous metals like Cd and Pb. Heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free QDs are reviewed for solar applications, analyzing synthetic strategies to optimize optical properties and improve charge dynamics. Structure&#8208;property relationships and future challenges like machine learning&#8208;based design and sustainable synthesis are also discussed.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) hold great promise as building blocks in solar technologies owing to their remarkable photostability and adjustable properties through the rationale involving size, atomic composition of core and shell, shapes, and surface states. However, most high&#8208;performing QDs in solar conversion contain hazardous metal elements, including Cd and Pb, posing significant environmental risks. Here, a comprehensive review of heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free colloidal QDs for solar technologies, including photovoltaic (PV) devices, solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical fuel conversion, and luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs), is presented. Emerging synthetic strategies to optimize the optical properties by tuning the energy band structure and manipulating charge dynamics within the QDs and at the QDs/charge acceptors interfaces, are analyzed. A comparative analysis of different synthetic methods is provided, structure&#8208;property relationships in these materials are discussed, and they are correlated with the performance of solar devices. This work is concluded with an outlook on challenges and opportunities for future work, including machine learning&#8208;based design, sustainable synthesis, and new surface/interface engineering.

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Photocatalytic Reactivity of Conjugated Microporous Polymer Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decreasing the size of conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) nanoparticles is proposed to overcome diffusional resistance of substrates in the porous polymer photocatalysts and improve energy efficiency of photocatalytic reactions. Smaller CMP nanoparticles show higher photocatalytic reactivity, achieving more than 1000% enhancement in the photocatalytic reaction rates by decreasing the particle size.








Abstract
Particle size is a critical factor for improving photocatalytic reactivity of conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) as mass transfer in the porous materials is often the rate&#8208;limiting step. However, due to the synthetic challenge of controlling the size of CMPs, the impact of particle size is yet to be investigated. To address this problem, a simple and versatile dispersion polymerization route that can synthesize dispersible CMP nanoparticles with controlled size from 15 to 180&#160;nm is proposed. Leveraging the precise control of the size, it is demonstrated that smaller CMP nanoparticles have dramatically higher photocatalytic reactivity in various organic transformations, achieving more than 1000% enhancement in the reaction rates by decreasing the size from 180 to 15&#160;nm. The size&#8208;dependent photocatalytic reactivity is further scrutinized using a kinetic model and transient absorption spectroscopy, revealing that only the initial 5&#160;nm&#8208;thick surface layer of CMP nanoparticles is involved in the photocatalytic reactions because of internal mass transfer limitations. This finding substantiates the potential of small CMP nanoparticles to efficiently use photo&#8208;generated excitons and improve energy&#8208;efficiency of numerous photocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Charged Black&#8208;Hole&#8208;Like Electronic Structure Driven by Geometric Potential of 2D Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is found that curvature in 2D semiconductors triggers the modified geometric potential with curvature&#8208;induced bandgap change, resembling the effective potential of black holes. The atomic&#8208;scale observation of bound states in the modified geometric potential shows an analog of the stable orbits near black holes. The modified geometric potential is related to curvature&#8208;induced variations in both band gap and spin&#8208;orbit interaction.








Abstract
One of the exotic expectations in the 2D curved spacetime is the geometric potential from the curvature of the 2D space, still possessing unsolved fundamental questions through Dirac quantization. The atomically thin 2D materials are promising for the realization of the geometric potential, but the geometric potential in 2D materials is not identified experimentally. Here, the curvature&#8208;induced ring&#8208;patterned bound states are observed in structurally deformed 2D semiconductors and formulated the modified geometric potential for the curvature effect, which demonstrates the ring&#8208;shape bound states with angular momentum. The formulated modified geometric potential is analogous to the effective potential of a rotating charged black hole. Density functional theory and tight&#8208;binding calculations are performed, which quantitatively agree well with the results of the modified geometric potential. The modified geometric potential is described by modified Gaussian and mean curvatures, corresponding to the curvature&#8208;induced changes in spin&#8208;orbit interaction and band gap, respectively. Even for complex structural deformation, the geometric potential solves the complexity, which aligns well with experimental results. The understanding of the modified geometric potential provides us with an intuitive clue for quantum transport and a key factor for new quantum applications such as valleytronics, spintronics, and straintronics in 2D semiconductors.

         <title>Spin Gapless Quantum Materials and Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A schematic representation of conventional (spin&#8208;FET and 3D spin&#8208;valve based on bulk transport) and a topological spintronic logic device (2D spin&#8208;valve) where topological switching of edge state conductance in a topological Rashba type spin gapless quantum material is implemented via bulk&#8208;boundary&#160;correspondence.








Abstract
Quantum materials, with nontrivial quantum phenomena and mechanisms, promise efficient quantum technologies with enhanced functionalities. Quantum technology is held back because a gap between fundamental science and its implementation is not fully understood yet. In order to capitalize the quantum advantage, a new perspective is required to figure&#160;out and close this gap. In this review, spin gapless quantum materials, featured by fully spin&#8208;polarized bands and the electron/hole transport, are discussed from the perspective of fundamental understanding and device applications. Spin gapless quantum materials can be simulated by minimal two&#8208;band models and could help to understand band structure engineering in various topological quantum materials discovered so far. It is explicitly highlighted that various types of spin gapless band dispersion are fundamental ingredients to understand quantum anomalous Hall effect. Based on conventional transport in the bulk and topological transport on the boundaries, various spintronic device aspects of spin gapless quantum materials as well as their advantages in different models for topological field effect transistors are&#160;reviewed.

         <title>Polymeric Fibers with High Strength and High Toughness at Extreme Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous&#8208;scale polyimide multifibrillar yarn with hierarchically spiral&#8208;oriented structure exhibits a rare combination of high strength and high toughness, even at extreme temperatures ranging from &#8722;196 to 200&#160;&#176;C. These fibers not only surpass the mechanical performance of polymer fibers, Aramid fibers, and dragline spider silks but also stand out among more than 3700 materials.








Abstract
Developing strong and simultaneously tough polymeric materials with excellent thermal stability and mechanical performance even under extreme temperatures is truly a challenge. In a disruptive progress, continuous polymeric yarns are developed with a combination of high tensile strength of (1145 &#177; 44) MPa and ultrahigh toughness of (350 &#177; 24) J g&#8722;1 and high thermomechanical properties from &#8722;196 to 200&#160;&#176;C. The comprehensive thermomechanical performance of this yarn surpasses that of previously developed polymeric materials and dragline spider silks. The results demonstrate that the molecular structure of polyimide (PI) with the incorporation of flexible&#8208;rigid macromolecular, hierarchically spiral&#8208;oriented fibers, and high glass transition temperature (248&#160;&#176;C) are keys for the yarn's notable comprehensive performance in thermomechanical properties. The materials are ideal for technical components exposed to high thermomechanical loadings, such as those encountered in spacecraft or automotive engineering for safety&#8208;critical applications.

         <title>Glutathione&#8208;Scavenging Celastrol&#8208;Cu Nanoparticles Induce Self&#8208;Amplified Cuproptosis for Augmented Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a self&#8208;amplified cuproptosis nanoparticles (Cel&#8208;Cu NP) using celastrol (Cel). In this system, Cel serves as a versatile copper ionophore, exhibiting an ideal coordination capacity toward copper ions without compromising the cuproptosis induction. Notably, Cel can simultaneously scavenge glutathione (GSH) to sensitize cuproptosis. This study provides an efficient nanomedicine by inducing self&#8208;amplified cuproptosis for a robust immune response.








Abstract
Cuproptosis is a novel copper&#8208;dependent programmed cell death. The efficacy of cuproptosis is highly dependent on intracellular copper accumulation and counteracted by a high level of glutathione (GSH) in tumor cells. Here, this work develops a self&#8208;amplified cuproptosis nanoparticles (Cel&#8208;Cu NP) using celastrol (Cel), a natural product isolated from medical plant. In Cel&#8208;Cu NP, Cel serves as a versatile copper ionophore, exhibiting an ideal coordination capacity toward copper ions without compromising the cuproptosis induction. Notably, Cel can simultaneously scavenge GSH content to amplify cuproptosis. Moreover, this self&#8208;amplified cuproptosis further activates immunogenic cell death (ICD) to elicit robust immune response. Combining with immune checkpoint blockade, Cel&#8208;Cu NP effectively eradicates metastatic tumors in a mouse lung metastasis model. This study provides an efficient nanomedicine by inducing self&#8208;amplified cuproptosis for robust immunotherapy.

         <title>Lightweight Electrolyte Design for Li/Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new electrolyte design strategy is introduced with a long&#8208;chain dialkyl ether diluent instead of conventional hydrofluoroethers. A 40% reduction in electrolyte density is achieved, translating into 12%&#8211;20% additional cell&#8208;level energy density. Concurrently, enhanced solvent&#8208;diluent attractive interactions enable more inorganic&#8208;rich interphases, reduce electrolyte loss, and prolong cycle life. The new design also offers good thermal stability and cost&#8208;effectiveness.








Abstract
Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) recently emerges&#160;as a promising cathode for high&#8208;energy lithium (Li) metal batteries owing to its high capacity, extended cycle life, and liberty from costly transition metals. As the high capacities of both Li metal and SPAN lead to relatively small electrode weights, the weight and specific energy density of Li/SPAN batteries are particularly sensitive to electrolyte weight, highlighting the importance of minimizing electrolyte density. Besides, the large volume changes of Li metal anode and SPAN cathode require inorganic&#8208;rich interphases that can guarantee intactness and protectivity throughout long cycles. This work addresses these crucial aspects with an electrolyte design where lightweight dibutyl ether (DBE) is used as a&#160;diluent for concentrated lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide&#160;(LiFSI)&#8208;triethyl phosphate (TEP) solution. The designed electrolyte (d = 1.04&#160;g mL&#8722;1) is 40%&#8211;50% lighter than conventional localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs), leading to 12%&#8211;20% extra energy density at the cell level. Besides, the use of DBE introduces substantial solvent&#8208;diluent affinity, resulting in a unique solvation structure with strengthened capability to form favorable anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich interphases, minimize electrolyte consumption, and improve cell cyclability. The electrolyte also exhibits low volatility and offers good protection to both Li metal anode and SPAN cathode under thermal abuse.

         <title>2D PtRhPb Mesoporous Nanosheets with Surface&#8208;Clean Active Sites for Complete Ethanol Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surfactant&#8208;free strategy is reported to synthesize quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystalline, anisotropic, surface&#8208;clean, 2D PtRhPb mesoporous nanosheets (MNSs). With synergistically structural and compositional advantages, the PtRhPb MNSs disclose impressive electrochemical activity, selectivity, and stability for complete ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) in both three&#8208;electrode and two&#8208;electrode systems.








Abstract
The development of active and selective metal electrocatalysts for complete ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) into desired C1 products is extremely promising for practical application of direct ethanol fuel cells. Despite some encouraging achievements, their activity and selectivity remain unsatisfactory. In this work, it is reported that 2D PtRhPb mesoporous nanosheets (MNSs) with anisotropic structure and surface&#8208;clean metal site&#160;perform perfectly for complete EOR electrocatalysis in both three&#8208;electrode and two&#8208;electrode systems. Different to the traditional routes, a selective etching strategy is developed to produce surface&#8208;clean mesopores while retaining parent anisotropy quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystalline structure without the mesopore&#8208;forming surfactants. This method also allows the general synthesis of surface&#8208;clean mesoporous metals with other compositions and structures. When being performed for alkaline EOR electrocatalysis, the best PtRhPb MNSs deliver remarkably high activity (7.8 A mg&#8722;1) and superior C1 product selectivity (70% of Faradaic efficiency), both of which are much better than reported electrocatalysts. High performance is assigned to multiple structural and compositional synergies that not only stabilized key OHads intermediate by surface&#8208;clean mesopores but also separated the chemisorption of two carbons in ethanol by adjacent Pt and Rh sites, which facilitate the oxidation cleavage of stable C&#9472;C bond for complete EOR electrocatalysis.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells Enabled by Contact&#8208;Resistance&#8208;Tunable Indium Tin Oxide Interlayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Sn&#8208;doped In2O3 interlayer is deposited via electron beam evaporation in this study. By precisely adjusting the Sn content to minimize the contact resistance between the interlayer and the transparent electrode, as well as optimizing energy level alignment, a high&#8208;performance perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell with a certified power conversion efficiency of 30.3% and exceptional long&#8208;term stability is successfully fabricated.








Abstract
The imperfect charge behavior at the interfaces of perovskite/electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL)/transparent conducting oxide (TCO) limits the further performance improvement of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. Herein, an indium tin oxide interlayer is deposited between ETL and TCO to address this issue. Specifically, the interlayer is prepared using an all&#8208;physical and H2O&#8208;free method, electron&#8208;beam evaporation, which can avoid any potential damage to the underlying perovskite and ETL layers. Moreover, the interlayer's composition can be readily tuned by changing the evaporator component, enabling authors to regulate the contact resistance and energy&#8208;level alignment of the ETL/TCO interface. Consequently, the resultant perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells exhibit an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE)&#160;of 30.8% (certified 30.3%). Moreover, the device retains 98% of its initial PCE after continuous operation under ambient conditions for 1078&#160;h, representing one of the most stable and efficient perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells.

It systematically dissects considerations to enhance the rate performance of anode materials, encompassing aspects such as porous engineering, electrolyte desolvation strategies, electrode/electrolyte interphase, electronic conductivity/ion diffusivity, and pseudocapacitive ion storage.

However, the extended charging time and low energy density pose a significant challenge to the widespread use of SIBs in electric vehicles. To overcome this hurdle, there is considerable focus on developing fast&#8208;charging anode materials with rapid Na&#8314; diffusion and superior reaction kinetics. Here, the key factors that limit the fast charging of anode materials are examined, which provides a comprehensive overview of the major advances and fast&#8208;charging characteristics across various anode materials. Specifically, it systematically dissects considerations to enhance the rate performance of anode materials, encompassing aspects such as porous engineering, electrolyte desolvation strategies, electrode/electrolyte interphase, electronic conductivity/ion diffusivity, and pseudocapacitive ion storage. Finally, the direction and prospects for developing fast&#8208;charging anode materials of SIBs are also proposed, aiming to provide a valuable reference for the further advancement of high&#8208;power SIBs.

         <title>Small Additives Make Big Differences: A Review on Advanced Additives for High&#8208;Performance Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries are believed to renovate energy storage devices; however, solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSE) still confront numerous critical issues that must be solved. Incorporating additives in the SSE is a facile, straightforward, and feasible method to resolve the difficulties. This review introduces various additive materials for SSE and comprehensively discusses its working principles.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) metal batteries, represent a significant advancement in energy storage technology, offering higher energy densities and enhanced safety over traditional Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) face critical challenges such as lower ionic conductivity, poor stability at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, and dendrite formation, potentially leading to short circuits and battery failure. The introduction of additives into SSEs has emerged as a transformative approach to address these challenges. A small amount of additives, encompassing a range from inorganic and organic materials to nanostructures, effectively improve ionic conductivity, drawing it nearer to that of their liquid counterparts, and strengthen mechanical properties to prevent cracking of SSEs and maintain stable interfaces. Importantly, they also play a critical role in inhibiting the growth of dendritic Li, thereby enhancing the safety and extending the lifespan of the batteries. In this review, the wide variety of additives that have been investigated, is comprehensively explored, emphasizing how they can be effectively incorporated into SSEs. By dissecting the operational mechanisms of these additives, the review hopes to provide valuable insights that can help researchers in developing more effective SSEs, leading to the creation of more efficient and reliable solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.

         <title>From Bioreactor to Bulk Rheology: Achieving Scalable Production of Highly Concentrated Circular DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA serves as a model polymer system due to its controllable topology and low entanglement threshold. Its application is restricted by expensive production and purification methods. By integrating bioreactor&#8208;based plasmid DNA production with anion exchange chromatography, gram&#8208;scale monodisperse DNA samples are produced. These concentrated DNA solutions facilitate advanced rheological measurements, revealing insights into ring polymers and condensed DNA dynamics.








Abstract
DNA serves as a model system in polymer physics due to its ability to be obtained as a uniform polymer with controllable topology and nonequilibrium behavior. Currently, a major obstacle in the widespread adoption of DNA is obtaining it on a scale and cost basis that accommodates bulk rheology and high&#8208;throughput screening. To address this, recent advancements in bioreactor&#8208;based plasmid DNA production is coupled with anion exchange chromatography producing a unified approach to generating gram&#8208;scale quantities of monodisperse DNA. With this method, 1.1 grams of DNA is obtained per batch to generate solutions with concentrations up to 116&#160;mg mL&#8722;1. This solution of uniform supercoiled and relaxed circular plasmid DNA, is roughly 69 times greater than the overlap concentration. The utility of this method is demonstrated by performing bulk rheology measurements at sample volumes up to 1 mL on DNA of different lengths, topologies, and concentrations. The measured elastic moduli are orders of magnitude larger than those previously reported for DNA and allowed for the construction of a time&#8208;concentration superposition curve that spans 12 decades of frequency. Ultimately, these results can provide important insights into the dynamics of ring polymers and the nature of highly condensed DNA dynamics.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Mediated Neurogenic Signaling: The Impact of Surface Geometry and Chemistry on Neural Cell Behavior for Regenerative and Brain&#8211;Machine Interfacing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface topography and material chemistry are significant extracellular stimuli that influence neural cell behavior to facilitate tissue integration and augment therapeutic outcomes. This review characterizes topographical modifications and surface chemistry on neural cell signaling to improve interface outcomes. The impact of extracellular mediated cues on intracellular signaling cascades provides perspective on the manipulation of neural microenvironments to drive therapeutic success.








Abstract
Nanomaterial advancements have driven progress in central and peripheral nervous system applications such as tissue regeneration and brain&#8211;machine interfacing. Ideally, neural interfaces with native tissue shall seamlessly integrate, a process that is often mediated by the interfacial material properties. Surface topography and material chemistry are significant extracellular stimuli that can influence neural cell behavior to facilitate tissue integration and augment therapeutic outcomes. This review characterizes topographical modifications, including micropillars, microchannels, surface roughness, and porosity, implemented on regenerative scaffolding and brain&#8211;machine interfaces. Their impact on neural cell response is summarized through neurogenic outcome and mechanistic analysis. The effects of surface chemistry on neural cell signaling with common interfacing compounds like carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials, conductive polymers, and biologically inspired matrices are also reviewed. Finally, the impact of these extracellular mediated neural cues on intracellular signaling cascades is discussed to provide perspective on the manipulation of neuron and neuroglia cell microenvironments to drive therapeutic outcomes.

         <title>Boronic Acid&#8208;Rich Lanthanide Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Enable Deep Proteomics with Ultratrace Biological Samples</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteomic coverage is constrained due to complex pretreatments. A hybrid of four boronic acid&#8208;rich lanthanide metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with high protein affinity to capture proteins in ultratrace samples, is introduced. A MOFs Aided Sample Preparation (MASP) workflow that shrinks sample volume and integrates pre&#8208;handle steps into a PCR tube to minimize sample loss caused by non&#8208;specific absorption, is described.








Abstract
Label&#8208;free proteomics is widely used to identify disease mechanism and potential therapeutic targets. However, deep proteomics with ultratrace clinical specimen remains a major technical challenge due to extensive contact loss during complex sample pretreatment. Here, a hybrid of four boronic acid&#8208;rich lanthanide metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with high protein affinity is introduced to capture proteins in ultratrace samples jointly by nitrogen&#8208;boronate complexation, cation&#8208;&#960; and ionic interactions. A MOFs Aided Sample Preparation (MASP) workflow that shrinks sample volume and integrates lysis, protein capture, protein digestion and peptide collection steps into a single PCR tube to minimize sample loss caused by non&#8208;specific absorption, is proposed further. MASP is validated to quantify &#8776;1800 proteins in 10 HEK&#8208;293T cells. MASP is applied to profile cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome from cerebral stroke and brain damaged patients, and identified &#8776;3700 proteins in 1&#160;&#181;L CSF. MASP is further demonstrated to detect &#8776;9600 proteins in as few as 50&#160;&#181;g mouse brain tissues. MASP thus enables deep, scalable, and reproducible proteome on precious clinical samples with low abundant proteins.

         <title>Magnetic Field&#8208;induced Disordered Phase of Spinel Oxides for High Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A locally generated magnetic field from a magnetic coating layer triggered a phase transition in lithium battery material spinal LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 from an ordered to a disordered phase at temperatures as low as 300&#160;&#176;C. This innovative approach enriches the methods for fabricating novel energy materials, enhancing their performance in energy related applications.








Abstract
The disordered phase of spinel LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 (LNMO) is more appealing as high&#8208;voltage cathode due to its superior electrochemical performance compared to its ordered counterpart. Various methods are developed to induce a phase transition. However, the resulting materials often suffer from capacity degradation due to the adverse influence of accompanying Mn3+ ions. This study presents the utilization of local magnetic fields generated by a magnetic Fe3O4 shell to induce a disordered phase transition in LNMO at lower temperature, transitioning it from an order state without significantly increasing the Mn3+ content. The pivotal role played by the local magnetic fields is evidenced through comparisons with samples with nonmagnetic Al2O3 shell, samples subjected to sole heat treatment, and samples heat&#8208;treated within magnetic fields. The key finding is that magnetic fields can initiate a radical pair mechanism, enabling the induction of order&#8208;disorder phase transition even at lower temperatures. The disordered spinal LNMO with a magnetic Fe3O4 shell exhibits excellent cycling stability and kinetic properties in electrochemical characterization as a result. This innovation not only unravels the intricate interplay between the disordered phase and Mn3+ content in the cathode spinel but also pioneers the use of magnetic field effects for manipulating material phases.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Chemo&#8208;Mechanically Stable and Sodiophilic Interface for Na Metal Anode in Liquid&#8208;based and Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;doped nanoscale polymeric film with improved sodiophilic sites and enhanced stiffness is developed by using the molecular layer deposition (MLD) technique. Metal crosslinkers in polymer chains ensure exceptional electrochemical/chemical stability for Na metal anodes, significantly extending lifespan at high current densities. The artificial SEI has effectively suppressed dendrite growth and minimized the accumulation of &#8220;dead Na.&#8221;








Abstract
Na metal batteries (NMBs) are attracting increasing attention because of their high energy density. However, the widespread application of NMBs is hindered by the growth of Na dendrites and interface instability. The design of artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with tuned chemical/electrochemical/mechanical properties is the key to achieving high&#8208;performance NMBs. This work develops a metal&#8208;doped nanoscale polymeric film with tunable composition, sodiophilic sites and improved stiffness. The incorporation of metal crosslinkers in the polymer chains results in exceptional electrochemical stability for Na metal anodes, leading to a significantly prolonged lifespan even at high current densities, which is at the top of the reported literature. The mechanical properties measurements and electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical phase&#8208;field model are performed to interpret the impact of the ionic transportation capability (decoupled mechanical) and mechanic property in the metal&#8208;doped polymer interface. In addition, this approach provides a promising strategy for the rational design of electrode interfaces, providing enhanced mechanical stability and improved sodiophilicity, which can open up opportunities for the fabrication of next&#8208;generation energy storage.

         <title>Intrinsically Safe Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by Thermo&#8208;Electrochemical Compatible In Situ Polymerized Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermo&#8208;electrochemically compatible solid&#8208;state electrolyte is proposed through a functional cross&#8208;linking design coupled with in situ polymerization, significantly enhancing interface stability and thermal safety of LMBs. The LMBs exhibit excellent electrochemical performance at an extremely high working temperature of 130&#160;&#176;C and intrinsic safety, with no thermal runaway observed before 300&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
In situ polymerized solid&#8208;state electrolytes have attracted much attention due to high Li&#8208;ion conductivity, conformal interface contact, and low interface resistance, but are plagued by lithium dendrite, interface degradation, and inferior thermal stability, which thereby leads to limited lifespan and severe safety hazards for high&#8208;energy lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, an in situ polymerized electrolyte is proposed by copolymerization of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane with 1,3,5&#8208;tri glycidyl isocyanurate (TGIC) as a cross&#8208;linking agent, which realizes a synergy of battery thermal safety and interface compatibility with Li anode. Functional TGIC enhances the electrolyte polymeric level. The unique carbon&#8208;formation mechanism facilitates flame retardancy and eliminates the battery fire risk. In the meantime, TGIC&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich interphase inhibits interface side reactions and promotes uniform Li plating. Intrinsically safe LMBs with nonflammability and outstanding electrochemical performances under extreme temperatures (130&#160;&#176;C) are achieved. This functional polymer design shows a promising prospect for the development of safe LMBs.

         <title>Operando Colorations from Real&#8208;Time Growth of 3D&#8208;Printed Nanoarchitectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Considering that most colors fade with time, this work develops an additive approach to diversify colors over time. This color enrichment is realized by operando observation and measurement of the real&#8208;time growth of subwavelength metallic nanoarchitectures during 3D nanoprinting. The dimensions and geometries of these growing nanoarchitectures change in real time, thereby generating a magnificent library of time&#8208;varying colors.








Abstract
While artificial 3D nanostructures can generate precise and flexible coloration, their real&#8208;time color changes during 3D nanoprinting remain unexplored owing&#160;to the inherent challenges of in situ transient measurements and observations. In this study, a 3D&#8208;printing system which supports the operando observation/measurement of the color dynamics of subwavelength metallic nanoarchitectures fabricated in real time is developed and evaluated. During 3D printing, the dimensions and geometries of the 3D nanostructures grow over time, producing a large library of optical spectra associated with real&#8208;time color changes. Only a timer is needed to define the expected colors from a single 3D print run. Fin&#8208;like nanostructures are used to toggle colors based on the polarization effect and produce color gradients. Based on structural coloration, nanoarchitectures are designed and printed to animate desired color patterns. Moreover, the resulting color dynamics can also serve as an operando identifier for real&#8208;time structural information during 3D nanoprinting. A single print run enables the efficient creation of a comprehensive library of desired colorations owing to the flexibility in time&#8208;dependent controllability and 3D geometries at the subwavelength scale. 3D nanoprinted plasmonic structures exhibiting time&#8208;varying colorations (4D printing of colors) uniquely redefines the coloring stategy,&#160;offering considerable potential for numerous&#160;applications.

This color enrichment is realized by operando observation and measurement of the real-time growth of subwavelength metallic nanoarchitectures during 3D nanoprinting. The dimensions and geometries of these growing nanoarchitectures change in real time, thereby generating a magnificent library of time-varying colors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While artificial 3D nanostructures can generate precise and flexible coloration, their real-time color changes during 3D nanoprinting remain unexplored owing&#160;to the inherent challenges of in situ transient measurements and observations. In this study, a 3D-printing system which supports the operando observation/measurement of the color dynamics of subwavelength metallic nanoarchitectures fabricated in real time is developed and evaluated. During 3D printing, the dimensions and geometries of the 3D nanostructures grow over time, producing a large library of optical spectra associated with real-time color changes. Only a timer is needed to define the expected colors from a single 3D print run. Fin-like nanostructures are used to toggle colors based on the polarization effect and produce color gradients. Based on structural coloration, nanoarchitectures are designed and printed to animate desired color patterns. Moreover, the resulting color dynamics can also serve as an operando identifier for real-time structural information during 3D nanoprinting. A single print run enables the efficient creation of a comprehensive library of desired colorations owing to the flexibility in time-dependent controllability and 3D geometries at the subwavelength scale. 3D nanoprinted plasmonic structures exhibiting time-varying colorations (4D printing of colors) uniquely redefines the coloring stategy,&#160;offering considerable potential for numerous&#160;applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Continuous Solar Energy Conversion Windows Integrating Zinc Anode&#8208;Based Electrochromic Device and IoT System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating a zinc anode&#8208;based electrochromic device and an Internet of Things (IoT) system, a novel window system is demonstrated. This window system facilitates the continuous conversion of photovoltaic&#8208;generated electricity to power indoor appliances while also allowing dynamic control of visible and near&#8208;infrared light. These findings open up new opportunities for the development of electrochromic windows.








Abstract
Integration of solar cells and electrochromic windows offers crucial contributions to green buildings. Solar&#8208;charging zinc anode&#8208;based electrochromic devices (ZECDs) present opportunities for addressing the solar intermittency issue. However, the limited energy storage capacity of ZECDs results in wasted harnessing of solar energy as well as overcharging. Herein, spectral&#8208;selective dual&#8208;band ZECDs that continuously transport solar energy to indoor appliances by remotely controlling the repeated bleached&#8208;tinted cycles during the daytime, are reported. Hexagonal phase cesium&#8208;doped tungsten bronze (h&#8208;Cs0.32WO3, CWO) nanocrystals are adopted for dual&#8208;band ZECDs due to their independent control ability of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) and visible (VIS) light transmittance (&#8710;T&#160;=&#160;73.0%, 700&#160;nm; &#8710;T = 83.7%, 1200&#160;nm) and excellent cycling stability (0.8% optical contrast decay at 1200&#160;nm after 10&#160;000 cycles). The prototype device (i.e., CWO//Zn//CWO) delivers extraordinary thermal insulation capability, displaying a 10&#160;&#176;C difference between &#8220;bright&#8221; and &#8220;dark&#8221; modes. Furthermore, an Internet of Things (IoT) controller to control the NIR and VIS lights of the CWO//Zn//CWO window wirelessly with a smartphone, empowering the continuous discharging of the solar&#8208;charged window during the daytime remotely, is developed. Such windows represent an intriguing potential technology whose future impact on green buildings may be substantial.

         <title>Co&#8208;Assembly of Polyoxometalates and Porphyrins as Anode for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article achieves the uniformly dispersion of POMs clusters and porphyrin units through self&#8208;assembly methods. It solves the problems of intrinsic low conductivity, easy aggregation, and poor stability of POMs. Benefiting from the generated sub&#8208;1&#160;nm channels and synergistic effect between POMs and porphyrin, the optimized PMo12/CoTPyP anode exhibits significant improved Li+ storage capability, superior rate, and cycling performance.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) have been considered one of the most promising anode candidates for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) in virtue of their high theoretical capacity and reversible multielectron redox properties. However, the poor intrinsic electronic conductivity, low specific surface area, and high solubility in organic electrolytes hinder their widespread applications in LIBs. Herein, a novel hybrid nanomaterial is synthesized by co&#8208;assembling POMs and porphyrins (PMo12/CoTPyP) through a facile solvothermal method. The POM clusters are stabilized by porphyrin units through electrostatic interactions, which simultaneously realize the uniform dispersion of POMs and porphyrin units. Benefiting from the generated sub&#8208;1&#160;nm channels for fast ion transport and the synergistic effect between evenly distributed PMo12 clusters and high&#8208;conductive CoTPyP units, the LIB based on the optimized PMo12/CoTPyP anode exhibits significantly improved Li+ storage capability as well as superior rate and cycling performance. The results of density functional theory simulations further reveal that the co&#8208;assembly of PMo12 and CoTPyP can accelerate the mobility of Li+ and electrons, which in turn promotes the enhancement of LIBs performance. This work paves a strategy for synthesizing POMs&#8211;based anode materials with simultaneously high dispersibility, redox activity, and stability.

         <title>Electrophysiological Analysis of Retinal Organoid Development Using 3D Microelectrodes of Liquid Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the analysis in the development of retinal ganglion cells in early to mid&#8208;stage retinal organoids, employing high&#8208;resolution 3D printing of liquid&#8208;metal microelectrodes. Through spatiotemporal recording of inner retinal cells and comparison with the matured retina, the features of the retinal organoid provide an electrophysiological similarity to the fetal native retinas.








Abstract
Despite of the substantial potential of human&#8208;derived retinal organoids, the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) during maturation limits their utility in assessing the functionality of later&#8208;born retinal cell subtypes. Additionally, conventional analyses primarily rely on fluorescent emissions, which limits the detection of actual cell functionality while risking damage to the 3D cytoarchitecture of organoids. Here, an electrophysiological analysis is presented to monitor RGC development in early to mid&#8208;stage retinal organoids, and compare distinct features with fully&#8208;mature mouse retina. This approach utilizes high&#8208;resolution 3D printing of liquid&#8208;metal microelectrodes, enabling precise targeting of specific inner retinal layers within organoids. The adaptable distribution and softness of these microelectrodes facilitate the spatiotemporal recording of inner retinal signals. This study not only demonstrates the functional properties of RGCs in retinal organoid development but also provides insights into their synaptic connectivity, reminiscent of fetal native retinas. Further comparison with fully&#8208;mature mouse retina in vivo verifies the organoid features, highlighting the potential of early&#8208;stage retinal organoids in biomedical research.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reinforced MOF&#8208;Based Nanogel Alleviates Osteoarthritis by Long&#8208;Acting Drug Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic nanogel, KZIF@HA, formed through hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between surface&#8208;modified Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) and hyaluronic acid is developed. The nanogel exhibits sustained drug release for one month with minimal leakage risk. ZIF&#8208;8's acid&#8208;degrading properties promote extracellular matrix secretion and M2 macrophage polarization, reversing osteoarthritis progression. Transcriptome sequencing and in vivo experiments confirm KZIF@HA's potential for osteoarthritis treatment.








Abstract
Intra&#8208;articular injection of drugs is an effective strategy for osteoarthritis (OA) treatment. However, the complex microenvironment and limited joint space result in rapid clearance of drugs. Herein, a nanogel&#8208;based strategy is proposed for prolonged drug delivery and microenvironment remodeling. Nanogel is constructed through the functionalization of hyaluronic acid (HA) by amide reaction on the surface of Kartogenin (KGN)&#8208;loaded zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (denoted as KZIF@HA). Leveraging the inherent hydrophilicity of HA, KZIF@HA spontaneously forms nanogels, ensuring extended drug release in the OA microenvironment. KZIF@HA exhibits sustained drug release over one month, with low leakage risk from the joint cavity compared to KZIF, enhanced cartilage penetration, and reparative effects on chondrocytes. Notably, KGN released from KZIF@HA serves to promote extracellular matrix (ECM) secretion for hyaline cartilage regeneration. Zn2+ release reverses OA progression by promoting M2 macrophage polarization to establish an anti&#8208;inflammatory microenvironment. Ultimately, KZIF@HA facilitates cartilage regeneration and OA alleviation within three months. Transcriptome sequencing validates that KZIF@HA stimulates the polarization of M2 macrophages and secretes IL&#8208;10 to inhibit the JNK and ERK pathways, promoting chondrocytes recovery and enhancing ECM remodeling. This pioneering nanogel system offers new therapeutic opportunities for sustained drug release, presenting a significant stride in OA treatment strategies.

         <title>Multicompartment Polyion Complex Micelles Based on Triblock Polypept(o)ides Mediate Efficient siRNA Delivery to Cancer&#8208;Associated Fibroblasts for Antistromal Therapy of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a novel identified target of cancer&#8208;associated fibroblast&#8208;derived microfibrillar&#8208;associated protein 5 (MFAP&#8208;5), ABC&#8208;triblock copolymer&#8208;based multicompartment polyion complex micelle delivers siRNA against MFAP&#8208;5 (siMFAP&#8208;5) and the cationic amphiphilic drug desloratatine simultaneously. The codelivery of DES facilitates intracellular siRNA delivery, resulting in a knockdown of MFAP&#8208;5 and significantly reduced&#160;tumor burden in a mice model of hepatocellular carcinoma.








Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent type of primary liver cancer and the third leading cause for cancer&#8208;related death worldwide. The tumor is difficult&#8208;to&#8208;treat due to its inherent resistance to chemotherapy. Antistromal therapy is a novel therapeutic approach, targeting cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAF) in the tumor microenvironment. CAF&#8208;derived microfibrillar&#8208;associated protein 5 (MFAP&#8208;5) is identified as a novel target for antistromal therapy of HCC with high translational relevance. Biocompatible polypept(o)ide&#8208;based polyion complex micelles (PICMs) constructed with a triblock copolymer composed of a cationic poly(l&#8208;lysine) complexing anti&#8208;MFAP&#8208;5 siRNA (siMFAP&#8208;5) via electrostatic interaction, a poly(&#947;&#8208;benzyl&#8208;l&#8208;glutamate) block loading cationic amphiphilic drug desloratatine (DES) via &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#160;interaction as endosomal escape enhancer and polysarcosine poly(N&#8208;methylglycine) for introducing stealth properties, are generated for siRNA delivery. Intravenous injection of siMFAP&#8208;5/DES PICMs significantly reduces the hepatic tumor burden in a syngeneic implantation model of HCC, with a superior MFAP&#8208;5 knockdown effect over siMFAP&#8208;5 PICMs or lipid nanoparticles. Transcriptome and histological analysis reveal that MFAP&#8208;5 knockdown inhibited CAF&#8208;related tumor vascularization, suggesting the anti&#8208;angiogenic effect of RNA interference therapy. In conclusion, multicompartment PICMs combining siMFAP&#8208;5 and DES in a single polypept(o)ide micelle induce a specific knockdown of MFAP&#8208;5 and demonstrate a potent antitumor efficacy (80% reduced tumor burden vs untreated control) in a clinically relevant HCC model.

         <title>Electrolytes for Sodium Ion Batteries: The Current Transition from Liquid to Solid and Hybrid systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review underscores the evolving shift from liquid electrolytes to solid and quasi&#8208;solid systems in NIBs, revealing that while considerable progress has been achieved, significant challenges remain to achieve commercial viability. Special emphasis is placed on elucidating the operational principles of solid&#8208;state batteries, spanning from truly solid&#8208;state electrolytes to hybrid polymer electrolytes, and ultimately to single sodium&#8208;ion conductors.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs) have recently garnered significant interest in being employed alongside conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries, particularly in applications where cost and sustainability are particularly relevant. The rapid progress in NIBs will undoubtedly expedite the commercialization process. In this regard, tailoring and designing electrolyte formulation is a top priority, as they profoundly influence the overall electrochemical performance and thermal, mechanical, and dimensional stability. Moreover, electrolytes play a critical role in determining the system's safety level and overall lifespan. This review delves into recent electrolyte advancements from liquid (organic and ionic liquid) to solid and quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte (dry, hybrid, and single ion conducting electrolyte) for NIBs, encompassing comprehensive strategies for electrolyte design across various materials, systems, and their functional applications. The objective is to offer strategic direction for the systematic production of safe electrolytes and to investigate the potential applications of these designs in real&#8208;world scenarios while thoroughly assessing the current obstacles and forthcoming prospects within this rapidly evolving field.

         <title>Beyond Metallic Electrode: Spontaneous Formation of Fluidic Electrodes from Operational Liquid in Highly Functional Droplet&#8208;Based Electricity Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study involves substituting metallic electrodes in the droplet&#8208;based electricity generator (DEG) with conductive fluidic electrodes, which is spontaneously formed during the operation of DEG with operating liquid. Considering the superior optical transmittance and fluidity of the water, functionalities such as transparency, bendability, and stretchability can be assigned onto the DEG, and it can broaden its practical applications.








Abstract
The droplet&#8208;based electricity generator (DEG) has facilitated efficient droplet energy harvesting, yet diversifying its applications necessitates the incorporation of various to the DEG. This study first proposes a methodology for advancing the DEG by substituting its conventional metallic electrode with electrically conductive water electrode&#160;(WE), which is spontaneously generated during the operation of the DEG with operating liquid. Due to the inherent conductive and fluidic nature of water, the introduction of the WE&#160;maintains the electrical output performance of the DEG while imparting functionalities such as high transparency and flexibility. So, the resultant WE&#160;applied DEG (WE&#8208;DEG) exhibits high optical transmittance (&#8776;99%) and retains its electricity&#8208;generating capability under varying deformations, including bending and stretching. This innovation expands the versatility of the DEG, and especially, a sun&#8208;raindrop dual&#8208;mode energy harvester is demonstrated by hybridizing the WE&#8208;DEG and photovoltaic (PV) cell. This hybridization effectively addresses the weather&#8208;dependent limitations inherent in each energy harvester and enhances the temperature&#8208;induced inefficiencies typically observed in PV cells, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency. The introduction of the WE&#160;will be poised to catalyze new developments in DEG research, paving the way for broader applicability and enhanced efficiency in droplet energy harvesting technologies.

         <title>Microporous Materials in Polymer Electrolytes: The Merit of Order</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manufacturing of solid&#8208;state batteries depends on the development of suitable solid&#8208;state electrolytes. One potential solution is to develop composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) that combine the strengths of inorganic fillers and polymer electrolytes. The recent advances made in the development of CPE chemistry and technology enabled by ordered microporous materials, including metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, and zeolites, are summarized.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) have garnered significant attention in the critical field of sustainable energy storage due to their potential benefits in safety, energy density, and cycle life. The large&#8208;scale, cost&#8208;effective production of SSBs necessitates the development of high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolytes. However, the manufacturing of SSBs relies heavily on the advancement of suitable solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs), which combine the advantages of ordered microporous materials (OMMs) and polymer electrolytes, meet the requirements for high ionic conductivity/transference number, stability with respect to electrodes, compatibility with established manufacturing processes, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, making them particularly well&#8208;suited for mass production of SSBs. This review delineates how structural ordering dictates the fundamental physicochemical properties of OMMs, including ion transport, thermal transfer, and mechanical stability. The applications of prominent OMMs are critically examined, such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, and zeolites, in CPEs, highlighting how structural ordering facilitates the fulfillment of property requirements. Finally, an outlook on the field is provided, exploring how the properties of CPEs can be enhanced through the dimensional design of OMMs, and the importance of uncovering the underlying &#8220;feature&#8208;function&#8221; mechanisms of various CPE types is underscored.

         <title>High&#8208;Lactate&#8208;Metabolizing Photosynthetic Bacteria Reprogram Tumor Immune Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lactate has emerged as a critical immunosuppressive factor within the tumor microenvironment, greatly impeding the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Hence, depriving lactate provides a favorable strategy to reprogram tumor immune microenvironment (TIM). This research suggests that LAB&#8208;1 is capable of colonizing TIM and sustaining a long&#8208;term reduction in lactate concentration. Single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals that lactate metabolism efficiently reprograms TIM.








Abstract
The elevated levels of lactate in tumor tissue play a pivotal role in fostering an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Therefore, efficiently reducing lactate levels to reprogram tumor immune microenvironment (TIM) is considered a crucial step for boosted immunotherapy. Here, a high&#8208;lactate&#8208;metabolizing photosynthetic bacteria (LAB&#8208;1) is selectively screened for TIM reprogramming, which then improves the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy. The culture medium for LAB&#8208;1 screening is initially developed through an orthogonal experiment, simulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) and utilizing lactate as the sole organic carbon source. As demonstrated in a murine 4T1 model, LAB&#8208;1 colonizes the TME selectively, resulting in a significant reduction in lactate levels and a subsequent increase in pH values within the tumor tissue. Furthermore, single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals that LAB&#8208;1 effectively reprograms the TIM, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of antitumor immune therapy. This approach of utilizing lactate&#8208;consuming bacteria represents a potent tool for augmenting tumor immunotherapy efficiency.

The culture medium for LAB-1 screening is initially developed through an orthogonal experiment, simulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) and utilizing lactate as the sole organic carbon source. As demonstrated in a murine 4T1 model, LAB-1 colonizes the TME selectively, resulting in a significant reduction in lactate levels and a subsequent increase in pH values within the tumor tissue. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals that LAB-1 effectively reprograms the TIM, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of antitumor immune therapy. This approach of utilizing lactate-consuming bacteria represents a potent tool for augmenting tumor immunotherapy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Augmented Magnetism of Lanthanide&#8208;Doped Nanoparticles and Enabling Magnetic Levitation&#8208;Based Exosome Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is discovered that the magnetism of the Gd&#8208;doped nanoparticles can be significantly augmented by increasing the particle concentration in a confined space. This finding enables a magnetic levitation system for target exosome sensing that is capable of distinguishing breast cancer patients and healthy people's blood samples, holding potential in exosome&#8208;based clinical diagnosis.








Abstract
Due to the presence of unpaired electron orbitals in most lanthanide ions, lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles (LnNPs) exhibit paramagnetism. However, as to biosensing applications, the magnetism of LnNPs is so weak that can hardly be employed in target separation. Herein, it is discovered that the magnetism of the LnNPs is highly associated with their concentration in a confined space, enabling aggregation&#8208;augmented magnetism to make them susceptive to a conventional magnet. Accordingly, a magnetic levitation (Maglev) sensing system is designed, in which the target exosomes can specifically introduce paramagnetic LnNPs to the microbeads&#8217; surface, allowing aggregation&#8208;augmented magnetism and further leverage the microbeads&#8217; levitation height in the Maglev device to indicate the target exosomes' content. It is demonstrated that this Maglev system can precisely distinguish healthy people's blood samples from those of breast cancer patients. This is the first work to report that LnNPs hold great promise in magnetic separation&#8208;based biological sample sorting, and the LnNP&#8208;permitted Maglev sensing system is proven to be promising for establishing a new generation of biosensing devices.

         <title>Highly Regular Layered Structure via Dual&#8208;Spatially&#8211;Confined Alignment of Nanosheets Enables High&#8208;Performance Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To minimize the internal defects of layered assemblies to exploit the intrinsic mechanics of nanosheets, a dual&#8208;scale spatially confined strategy for co&#8208;assembly of different&#8208;sized nanosheets into a near&#8208;perfect layered structure is proposed. Benefiting from the precise alignment of different&#8208;sized nanosheets, efficient cross&#8208;scale stress transfer between nanosheets and matrix is achieved, resulting in layered nanocomposites with multiscale mechanical enhancement.








Abstract
Assembling ultrathin nanosheets into layered structure represents one promising way to fabricate high&#8208;performance nanocomposites. However, how to minimize the internal defects of the layered assemblies to fully exploit the intrinsic mechanical superiority of nanosheets remains challenging. Here, a dual&#8208;scale spatially confined strategy for the co&#8208;assembly of ultrathin nanosheets with different aspect ratios into a near&#8208;perfect layered structure is developed. Large&#8208;aspect&#8211;ratio (LAR) nanosheets are aligned due to the microscale confined space of a flat microfluidic channel, small&#8208;aspect&#8211;ratio (SAR) nanosheets are aligned due to the nanoscale confined space between adjacent LAR nanosheets. During this co&#8208;assembly process, SAR nanosheets can flatten LAR nanosheets, thus reducing wrinkles and pores of the assemblies. Benefiting from the precise alignment (orientation degree of 90.74%) of different&#8208;sized nanosheets, efficient stress transfer between nanosheets and interlayer matrix is achieved, resulting in layered nanocomposites with multiscale mechanical enhancement and superior fatigue durability (100&#160;000 bending cycles). The proposed co&#8208;assembly strategy can be used to orderly integrate high&#8208;quality nanosheets with different sizes or diverse functions toward high&#8208;performance or multifunctional nanocomposites.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Induced Memristor of Chiral Nanostructured Half&#8208;Metallic Fe3O4 Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral nanostructured half&#8208;metallic Fe3O4 is synthesized on fluorine tin oxide (FTO) substrates via a chiral molecule&#8208;assisted hydrothermal route. By harnessing the half&#8208;metallic properties of Fe3O4 crystals and the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, chirality&#8208;induced memristor behaviors are achieved in these films at 100 K.








Abstract
Spintronic memristors, which combine the nonvolatile characteristics of memristors with the scalability of a spin&#8208;transfer torque device, are expected to play a crucial role in advancing quantitative information processing. This field commonly relies on magnetic tunnel junctions, domain wall motion, and spin waves. Here, the discovery of chirality&#8208;induced memristor behavior in chiral nanostructured Fe3O4 films (CNFFs) is reported. These CNFFs are grown on fluorine tin oxide (FTO) substrates using enantiomeric glutamic acid (Glu) as symmetry&#8208;breaking agents and consist of arrays of oriented twisted nanofibers. At 100 K, the L&#8208;CNFF exhibits memristor behavior as a pinched hysteresis loop in the I&#8208;V curve, while the D&#8208;CNFF exhibits semiconductor behavior with constant electrical resistance. The intrinsic spin polarization of half&#8208;metallic Fe3O4 and the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) are speculated to contribute to the memristor in one handedness of the chiral structure. These findings present a novel spinristor that combines the functions of a memristor and a spin&#8208;filter based on chiral structures, which may promote the development of spintronic devices.

         <title>Digital Light 3D Printing of Double Thermoplastics with Customizable Mechanical Properties and Versatile Reprocessability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Digital light 3D printing of thermoplastics with customizable mechanical properties and versatile reprocessability is realized by sequentially constructing stiff and flexible double linear polymers. The obtained 3D double thermoplastics exhibit tunable mechanical properties from rigid to flexible, as well as multiple reprocessability such as self&#8208;healing and reprinting, demonstrating potential applications in soft robotics and soft electronics.








Abstract
Digital light processing (DLP) is a 3D printing technology offering high resolution and speed. Printable materials are commonly based on multifunctional monomers, resulting in the formation of thermosets that usually cannot be reprocessed or recycled. Some efforts are made in DLP 3D printing of thermoplastic materials. However, these materials exhibit limited and poor mechanical properties. Here, a new strategy is presented for DLP 3D printing of thermoplastics based on a sequential construction of two linear polymers with contrasting (stiff and flexible) mechanical properties. The inks consist of two vinyl monomers, which lead to the stiff linear polymer, and &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid, which forms the flexible linear polymer via thermal ring&#8208;opening polymerization in a second step. By varying the ratio of stiff and flexible linear polymers, the mechanical properties can be tuned with Young's modulus ranging from 1.1&#160;GPa to 0.7&#160;MPa, while the strain at break increased from 4% to 574%. Furthermore, these printed thermoplastics allow for a variety of reprocessability pathways including self&#8208;healing, solvent casting, reprinting, and closed&#8208;loop recycling of the flexible polymer, contributing to the development of a sustainable materials economy. Last, the potential of the new material in applications ranging from soft robotics to electronics is demonstrated.

         <title>Reviving Fatigue Surface for Solid&#8208;State Upcycling of Highly Degraded Polycrystalline LiNi1&#8208;x&#8208;yCoxMnyO2 Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The passivated rock salt surface is diagnosed as the obstacle of the crystal growth during solid&#8208;state calcination. This work retrieves the crystal growth activity of the highly degraded polycrystalline LiNi1&#8208;x&#8208;yCoxMnyO2 cathodes and achieves the regenerated single&#8208;crystalline cathodes via a universal solid&#8208;state upcycling strategy. The upcycled cathodes exhibit superior electrochemical properties over both the pristine and regenerated polycrystalline materials.








Abstract
The ongoing tide of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) urgently calls for high&#8208;value output in efficient recycling. Recently, direct regeneration has emerged as a novel recycling strategy but fails to repair the irreversible morphology and structure damage of the highly degraded polycrystalline layered oxide materials. Here, this work carries out a solid&#8208;state upcycling study for the severely cracked LiNi1&#8208;x&#8208;yCoxMnyO2 cathodes. The specific single&#8208;crystallization process during calcination is investigated and the surface rock salt phase is recognized as the intrinsic obstacle to the crystal growth of the degraded cathodes due to sluggish diffusion in the heterogeneous grain boundary. Accordingly, this work revives the fatigue rock salt phase by restoring a layered surface and successfully reshapes severely broken cathodes into the high&#8208;performance single&#8208;crystalline particles. Benefiting from morphological and structural integrity, the upcycled single&#8208;crystalline cathode materials exhibit an enhanced capacity retention rate of 93.5% after 150 cycles at 1C compared with 61.7% of the regenerated polycrystalline materials. The performance is also beyond that of the commercial cathodes even under a high cut&#8208;off voltage (4.5&#160;V) or high operating temperature (45&#160;&#176;C).

     alt="Reviving Fatigue Surface for Solid-State Upcycling of Highly Degraded Polycrystalline LiNi1-x-yCoxMnyO2 Cathodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passivated rock salt surface is diagnosed as the obstacle of the crystal growth during solid-state calcination. This work retrieves the crystal growth activity of the highly degraded polycrystalline LiNi&lt;sub&gt;1-x-y&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes and achieves the regenerated single-crystalline cathodes via a universal solid-state upcycling strategy. The upcycled cathodes exhibit superior electrochemical properties over both the pristine and regenerated polycrystalline materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ongoing tide of spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) urgently calls for high-value output in efficient recycling. Recently, direct regeneration has emerged as a novel recycling strategy but fails to repair the irreversible morphology and structure damage of the highly degraded polycrystalline layered oxide materials. Here, this work carries out a solid-state upcycling study for the severely cracked LiNi&lt;sub&gt;1-x-y&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes. The specific single-crystallization process during calcination is investigated and the surface rock salt phase is recognized as the intrinsic obstacle to the crystal growth of the degraded cathodes due to sluggish diffusion in the heterogeneous grain boundary. Accordingly, this work revives the fatigue rock salt phase by restoring a layered surface and successfully reshapes severely broken cathodes into the high-performance single-crystalline particles. Benefiting from morphological and structural integrity, the upcycled single-crystalline cathode materials exhibit an enhanced capacity retention rate of 93.5% after 150 cycles at 1C compared with 61.7% of the regenerated polycrystalline materials. The performance is also beyond that of the commercial cathodes even under a high cut-off voltage (4.5&#160;V) or high operating temperature (45&#160;&#176;C). This work provides scientific insights for the upcycling of the highly degraded cathodes in spent LIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Perovskite Fibre Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article presents the development of fibre&#8208;based photodetectors using rolled graphene layers and perovskites, achieving high external responsivity (&#8764;22 kAW&#8208;1 at 488 nm) and fast response times (&#8764;9 ms). These photodetectors maintain performance after 30 wash cycles (&#8764;72% photocurrent), suitable for wearable applications.








Abstract
The integration of optoelectronic devices, such as transistors and photodetectors (PDs), into wearables and textiles is of great interest for applications such as healthcare and physiological monitoring. These require flexible/wearable systems adaptable to body motions, thus materials conformable to non&#8208;planar surfaces, and able to maintain performance under mechanical distortions. Here, fibre PDs are prepared by combining rolled graphene layers and photoactive perovskites. Conductive fibres (~500 &#937;cm&#8208;1) are made by rolling single&#8208;layer graphene (SLG) around silica fibres, followed by deposition of a dielectric layer (Al2O3 and parylene C), another rolled SLG as a channel, and perovskite as photoactive component. The resulting gate&#8208;tunable PD has a response time~9ms, with an external responsivity~22kAW&#8208;1 at 488nm for a 1V bias. The external responsivity is two orders of magnitude higher, and the response time one order of magnitude faster, than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art wearable fibre&#8208;based PDs. Under bending at 4mm radius, up to~80% photocurrent is maintained. Washability tests show~72% of initial photocurrent after 30 cycles, promising for wearable&#160;applications.

         <title>Voltage&#8208;Driven Fluorine Motion for Novel Organic Spintronic Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work discovers the voltage&#8208;driven fluorine (F) motion in the La0.6Sr0.4MnO3(LSMO)/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/Co junction, which can generate a huge reversible resistivity change up to 106% with ns timescale upon polarizing voltage. Removing F from PVDF layer also significantly enhances the tunneling magnetoresistance, paving the way to develop multifunctional organic spintronic memristor for storage and neuromorphic applications.








Abstract
Integrating tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect in memristors is a long&#8208;term aspiration because it allows to realize multifunctional devices, such as multi&#8208;state memory and tunable plasticity for synaptic function. However, the reported TMR in different multiferroic tunnel junctions is limited to 100%. This work demonstrates a giant TMR of &#8722;266% in La0.6Sr0.4MnO3(LSMO)/poly(vinylidene fluoride)(PVDF)/Co memristor with thin organic barrier. Different from the ferroelectricity&#8208;based memristors, this work discovers that the voltage&#8208;driven florine (F) motion in the junction generates a huge reversible resistivity change up to 106% with nanosecond (ns) timescale. Removing F from PVDF layer suppresses the dipole field in the tunneling barrier, thereby significantly enhances the TMR. Furthermore, the TMR can be tuned by different polarizing voltage due to the strong modification of spin&#8208;polarization at the LSMO/PVDF interface upon F doping. Combining of high TMR in the organic memristor paves the way to develop high&#8208;performance multifunctional devices for storage and neuromorphic applications.

         <title>Reactive Oxygen Species Responsive Multifunctional Fusion Extracellular Nanovesicles: Prospective Treatments for Acute Heart Transplant Rejection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multifunctional fusion extracellular nanovesicles carrying rapamycin (FNVs@RAPA) are developed by combining Exocarpium Citri grandis&#8208;derived nanovesicles (ENVs) with anti&#8208;inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and mesenchymal stem cell&#8208;derived nanovesicles expressing Calreticulin (CNVs) with macrophage&#8208;targeting ability. A novel reactive oxygen species&#8208;responsive bio&#8208;orthogonal chemistry approach facilitates the active targeting delivery of FNVs@RAPA to the heart graft site, effectively alleviating acute rejection stage complications.








Abstract
Heart transplantation offers life&#8208;saving treatment for patients with end&#8208;stage heart failure; however, ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (IRI) and subsequent immune responses remain significant challenges. Current therapies primarily target adaptive immunity, with limited options available for addressing IRI and innate immune activation. Although plant&#8208;derived vesicle&#8208;like nanoparticles show promise in managing diseases, their application in organ transplantation complications is unexplored. Here, this work develops a novel reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive multifunctional fusion extracellular nanovesicles carrying rapamycin (FNVs@RAPA) to address early IRI and Ly6C+Ly6G&#8722; inflammatory macrophage&#8208;mediated rejection in heart transplantation. The FNVs comprise Exocarpium Citri grandis&#8208;derived extracellular nanovesicles with anti&#8208;inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and mesenchymal stem cell membrane&#8208;derived nanovesicles expressing calreticulin with macrophage&#8208;targeting ability. A novel ROS&#8208;responsive bio&#8208;orthogonal chemistry approach facilitates the active targeting delivery of FNVs@RAPA to the heart graft site, effectively alleviating IRI and promoting the polarization of Ly6C+Ly6G&#8722; inflammatory macrophages toward an anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype. Hence, FNVs@RAPA represents a promising therapeutic approach for mitigating early transplantation complications and immune rejection. The fusion&#8208;targeted delivery strategy offers superior heart graft site enrichment and macrophage&#8208;specific targeting, promising improved transplant outcomes.

         <title>Organic Semiconductor&#8208;BiVO4 Tandem Devices for Solar&#8208;Driven H2O and CO2 Splitting</title>

Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices offer a promising platform towards direct solar light harvesting and chemical storage. However, most prototypes employ wide bandgap semiconductors, moisture&#8208;sensitive inorganic light absorbers, or corrosive electrolytes. Here, we introduce the design and assembly of PEC devices based on an organic donor&#8208;acceptor bulk heterojunction (BHJ), which demonstrate long&#8208;term H2 evolution and CO2 reduction in benign aqueous media using a carbon&#8208;based encapsulant. Accordingly, PCE10:EH&#8208;IDTBR photocathodes display long&#8208;term H2 production for 300&#160;h in a near&#8208;neutral pH solution, whereas photocathodes with a molecular CO2 reduction catalyst attain a CO:H2 selectivity of 5.41&#177;0.53 under 0.1 sun irradiation. Their early onset potentials enable the construction of PCE10:EH&#8208;IDTBR &#8211; BiVO4 artificial leaves, which couple unassisted syngas production with O2 evolution in a reactor completely powered by sunlight, sustaining a 1:1 ratio of CO to H2 over 96&#160;h of operation.

         <title>Ordered Transfer from 3D&#8208;oriented MOF Superstructures to Polymeric Films: Microfabrication, Enhanced Chemical Stability, and Anisotropic Fluorescent Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Films and patterns of 3D&#8208;oriented metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) afford well&#8208;ordered pore structures extending across centimeter&#8208;scale areas. These macroscopic domains of aligned pores are pivotal to enhance diffusion along specific pathways and orient functional guests. The anisotropic properties emerging from this alignment are beneficial for applications in ion conductivity and photonics. However, the structure of 3D&#8208;oriented MOF films and patterns can rapidly degrade under humid and acidic conditions. Thus, more durable 3D&#8208;ordered porous systems are desired for practical applications. Here, oriented porous polymer films and patterns are prepared by using heteroepitaxially oriented N3&#8208;functionalized MOF films as precursor materials. The film fabrication protocol utilizes an azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition on the Cu2(AzBPDC)2DABCO MOF. The micropatterning protocol exploits the X&#8208;ray sensitivity of azide groups in Cu2(AzBPDC)2DABCO, enabling selective degradation in the irradiated areas. The masked regions of the MOF film retain their N3&#8208;functionality, allowing for subsequent cross&#8208;linking through azide&#8208;alkyne coupling. Subsequent acidic treatment removes the Cu ions from the MOF, yielding porous polymer micro&#8208;patterns. The polymer has high chemical stability and shows an anisotropic fluorescent response. The use of 3D&#8208;oriented MOF systems as precursors for the fabrication of oriented porous polymers will facilitate the progress of optical components for photonic applications.

         <title>From Lab to Application: Challenges and Opportunities in Achieving Fast Charging with Polyanionic Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), recognized for balanced energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness, are positioned as a promising complement to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) and a substitute for lead&#8208;acid batteries, particularly in low&#8208;speed electric vehicles and large&#8208;scale energy storage. Despite their extensive potential, concerns about range anxiety due to lower energy density underscore the importance of fast&#8208;charging technologies, which drives the exploration of high&#8208;rate electrode materials. Polyanionic cathode materials are emerging as promising candidates in this regard. However, their intrinsic limitation in electronic conductivity poses challenges for synchronized electron and ion transport, hindering their suitability for fast&#8208;charging applications. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of sodium ion migration during charging/discharging, highlighting it as a critical rate&#8208;limiting step for fast charging. By delving into intrinsic dynamics, we identify and summarize key factors that constrain fast&#8208;charging characteristics. Innovative modification routes are then introduced, with a focus on shortening migration paths and increasing diffusion coefficients, providing detailed insights into feasible strategies. Moreover, the discussion extends beyond half cells to full cells, addressing challenges and opportunities in transitioning polyanionic materials from the laboratory to practical applications. This review aims to offer valuable insights into the development of high&#8208;rate polyanionic cathodes, acknowledging their pivotal role in advancing fast&#8208;charging SIBs.

         <title>Conformal Neuromorphic Bioelectronics for Sense Digitalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sense digitalization, the process of transforming sensory experiences into digital data, is an emerging research frontier that links the physical world with human perception and interaction. This field is largely inspired by the adaptability, fault tolerance, robustness, and energy efficiency inherent in biological senses, driving the development of numerous innovative digitalization techniques. Among these techniques, neuromorphic bioelectronics, characterized by biomimetic adaptability, stand out for their seamless bidirectional interactions with biological entities through stimulus&#8208;response and feedback loops, incorporating bio&#8208;neuromorphic intelligence for information exchange. This review illustrates recent progress in sensory digitalization, encompassing not only the digital representation of physical sensations such as touch, light, and temperature, correlating to tactile, visual, and thermal perceptions, but also the detection of biochemical stimuli such as gases, ions, and neurotransmitters, mirroring olfactory, gustatory, and neural processes. It thoroughly examines the material design, device manufacturing, and system integration, offering detailed insights. However, the field faces significant challenges, including the development of new device/system paradigms, forging genuine connections with biological systems, ensuring compatibility with the semiconductor industry, and overcoming the absence of standardization. Looking ahead, the ambition is to realize biocompatible neural prosthetics, exoskeletons, soft humanoid robots, and cybernetic devices that integrate smoothly with both biological tissues and artificial components, bridging the gap between organic and synthetic realms.

         <title>High&#8208;Fidelity Bioelectrodes with Bidirectional Ion&#8208;Electron Transduction Capability by Integrating Multiple Charge&#8208;Transfer Processes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Bioelectronics is an exciting field that bridges the gap between physiological activities and external electronic devices, striving for high resolution, high conformability, scalability, and ease of integration. One crucial component in bioelectronics is bioelectrodes, designed to convert neural activity into electronic signals or vice versa. Previously reported bioelectrodes have struggled to meet several essential requirements simultaneously: high&#8208;fidelity signal transduction, high charge injection capability, strain resistance, and multi&#8208;functionality. This work introduces a novel strategy for fabricating superior bioelectrodes by merging multiple charge&#8208;transfer processes. The resulting bioelectrodes offer accurate ion&#8208;to&#8208;electron transduction for capturing electrophysiological signals, dependable charge injection capability for neuromodulation, consistent electrode potential for artifact rejection and biomolecule sensing, and high transparency for seamless integration with optoelectronics. Furthermore, the bioelectrode can be designed to be strain&#8208;insensitive by isolating signal transduction from electron transportation. The innovative concept presented in this work holds great promise for extending to other electrode materials and paves the way for the advancement of multimodal bioelectronics.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;induced Magnet&#8208;free Spin Generation in a Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrical generation and transduction of polarized electron spins in semiconductors are of central interest in spintronics and quantum information science. While spin generation in semiconductors has been frequently realized via electrical injection from a ferromagnet, there are significant advantages in nonmagnetic pathways of creating spin polarization. One such pathway exploits the interplay of electron spin with chirality in electronic structures or real space. Here, utilizing chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS), we demonstrate efficient creation of spin accumulation in n&#8208;doped GaAs via electric current injection from a normal metal (Au) electrode through a self&#8208;assembled monolayer of chiral molecules (&#945;&#8208;helix L&#8208;polyalanine, AHPA&#8208;L). The resulting spin polarization is detected as a Hanle effect in the n&#8208;GaAs, which is found to obey a distinct universal scaling with temperature and bias current consistent with chirality&#8208;induced spin accumulation. The experiment constitutes a definitive observation of CISS in a fully nonmagnetic device structure and demonstration of its ability to generate spin accumulation in a conventional semiconductor. The results thus place key constraints on the physical mechanism of CISS and present a new scheme for magnet&#8208;free semiconductor spintronics.

         <title>Large Non&#8208;Hysteretic Volume Magnetostriction in a Strong and Ductile High&#8208;Entropy Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rapid development of smart technologies poses a big challenge for magnetostrictive materials, which should not only permit isotropic and hysteresis&#8208;free actuation (i.e., non&#8208;hysteretic volume change) in magnetic fields, but also have high strength and high ductility. Unfortunately, the magnetostriction from self&#8208;assembly of ferromagnetic domains is volume&#8208;conserving; the volume magnetostriction from field&#8208;induced first&#8208;order phase transition has large intrinsic hysteresis; and most prototype magnetostrictive materials are intrinsically brittle. Here we report a magnetic high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) Fe35Co35Al10Cr10Ni10 that can rectify these challenges, exhibiting an unprecedented combination of large non&#8208;hysteretic volume magnetostriction, high tensile strength and large elongation strain, over a wide working temperature range from room temperature down to 100 K. Its exceptional properties stem from a dual&#8208;phase microstructure, where the face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (FCC) matrix phase with nano&#8208;scale compositional and structural fluctuations can enable a magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;induced transition from low&#8208;spin small&#8208;volume state to high&#8208;spin large&#8208;volume state, and the ordered body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) B2 phase contributes to mechanical strengthening. The present findings may provide insights into designing unconventional and technologically&#8208;important magnetostrictive materials.

Its exceptional properties stem from a dual-phase microstructure, where the face-centered-cubic (FCC) matrix phase with nano-scale compositional and structural fluctuations can enable a magnetic-field-induced transition from low-spin small-volume state to high-spin large-volume state, and the ordered body-centered-cubic (BCC) B2 phase contributes to mechanical strengthening. The present findings may provide insights into designing unconventional and technologically-important magnetostrictive materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Uniform, Fully Connected, High&#8208;quality Monocrystalline Freestanding Perovskite Oxide Films Fabricated from Recyclable Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Releasing epitaxial perovskite oxide films from their native oxide substrates produces high quality, two&#8208;dimensional&#8208;material&#8208;like monocrystalline freestanding oxide membranes, as potential key components for the next&#8208;generation electronic devices. Two major obstacles still limit their practical applications: macroscopic material defects (mainly cracks) that lowers uniformity and yield, and the high cost of the consumed oxide substrates. Here, a two&#8208;step film transfer method and a substrate recycling method enable repetitive fabrication of millimeter&#8208;scale, fully&#8208;connected freestanding oxide films of various chemical compositions from the same substrates; arrays of capacitor and resistor devices based on these oxides transferred on silicon indicate high uniformity, low sample&#8208;to&#8208;sample variation and satisfactory electrical connectivity. The two&#8208;step transfer suppresses crack formation by avoiding buckling&#8208;delamination&#8208;type relaxation of epitaxial strain, and the key point to achieve substrate reuse is to remove the residual Al species bonded to the substrate surfaces. The mitigation of such long&#8208;lasting issues in freestanding oxide fabrication techniques may eventually pave roads towards future industrial&#8208;grade devices, as well as enabling many research opportunities in fundamental physics.

         <title>Ultrafast dynamics of Bloch surface wave polaritons in large&#8208;area 2D semiconductor monolayers at room temperature</title>

Abstract
The dynamics of strongly coupled polariton systems integrated with two&#8208;dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is key to enabling efficient coherent processes and achieving high&#8208;performance TMD&#8208;based polaritonic devices such as ultralow&#8208;threshold polariton lasers and ultrafast optical switches. However, there has been a lack of a comprehensive understanding of the excited state dynamics in TMD&#8208;based polariton systems. In this work, we use ultrafast pump&#8208;probe optical spectroscopy to investigate the room&#8208;temperature dynamics of the polariton systems consisting of TMD monolayer excitons strongly coupled with Bloch surface waves (BSWs) supported by all&#8208;dielectric photonic structures. The transient response is found for both above&#8208;exciton energy pumping and polariton&#8208;resonant pumping. We observe the excited state population and ultrafast coherent coupling of the exciton reservoir and lower polariton (LP) branch for resonant pumping. Moreover, it is found that transient response of the LP first decays on a short time scale of 0.15&#8208;0.25&#160;ps compared to the calculated intrinsic lifetime of 0.11&#8208;0.20&#160;ps, and is followed by longer decay (&gt; 100&#160;ps) due to the dynamical evolution of the exciton reservoir. Our results provide a fundamental understanding of the dynamics in TMD&#8208;based polariton systems while showing the potential for achieving efficient coherent optical processes for device applications.

Abstract
High&#8208;quality imaging units are indispensable in modern&#160;optoelectronic systems for accurate recognition and processing of optical information. To fulfill massive and complex imaging tasks in&#160;digital age, devices with remarkable photoresponsive characteristics and versatile reconfigurable functions on a single device platform are&#160;in demand but remain challenging to fabricate. We report an AlGaN/GaN&#8208;based double&#8208;heterostructure, incorporated with a unique compositionally graded AlGaN structure to generate a channel of polarization&#8208;induced two&#8208;dimensional electrons that can be modulated to control electron separation, collection, and storage process in the channel of the fabricated phototransistor. As a result, when exposed to different light sources, the device shows reconfigurable multifunctional photoresponsive behaviors with superior characteristics owing to the successful programming of the 2DEGs by the combined gate and drain voltage inputs. A self&#8208;powered mode with a responsivity over 100 A/W and a photoconductive mode with a responsivity of &#8764;108&#160;A/W were achieved, with the ultimate demonstration of a 10&#215;10 device array for imaging. More intriguingly, the device can be switched to photoelectric synapse mode, emulating synaptic functions to denoise the imaging process while prolonging the image storage capability. Demonstrating three&#8208;in&#8208;one operational characteristics in a single device offers a new path toward future integrated and multifunctional imaging units.

         <title>Realizing Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetism in Molecular&#8208;Intercalated Antiferromagnet VOCl</title>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets are gaining attention in fundamental physics and advanced spintronics, due to their unique dimension&#8208;dependent magnetism and potential for ultra&#8208;compact integration. However, achieving intrinsic ferromagnetism with high Curie temperature (TC) remains a technical challenge, including preparation and stability issues. Herein, we develop an applicable electrochemical intercalation strategy to decouple interlayer interaction and guide charge doping in antiferromagnet VOCl, thereby inducing robust room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism. The expanded vdW gap isolates the neighboring layers and shrinks the distance between the V&#8208;V bond, favoring the generation of ferromagnetic (FM) coupling with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Element&#8208;specific X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) directly proves the source of the ferromagnetism. Detailed experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the charge doping enhances the FM interaction by promoting the orbital hybridization between t2g and eg. Our work sheds new light on a promising way to achieve room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism in antiferromagnets, thus addressing the critical materials demand for designing spintronic devices.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;high Performance Thermochromic Polymers via a Solid&#8208;solid Phase Transition Mechanism and Their Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermochromic materials are substances that change colour in response to temperature variations. Today, sustainability concerns are the main drivers of thermochromic research, with smart, energy efficient windows being one of primary applications. While vanadium oxides and leuco dyes are traditionally the main thermochromic materials, hydrogels operating based on change of solvation have risen as some of the most promising materials due to their high optical transparency and good solar modulating abilities. In this work, a distinct mechanism for thermochromism arising from the crystalline solid to amorphous solid polymer transition, with a corresponding transition from an opaque state to a transparent state is disclosed. Both ultra&#8208;high optical transparency (Tlum up to 99%) and ultra&#8208;high solar modulation (&#916;Tsolar up to 87%) were observed. The transition temperature was tunable from 11 to 61 &#870; C by tuning the polymer structure. When incorporated into applications such as greenhouse materials and thermoelectric devices, significant performance enhancement was observed, due to the thermochromic material functioning as a thermal valve, speeding up solar heat absorbance while inhibiting the cooling process via its phase transition.

The quest for the advancement of green energy storage technologies and reduction of carbon footprint is determinedly rising towards carbon neutrality. Aqueous rechargeable Zn&#8208;CO2 batteries (ARZCBs) hold the great potential to encounter both the targets simultaneously, i.e., green energy storage &amp; CO2 conversion to value&#8208;added chemicals/fuels. The major descriptor of ARZCBs efficiency is allied with the reactions occurring at cathode during discharging (CO2 reduction) and charging (O2 evolution) which own different fundamental mechanisms and hence mandate the employment of two different catalysts. This presents an overall complex and expensive battery system which requires a concrete solution, while the development and application of a bifunctional cathode catalyst towards both reactions could reduce the complexity and cost and thus can be a pivotal for ARZCBs. However, despite the increasing research interest and ongoing research, a systematic evaluation of bifunctional catalysts is rarely reported. In this review, the need of bifunctional cathode catalysts for ARZCBs and associated challenges with strategies have been critically assessed. A detailed progress examination and understanding towards designing of bifunctional catalyst for ARZCBs have been provided. This review will enlighten the future research approaching boosted performance of ARZCBs through the development of efficient bifunctional cathode catalysts.

         <title>Digitization of Colorimetric Sensor Technologies for Food Safety</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Colorimetric sensors play a crucial role in promoting on&#8208;site testing, enabling the detection and/or quantification of various analytes based on changes in colour. These sensors offer several advantages, such as simplicity, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and visual readouts, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, including food safety and monitoring. A critical component in portable colorimetric sensors involves their integration with colour models for effective analysis and interpretation of output signals. The most commonly used models include CIELAB (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage), RGB (Red, Green, Blue), and HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value). This review outlines the use of colour models via digitalisation in sensing applications within the food safety and monitoring field. Additionally, challenges, future directions, and considerations are discussed, highlighting a significant gap in integrating a comparative analysis towards determining the colour model that results in the highest sensor performance. The aim of this review is to underline the potential of this integration in mitigating the global impact of food spoilage and contamination on health and the economy, proposing a multidisciplinary approach to harness the full capabilities of colorimetric sensors in ensuring food safety.

         <title>Engineering Mesoscale T Cell Receptor Clustering by Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Play Nanotools</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
T&#160;cell receptor (TCR) clustering and formation of an immune synapse are crucial for TCR signaling. However, limited information is available about these dynamic assemblies and their connection to transmembrane signaling. Here, we controlled TCR clustering via plug&#8208;and&#8208;play nanotools based on an engineered irreversible conjugation pair and a peptide&#8208;loaded major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecule to compare receptor assembly in a ligand (pMHC)&#8208;induced or ligand&#8208;independent manner. A streptavidin&#8208;binding peptide displayed in both tools enabled their anchoring in streptavidin&#8208;pre&#8208;structured matrices. Strikingly, pMHC&#8208;induced clustering in the confined regions exhibited higher density and dynamics than the ligand&#8208;free approach, indicating that the size and architecture of the pMHC ligand influences TCR assembly. Our approach enables the control of membrane receptor clustering with high specificity and provide the possibility to explore different modalities of receptor activation.

         <title>Achieving Ultra&#8208;Broadband Sunlight&#8208;Like Emission in Single&#8208;Phase Phosphors: The Interplay of Structure and Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The quest for artificial light sources that mimic sunlight's spectral characteristics has been a long&#8208;standing endeavor, particularly for applications in anticounterfeiting, agriculture, and color hue detection. Conventional sunlight simulators, such as xenon lamps, are often cost&#8208;prohibitive and bulky, limiting their adoption. In this regard, the development of a series of single&#8208;phase phosphors Ca9LiMg1&#8208;xAl2x/3(PO4)7:0.1Eu2+ (x = 0&#8208;0.75) with sunlight&#8208;like emission described in this work holds immense promise as a compact and economical light source alternative. The phosphors have been obtained by an original heterovalent substitution method and emit a broad spectrum that encompasses the entire visible region, spanning from violet to deep red. Notably, the phosphor with x = 0.5 exhibits an impressive full width at half maximum of 330&#160;nm. A synergistic interplay of experimental investigations and density&#8208;functional theory calculations unveils the underlying mechanism behind sunlight&#8208;like emission. It is attributed to the local structural perturbations introduced by the heterovalent substitution of Al3+ for Mg2+, leading to a varied distribution of Eu2+ within the lattice. Subsequent characterization of a series of organic dyes combining absorption spectroscopy with convolutional neural network analysis convincingly demonstrates the potential of this phosphor in portable photodetection devices. Broad&#8208;spectrum light source testing empowers our model to precisely differentiate dye patterns. This points to the phosphor being ideal for mimicking sunlight. And beyond this demonstrated application, we envision the phosphor's utility in other relevant domains, including visible light communication and smart agriculture. These findings not only enrich our understanding of luminescent materials design but also pave the way for advancements in various application areas.

         <title>Unlocking Efficiency: Minimizing Energy Loss in Electrocatalysts for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Catalysts play a crucial role in water electrolysis by reducing the energy barriers for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). Research aims to enhance the intrinsic activities of potential catalysts through material selection, microstructure design, and various engineering techniques. However, the energy consumption of catalysts has often been overlooked due to the intricate interplay among catalyst microstructure, dimensionality, catalyst&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;gas dynamics, surface chemistry, electron transport within electrodes, and electron transfer among electrode components. Efficient catalyst development for high&#8208;current&#8208;density applications is essential to meet the increasing demand for green hydrogen. This involves transforming catalysts with high intrinsic activities into electrodes capable of sustaining high current densities. This review focuses on current improvement strategies of mass exchange, charge transfer, and reducing electrode resistance to decrease energy consumption. It aims to bridge the gap between laboratory&#8208;developed, highly efficient catalysts and industrial applications regarding catalyst structural design, surface chemistry, and catalyst&#8208;electrode interplay, outlining the development roadmap of hierarchically structured electrode&#8208;based water electrolysis for minimizing energy loss in electrocatalysts for water splitting.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Engineered Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks as Nanocarriers for Pharmacotherapy: Insights into Intracellular Dynamics at The Single Particle Level</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Nanoscale Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (nanoMOFs) are widely implemented in a host of assays involving drug delivery, biosensing catalysis, and bioimaging. However, the cell pathways and cell fate remain poorly understood. Here, we have synthesized a new fluorescent nanoMOF integrating ATTO 655 into surface defects of colloidal UiO&#8208;66, allowing us to track the spatiotemporal localization of Single nanoMOF in live cells. DFT reveals the stronger binding of ATTO 655 to the Zr6 cluster nodes compared with phosphate and Alendronate Sodium. Parallelized tracking of the spatiotemporal localization of thousands of nanoMOFs and analysis using machine learning platforms revealed whether nanoMOFs remain outside as well as their cellular internalization pathways. To quantitatively assess their colocalization with endo/lysosomal compartments, we developed a colocalization proxy approach relying on the nanoMOF detection of particles in one channel to the signal in the corresponding endo/lysosomal compartments channel, considering signal versus local background intensity ratio and signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. This strategy mitigates colocalization value inflation from high or low signal expression in endo/lysosomal compartments. The results accurately measure the nanoMOFs&#8217; colocalization from early to late endosomes and lysosomes and emphasize the importance of understanding their intracellular dynamics based on single&#8208;particle tracking for optimal and safe drug delivery.

         <title>Atomic Confinement Empowered CoZn Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Nanotubes for H2O2 Production in Sequential Dual&#8208;Cathode Electro&#8208;Fenton Process</title>

Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are flourishing in various fields because of their 100% atomic utilization. However, their uncontrollable selectivity, poor stability and vulnerable inactivation remain critical challenges. According to theoretical predictions and experiments, a heteronuclear CoZn dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom confined in N/O&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanotube reactors (CoZnSA@CNTs) was synthesized via a spatial confinement growth strategy. CoZnSA@CNTs exhibited superior performance for H2O2 electrosynthesis over the entire pH range due to dual&#8208;confinement of the atomic sites and O2 molecule. CoZnSA@CNTs was favorable for H2O2 production mainly because the synergy of adjacent atomic sites, defect&#8208;rich feature and nanotube reactor promoted O2 enrichment and enhanced H2O2 reactivity/selectivity. The H2O2 selectivity reached nearly 100% in a range of 0.2 &#8764; 0.65&#160;V versus RHE and the yield achieved 7.50&#160;M gcat&#8722;1 with CoZnSA@CNTs/carbon fiber felt, which exceeded most of the reported SACs in H&#8208;type cells. The obtained H2O2 was converted directly to sodium percarbonate and sodium perborate in a safe way for H2O2 storage/transportation. The sequential dual&#8208;cathode electron&#8208;Fenton process promoted the formation of reactive oxygen species (&#8226;OH, 1O2 and &#8226;O2&#8722;) by activating the in&#8208;situ generated H2O2, enabling accelerated degradation of various pollutants and Cr(VI) detoxification in actual wastewater. This work proposes a promising confinement strategy for catalyst design and selectivity regulation of complex reactions.

         <title>Piezoelectric Biomaterials Inspired by Nature for Applications in Biomedicine and Nanotechnology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Bioelectricity provides electrostimulation to regulate cell/tissue behaviors and functions. In the human body, bioelectricity can be generated in electromechanically responsive tissues and organs, as well as biomolecular building blocks that exhibit piezoelectricity, with a phenomenon known as the piezoelectric effect. Inspired by natural bio&#8208;piezoelectric phenomenon, efforts have been devoted to exploiting high&#8208;performance synthetic piezoelectric biomaterials, including molecular materials, polymeric materials, ceramic materials, and composite materials. Notably, piezoelectric biomaterials polarize under mechanical strain and generate electrical potentials, which can be used to fabricate electronic devices. Herein, we propose a review article to summarize the design and research progress of piezoelectric biomaterials and devices toward bionanotechnology. We first introduce the functions of bioelectricity in regulating human electrophysiological activity from cellular to tissue level. Next, recent advances as well as structure&#8208;property relationship of various natural and synthetic piezoelectric biomaterials are provided in detail. In the following part, we systematically classify and discuss the applications of piezoelectric biomaterials in tissue engineering, drug delivery, biosensing, energy harvesting, and catalysis. Finally, the challenges and future prospects of piezoelectric biomaterials are presented. We believe that this review will provide inspiration for the design and development of innovative piezoelectric biomaterials in the fields of biomedicine and nanotechnology.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics in Advanced Membranes for Enhanced Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Osmotic energy, often referred to as &#8220;blue energy,&#8221; is the energy generated from the mixing of solutions with different salt concentrations, offering a vast, renewable, and environmentally friendly energy resource. Efficacy of osmotic power production considerably relies on the performance of the transmembrane process, which depends on ionic conductivity and the capability to differentiate between positive and negative ions. Recent advancements have led to the development of membrane materials featuring precisely tailored ion transport nanochannels, enabling high&#8208;efficiency osmotic energy harvesting. In this review, ion diffusion in confined nanochannels and the rational design and optimization of membrane architecture are explored. Furthermore, structural optimization of the membrane to mitigate transport resistance and the concentration polarization effect for enhancing osmotic energy harvesting is highlighted. Finally, an outlook on the challenges that lie ahead is provided, and the potential applications of osmotic energy conversion are outlined. This review offers a comprehensive viewpoint on the evolving prospects of osmotic energy conversion.

         <title>Sodiophilic Substrate Induces NaF&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interface for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) substrate with abundant sodiophilic active sites holds promise for implementing dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anodes and high&#8208;performance sodium batteries. However, the heightened electrode/electrolyte side reactions stemming from high specific surface area still hinder electrode structure stability and cycling reversibility, particularly under high current densities. Herein, we regulated the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) component and restrained detrimental side reactions through the uniform loading of Na&#8208;Sn alloy onto a porous 3D nanofiber framework (NaSn&#8208;PCNF). The strong interaction between Na&#8208;Sn alloy and PF6&#8722; anions facilitates the dissociation of sodium salts and releases more free sodium ions for effective charge transfer. Simultaneously, the modulations of the interfacial electrolyte solvation structure and the construction of a high NaF content SEI layer stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface. NaSn&#8208;PCNF symmetrical battery demonstrates stable cycling for over 600 hours with an ultralow overpotential of 24.5&#160;mV under harsh condition of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the full cells and pouch cells exhibit accelerated reaction kinetics and splendid capacity retention, providing valuable insights into the development of advanced Na substrates for high&#8208;energy sodium metal batteries.

Abstract
In the dynamic landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI), two notable phenomena are becoming predominant: the exponential growth of large AI model sizes and the explosion of massive amount of data. Meanwhile, scientific research such as quantum computing and protein synthesis increasingly demand higher computing capacities. Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the mechanism and functionality of human brains, uses physical artificial neurons to do computations and is drawing widespread attention. Conventional electronic computing has experienced certain difficulties, particularly concerning the latency, crosstalk, and energy consumption of digital processors. As the Moore's law approaches its terminus, there is a urgent need for alternative computing architectures that can satisfy this growing computing demand and break through the von Neumann model. Recently, the expansion of optoelectronic devices on photonic integration platforms has led to significant growth in photonic computing, where photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have enabled ultrafast artificial neural networks (ANN) with sub&#8208;nanosecond latencies, low heat dissipation, and high parallelism. Such non&#8208;von Neumann photonic computing systems hold the promise to cater to the escalating requirements of AI and scientific computing. In this review, we&#160;study recent advancements in integrated photonic neuromorphic systems, and from the perspective of materials and device engineering, we&#160;lay out the scientific and technological breakthroughs necessary to advance the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. In particular, we&#160;examine various technologies and devices employed in neuromorphic photonic AI accelerators, spanning from traditional optics to PICs. We&#160;evaluate the performances of different designs by energy efficiency in operations per joule (OP/J) and compute density in operations per squared millimeter per second (OP/mm2/s). Putting special emphasis on photonic components such as VCSEL lasers, optical interconnects, and frequency microcombs, we&#160;highlight the most recent breakthroughs in photonic engineering and materials science used to create advanced neuromorphic computing chips. Lastly, we&#160;recognize that existing technologies encounter obstacles in achieving photonic AI accelerators with peta&#8208;level computing speed and energy efficiency, and we&#160;also explore potential approaches in new devices, fabrication, materials, and integration to drive innovation. As the current challenges and barriers in cost, scalability, footprint, and computing capacity are resolved one&#8208;by&#8208;one, photonic neuromorphic systems are bound to co&#8208;exist with, if not replace, conventional electronic computers and transform the landscape of AI and scientific computing in the foreseeable future.

         <title>Expanding RNAi to Kidneys, Lungs, and Spleen via Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT) siRNA Lipid Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inhibition of disease&#8208;causing mutations using RNA interference (RNAi) has resulted in clinically approved medicines with additional candidates in late stage trials. However, targetable tissues currently in pre&#8208;clinical development are limited to liver following systemic intravenous (IV) administration because predictable delivery of siRNA to non&#8208;liver tissues remains an unsolved challenge. Here we provide evidence of durable extrahepatic gene silencing enabled by siRNA Selective Organ Targeting lipid nanoparticles (siRNA SORT LNPs) to the kidneys, lungs, and spleen. LNPs excel at dose&#8208;dependent silencing of tissue&#8208;enriched endogenous targets resulting in 60&#8211;80% maximal knockdown after a single IV injection and up to 88% downregulation of protein expression in mouse lungs after two doses. To examine knockdown potency and unbiased organ targeting, we utilize B6.129TdTom/EGFP mice that constitutively express the TdTomato transgene across all cell types to demonstrate 58%, 45%, and 15% drop in TdTomato fluorescence in lungs, spleen, and kidneys respectively. Finally, we establish physiological relevance of siRNA SORT LNP&#8208;mediated gene silencing via acute suppression of endogenous Tie2 which induced lung&#8208;specific phenotypic alteration of vascular endothelial barrier. Due to plethora of extrahepatic diseases that might benefit from RNAi interventions, we anticipate that our findings will expand pre&#8208;clinical landscape of therapeutically relevant targets beyond the liver.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inhibition of disease-causing mutations using RNA interference (RNAi) has resulted in clinically approved medicines with additional candidates in late stage trials. However, targetable tissues currently in pre-clinical development are limited to liver following systemic intravenous (IV) administration because predictable delivery of siRNA to non-liver tissues remains an unsolved challenge. Here we provide evidence of durable extrahepatic gene silencing enabled by siRNA Selective Organ Targeting lipid nanoparticles (siRNA SORT LNPs) to the kidneys, lungs, and spleen. LNPs excel at dose-dependent silencing of tissue-enriched endogenous targets resulting in 60&#8211;80% maximal knockdown after a single IV injection and up to 88% downregulation of protein expression in mouse lungs after two doses. To examine knockdown potency and unbiased organ targeting, we utilize B6.129&lt;sup&gt;TdTom/EGFP&lt;/sup&gt; mice that constitutively express the TdTomato transgene across all cell types to demonstrate 58%, 45%, and 15% drop in TdTomato fluorescence in lungs, spleen, and kidneys respectively. Finally, we establish physiological relevance of siRNA SORT LNP-mediated gene silencing via acute suppression of endogenous Tie2 which induced lung-specific phenotypic alteration of vascular endothelial barrier.

         <title>Unveiling the In Situ Evolution of Li2O&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interface on CoOx Embedded Carbon Fibers as Li Anode Host</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Modification of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) carbon hosts with metal oxides has been considered as advantageous for the formation of Li2O&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI), which could show fast Li+ diffusion, and meanwhile alleviate dendrite problems caused by fragility and non&#8208;uniformity of native SEIs. However, the lack of convincing experimental evidence has made it difficult to unveil the true origin of oxygen in Li2O&#8208;rich SEIs until now. Herein, we successfully prepared CoOx embedded carbon nanofibers (CNF&#8208;CoOx) as high&#8208;performance Li anode hosts. By employing 18O isotope labeling, we aimed to elucidate the role of CoOx during SEI evolution that CoOx contributes significantly to Li2O formation by delivering oxygen. Benefiting from the rich Li2O content, the as&#8208;formed SEIs greatly improve the Li+ migration kinetics, and therefore the CNF&#8208;CoOx@Li anode could exhibit excellent cycling stability in half, symmetrical, and full cells.

         <title>Defect&#8208;free Nano&#8208;welding of Bilayer SnSe Nanoplates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nano&#8208;welding is a bottom&#8208;up technique to create custom designed nanostructures and devices beyond the precision of lithographic methods. Here, we report a new technique based on anisotropic lubricity at the van der Waals interface between monolayer and bilayer SnSe nanoplates and a graphene substrate, to achieve precise control of the crystal orientation and the interface during the welding process. As&#8208;grown SnSe monolayer and bilayer nanoplates are commensurate with graphene's armchair direction but lack commensuration along graphene's zigzag direction, resulting in a reduced friction along that direction and a rail&#8208;like, one dimensional movement that permits joining nanoplates with high precision. This way, molecular beam epitaxially grown SnSe nanoplates of lateral sizes 30&#8764;100&#160;nm are manipulated by the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope at room temperature. In situ annealing is applied afterwards to weld contacting nanoplates without atomic defects at the interface. This technique can be generalized to any van der Waals interfaces with anisotropic lubricity and is highly promising for the construction of complex quantum devices, such as field effect transistors, quantum interference devices, lateral tunneling junctions, and solid&#8208;state qubits.

         <title>Efficient Orbitronic Terahertz Emission Based on CoPt Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Orbitronic devices operate by manipulating orbitally polarized currents. Recent studies have shown that these orbital currents can be excited by femtosecond laser pulses in a ferromagnet such as Ni and converted into ultrafast charge currents via orbital&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion. However, the terahertz emission from orbitronic terahertz emitters based on Ni is still much weaker than that of the typical spintronic terahertz emitter. Here, we report a more efficient light&#8208;induced generation of orbital current from a CoPt alloy, and the terahertz emission from CoPt/Cu/MgO is comparable to that of benchmark spintronic terahertz emitters. By varying the composition of the CoPt alloy, the thickness of Cu, and the capping layer, we confirm that THz emission primarily originates from the orbital accumulation generated within CoPt, propagating through Cu, followed by subsequent orbital&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion due to the inverse orbital Rashba&#8208;Edelstein effect at the Cu/MgO interface. This study provides strong evidence for the efficient orbital current generation in CoPt alloy, paving the way for efficient orbital terahertz emitters.

         <title>Cu/CuxO/Graphdiyne Tandem Catalyst for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction reaction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to ammonia (NH3) is a feasible way to achieve artificial nitrogen cycle. However, the low yield rate and poor selectivity towards NH3 product is a technical challenge. Here we present a graphdiyne (GDY)&#8208;based tandem catalyst featuring Cu/CuxO nanoparticles anchored to GDY support (termed Cu/CuxO/GDY) for efficient electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction. We achieve a high NH3 yield rate of 25.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 (25.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) with a Faradaic efficiency of 99.8% at an applied potential of &#8208;0.8&#160;V versus RHE using the designed catalyst. These performance metrics outperform most reported NO3&#8722; to NH3 catalysts in the alkaline media. Electrochemical measurements and density functional theory reveal that the NO3&#8722; preferentially attacks Cu/CuxO, and the GDY can effectively catalyze the reduction of NO2&#8722; to NH3. This work highlights the efficacy of GDY as a new class of tandem catalysts for the artificial nitrogen cycle and provides powerful guidelines for the design of tandem electrocatalysts.

         <title>Unraveling Mechanism for Microstructure Engineering toward High&#8208;capacity Nickel&#8208;rich Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Microstructural engineering on nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide (NRLO) cathode materials is considered a promising approach to increase both the capacity and lifespan of lithium&#8208;ion batteries by introducing high valence&#8208;state elements. However, rational regulation on NRLO microstructures based on a deep understanding of its capacity enhancement mechanism remains challenging. Herein for the first time, we demonstrate that an increase of 14 mAh&#183;g&#8722;1 in reversible capacity at the first cycle can be achieved via tailoring the micro and nano structure of NRLO through introducing tungsten. Aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy characterization reveals that the formation of a modified microstructure featured as coherent spinel twin boundaries. Theoretical modeling and electrochemical investigations further demonstrate that the capacity increase mechanism is related to such coherent spinel twin boundaries, which could lower the Li+ diffusion barrier and thus allow more Li+ to participate in deeper phase transitions. Meanwhile, the surface and grain boundaries of NRLOs are found to be modified by generating a dense and uniform LiWxOy phase, which further extends its cycle life by reducing side reactions with electrolytes. This work enables a comprehensive understanding of the capacity&#8208;increased mechanism and endows the remarkable potential of microstructural engineering for capacity&#8208; and lifespan&#8208;increased NRLOs.

         <title>Nanoengineering&#8208;Enhanced Capillary Cooling Achieves Sustained Thermal Protection for Ultra&#8208;High Heat Flux and Temperature</title>

Abstract
Extreme thermal conditions with heat flux densities exceeding 1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2 or temperatures reaching up to 1000 &#176;C are prevalent in various situations. However, the ability of thermal protection either depends on specialized materials or is currently limited with existing cooling schemes. Herein, we propose an innovative cooling scheme that relies on evaporation&#8208;driven capillary flow enhanced by nanoengineering&#8208;designed porous structures with common materials. Experimentally&#8208;obtained capillary flow cooling curve identifies critical heat flux corresponding to evaporation&#8208;driven flow stage, where coolants cool the surface and subsequent vapor impedes heat transfer from thermal boundaries. Nanoengineering provides opportunities for enhanced capillary flow, which proves to endow bronze, TC4, and Al2O3 with thermal protection ability 50%&#8722;180% higher than that without nanoengineering&#8208;designed. Our scheme achieves critical heat flux up to 2.0&#8208;3.1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2, and performs thermal dissipation capacity almost twice higher than inherent latent heat of coolant. Furthermore, in a supersonic wind tunnel with total temperature reaching up to 1792 K, our scheme effectively protects surfaces by cooling them to surface temperatures below 500 K. Nanoengineering&#8208;enhanced capillary cooling gives access to the application of common materials for high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;heat&#8208;flux environments and paves the way for the development of lightweight, long&#8208;lasting, and large&#8208;scale solutions for thermal protection.

         <title>Modular Assembly of Metamaterials Using Light Gradients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
This is a report on a pilot study that tests the feasibility of assembling photonic metamaterials (PMs) using light gradient forces. Following a strategy that works like modular construction, light gradient forces, produced by a tightly focused, one&#8208;dimensional standing wave optical trap (SWOT), time&#8208;multiplexed across a two&#8208;dimensional lattice were used to assemble voxels consisting of prefabricated, monodispersed nanoparticles (NPs) with radii ranging from 30 to 500&#160;nm into three&#8208;dimensional structures on a hydrogel scaffold. Hundreds of NPs can be manipulated concurrently into a complex heterogeneous voxel this way, and then the process can be repeated by stitching together voxels to form a metamaterial of any size, shape, and constituency although imperfectly. Imperfections introduce random phase&#8208;shifts and amplitude variations that can have an adverse effect on the band structure. Regardless, PMs were created this way using two different dielectric NPs, polystyrene and rutile, and then the near&#8208;infrared performance for each was analyzed with angle&#8208;, wavelength&#8208;, and polarization&#8208;dependent reflection spectroscopy. The cross&#8208;polarized spectra showed evidence of a resonance peak. Interestingly, whereas the line&#8208;shape from the polypropylene array was symmetric, the rutile array was not, which may be indicative of Fano resonance. So, even with the structural defects, reflection spectroscopy revealed a resonance.

         <title>Interstitials in Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Defect structure is pivotal in advancing thermoelectric performance with interstitials being widely recognized for their remarkable roles in optimizing both phonon and electron transport properties. Diverse interstitial atoms have been identified in previous works according to their distinct roles and can be classified into rattling interstitial, decoupling interstitial, interlayer interstitial, dynamic interstitial and liquid interstitial. Specifically, rattling interstitial can cause phonon resonance in cage compound to scatter phonon transport; decoupling interstitial can contribute to phonon blocking and electron transport due to their significantly different mean free paths; interlayer interstitial can facilitate out&#8208;of&#8208;layer electron transport in layered compounds; dynamic interstitial can tune temperature&#8208;dependent carrier density and optimize electrical transport properties at wide temperatures; liquid interstitial could improve the carrier mobility at homogeneous dispersion state. All of these interstitials have positive impact on thermoelectric performance by adjusting transport parameters. This perspective therefore intends to provide a thorough overview of advances in interstitial strategy and highlight their significance for optimizing thermoelectric parameters. Finally, the profound potential for extending interstitial strategy to various other thermoelectric systems is discussed and some future directions in thermoelectric material are also outlined.

         <title>Band Engineering of Perovskite Quantum Dot Solids for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dot (PQD) shows high potential for next&#8208;generation photovoltaics due to their tunable surface chemistry, good solution&#8208;processability and unique photophysical properties. However, the remained long&#8208;chain ligand attached to the PQD surface significantly impedes the charge carrier transport within the PQD solids, thereby predominantly influencing the charge extraction of PQD solar cells (PQDSCs). Herein, a ligand&#8208;induced energy level modulation is reported for band engineering of PQD solids to improve the charge extraction of PQDSCs. Detailed theoretical calculations and systemic experimental studies are performed to comprehensively understand the photophysical properties of the PQD solids dominated by the surface ligands of PQDs. The results reveal that 4&#8208;nitrobenzenethiol and 4&#8208;methoxybenzenethiol molecules with different dipole moments could firmly anchor to the PQD surface thoroughly the thiol group to modulate the energy levels of PQDs, and a gradient band structure within the PQD solid is subsequently realized. Consequently, the band&#8208;engineered PQDSC delivers an efficiency of up to 16.44%, which is one of the highest efficiencies of CsPbI3 PQDSCs. This work provides a feasible avenue for the band engineering of PQD solids by tuning the surface chemistry of PQDs for high&#8208;performing solar cells or other optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Fully Reprogrammable 2D Array of Multi&#8208;State Molecular Switching Units</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Integration of molecular switching units into complex electronic circuits is considered to be the next step towards the realization of novel logic and memory devices. Here, we&#160;report on an ordered 2D network of neighboring ternary switching units represented by triazatruxene (TAT) molecules organized in a honeycomb lattice on a Ag(111) surface. Using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we&#160;are able to control the bonding configurations of individual TAT molecules within the lattice, realizing up to 12 distinct states per molecule. The switching between those states shows a particularly strong bias dependence ranging from tens of millivolts to volts. Based on a single TAT molecule as a fundamental building block, we&#160;then explore the low&#8208;bias switching behavior in units consisting of two and more interacting TAT molecules purposefully defined by the high&#8208;bias switching within the honeycomb lattice. we&#160;demonstrate the possibility to realize up to 9 and 19 distinguishable states in a dyad and a tetrad of coupled switching units, respectively. The switching dynamics can be triggered and accessed by single&#8208;point measurements on a single molecule. High experimental control over the desired state, owing to hierarchical switching and pronounced switching directionality, as well as the observed full reversibility, makes this system particularly appealing, paving the way to design complex molecule&#8208;based memory&#160;systems.

         <title>Synchronous Switching Strategy to Enhance the Real&#8208;Time Powering and Charging Performance of Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are of great significance as sustainable power sources that harvest energy from the human body and environment. Nevertheless, due to TENG's impedance&#8208;dependent output voltage characteristics, in traditional strategy (TS), real&#8208;timely powering a sensor with TENG has a poor sensing on/off ratio (or response), and directly charging a capacitor with TENG shows a low charging efficiency. This degraded real&#8208;time powering and charging performance of TENG compared to a commercial constant voltage source has been a huge challenge of the TENG field for a long time. Here, we propose a synchronous switching strategy (SSS) for TENG to real&#8208;timely power sensors or charge capacitors without degrading its performance. Compared with TS, this new strategy enables sensors to have 5&#8211;7 times sensing on/off ratio enhancement when using TENG as a power source, reaching the powering ability of a commercial constant voltage source, it makes the powering performance of TENG stable under different driving frequency, improving the powering robustness of TENG. In addition, compared with TS, SSS can also enhance the charging efficiency of TENG in every charging cycle by up to 2.4 times when charging capacitors. This work contributes to real&#8208;timely powering or charging the distributed, mobile and wireless electronics using TENG.

         <title>Electrically Reconfigurable Phase&#8208;Change Transmissive Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Programmable and reconfigurable optics hold significant potential for transforming a broad spectrum of applications, spanning space explorations to biomedical imaging, gas sensing, and optical cloaking. The ability to adjust the optical properties of components like filters, lenses, and beam steering devices could result in dramatic reductions in size, weight, and power consumption in future optoelectronic devices. Among the potential candidates for reconfigurable optics, chalcogenide&#8208;based phase change materials (PCMs) offer great promise due to their non&#8208;volatile and analogue switching characteristics. Although PCM have found widespread use in electronic data storage, these memory devices are deeply sub&#8208;micron&#8208;sized. To incorporate phase change materials into free&#8208;space optical components, it is essential to scale them up to beyond several hundreds of microns while maintaining reliable switching characteristics. This study demonstrated a non&#8208;mechanical, non&#8208;volatile transmissive filter based on low&#8208;loss PCMs with a 200 &#181;m&#215;200 &#181;m switching area. The device/metafilter can be consistently switched between low&#8208; and high&#8208;transmission states using electrical pulses with a switching contrast ratio of 5.5 dB. The device was&#160;reversibly switched for 1250 cycles before accelerated degradation took place. The work represents an important step toward realizing free&#8208;space reconfigurable optics based on&#160;PCMs.

         <title>A Topological Parametric Phonon Oscillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological bosonic systems have recently aroused intense interests in exploring exotic phenomena that have no counterparts in electronic systems. The squeezed bosonic interaction in these systems is particularly interesting, because it can modify the vacuum fluctuations of topological states, drive them into instabilities, and lead to topological parametric oscillators. However, these phenomena remain experimentally elusive because of limited nonlinearities in most existing topological bosonic systems. Here, a topological parametric phonon oscillator is experimentally realized based on a nonlinear nanoelectromechanical Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity with strong squeezed interaction. Specifically, the Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity is parametrically driven to provide phase&#8208;sensitive amplification for topological phonons, leading to the observation of coherent parametric phonon oscillation above the threshold. Additionally, it is confirmed that the random frequency variation caused by fabrication disorders can be suppressed effectively by increasing the cavity size, while the free spectral range reduces at a much slower rate, which benefit the realization of large&#8208;area single&#8208;mode lasers. Our results represent an important advance in experimental investigations of topological physics with large bosonic nonlinearities and parametric gain.

         <title>Reorganizing Helmholtz Adsorption Plane Enables Sodium Layered&#8208;Oxide Cathode Beyond High Oxidation Limits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sodium layered&#8208;oxides (NaxTMO2) sustain severe interfacial stability issues when subjected to battery applications. Particularly at high potential, the oxidation limits including transition metal dissolution and SEI reformation are intertwined upon the cathode, resulting in poor cycle ability. Herein, by rearranging the complex and structure of Helmholtz absorption plane adjacent to NaxTMO2 cathodes, the mechanism of constructing stable cathode/electrolyte interphase to push up oxidation limits is clarified. The strong absorbent fluorinated anions replace the solvents into the inner Helmholtz plane, thereby reorganizing the Helmholtz absorption structure and spontaneously inducing an anion&#8208;dominated interphase to envelop more active sites for layered oxides. More importantly, such multi&#8208;component cathode/electrolyte interphase proves effective for long&#8208;term durability of a series of manganese&#8208;based oxide cathodes, which achieves 1500&#8208;cycles lifetime against high oxidation voltage limit beyond 4.3&#160;V. This work unravels the key role of breaking high&#8208;oxidation limits in attaining higher energy density of layered&#8208;oxide systems.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated DNA Nanotechnology in 3D: Structural Library by Templated Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
DNA double helices containing metal&#8208;mediated DNA (mmDNA) base pairs have been constructed from Ag+ and Hg2+ ions between pyrimidine:pyrimidine pairs with the promise of nanoelectronics. Rational design of mmDNA nanomaterials has been impractical without a complete lexical and structural description. Here, we explore the programmability of structural DNA nanotechnology toward its founding mission of self&#8208;assembling a diffraction platform for biomolecular structure determination. We employed the tensegrity triangle to build a comprehensive structural library of mmDNA pairs via X&#8208;ray diffraction and elucidated generalized design rules for mmDNA construction. We uncovered two binding modes: N3&#8208;dominant, centrosymmetric pairs and major groove binders driven by 5&#8208;position ring modifications. Energy gap calculations showed additional levels in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of mmDNA structures, rendering them attractive molecular electronic candidates.
