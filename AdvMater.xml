      <title>Repeatable and Reprogrammable Shape Morphing from Photoresponsive Gold Nanorod/Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
      <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive gold nanorod/liquid crystal elastomer film is prepared, demonstrating excellent photothermal performance with fast actuation and recovery speed, cyclability, and the ability to achieve multiple shapes (both symmetric and asymmetric) from a single film with monodomain alignment of the liquid crystal director field through spatial modulation of the projected light to the film.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are of interest for applications such as soft robotics and shape&#8208;morphing devices. Among the different actuation mechanisms, light offers advantages such as spatial and local control of actuation via the photothermal effect. However, the unwanted aggregation of the light&#8208;absorbing nanoparticles in the LCE matrix will limit the photothermal response speed, actuation performance, and repeatability. Herein, a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive LCE composite consisting of up to 0.20 wt% poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;modified gold nanorods (AuNRs) without apparent aggregation is demonstrated. The high Young's modulus, 20.3&#160;MPa, and excellent photothermal performance render repeated and fast actuation of the films (actuation within 5 s and recovery in 2 s) when exposed to 800&#160;nm light at an average output power of &#8776;1.0 W cm&#8722;2, while maintaining a large actuation strain (56%). Further, it is shown that the same sheet of AuNR/LCE film (100&#160;&#181;m thick) can be morphed into different shapes simply by varying the motifs of the photomasks.

&lt;p&gt;A near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive gold nanorod/liquid crystal elastomer film is prepared, demonstrating excellent photothermal performance with fast actuation and recovery speed, cyclability, and the ability to achieve multiple shapes (both symmetric and asymmetric) from a single film with monodomain alignment of the liquid crystal director field through spatial modulation of the projected light to the film.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are of interest for applications such as soft robotics and shape&#8208;morphing devices. Among the different actuation mechanisms, light offers advantages such as spatial and local control of actuation via the photothermal effect. However, the unwanted aggregation of the light&#8208;absorbing nanoparticles in the LCE matrix will limit the photothermal response speed, actuation performance, and repeatability. Herein, a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive LCE composite consisting of up to 0.20 wt% poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;modified gold nanorods (AuNRs) without apparent aggregation is demonstrated. The high Young's modulus, 20.3&#160;MPa, and excellent photothermal performance render repeated and fast actuation of the films (actuation within 5 s and recovery in 2 s) when exposed to 800&#160;nm light at an average output power of &#8776;1.0 W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, while maintaining a large actuation strain (56%). Further, it is shown that the same sheet of AuNR/LCE film (100&#160;&#181;m thick) can be morphed into different shapes simply by varying the motifs of the photomasks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Controlled Assembly of Liquid Metal Inclusions as a General Approach for Multifunctional Composites</title>
      <dc:description>
A general approach to synthesize soft material composites that incorporate liquid metal is described. The approach extends functionalities imparted by liquid metal inclusions to functional matrix materials. A key to this study is the understanding of the influence of processing parameters to activate electrical conductivity in the composites.








Abstract
Soft composites that use droplets of gallium&#8208;based liquid metal (LM) as the dispersion phase have the potential for transformative impact in multifunctional material engineering. However, it is unclear whether percolation pathways of LM can support high electrical conductivity in a wide range of matrix materials. This issue is addressed through an approach to LM composite synthesis that focuses on the interrelated effects of matrix curing/solidification and droplet formation. The combined influence of LM concentration, particle size, and sedimentation is explored. By developing this approach, the functionalities that have been demonstrated with LM composites can be generalized to other matrix materials that impart additional functionality. Specifically, composites are synthesized using a biodegradable/reprocessable plastic (polycaprolactone), a hydrogel (poly(vinyl alcohol)), and a processable rubber (a styrene&#8211;ethylene&#8211;butylene&#8211;styrene derivative) to demonstrate wide applicability. This method enables synthesis of composites: i) with high stretchability and negligible electromechanical coupling (&gt;600% strain); ii) with Joule&#8208;heated healing and reprocessability; iii) with electrical and mechanical self&#8208;healing; and iv) that can be printed. This approach to controlled assembly represents a widely applicable technique for creating new classes of LM composites with unprecedented multifunctionality.

      <title>Fractal Web Design of a Hemispherical Photodetector Array with Organic&#8208;Dye&#8208;Sensitized Graphene Hybrid Composites</title>
      <dc:description>
A spider&#8208;web&#8208;inspired fractal design is integrated with a high&#8208;performance photodetector array, providing a viable possibility for hemispherical light detection to replicate the vision system of arthropods such as insects and crustaceans. The enhanced photoresponsivity (&gt;1000 A W&#8722;1) and mechanical reliability of the hemisherical photodetector are enabled by the use of organic&#8208;dye&#8208;sensitized graphene hybrid composites.








Abstract
The vision system of arthropods consists of a dense array of individual photodetecting elements across a curvilinear surface. This compound&#8208;eye architecture could be a useful model for optoelectronic sensing devices that require a large field of view and high sensitivity to motion. Strategies that aim to mimic the compound&#8208;eye architecture involve integrating photodetector pixels with a curved microlens, but their fabrication on a curvilinear surface is challenged by the use of standard microfabrication processes that are traditionally designed for planar, rigid substrates (e.g., Si wafers). Here, a fractal web design of a hemispherical photodetector array that contains an organic&#8208;dye&#8208;sensitized graphene hybrid composite is reported to serve as an effective photoactive component with enhanced light&#8208;absorbing capabilities. The device is first fabricated on a planar Si wafer at the microscale and then transferred to transparent hemispherical domes with different curvatures in a deterministic manner. The unique structural property of the fractal web design provides protection of the device from damage by effectively tolerating various external loads. Comprehensive experimental and computational studies reveal the essential design features and optoelectronic properties of the device, followed by the evaluation of its utility in the measurement of both the direction and intensity of incident light.

      <title>Bloch Lines Constituting Antiskyrmions Captured via Differential Phase Contrast</title>
      <dc:description>
Recently, the discovery of transformations between magnetic spin textures, antiskyrmions and skyrmions, has generated a flurry of interest. The mechanism by which these topologically protected spin textures transform may be the creation and annihilation of Bloch lines. In this work, Bloch lines constituting antiskyrmions are directly measured, a significant advancement in the understanding of and quest to manipulate magnetic spin textures.








Abstract
Much scientific capital has been directed toward exotic magnetic spin textures called Bloch lines, that is, N&#233;el&#8208;type line boundaries within domain walls, because their geometry promises high&#8208;density magnetic storage. While predicted to arise in high&#8208;anisotropy magnets, bulk soft magnets, and thin films with in&#8208;plane magnetization, Bloch lines also constitute magnetic antiskyrmions, that is, topological antiparticles of skyrmions. Most domain walls occur as Bloch&#8208;type or N&#233;el&#8208;type, in which the magnetization rotates parallel or perpendicular to the domain wall across its profile, respectively. The Bloch lines&#8217; N&#233;el&#8208;type rotation and their minute size make them difficult to directly measure. This work utilizes differential phase contrast (DPC) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to measure the in&#8208;plane magnetization of Bloch lines within antiskyrmions emergent in a non&#8208;centrosymmetric Heusler magnet with D2d symmetry, Mn1.4Pt0.9Pd0.1Sn, in addition to Bloch&#8208;type skyrmions in an FeGe magnet with B20&#8208;type crystal structure to benchmark the DPC technique. Both in&#8208;focus measurement and identification of Bloch lines at the antiskyrmion's corners are provided.

      <title>Record&#8208;Low Subthreshold&#8208;Swing Negative&#8208;Capacitance 2D Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
      <dc:description>
A 2D MoS2 negative&#8208;capacitance field&#8208;effect transistor based on a ferroelectric LiNbO3 platform performs a record&#8208;low subthreshold swing of 4.97&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 and quasi&#8208;free hysteresis at room temperature, which can be attributed to the excellent capacitance matching under modulation of Vds, Vg, and channel length.








Abstract
Power consumption is one of the most challenging bottlenecks for complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8211;semiconductor integration. Negative&#8208;capacitance field&#8208;effect transistors (NC&#8208;FETs) offer a promising platform to break the thermionic limit defined by the Boltzmann tyranny and architect energy&#8208;efficient devices. However, it is a great challenge to achieving ultralow&#8208;subthreshold&#8208;swing (SS) (10&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) and small&#8208;hysteresis NC&#8208;FETs simultaneously at room temperature, which has only been reported using the hafnium zirconium oxide system. Here, based on a ferroelectric LiNbO3 thin film with great spontaneous polarization, an ultralow&#8208;SS NC&#8208;FET with small hysteresis is designed. The LiNbO3 NC&#8208;FET platform exhibits a record&#8208;low SS of 4.97&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 with great repeatability due to the superior capacitance matching characteristic as evidenced by the negative differential resistance phenomenon. By modulating the structure and operating parameters (such as channel length (Lch), drain&#8211;sourse bias (Vds), and gate bias (Vg)) of devices, an optimized SS from &#8776;40 to &#8776;10&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 and hysteresis from &#8776;900 to &#8776;60&#160;mV are achieved simultaneously. The results provide a new potential method for future highly integrated electronic and optical integrated energy&#8208;efficient devices.

      <dc:description>
The recent advancements in miniaturized cavity resonators employing three light engineering methods are discussed: 1) cladding engineering in subwavelength metal&#8208;clad cavities for room&#8208;temperature lasing and efficient waveguide coupling; 2) low&#8208;loss plasmonic cavities and waveguides engineered by plasmonic crystals; and 3) geometric engineering for photon squeezing into a deep&#8208;subwavelength space.








Abstract
Significant advances have been made in photonic integrated circuit technology, similar to the development of electronic integrated circuits. However, the miniaturization of cavity resonators, which are the essential components of photonic circuits, still requires considerable improvement. Over the past decades, various optical cavities have been utilized to implement next&#8208;generation light sources in photonic circuits with low energy, high data traffic, and integrable physical sizes. Nevertheless, it has been difficult to reduce the size of most commercialized cavities beyond the diffraction limit while maintaining high performance. Herein, recent advancements in subwavelength metallic cavities that can improve performance, even with the use of lossy plasmonic modes, are reviewed. The discussion is divided in three parts according to light engineering methods: subwavelength metal&#8208;clad cavities engineered using intermediate dielectric cladding; implementation of plasmonic cavities and waveguides using plasmonic crystals; and development of deep&#8208;subwavelength plasmonic waveguides and cavities using geometric engineering. A direction for further developments in photonic integrated circuit technology is also discussed, along with its practical application.

&lt;p&gt;The recent advancements in miniaturized cavity resonators employing three light engineering methods are discussed: 1) cladding engineering in subwavelength metal&#8208;clad cavities for room&#8208;temperature lasing and efficient waveguide coupling; 2) low&#8208;loss plasmonic cavities and waveguides engineered by plasmonic crystals; and 3) geometric engineering for photon squeezing into a deep&#8208;subwavelength space.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significant advances have been made in photonic integrated circuit technology, similar to the development of electronic integrated circuits. However, the miniaturization of cavity resonators, which are the essential components of photonic circuits, still requires considerable improvement. Over the past decades, various optical cavities have been utilized to implement next&#8208;generation light sources in photonic circuits with low energy, high data traffic, and integrable physical sizes. Nevertheless, it has been difficult to reduce the size of most commercialized cavities beyond the diffraction limit while maintaining high performance. Herein, recent advancements in subwavelength metallic cavities that can improve performance, even with the use of lossy plasmonic modes, are reviewed. The discussion is divided in three parts according to light engineering methods: subwavelength metal&#8208;clad cavities engineered using intermediate dielectric cladding; implementation of plasmonic cavities and waveguides using plasmonic crystals; and development of deep&#8208;subwavelength plasmonic waveguides and cavities using geometric engineering. A direction for further developments in photonic integrated circuit technology is also discussed, along with its practical application.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Organic Semiconductor&#8211;DNA Hybrid Assemblies</title>
      <dc:description>
By virtue of the active role of DNAs, even conventional organic molecules widely used in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes can become bioactive and generate biospecific photonics. The fabrication of emerging hybrid assemblies of DNAs complexed with various organic semiconductors is described, together with their applications in the field of biophotonic electronics resulting from their endowed biofunctions.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors are photonic and electronic materials with high luminescence, quantum efficiency, color tunability, and size&#8208;dependent optoelectronic properties. The self&#8208;assembly of organic molecules enables the establishment of a fabrication technique for organic micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;architectures with well&#8208;defined shapes, tunable sizes, and defect&#8208;free structures. DNAs, a class of biomacromolecules, have recently been used as an engineering material capable of intricate nanoscale structuring while simultaneously storing biological genetic information. Here, the up&#8208;to&#8208;date research on hybrid materials made from organic semiconductors and DNAs is presented. The trends in photonic and electronic phenomena discovered in DNA&#8208;functionalized and DNA&#8208;driven organic semiconductor hybrids, comprising small molecules and polymers, are observed. Various hybrid forms of solutions, arrayed chips, nanowires, and crystalline particles are discussed, focusing on the role of DNA in the hybrids. Furthermore, the recent technical advances achieved in the integration of DNAs in light&#8208;emitting devices, transistors, waveguides, sensors, and biological assays are presented. DNAs not only serve as a recognizing element in organic&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;based sensors, but also as an active charge&#8208;control material in high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices.

      <title>A Multistage Cooperative Nanoplatform Enables Intracellular Co&#8208;Delivery of Proteins and Chemotherapeutics for Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
A multistage cooperative drug delivery nanoplatform is developed to concurrently load doxorubicin and phenylboronic&#8208;acid&#8208;modified RNase A through hydrophobic interactions and dynamic covalent conjugation, respectively. This nanoplatform efficiently delivers both cargos into tumor sites with high systemic stability and mediates low&#8208;pH&#8208; and ROS&#8208;triggered cooperative release of doxorubicin and RNase A within tumor cells, leading to enhanced combined anticancer efficacy.








Abstract
Combining intracellularly active proteins with chemotherapeutics represents a promising strategy for synergistic cancer therapy. However, the lack of nanocarrier systems for delivery into cancer cells and controlled intracellular release of both physicochemically very distinct cargos significantly impedes the biomedical translation of this combination strategy in cancer therapy. Here, a well&#8208;designed triblock copolymer, mPEG&#8208;b&#8208;PGCA&#8208;b&#8208;PGTA, is reported for application in a multistage cooperative drug delivery nanoplatform that accomplishes effective intracellular co&#8208;delivery of hydrophilic ribonuclease A (RNase A) and hydrophobic doxorubicin (DOX). RNase A bioreversibly modified with phenylboronic acid groups via a ROS&#8208;cleavable carbamate linker is incorporated into the triblock copolymer nanoparticles with high efficiency through a pH&#8208;reversible phenylboronic acid&#8211;catechol linkage. The reversible covalent conjugations between RNase A and the triblock copolymer endow the nanoparticles with high stability under normal physiological conditions. Upon cellular internalization, the cooperative release of DOX and RNase A from the triblock copolymer nanoparticles is triggered at multiple stages by endosomal acidic environment and subsequent DOX&#8208;enhanced intracellular ROS environment. This leads to enhanced synergistic anticancer effects as demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Given the versatility of dynamic covalent conjugations, this work provides a universal and stable platform for intracellular co&#8208;delivery of various combinations of proteins and chemotherapeutics.

      <title>Historical Analysis of High&#8208;Efficiency, Large&#8208;Area Solar Cells: Toward Upscaling of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Lessons learned from the historical analysis of diverse solar cells provide a fundamental diagnosis of the relative and absolute development status of perovskite solar cells. The upscaling of perovskite solar cells and commercialization of various solar cells are comparatively analyzed and feasible technologies that can be applied to the perovskite upscaling process, both now and in the future, are suggested.








Abstract
The status and problems of upscaling research on perovskite solar cells, which must be addressed for commercialization efforts to be successful, are investigated. An 804 cm2 perovskite solar module has been reported with 17.9% efficiency, which is significantly lower than the champion perovskite solar cell efficiency of 25.2% reported for a 0.09 cm2 aperture area. For the realization of upscaling high&#8208;quality perovskite solar cells, the upscaling and development history of conventional silicon, copper indium gallium sulfur/selenide and CdTe solar cells, which are already commercialized with modules of sizes up to &#8776;25&#160;000 cm2, are reviewed. GaAs, organic, dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells and perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells are also reviewed. The similarities of the operating mechanisms between the various solar cells and the origin of different development pathway are investigated, and the ideal upscaling direction of perovskite solar cells is subsequently proposed. It is believed that lessons learned from the historical analysis of various solar cells provide a fundamental diagnosis of relative and absolute development status of perovskite solar cells. The unique perspective proposed here can pave the way toward the upscaling of perovskite solar cells.

      <title>Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte Design for Lithium Dendrite Suppression</title>
      <dc:description>
According to the proposed principles for the suppression of dendrite formation, a Li3N&#8211;LiF composite that is thermodynamically stable and has high interface energy against Li metal is designed as an interlayer for dendrite&#8208;free all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. A Li3N&#8211;LiF layer coating on a Li3PS4 solid&#8208;state electrolyte achieves a record&#8208;high critical current of &gt;6&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 even at a high capacity of 6.0 mAh cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries have attracted extensive attention due to their high safety and high energy density. However, Li dendrite growth in solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) still hinders their application. Current efforts mainly aim to reduce the interfacial resistance, neglecting the intrinsic dendrite&#8208;suppression capability of SSEs. Herein, the mechanism for the formation of Li dendrites is investigated, and Li&#8208;dendrite&#8208;free SSE criteria are reported. To achieve a high dendrite&#8208;suppression capability, SSEs should be thermodynamically stable with a high interface energy against Li, and they should have a low electronic conductivity and a high ionic conductivity. A cold&#8208;pressed Li3N&#8211;LiF composite is used to validate the Li&#8208;dendrite&#8208;free design criteria, where the highly ionic conductive Li3N reduces the Li plating/stripping overpotential, and LiF with high interface energy suppresses dendrites by enhancing the nucleation energy and suppressing the Li penetration into the SSEs. The Li3N&#8211;LiF layer coating on Li3PS4 SSE achieves a record&#8208;high critical current of &gt;6&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 even at a high capacity of 6.0 mAh cm&#8722;2. The Coulombic efficiency also reaches a record 99% in 150 cycles. The Li3N&#8211;LiF/Li3PS4 SSE enables LiCoO2 cathodes to achieve 101.6 mAh g&#8722;1 for 50 cycles. The design principle opens a new opportunity to develop high&#8208;energy all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.

      <title>Dual&#8208;Metal Interbonding as the Chemical Facilitator for Single&#8208;Atom Dispersions</title>
      <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;metal (Rh&#63743;Fe) interbonding facilitates each metal species to be atomically dispersed. The presence of Rh&#63743;Fe bonding between adjacent Fe and Rh single atoms contributes to thermodynamic stability, which facilitates the stripping of a single Fe atom from Fe nanoparticles, leading to a stabilized single atom. The existence of Fe prevents the aggregation of Rh nanoparticles before pyrolysis.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed catalysts, with maximized atom utilization of expensive metal components and relatively stable ligand structures, offer high reactivity and selectivity. However, the formation of atomic&#8208;scale metals without aggregation remains a formidable challenge due to thermodynamic stabilization driving forces. Here, a top&#8208;down process is presented that starts from iron nanoparticles, using dual&#8208;metal interbonds (Rh&#63743;Fe bonding) as a chemical facilitator to spontaneously convert Fe nanoparticles to single atoms at low temperatures. The presence of Rh&#63743;Fe bonding between adjacent Fe and Rh single atoms contributes to the thermodynamic stability, which facilitates the stripping of a single Fe atom from the Fe nanoparticles, leading to the stabilized single atom. The dual single&#8208;atom Rh&#8211;Fe catalyst renders excellent electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction in an acidic electrolyte. This discovery of dual&#8208;metal interbonding as a chemical facilitator paves a novel route for atomic dispersion of chemical metals and the design of efficient catalysts at the atomic scale.

     alt="Dual&#8208;Metal Interbonding as the Chemical Facilitator for Single&#8208;Atom Dispersions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dual&#8208;metal (Rh&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Fe) interbonding facilitates each metal species to be atomically dispersed. The presence of Rh&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Fe bonding between adjacent Fe and Rh single atoms contributes to thermodynamic stability, which facilitates the stripping of a single Fe atom from Fe nanoparticles, leading to a stabilized single atom. The existence of Fe prevents the aggregation of Rh nanoparticles before pyrolysis.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomically dispersed catalysts, with maximized atom utilization of expensive metal components and relatively stable ligand structures, offer high reactivity and selectivity. However, the formation of atomic&#8208;scale metals without aggregation remains a formidable challenge due to thermodynamic stabilization driving forces. Here, a top&#8208;down process is presented that starts from iron nanoparticles, using dual&#8208;metal interbonds (Rh&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Fe bonding) as a chemical facilitator to spontaneously convert Fe nanoparticles to single atoms at low temperatures. The presence of Rh&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Fe bonding between adjacent Fe and Rh single atoms contributes to the thermodynamic stability, which facilitates the stripping of a single Fe atom from the Fe nanoparticles, leading to the stabilized single atom. The dual single&#8208;atom Rh&#8211;Fe catalyst renders excellent electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction in an acidic electrolyte. This discovery of dual&#8208;metal interbonding as a chemical facilitator paves a novel route for atomic dispersion of chemical metals and the design of efficient catalysts at the atomic scale.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Magnetic&#8208;Pole Flip by Millimeter Wave</title>
      <dc:description>
A new magnetic recording methodology, &#8220;focused&#8208;millimeter&#8208;wave&#8208;assisted magnetic recording (F&#8208;MIMR)&#8221;, is demonstrated by irradiating a focused millimeter wave onto epsilon iron oxide. In F&#8208;MIMR, the magnetic pole direction is instantly switched by the focused millimeter wave generated from terahertz light, and the heat&#8208;up effect of the recording media is suppressed. Thus, F&#8208;MIMR can be applied to high&#8208;density magnetic recordings.








Abstract
In the era of Big Data and the Internet of Things, data archiving is a key technology. From this viewpoint, magnetic recordings are drawing attention because they guarantee long&#8208;term data storage. To archive an enormous amount of data, further increase of the recording density is necessary. Herein a new magnetic recording methodology, &#8220;focused&#8208;millimeter&#8208;wave&#8208;assisted magnetic recording (F&#8208;MIMR),&#8221; is proposed. To test this methodology, magnetic films based on epsilon iron oxide nanoparticles are prepared and a focused&#8208;millimeter&#8208;wave generator is constructed using terahertz (THz) light. Irradiating the focused millimeter wave to epsilon iron oxide instantly switches its magnetic pole direction. The spin dynamics of F&#8208;MIMR are also calculated using the stochastic Landau&#8211;Lifshitz&#8211;Gilbert model considering all of the spins in an epsilon iron oxide nanoparticle. In F&#8208;MIMR, the heat&#8208;up effect of the recording media is expected to be suppressed. Thus, F&#8208;MIMR can be applied to high&#8208;density magnetic recordings.

An A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule, COi6&#8208;4Cl, is synthesized and exploited in tumor theranostics. COi6&#8208;4Cl absorbs 880 nm light to emit bright NIR&#8208;II emission and exert type&#8208;I/II combined photodynamic reactions, which can realize deep&#8208;penetration fluorescence imaging and hypoxia&#8208;tolerant photodynamic therapy simultaneously by the same NIR&#8208;light irradiation. These features make COi6&#8208;4Cl a distinguished single&#8208;NIR&#8208;wavelength&#8208;activated phototheranostic material.








Abstract
As a common feature in a majority of malignant tumors, hypoxia has become the Achilles&#8217; heel of photodynamic therapy (PDT). The development of type&#8208;I photosensitizers that show hypoxia&#8208;tolerant PDT efficiency provides a straightforward way to address this issue. However, type&#8208;I PDT materials have rarely been discovered. Herein, a &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule with A&#8211;D&#8211;A configuration, COi6&#8208;4Cl, is reported. The H2O&#8208;dispersible nanoparticle of COi6&#8208;4Cl can be activated by an 880 nm laser, and displays hypoxia&#8208;tolerant type I/II combined PDT capability, and more notably, a high NIR&#8208;II fluorescence with a quantum yield over 5%. Moreover, COi6&#8208;4Cl shows a negligible photothermal conversion effect. The non&#8208;radiative decay of COi6&#8208;4Cl is suppressed in the dispersed and aggregated state due to the restricted molecular vibrations and distinct intermolecular steric hindrance induced by its four bulky side chains. These features make COi6&#8208;4Cl a distinguished single&#8208;NIR&#8208;wavelength&#8208;activated phototheranostic material, which performs well in NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;guided PDT treatment and shows an enhanced in vivo anti&#8208;tumor efficiency over the clinically approved Chlorin e6, by the equal stresses on hypoxia&#8208;tolerant anti&#8208;tumor therapy and deep&#8208;penetration imaging. Therefore, the great potential of COi6&#8208;4Cl in precise PDT cancer therapy against hypoxia challenges is demonstrated.

      <title>A New Highly Anisotropic Rh&#8208;Based Heusler Compound for Magnetic Recording</title>
      <dc:description>
Rh2CoSb is introduced as a potential hard magnet for heat&#8208;assisted magnetic recording. The hardness parameter of 3.7 is the highest observed for any rare&#8208;earth&#8208;free hard magnet. The temperature dependence of the anisotropy, together with the high anisotropic thermal conductivity of 20 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, makes Rh2CoSb a candidate for heat&#8208;assisted writing with a high recording density.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;density magnetic recording media is limited by superparamagnetism in very small ferromagnetic crystals. Hard magnetic materials with strong perpendicular anisotropy offer stability and high recording density. To overcome the difficulty of writing media with a large coercivity, heat&#8208;assisted magnetic recording was developed, rapidly heating the media to the Curie temperature Tc before writing, followed by rapid cooling. Requirements are a suitable Tc, coupled with anisotropic thermal conductivity and hard magnetic properties. Here, Rh2CoSb is introduced as a new hard magnet with potential for thin&#8208;film magnetic recording. A magnetocrystalline anisotropy of 3.6 MJ m&#8722;3 is combined with a saturation magnetization of &#956;0Ms&#160;= 0.52 T at 2 K (2.2 MJ m&#8722;3 and 0.44 T at room temperature). The magnetic hardness parameter of 3.7 at room temperature is the highest observed for any rare&#8208;earth&#8208;free hard magnet. The anisotropy is related to an unquenched orbital moment of 0.42 &#956;B on Co, which is hybridized with neighboring Rh atoms with a large spin&#8211;orbit interaction. Moreover, the pronounced temperature dependence of the anisotropy that follows from its Tc of 450 K, together with a thermal conductivity of 20 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, make Rh2CoSb a candidate for the development of heat&#8208;assisted writing with a recording density in excess of 10&#160;Tb in.&#8722;2.

      <title>Discovery of Real&#8208;Space Topological Ferroelectricity in Metallic Transition Metal Phosphides</title>
      <dc:description>
Ferroelectric metals are an intriguing frontier research field. Real&#8208;space topological ferroelectricity in asymmetric Ni2P metal is reported. Governed by a balance of the polyhedral polarity, the in&#8208;plane compressive strain creates a tunable bilinear double&#8208;well potential, and the reversible polarity couples with the momentum&#8208;dependent spin polarization. These findings open up a field for exploring valence&#8211;polarity&#8211;spin correlation in metallic systems with non&#8208;centrosymmetry.








Abstract
Ferroelectric metals&#8212;with coexisting ferroelectricity and structural asymmetry&#8212;challenge traditional perceptions because free electrons screen electrostatic forces between ions, the driving force of breaking the spatial inversion symmetry. Despite ferroelectric metals having been unveiled one after another, topologically switchable polar objects with metallicity have never been identified so far. Here, the discovery of real&#8208;space topological ferroelectricity in metallic and non&#8208;centrosymmetric Ni2P is reported. Protected by the rotation&#8211;inversion symmetry operation, it is found that the balanced polarity of alternately stacked polyhedra couples intimately with elemental valence states, which are verified using quantitative electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that an applied in&#8208;plane compressive strain creates a tunable bilinear double&#8208;well potential and reverses the polyhedral polarity on a unit&#8208;cell scale. The dual roles of nickel cations, including polar displacement inside polyhedral cages and a 3D bonding network, facilitate the coexistence of topological polarity with metallicity. In addition, the switchable in&#8208;plane polyhedral polarity gives rise to a spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupling&#8208;induced spin texture with large momentum&#8208;dependent spin splitting. These findings point out a new direction for exploring valence&#8211;polarity&#8211;spin correlative interactions via topological ferroelectricity in metallic systems with structural asymmetry.

Here, the discovery of real&#8208;space topological ferroelectricity in metallic and non&#8208;centrosymmetric Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P is reported. Protected by the rotation&#8211;inversion symmetry operation, it is found that the balanced polarity of alternately stacked polyhedra couples intimately with elemental valence states, which are verified using quantitative electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that an applied in&#8208;plane compressive strain creates a tunable bilinear double&#8208;well potential and reverses the polyhedral polarity on a unit&#8208;cell scale. The dual roles of nickel cations, including polar displacement inside polyhedral cages and a 3D bonding network, facilitate the coexistence of topological polarity with metallicity. In addition, the switchable in&#8208;plane polyhedral polarity gives rise to a spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupling&#8208;induced spin texture with large momentum&#8208;dependent spin splitting. These findings point out a new direction for exploring valence&#8211;polarity&#8211;spin correlative interactions via topological ferroelectricity in metallic systems with structural asymmetry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Organic Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescence from a Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Compound</title>
      <dc:description>
Organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence from an organic thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) compound is demonstrated. It is also shown that this phenomenon can occur in a number of chemically distinct host matrices. Furthermore, this work reveals the important role that photoinduced charges play in TADF&#8208;emitter&#8208;doped films, which has a significant impact on their photophysical properties.








Abstract
Organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL) is one of the most promising methods for long&#8208;lived&#8208;emission applications. However, present room&#8208;temperature OLPL emitters are mainly based on a bimolecular exciplex system which usually needs an expensive small molecule such as 2,8&#8208;bis(diphenyl&#8208;phosphoryl)dibenzo[b,d]thiophene (PPT) as the acceptor. In this study, a new thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) compound, 3&#8208;(4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;b]pyrazine&#8208;8,9&#8208;dicarbonitrile (CzPhAP), is designed, which also shows OLPL in many well&#8208;known hosts such as PPT, 2,2&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;benzinetriyl)&#8208;tris(1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;H&#8208;benzimidazole) (TPBi), and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), without any exciplex formation, and its OLPL duration reaches more than 1&#160;h at room temperature. Combining the low cost of PMMA manufacture and flexible designs of TADF molecules, pure organic, large&#8208;scale, color tunable, and low&#8208;cost room&#8208;temperature OLPL applications become possible. Moreover, it is found that the onset of the 77&#160;K afterglow spectra from a TADF&#8208;emitter&#8208;doped film is not necessarily reliable for determining the lowest triplet state energy level. This is because in some TADF&#8208;emitter&#8208;doped films, optical excitation can generate charges (electron and holes) that can later recombine to form singlet excitons during the phosphorescence spectrum measurement. The spectrum taken in the phosphorescence time window at low temperature may consequently consist of both singlet and triplet emission.

      <dc:description>
Atom qubits in silicon provide a promising platform for realising a scalable quantum computer. In article number 2003361, Michelle Simmons and co&#8208;workers present a qubit environment with a notably low level of charge noise achieved by hosting phosphorus atoms in an all&#8208;crystalline silicon substrate well&#8208;separated from surface and interface states. The level of charge noise experienced by the phosphorus atoms is sufficiently low to enable two&#8208;qubit gate fidelities above 99.99%, well within the 99% threshold required for error&#8208;correction.

      <dc:description>
In article number 2004300, Young Keun Kim, Heemin Kang, and co&#8208;workers report a magnetic nano&#8208;barcoding system that enables unique tunability of ligand frequency and nano&#8208;sequences to effectively regulate stem cell adhesion with no systemic toxicity in vivo. Low&#8208;frequency and terminally sequenced nano&#8208;ligands facilitate focal adhesion, mechanotransduction, and differentiation of stem cells.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.2020043002004300&lt;/a&gt;, Young Keun Kim, Heemin Kang, and co&#8208;workers report a magnetic nano&#8208;barcoding system that enables unique tunability of ligand frequency and nano&#8208;sequences to effectively regulate stem cell adhesion with no systemic toxicity in vivo. Low&#8208;frequency and terminally sequenced nano&#8208;ligands facilitate focal adhesion, mechanotransduction, and differentiation of stem cells.

      <dc:description>
A relation map of dynamic fibers/fabrics with responsive functions, including actuation, sensing, and energy harvesting, is built for potential construction of a soft, safe, user&#8208;friendly human&#8211;robot interface. It promises the seamless integration between actuators, sensors, and power sources into fibers/fabrics, envisaging self&#8208;regulated, autonomous, and intelligent robotic fibers/fabrics for daily functions and biomedical services.








Abstract
Soft robotics inspired by the movement of living organisms, with excellent adaptability and accuracy for accomplishing tasks, are highly desirable for efficient operations and safe interactions with human. With the emerging wearable electronics, higher tactility and skin affinity are pursued for safe and user&#8208;friendly human&#8211;robot interactions. Fabrics interlocked by fibers perform traditional static functions such as warming, protection, and fashion. Recently, dynamic fibers and fabrics are favorable to deliver active stimulus responses such as sensing and actuating abilities for soft&#8208;robots and wearables. First, the responsive mechanisms of fiber/fabric actuators and their performances under various external stimuli are reviewed. Fiber/yarn&#8208;based artificial muscles for soft&#8208;robots manipulation and assistance in human motion are discussed, as well as smart clothes for improving human perception. Second, the geometric designs, fabrications, mechanisms, and functions of fibers/fabrics for sensing and energy harvesting from the human body and environments are summarized. Effective integration between the electronic components with garments, human skin, and living organisms is illustrated, presenting multifunctional platforms with self&#8208;powered potential for human&#8211;robot interactions and biomedicine. Lastly, the relationships between robotic/wearable fibers/fabrics and the external stimuli, together with the challenges and possible routes for revolutionizing the robotic fibers/fabrics and wearables in this new era are proposed.

      <title>Scalable Functionalization of Optical Fibers Using Atomically Thin Semiconductors</title>
      <dc:description>
Chemical vapor deposition of monolayer MoS2 and WS2 on microstructured optical fibers is used to integrate atomically thin materials into optical fibers. This approach yields novel opportunities in integrated photonics. In two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiments excitation, and collection of excitonic photoluminescence with the fiber modes and third&#8208;harmonic enhancement due to nonlinear polarization of the monolayers is demonstrated.








Abstract
Atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides are highly promising for integrated optoelectronic and photonic systems due to their exciton&#8208;driven linear and nonlinear interactions with light. Integrating them into optical fibers yields novel opportunities in optical communication, remote sensing, and all&#8208;fiber optoelectronics. However, the scalable and reproducible deposition of high&#8208;quality monolayers on optical fibers is a challenge. Here, the chemical vapor deposition of monolayer MoS2 and WS2 crystals on the core of microstructured exposed&#8208;core optical fibers and their interaction with the fibers&#8217; guided modes are reported. Two distinct application possibilities of 2D&#8208;functionalized waveguides to exemplify their potential are demonstrated. First, the excitonic 2D material photoluminescence is simultaneously excited and collected with the fiber modes, opening a novel route to remote sensing. Then it is shown that third&#8208;harmonic generation is modified by the highly localized nonlinear polarization of the monolayers, yielding a new avenue to tailor nonlinear optical processes in fibers. It is anticipated that the results may lead to significant advances in optical&#8208;fiber&#8208;based technologies.

      <title>Progress in Materials, Solution Processes, and Long&#8208;Term Stability for Large&#8208;Area Organic Photovoltaics</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent advances in organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials and processing technologies are promising for transitioning of OPV devices from laboratory&#8208;scale to large&#8208;area industrial scale modules. Recent breakthroughs attained by development of nonfullerene acceptors have led to significant enhancement in power conversion efficiency. It is essential to elucidate degradation mechanisms of OPV devices for improving device long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Organic solar cells based on bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) are attractive energy&#8208;conversion devices that can generate electricity from absorbed sunlight by dissociating excitons and collecting charge carriers. Recent breakthroughs attained by development of nonfullerene acceptors result in significant enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCEs) exceeding 17%. However, most of researches have focused on pursuing high efficiency of small&#8208;area (&lt;1 cm2) unit cells fabricated usually with spin coating. For practical application of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) from lab&#8208;scale unit cells to industrial products, it is essential to develop efficient technologies that can extend active area of devices with minimized loss of performance and ensured operational stability. In this progress report, an overview of recent advancements in materials and processing technologies is provided for transitioning from small&#8208;area laboratory&#8208;scale devices to large&#8208;area industrial scale modules. First, development of materials that satisfy requirements of high tolerability in active layer thickness and large&#8208;area adaptability is introduced. Second, morphology control using various coating techniques in a large active area is discussed. Third, the recent research progress is also underlined for understanding mechanisms of OPV degradation and studies for improving device long&#8208;term stability along with reliable evaluation procedures.

      <title>Continuous Synthesis of Hollow High&#8208;Entropy Nanoparticles for Energy and Catalysis Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
The rapid and continuous synthesis of hollow high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy (HEA) nanoparticles by a &#8220;droplet&#8208;to&#8208;particle&#8221; nanomanufacturing method is reported. The formation of hollow HEA nanoparticles is enabled by the introduction of a blowing agent. The high active sites per mass ratio of such hollow HEA nanoparticles makes them promising candidates for electrocatalysis.








Abstract
Mixing multimetallic elements in hollow&#8208;structured nanoparticles is a promising strategy for the synthesis of highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective catalysts. However, the synthesis of multimetallic hollow nanoparticles is limited to two or three elements due to the difficulties in morphology control under the harsh alloying conditions. Herein, the rapid and continuous synthesis of hollow high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy (HEA) nanoparticles using a continuous &#8220;droplet&#8208;to&#8208;particle&#8221; method is reported. The formation of these hollow HEA nanoparticles is enabled through the decomposition of a gas&#8208;blowing agent in which a large amount of gas is produced in situ to &#8220;puff&#8221; the droplet during heating, followed by decomposition of the metal salt precursors and nucleation/growth of multimetallic particles. The high active sites per mass ratio of such hollow HEA nanoparticles makes them promising candidates for energy and electrocatalysis applications. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, it is demonstrated that these materials can be applied as the cathode catalyst for Li&#8211;O2 battery operations with a record&#8208;high current density per catalyst mass loading of 2000&#160;mA gcat.&#8722;1, as well as good stability and durable catalytic activity. This work offers a viable strategy for the continuous manufacturing of hollow HEA nanomaterials that can find broad applications in energy and catalysis.

      <title>Biomineralized Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles Potentiate Safe and Efficient Tumor Microenvironment Reprogramming for Anticancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Outer membrane vesicle (OMV)&#8208;based platform is developed through biomineralization, in which biocompatible calcium phosphate is employed to cover the surface of OMVs. Such a &#8220;shielding&#8221; strategy not only enables safe and flexible deployment of OMVs for tumor accumulation and tumor microenvironment (TME) reprogramming, but also brings an additional functionality of neutralizing the acidic TME, leading to a potent anticancer therapeutic effect.








Abstract
The highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in solid tumors often dampens the efficacy of immunotherapy. In this study, bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are demonstrated as powerful immunostimulants for TME reprogramming. To overcome the obstacles of antibody&#8208;dependent clearance and high toxicity induced by OMVs upon intravenous injection (a classic clinically relevant delivery mode), calcium phosphate (CaP) shells are employed to cover the surface of OMVs, which enables potent OMV&#8208;based TME reprograming without side effects. Meanwhile, the pH&#8208;sensitive CaP shells facilitate the neutralization of acidic TME, leading to highly beneficial M2&#8208;to&#8208;M1 polarization of macrophages for improved antitumor effect. Moreover, the outer shells can be integrated with functional components like folic acid or photosensitizer agents, which facilitates the use of the OMV&#8208;based platform in combination therapies for a synergic therapeutic effect.

To overcome the obstacles of antibody&#8208;dependent clearance and high toxicity induced by OMVs upon intravenous injection (a classic clinically relevant delivery mode), calcium phosphate (CaP) shells are employed to cover the surface of OMVs, which enables potent OMV&#8208;based TME reprograming without side effects. Meanwhile, the pH&#8208;sensitive CaP shells facilitate the neutralization of acidic TME, leading to highly beneficial M2&#8208;to&#8208;M1 polarization of macrophages for improved antitumor effect. Moreover, the outer shells can be integrated with functional components like folic acid or photosensitizer agents, which facilitates the use of the OMV&#8208;based platform in combination therapies for a synergic therapeutic effect.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pressure&#8208;Dependent Behavior of Defect&#8208;Modulated Band Structure in Boron Arsenide</title>
      <dc:description>
Impurities and defects play a significant role in the thermal, electrical, and optical properties of boron arsenide (BAs). Si&#8208;/C&#8208; donor&#8211;acceptor pair transitions are identified within the indirect bandgap. With high pressure/strain applied by a diamond anvil cell, the intrinsic band structure of BAs can be modified, suggesting potential applications in electronic devices by strain.








Abstract
The recent observation of unusually high thermal conductivity exceeding 1000 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 in single&#8208;crystal boron arsenide (BAs) has led to interest in the potential application of this semiconductor for thermal management. Although both the electron/hole high mobilities have been calculated for BAs, there is a lack of experimental investigation of its electronic properties. Here, a photoluminescence (PL) measurement of single&#8208;crystal BAs at different temperatures and pressures is reported. The measurements reveal an indirect bandgap and two donor&#8211;acceptor pair (DAP) recombination transitions. Based on first&#8208;principles calculations and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry results, the two DAP transitions are confirmed to originate from Si and C impurities occupying shallow energy levels in the bandgap. High&#8208;pressure PL spectra show that the donor level with respect to the conduction band minimum shrinks with increasing pressure, which affects the release of free carriers from defect states. These findings suggest the possibility of strain engineering of the transport properties of BAs for application in electronic devices.

      <title>Emerging Prospects of Exosomes for Cancer Treatment: From Conventional Therapy to Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Exosomes are nano&#8208;sized vesicles secreted by cells that reflect features of parental cells and play critical roles in intercellular communication. Exosomes are suitable for cancer treatment by providing an optimal environment to convey various bioactive molecules. This review covers advantages of using exosomes for cancer treatment from conventional therapy to immunotherapy, and challenges to be solved for clinical usage.








Abstract
Exosomes are a class of extracellular vesicles of around 100&#160;nm in diameter that are secreted by most cells and contain various bioactive molecules reflecting their cellular origin and mediate intercellular communication. Studies of these exosomal features in tumor pathogenesis have led to the development of therapeutic and diagnostic approaches using exosomes for cancer therapy. Exosomes have many advantages for conveying therapeutic agents such as small interfering RNAs, microRNAs, membrane&#8208;associated proteins, and chemotherapeutic compounds; thus, they are considered a prime candidate as a delivery tool for cancer treatment. Since exosomes also provide an optimal microenvironment for the effective function of immunomodulatory factors, exosomes harboring bioactive molecules have been bioengineered as cancer immunotherapies that can effectively activate each stage of the cancer immunity cycle to successfully elicit cancer&#8208;specific immunity. This review discusses the advantages of exosomes for treating cancer and the challenges that must be overcome for their successful clinical development.

      <title>Tunable Ferromagnetism and Thermally Induced Spin Flip in Vanadium&#8208;Doped Tungsten Diselenide Monolayers at Room Temperature</title>
      <dc:description>
Strong and tunable room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism is achieved in vanadium&#8208;doped tungsten diselenide monolayers using a reproducible and atmospheric&#8208;pressure film sulfidation growth method. As the vanadium concentration increases, the saturation magnetization increases, which is optimal at &#8776;4 at% vanadium&#8212;the highest doping level ever achieved for V&#8208;doped WSe2 monolayers. A novel thermally induced spin flipping effect is also discovered in these monolayers.








Abstract
The outstanding optoelectronic and valleytronic properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have triggered intense research efforts by the scientific community. An alternative to induce long&#8208;range ferromagnetism (FM) in TMDs is by introducing magnetic dopants to form a dilute magnetic semiconductor. Enhancing ferromagnetism in these semiconductors not only represents a key step toward modern TMD&#8208;based spintronics, but also enables exploration of new and exciting dimensionality&#8208;driven magnetic phenomena. To this end, tunable ferromagnetism at room temperature and a thermally induced spin flip (TISF) in monolayers of V&#8208;doped WSe2 are shown. As vanadium concentration increases, the saturation magnetization increases, which is optimal at &#8776;4 at% vanadium; the highest doping level ever achieved for V&#8208;doped WSe2 monolayers. The TISF occurs at &#8776;175 K and becomes more pronounced upon increasing the temperature toward room temperature. The TISF can be manipulated by changing the vanadium concentration. The TISF is attributed to the magnetic&#8208;field&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent flipping of the nearest W&#8208;site magnetic moments that are antiferromagnetically coupled to the V magnetic moments in the ground state. This is fully supported by a recent spin&#8208;polarized density functional theory study. The findings pave the way for the development of novel spintronic and valleytronic nanodevices and stimulate further research.

Abstract
Low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;safety aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries are an exceptionally compelling technology for grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, their development has been plagued by the lack of stable cathode materials allowing fast Zn2+&#8208;ion insertion and scalable synthesis. Here, a lattice&#8208;water&#8208;rich, inorganic&#8208;open&#8208;framework (IOF) phosphovanadate cathode, which is mass&#8208;producible and delivers high capacity (228 mAh g&#8722;1) and energy density (193.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 or 513&#160;Wh L&#8722;1), is reported. The abundant lattice waters functioning as a &#8220;charge shield&#8221; enable a low Zn2+&#8208;migration energy barrier, (0.66&#160;eV) even close to that of Li+ within LiFePO4. This fast intrinsic ion&#8208;diffusion kinetics, together with nanostructure effect, allow the achievements of ultrafast charging (71% state of charge in 1.9 min) and an ultrahigh power density (7200 W kg&#8722;1 at 107&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1). Equally important, the IOF exhibits a quasi&#8208;zero&#8208;strain feature (&lt;1% lattice change upon (de)zincation), which ensures ultrahigh cycling durability (3000 cycles) and Coulombic efficiencies of 100%. The cell&#8208;level energy and power densities reach &#8776;90&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and &#8776;3320 W kg&#8722;1, far surpassing commercial lead&#8211;acid, Ni&#8211;Cd, and Ni&#8211;MH batteries. Lattice&#8208;water&#8208;rich IOFs may open up new opportunities for exploring stable and fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8208;ion batteries.

      <title>Six Birds with One Stone: Versatile Nanoporphyrin for Single&#8208;Laser&#8208;Triggered Synergistic Phototheranostics and Robust Immune Activation</title>
      <dc:description>
A versatile nanoporphyrin (Pp18&#8208;lipo) that self&#8208;assembled from lipid&#8211;purpurin 18 conjugates (Pp18&#8208;lipids) and pure lipids is developed for multifunctional cancer theranostics. Upon exposure to a single 705&#160;nm&#8208;laser, the as&#8208;prepared Pp18&#8208;lipos with two different proportions of Pp18&#8208;lipids can simultaneously realize photoacoustic imaging, fluorescence imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, and immune activation.








Abstract
Simultaneous photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) can reduce the risks of drug leakage, body burden, and preparation complexity in traditional combination PDT/PTT. Here, a versatile nanoporphyrin (Pp18&#8208;lipos) self&#8208;assembled from lipid&#8211;purpurin 18 conjugates (Pp18&#8208;lipids) and pure lipids is presented. The as&#8208;prepared Pp18&#8208;lipos with 2 mol% Pp18&#8208;lipids can perform effective PDT and fluorescence imaging. The Pp18&#8208;lipos with 65 mol% Pp18 can perform potent PTT and photoacoustic imaging. The chelation of Mn2+ endows the Pp18&#8208;lipids&#8208;Mn2+ a high T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance imaging contrast. Notably, pretreatment of low&#8208;dose PDT facilitates the endocytosis and tumor accumulation of Pp18&#8208;lipos, thus achieving synergistic PDT/PTT. Upon exposure to a single 705&#160;nm&#8208;laser, the combination of PDT/PTT achieves a significantly higher tumor growth inhibition rate than PDT or PTT alone. In addition, it is found that the synergistic PDT/PTT triggers more potent anti&#8208;tumor immune response including tumor infiltration of immune cells and release of related cytokines.

     alt="Six Birds with One Stone: Versatile Nanoporphyrin for Single&#8208;Laser&#8208;Triggered Synergistic Phototheranostics and Robust Immune Activation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A versatile nanoporphyrin (Pp18&#8208;lipo) that self&#8208;assembled from lipid&#8211;purpurin 18 conjugates (Pp18&#8208;lipids) and pure lipids is developed for multifunctional cancer theranostics. Upon exposure to a single 705&#160;nm&#8208;laser, the as&#8208;prepared Pp18&#8208;lipos with two different proportions of Pp18&#8208;lipids can simultaneously realize photoacoustic imaging, fluorescence imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, and immune activation.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneous photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) can reduce the risks of drug leakage, body burden, and preparation complexity in traditional combination PDT/PTT. Here, a versatile nanoporphyrin (Pp18&#8208;lipos) self&#8208;assembled from lipid&#8211;purpurin 18 conjugates (Pp18&#8208;lipids) and pure lipids is presented. The as&#8208;prepared Pp18&#8208;lipos with 2 mol% Pp18&#8208;lipids can perform effective PDT and fluorescence imaging. The Pp18&#8208;lipos with 65 mol% Pp18 can perform potent PTT and photoacoustic imaging. The chelation of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; endows the Pp18&#8208;lipids&#8208;Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; a high &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance imaging contrast. Notably, pretreatment of low&#8208;dose PDT facilitates the endocytosis and tumor accumulation of Pp18&#8208;lipos, thus achieving synergistic PDT/PTT. Upon exposure to a single 705&#160;nm&#8208;laser, the combination of PDT/PTT achieves a significantly higher tumor growth inhibition rate than PDT or PTT alone. In addition, it is found that the synergistic PDT/PTT triggers more potent anti&#8208;tumor immune response including tumor infiltration of immune cells and release of related cytokines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bioinspired Anti&#8208;Plateau&#8211;Rayleigh&#8208;Instability on Dual Parallel Fibers</title>
      <dc:description>
Inspired by the unique topological structure of mulberry silk, a facile strategy is proposed to overcome the fluidic Plateau&#8211;Rayleigh instability (PRI) during the fibrous solution coating process using dual parallel cylindrical fibers, by which a uniform and smooth coating on fibers is realized.








Abstract
The Plateau&#8211;Rayleigh instability (PRI) is a well&#8208;known phenomenon where a liquid column always breaks up into droplets to achieve the minimization of surface energy. It normally leads to the non&#8208;uniformity of a liquid film, which, however, is unfavorable for the fluid coating process. So far, strategies to overcome this instability rely on either the surfactants, UV/high&#8208;temp curing treatments, or specific chemical reactions, which suffer from both limited liquid composition and complicated experimental conditions. Natural mulberry silk, a typical composite fiber, is produced by silkworms through a similar fluidic coating process, but exhibits a remarkably uniform and smooth surface. Drawing inspiration, it is revealed that the unique dual parallel fibers are capable of overcoming the PRI during the fluid coating process. Such anti&#8208;PRI ability is attributable to the changes in the Laplace pressure difference caused by the alternative asymmetry of the liquid film, as has been demonstrated by both a force analysis on the irregular liquid film and theoretical simulation according to the stability of the liquid on parallel fibers in the fluid coating process. The strategy is applicable for preparing various smooth functional coatings on fibers, which offers new perspectives for fluid coating and microfluidic technologies.

      <title>An Organelle&#8208;Specific Nanozyme for Diabetes Care in Genetically or Diet&#8208;Induced Models</title>
      <dc:description>
Iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) subcellularly induce adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate&#8208;activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation via organelle&#8208;specific peroxidase&#8208;like activity. Administration of Fe3O4 NPs enhances the glucose uptake capacity and insulin sensitivity, demonstrating therapeutic effects on hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in Drosophila and mouse models of type 2 diabetes.








Abstract
The development of nanozymes has made active impact in diagnosis and therapeutics. However, understanding of the full effects of these nanozymes on biochemical pathways and metabolic homeostasis remains elusive. Here, it is found that iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs), a type of well&#8208;established nanozyme, can locally regulate the energy sensor adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate&#8208;activated protein kinase (AMPK) via their peroxidase&#8208;like activity in the acidic lysosomal compartment, thereby promoting glucose metabolism and insulin response. Fe3O4 NPs induce AMPK activation and enhance glucose uptake in a variety of metabolically active cells as well as in insulin resistant cell models. Dietary Fe3O4 NPs display therapeutic effects on hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in Drosophila models of diabetes induced by genetic manipulation or high&#8208;sugar diet. More importantly, intraperitoneal administration of Fe3O4 NPs stimulates AMPK activities in metabolic tissues, reduces blood glucose levels, and improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in diabetic ob/ob mice. The study reveals intrinsic organelle&#8208;specific properties of Fe3O4 NPs in AMPK activation, glycemic control, and insulin&#8208;resistance improvement, suggesting their potential efficacy in diabetes care.

      <title>Hole&#8208;Trapping&#8208;Induced Stabilization of Ni4&#8201;+ in SrNiO3/LaFeO3 Superlattices</title>
      <dc:description>
The otherwise unstable Ni4+ can be stabilized in perovskite oxides by artificial structuring in carefully designed (SrNiO3)1/(LaFeO3)n superlattices. Spectroscopy measurements in combination with density functional theory calculations reveal that the B&#8208;site cation valences can be tuned by controlling the magnitude of the FeO6 octahedral rotations, which in turn drive the energy balance between Ni3+/Fe4+ and Ni4+/Fe3+, thus controlling emergent electrical properties.








Abstract
Creating new functionality in materials containing transition metals is predicated on the ability to control the associated charge states. For a given transition metal, there is an upper limit on valence that is not exceeded under normal conditions. Here, it is demonstrated that this limit of 3+ for Ni and Fe can be exceeded via synthesis of (SrNiO3)m/(LaFeO3)n superlattices by tuning n and m. The Goldschmidt tolerance constraints are lifted, and SrNi4+O3 with holes on adjacent O anions is stabilized as a perovskite at the single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell level (m&#160;= 1). Holding m&#160;= 1, spectroscopy reveals that the n&#160;= 1 superlattice contains Ni3+ and Fe4+, whereas Ni4+ and Fe3+ are observed in the n&#160;= 5 superlattice. It is revealed that the B&#8208;site cation valences can be tuned by controlling the magnitude of the FeO6 octahedral rotations, which, in turn, determine the energy balance between Ni3+/Fe4+ and Ni4+/Fe3+, thus controlling emergent electrical properties such as the band alignment and resulting hole confinement. This approach can be extended to other systems for synthesizing novel, metastable layered structures with new functionalities.

      <dc:description>
Monitoring of the freshness of meat is important for food safety and food waste reduction. Few E&#8208;noses have been integrated with food supply chains due to either sensing or pattern recognition issues. Cross&#8208;reactive colorimetric barcode combinatorics and deep convolutional neural networks are combined to form a portable, automatic, and accurate, real&#8208;time platform for monitoring of meat freshness.








Abstract
Artificial scent screening systems (known as electronic noses, E&#8208;noses) have been researched extensively. A portable, automatic, and accurate, real&#8208;time E&#8208;nose requires both robust cross&#8208;reactive sensing and fingerprint pattern recognition. Few E&#8208;noses have been commercialized because they suffer from either sensing or pattern&#8208;recognition issues. Here, cross&#8208;reactive colorimetric barcode combinatorics and deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are combined to form a system for monitoring meat freshness that concurrently provides scent fingerprint and fingerprint recognition. The barcodes&#8212;comprising 20 different types of porous nanocomposites of chitosan, dye, and cellulose acetate&#8212;form scent fingerprints that are identifiable by DCNN. A fully supervised DCNN trained using 3475 labeled barcode images predicts meat freshness with an overall accuracy of 98.5%. Incorporating DCNN into a smartphone application forms a simple platform for rapid barcode scanning and identification of food freshness in real time. The system is fast, accurate, and non&#8208;destructive, enabling consumers and all stakeholders in the food supply chain to monitor food freshness.

In this progress report, the recent advances of the memristive electronic system are comprehensively introduced and discussed in terms of various types of the memristors, their functional principles, representative learning algorithms, and hardware implementations.








Abstract
Memristors have recently attracted significant interest due to their applicability as promising building blocks of neuromorphic computing and electronic systems. The dynamic reconfiguration of memristors, which is based on the history of applied electrical stimuli, can mimic both essential analog synaptic and neuronal functionalities. These can be utilized as the node and terminal devices in an artificial neural network. Consequently, the ability to understand, control, and utilize fundamental switching principles and various types of device architectures of the memristor is necessary for achieving memristor&#8208;based neuromorphic hardware systems. Herein, a wide range of memristors and memristive&#8208;related devices for artificial synapses and neurons is highlighted. The device structures, switching principles, and the applications of essential synaptic and neuronal functionalities are sequentially presented. Moreover, recent advances in memristive artificial neural networks and their hardware implementations are introduced along with an overview of the various learning algorithms. Finally, the main challenges of the memristive synapses and neurons toward high&#8208;performance and energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing are briefly discussed. This progress report aims to be an insightful guide for the research on memristors and neuromorphic&#8208;based computing.

      <title>Prebiotics&#8208;Encapsulated Probiotic Spores Regulate Gut Microbiota and Suppress Colon Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>
Through host&#8211;guest chemistry between Clostridium butyricum and chemically modified prebiotic dextran, prebiotics&#8208;encapsulated probiotic spores (spores&#8208;dex) are prepared to achieve oral bacterial treatment of colon cancer.








Abstract
While microbial&#8208;based therapy has been considered as an effective strategy for treating diseases such as colon cancer, its safety remains the biggest challenge. Here, probiotics and prebiotics, which possess ideal biocompatibility and are extensively used as additives in food and pharmaceutical products, are combined to construct a safe microbiota&#8208;modulating material. Through the host&#8211;guest chemistry between commercial Clostridium butyricum and chemically modified prebiotic dextran, prebiotics&#8208;encapsulated probiotic spores (spores&#8208;dex) are prepared. It is found that spores&#8208;dex can specifically enrich in colon cancers after oral administration. In the lesion, dextran is fermented by C. butyricum, and thereby produces anti&#8208;cancer short&#8208;chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Additionally, spores&#8208;dex regulate the gut microbiota, augment the abundance of SCFA&#8208;producing bacteria (e.g., Eubacterium and Roseburia), and markedly increase the overall richness of microbiota. In subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor models, drug&#8208;loaded spores&#8208;dex inhibit tumor growth up to 89% and 65%, respectively. Importantly, no obvious adverse effect is found. The work sheds light on the possibility of using a highly safe strategy to regulate gut microbiota, and provides a promising avenue for treating various gastrointestinal diseases.

      <dc:description>
Piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) aims to generate sufficient power to operate targeting devices from limited ambient energy. PEH includes mechanical&#8208;to&#8208;mechanical, mechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical, and electrical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversions, which are related to structures, materials, and circuits, respectively; these should be efficient for increasing total power.

This critical review focuses on PEH structures and materials associated with the two major energy conversions to improve PEH performance. First, the resonance tuning mechanisms for PEH structures maintaining continuous resonance, regardless of a change in the vibration frequency, are presented. Based on the manual tuning technique, the electrically&#8208; and mechanically&#8208;driven self&#8208;resonance tuning (SRT) techniques are introduced in detail. The representative SRT harvesters are summarized in terms of tunability, power consumption, and net power. Second, the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merits of the piezoelectric materials for output power are summarized based on the operating conditions, and optimal piezoelectric materials are suggested. Piezoelectric materials with large kij, dij, and gij values are suitable for most PEHs, whereas those with large kij and Qm values should be used for on&#8208;resonance conditions, wherein the mechanical energy is directly supplied to the piezoelectric material. This comprehensive review provides insights for designing efficient structures and selection of proper piezoelectric materials for PEHs.

      <title>Energy Manipulation in Lanthanide&#8208;Doped Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticles for Tunable Dual&#8208;Mode Luminescence toward Advanced Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
      <dc:description>
A new mechanistic strategy for achieving efficient dual&#8208;mode emissions with multicolor outputs in a designed core&#8211;shell nanostructure is proposed via Gd3+&#8208;mediated interfacial energy transfer and Ce3+&#8208;assisted cross&#8208;relaxation processes, which is of great significance for understanding and controlling energy transfer at the nanoscale and provides valuable references to the design of novel luminescent materials for anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.








Abstract
Developing advanced luminescent materials and techniques is of significant importance for anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications, and remains a huge challenge. In this work, a new and efficient approach for achieving efficient dual&#8208;mode luminescence with tunable color outputs via Gd3+&#8208;mediated interfacial energy transfer, Ce3+&#8208;assisted cross&#8208;relaxation, and core&#8211;shell nanostructuring strategy is reported. The introduction of Ce3+ into the inner core not only serves the regulation of upconversion emission, but also facilitates the ultraviolet photon harvesting and subsequent energy transfer to downshifting (DS) activators in the outer shell layer. Furthermore, the construction of the core@shell nanoarchitecture enables the spatial separation of upconverting activators and DS centers, which greatly suppresses their adverse cross&#8208;relaxation processes. Consequently, efficient and multicolor&#8208;tunable dual&#8208;mode emissions can be simultaneously observed in the pre&#8208;designed NaGdF4:Yb/Ho/Ce@NaYF4:X (X = Eu, Tb, Sm, Dy) core&#8211;shell nanostructures under 254 nm ultraviolet light and 980 nm laser excitation. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment demonstrates that 2D&#8208;encoded patterns based on dual&#8208;mode emitting nanomaterials are very promising for anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications. It is believed that this preliminary study will advance the development of the fluorescent materials for potential applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and optical multiplexing.

Abstract
Smart and wearable electronics have aroused substantial demand for flexible portable power sources, but it remains a large challenge to realize scalable production of wearable batteries/supercapacitors with high electrochemical performance and remarkable flexibility simultaneously. Here, a scalable approach is developed to prepare wearable solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion capacitors (LICs) with superior performance enabled by synergetic engineering from materials to device architecture. Nitrogen&#8208;doped hierarchical carbon (HC) composed of 1D carbon nanofibers welded with 2D carbon nanosheets is synthesized via a unique self&#8208;propagating high&#8208;temperature synthesis (SHS) technique, which exhibits superior electrochemical performance. Subsequently, inspired by origami, here, wave&#8208;shaped LIC punch&#8208;cells based on the above materials are designed by employing a compatible and scalable post&#8208;imprint technology. Finite elemental analysis (FEA) confirms that the bending stress of the punch&#8208;cell can be offset effectively, benefiting from the wave architecture. The wearable solid&#8208;state LIC punch&#8208;cell exhibits large energy density, long cyclic stability, and superior flexibility. This study demonstrates great promise for scalable fabrication of wearable energy&#8208;storage systems.

      <title>Exploiting Unique Alignment of Cobalt Ferrite Nanoparticles, Mild Hyperthermia, and Controlled Intrinsic Cobalt Toxicity for Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Trimodal cancer therapy using cobalt ferrite nanocubes (Co&#8211;Fe NCs) is proposed. Heat damage by mild hyperthermia effect; mechanical damage by collective movement of unique chains formed during hyperthermia treatment; and intrinsic cobalt toxicity by the slow and controlled degradation of nanoparticle within a tumor, all lead to a reduced tumor burden and improved overall survival in a preclinical animal model.








Abstract
Nanoparticle&#8208;based magnetic hyperthermia is a well&#8208;known thermal therapy platform studied to treat solid tumors, but its use for monotherapy is limited due to incomplete tumor eradication at hyperthermia temperature (45&#160;&#176;C).&#160;It is often combined with chemotherapy for obtaining a more effective therapeutic outcome. Cubic&#8208;shaped cobalt ferrite nanoparticles (Co&#8211;Fe NCs) serve as magnetic hyperthermia agents and as a cytotoxic agent due to the known cobalt ion toxicity, allowing the achievement of both heat and cytotoxic effects from a single platform. In addition to this advantage, Co&#8211;Fe NCs have the unique ability to form growing chains under an alternating magnetic field (AMF). This unique chain formation, along with the mild hyperthermia and intrinsic cobalt toxicity, leads to complete tumor regression and improved overall survival in an in vivo murine xenograft model, all under clinically approved AMF conditions. Numerical calculations identify magnetic anisotropy as the main Co&#8211;Fe NCs&#8217; feature to generate such chain formations. This novel combination therapy can improve the effects of magnetic hyperthermia, inaugurating investigation of mechanical behaviors of nanoparticles under AMF, as a new avenue for cancer therapy.

      <title>Direct Optical Patterning of Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes via In Situ Ligand Exchange</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution direct optical patterning of quantum dot (QD) light&#8208;emitting diodes is demonstrated using photoacid generators that induce photochemical reactions and in situ ligand exchange in QD films. Uniform electroluminescence patterns of QDs are produced with feature size down to 1.5 &#181;m while preserving the structural, optical, and electronic properties of patterned QDs.








Abstract
Precise patterning of quantum dot (QD) layers is an important prerequisite for fabricating QD light&#8208;emitting diode (QLED) displays and other optoelectronic devices. However, conventional patterning methods cannot simultaneously meet the stringent requirements of resolution, throughput, and uniformity of the pattern profile while maintaining a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the patterned QD layers. Here, a specially designed nanocrystal ink is introduced, &#8220;photopatternable emissive nanocrystals&#8221; (PENs), which satisfies these requirements. Photoacid generators in the PEN inks allow photoresist&#8208;free, high&#8208;resolution optical patterning of QDs through photochemical reactions and in situ ligand exchange in QD films. Various fluorescence and electroluminescence patterns with a feature size down to &#8776;1.5 &#181;m are demonstrated using red, green, and blue PEN inks. The patterned QD films maintain &#8776;75% of original PLQY and the electroluminescence characteristics of the patterned QLEDs are comparable to thopse of non&#8208;patterned control devices. The patterning mechanism is elucidated by in&#8208;depth investigation of the photochemical transformations of the photoacid generators and changes in the optical properties of the QDs at each patterning step. This advanced patterning method provides a new way for additive manufacturing of integrated optoelectronic devices using colloidal QDs.

      <title>Highly Tunable Thiol&#8208;Ene Photoresins for Volumetric Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <dc:description>
Thiol&#8208;ene resins are adapted for volumetric 3D printing by incorporating a threshold response using a polymerization inhibitor. This feature, combined with quantitative spatial control of the absorbed optical energy dose, makes volumetric additive manufacturing possible with a large new class of materials. Adjusting the monomer compositions of these thiol&#8208;enes accesses a broad range of mechanical properties.








Abstract
Volumetric additive manufacturing (VAM) forms complete 3D objects in a single photocuring operation without layering defects, enabling 3D printed polymer parts with mechanical properties similar to their bulk material counterparts. This study presents the first report of VAM&#8208;printed thiol&#8208;ene resins. With well&#8208;ordered molecular networks, thiol&#8208;ene chemistry accesses polymer materials with a wide range of mechanical properties, moving VAM beyond the limitations of commonly used acrylate formulations. Since free&#8208;radical thiol&#8208;ene polymerization is not inhibited by oxygen, the nonlinear threshold response required in VAM is introduced by incorporating 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1&#8208;piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) as a radical scavenger. Tuning of the reaction kinetics is accomplished by balancing inhibitor and initiator content. Coupling this with quantitative measurements of the absorbed volumetric optical dose allows control of polymer conversion and gelation during printing. Importantly, this work thereby establishes the first comprehensive framework for spatial&#8211;temporal control over volumetric energy distribution, demonstrating structures 3D printed in thiol&#8208;ene resin by means of tomographic volumetric VAM. Mechanical characterization of this thiol&#8208;ene system, with varied ratios of isocyanurate and triethylene glycol monomers, reveals highly tunable mechanical response far more versatile than identical acrylate&#8208;based resins. This broadens the range of materials and properties available for VAM, taking another step toward high&#8208;performance printed polymers.

      <title>Visualizing the Anomalous Charge Density Wave States in Graphene/NbSe2 Heterostructures</title>
      <dc:description>
Prominent suppression of the charge density wave (CDW) orders in graphene/NbSe2 heterostructures is observed by Raman spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. The findings propose a new criterion to determine the TCDW through monitoring the line shape of the A1g mode. First&#8208;principles calculations imply that interfacial electron doping suppresses the CDW states by impeding the lattice distortion of 2H&#8208;NbSe2.








Abstract
Metallic layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) host collective many&#8208;body interactions, including the competing superconducting and charge density wave (CDW) states. Graphene is widely employed as a heteroepitaxial substrate for the growth of TMD layers and as an ohmic contact, where the graphene/TMD heterostructure is naturally formed. The presence of graphene can unpredictably influence the CDW order in 2D CDW conductors. This work reports the CDW transitions of 2H&#8208;NbSe2 layers in graphene/NbSe2 heterostructures. The evolution of Raman spectra demonstrates that the CDW phase transition temperatures (TCDW) of NbSe2 are dramatically decreased when capped by graphene. The induced anomalous short&#8208;range CDW state is confirmed by scanning tunneling microscopy measurements. The findings propose a new criterion to determine the TCDW through monitoring the line shape of the A1g mode. Meanwhile, the 2D band is also discovered as an indicator to observe the CDW transitions. First&#8208;principles calculations imply that interfacial electron doping suppresses the CDW states by impeding the lattice distortion of 2H&#8208;NbSe2. The extraordinary random CDW lattice suggests deep insight into the formation mechanism of many collective electronic states and possesses great potential in modulating multifunctional devices.

The development of smart inks that change color and transparency in response to external stimuli is important in safety and anticounterfeiting. In article number 2003980, Kwang&#8208;Un Jeong and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that a secret code, written with thermoresponsive and polarization&#8208;dependent secret inks consisting of imidazolium&#8208;functionalized diacetylenes, can be deciphered by wearing polaroid glasses and the heat from torchlight.

In article number 2002652, Lumin Wang and co&#8208;workers report that a nanoscale hierarchical dual&#8208;phase structure forms in a nanocrystalline NiFeCoCrCu high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy film via an ion&#8208;irradiation&#8208;induced face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (fcc) to body&#8208;centeredcubic (bcc) phase transformation. The microstructure of the material is represented in the top and bottom TEM images: a five&#8208;component high&#8208;entropy alloy, before (top) and after (bottom) ion&#8208;beam irradiation. Atoms are displaced in the induced &#8220;displacement cascade&#8221; (as shown in the top image). The two crystal models (top and bottom) show the atomic arrangement (bcc or fcc) in the resultant dual&#8208;phase structure.

      <title>IFlowPlate&#8212;A Customized 384&#8208;Well Plate for the Culture of Perfusable Vascularized Colon Organoids</title>
      <dc:description>
In recent years, there has been significant interest in organoid systems for biological modeling. However, organoids usually lack vascularization and are cultured under static conditions. In this work, a customized 384&#8208;well plate platform is developed, named IFlowPlate, which can be used to vascularize and perfuse organoids readily. This is the first system that has demonstrated organoid vascularization with intravascular perfusion.








Abstract
Despite the complexity and structural sophistication that 3D organoid models provide, their lack of vascularization and perfusion limit the capability of these models to recapitulate organ physiology effectively. A microfluidic platform named IFlowPlate is engineered, which can be used to culture up to 128 independently perfused and vascularized colon organoids in vitro. Unlike traditional microfluidic devices, the vascularized organoid&#8208;on&#8208;chip device with an &#8220;open&#8208;well&#8221; design does not require any external pumping systems and allows tissue extraction for downstream analyses, such as histochemistry or even in vivo transplantation. By optimizing both the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the culture media formulation, patient&#8208;derived colon organoids are co&#8208;cultured successfully within a self&#8208;assembled vascular network, and it is found that the colon organoids grow significantly better in the platform under constant perfusion versus conventional static condition. Furthermore, a colon inflammation model with an innate immune function where circulating monocytes can be recruited from the vasculature, differentiate into macrophage, and infiltrate the colon organoids in response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)&#8208; inflammatory cytokine stimulation is developed using the platform. With the ability to grow vascularized colon organoids under intravascular perfusion, the IFlowPlate platform could unlock new possibilities for screening potential therapeutic targets or modeling relevant diseases.

     alt="IFlowPlate&#8212;A Customized 384&#8208;Well Plate for the Culture of Perfusable Vascularized Colon Organoids"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, there has been significant interest in organoid systems for biological modeling. However, organoids usually lack vascularization and are cultured under static conditions. In this work, a customized 384&#8208;well plate platform is developed, named IFlowPlate, which can be used to vascularize and perfuse organoids readily. This is the first system that has demonstrated organoid vascularization with intravascular perfusion.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the complexity and structural sophistication that 3D organoid models provide, their lack of vascularization and perfusion limit the capability of these models to recapitulate organ physiology effectively. A microfluidic platform named IFlowPlate is engineered, which can be used to culture up to 128 independently perfused and vascularized colon organoids in vitro. Unlike traditional microfluidic devices, the vascularized organoid&#8208;on&#8208;chip device with an &#8220;open&#8208;well&#8221; design does not require any external pumping systems and allows tissue extraction for downstream analyses, such as histochemistry or even in vivo transplantation. By optimizing both the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the culture media formulation, patient&#8208;derived colon organoids are co&#8208;cultured successfully within a self&#8208;assembled vascular network, and it is found that the colon organoids grow significantly better in the platform under constant perfusion versus conventional static condition. Furthermore, a colon inflammation model with an innate immune function where circulating monocytes can be recruited from the vasculature, differentiate into macrophage, and infiltrate the colon organoids in response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)&#8208; inflammatory cytokine stimulation is developed using the platform. With the ability to grow vascularized colon organoids under intravascular perfusion, the IFlowPlate platform could unlock new possibilities for screening potential therapeutic targets or modeling relevant diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dopant&#8208;Driven Positive Reinforcement in Ex&#8208;Solution Process: New Strategy to Develop Highly Capable and Durable Catalytic Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
The in situ growth of Ir nanoparticles on a binary oxide as a new class in ex&#8208;solution phenomena is described. The Ir nanoparticles are uniformly anchored on WO3 host oxides and their formation mechanism is demonstrated by in situ analysis and simulations. The Ir&#8208;catalyst&#8208;loaded WO3 shows extremely high selectivity to H2S with outstanding stability.








Abstract
The ex&#8208;solution phenomenon, a central platform for growing metal nanoparticles on the surface of host oxides in real time with high durability and a fine distribution, has recently been applied to various scientific and industrial fields, such as catalysis, sensing, and renewable energy. However, the high&#8208;temperature processing required for ex&#8208;solutions (&gt;700&#160;&#176;C) limits the applicable material compositions and has hindered advances in this technique. Here, an unprecedented approach is reported for low&#8208;temperature particle ex&#8208;solution on important nanoscale binary oxides. WO3 with a nanosheet structure is selected as the parent oxide, and Ir serves as the active metal species that produces the ex&#8208;solved metallic particles. Importantly, Ir doping facilitates a phase transition in the WO3 bulk lattice, which further promotes Ir ex&#8208;solution at the oxide surface and eventually enables the formation of Ir particles (&lt;3&#160;nm) at temperatures as low as 300&#160;&#176;C. Low&#8208;temperature ex&#8208;solution effectively inhibits the agglomeration of WO3 sheets while maintaining well&#8208;dispersed ex&#8208;solved particles. Furthermore, the Ir&#8208;decorated WO3 sheets show excellent durability and H2S selectivity when used as sensing materials, suggesting that this is a generalizable synthetic strategy for preparing highly robust heterogeneous catalysts for a variety of applications.

      <title>Human&#8208;Recombinant&#8208;Elastin&#8208;Based Bioinks for 3D Bioprinting of Vascularized Soft Tissues</title>
      <dc:description>
New biocompatible and elastic bioinks based on recombinant human tropoelastin and gelatin for bioprinting of complex soft tissues is introduced. As proof of the concept, highly vascularized and functional 3D cardiac tissue constructs are bioprinted using a freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogels (FRESH) printing technique. The in vitro functionality and in vivo biocompatibility of the bioprinted structures are characterized.








Abstract
Bioprinting has emerged as an advanced method for fabricating complex 3D tissues. Despite the tremendous potential of 3D bioprinting, there are several drawbacks of current bioinks and printing methodologies that limit &#160;the ability to print elastic and highly vascularized tissues. In particular, fabrication of complex biomimetic structure that are entirely based on 3D bioprinting is still challenging primarily due to the lack of suitable bioinks with high printability, biocompatibility, biomimicry, and proper mechanical properties. To address these shortcomings, in this work the use of recombinant human tropoelastin as a highly biocompatible and elastic bioink for 3D printing of complex soft tissues is demonstrated. As proof of the concept, vascularized cardiac constructs are bioprinted and their functions are assessed in vitro and in vivo. The printed constructs demonstrate endothelium barrier function and spontaneous beating of cardiac muscle cells, which are important functions of cardiac tissue in vivo. Furthermore, the printed construct elicits minimal inflammatory responses, and is shown to be efficiently biodegraded in vivo when implanted subcutaneously in rats. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential of the elastic bioink for printing 3D functional cardiac tissues, which can eventually be used for cardiac tissue replacement.

      <title>Realizing Few&#8208;Layer Iodinene for High&#8208;Rate Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Atomically thin iodinene nanosheets are successfully fabricated by a liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation strategy. When explored as cathodes for Na+ ions batteries, they exhibit a high specific capacity and an extraordinary rate performance owing to their unique 2D ultrathin architecture with largely lower energy barrier and totally different ion&#8208;diffusion path versus the bulk counterpart.








Abstract
Elemental 2D materials with fascinating characteristics are regarded as an influential portion of the 2D family. Iodine is as a typical monoelemental molecular crystal and exhibits great prospects of applications. To realize 2D iodine, not only is it required to separate the weak interlayer van der Waals interactions, but also to reserve the weak intramolecular halogen bonds; thus, 2D iodine is still unexploited until now. Herein, atomically thin iodine nanosheets (termed &#8220;iodinene&#8221;) with the thickness around 1.0&#160;nm and lateral sizes up to hundreds of nanometers are successfully fabricated by a liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation strategy. When used for the cathode of rechargeable sodium&#8208;ion batteries, the ultrathin iodinene exhibits superb rate properties with a high specific capacity of 109.5&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at the high rate of 10 A g&#8722;1 owing to its unique 2D ultrathin architecture with remarkably enhanced pseudocapacitive behavior. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that the diffusion of sodium ions in few&#8208;layered iodinene changes from the original horizontal direction in bulk to the vertical with a small energy barrier of 0.07&#160;eV because of the size effect. The successful preparation and intensive structural investigation of iodinene paves the way for the development of novel iodine&#8208;based science and technologies.

Abstract
Various biological systems rely on the supramolecular assembly of biomolecules through noncovalent bonds for performing sophisticated functions.

Supramolecular 2D materials based on biological systems provide a novel perspective for the development of functional 2D materials. The physical and chemical properties of 2D structures, attributed to their large surface area, can enhance the sensitivity of the detection of target molecules, molecular loading, and bioconjugation efficiency, suggesting the potential utility of functional 2D materials as candidates for biological systems. Although several types of studies on supramolecular 2D materials have been reported, supramolecular biofunctional 2D materials have not been reviewed previously. In this regard, the current advances in 2D material development using molecular assembly are discussed with respect to the rational design of self&#8208;assembling aromatic amphiphiles, the formation of 2D structures, and the biological applications of functional 2D materials.

      <title>Synergetic Structural Transformation of Pt Electrocatalyst into Advanced 3D Architectures for Hydrogen Fuel Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
3D Pt architectures have received tremendous attention owing to their superior structure and intrinsic properties that are suited to fuel cell electrocatalyst applications. The fabrication methods and the effect of geometry on electrochemical processes for high&#8208;performance 3D Pt electrocatalysts are reviewed. New design guidelines for the development of such electrocatalysts are proposed considering future research directions.








Abstract
A new direction for developing electrocatalysts for hydrogen fuel cell systems has emerged, based on the fabrication of 3D architectures. These new architectures include extended Pt surface building blocks, the strategic use of void spaces, and deliberate network connectivity along with tortuosity, as design components. Various strategies for synthesis now enable the functional and structural engineering of these electrocatalysts with appropriate electronic, ionic, and electrochemical features. The new architectures provide efficient mass transport and large electrochemically active areas. To date, although there are few examples of fully functioning hydrogen fuel cell devices, these 3D electrocatalysts have the potential to achieve optimal cell performance and durability, exceeding conventional Pt powder (i.e., Pt/C) electrocatalysts. This progress report highlights the various 3D architectures proposed for Pt electrocatalysts, advances made in the fabrication of these structures, and the remaining technical challenges. Attempts to develop design rules for 3D architectures and modeling, provide insights into their achievable and potential performance. Perspectives on future developments of new multiscale designs are also discussed along with future study directions.

To date, although there are few examples of fully functioning hydrogen fuel cell devices, these 3D electrocatalysts have the potential to achieve optimal cell performance and durability, exceeding conventional Pt powder (i.e., Pt/C) electrocatalysts. This progress report highlights the various 3D architectures proposed for Pt electrocatalysts, advances made in the fabrication of these structures, and the remaining technical challenges. Attempts to develop design rules for 3D architectures and modeling, provide insights into their achievable and potential performance. Perspectives on future developments of new multiscale designs are also discussed along with future study directions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>
Metal halide perovskite nanorods show strong polarized emission, high optical gain, and improved charge transport, and thus hold promising applications in solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), photodetectors, photodetectors/phototransistors, and lasers. Recent advances in the synthetic strategies, growth mechanism, and optical and electronic properties of these materials are discussed, and the emerging applications are highlighted.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;1D metal halide perovskite nanorods (NRs) are emerging as a type of materials with remarkable optical and electronic properties. Research into this field is rapidly expanding and growing in the past several years, with significant advances in both mechanistic studies of their growth and widespread possible applications. Here, the recent advances in 1D metal halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are reviewed, with a particular emphasis on NRs. At first, the crystal structures of perovskites are elaborated, which is followed by a review of the major synthetic approaches toward perovskite NRs, such as wet&#8208;chemical synthesis, substrate&#8208;assisted growth, and anion exchange reactions, and discussion of the growth mechanisms associated with each synthetic method. Then, thermal and aqueous stability and the linear polarized luminescence of perovskite NRs are considered, followed by highlighting their applications in solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, photodetectors/phototransistors, and lasers. Finally, challenges and future opportunities in this rapidly developing research area are summarized.

      <dc:description>
The recent progress regarding memristors based on 2D materials for neuromorphic electronics is reviewed. They are categorized by their various materials, structures, and mechanisms. Owing to their outstanding synaptic characteristics, neuromorphic devices based on 2D materials offer excellent performance, energy&#8208;efficient operation, and modifiable synaptic functions applicable to complex learning.








Abstract
The memristor, a composite word of memory and resistor, has become one of the most important electronic components for brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic computing in recent years. This device has the ability to control resistance with multiple states by memorizing the history of previous electrical inputs, enabling it to mimic a biological synapse in the neural network of the human brain. Among many candidates for memristive materials, including metal oxides, organic materials, and low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials, 2D layered materials have been widely investigated owing to their outstanding physical properties and electrical tunability, low&#8208;power&#8208;switching capability, and hetero&#8208;integration compatibility. Hence, a large number of experimental demonstrations on 2D material&#8208;based memristors have been reported showing their unique memristive characteristics and novel synaptic functionalities, distinct from traditional bulk&#8208;material&#8208;based systems. Herein, an overview of the latest advances in the structures, mechanisms, and memristive characteristics of 2D material&#8208;based memristors is presented.

      <title>Recent Progress in Engineering the Atomic and Electronic Structure of Electrocatalysts via Cation Exchange Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Further development of electrocatalysts for renewable energy devices requires the design of catalytic materials at the atomic/electronic level, which is a grand challenge. The recent advances in the cation exchange strategy, a powerful tool for fine&#8208;tuning atomic/electronic structure of electrocatalysts through surface faceting, heteroatom doping, defects formation, and strain modulation, are reviewed.








Abstract
In the past few decades, tremendous advances have been made in electrocatalysis due to the rational design of electrocatalysts at the nanoscale level. Further development requires engineering electrocatalysts at the atomic level, which is a grand challenge. Here, the recent advances in cation exchange strategy, which is a powerful tool for fine&#8208;tuning atomic structure of electrocatalysts via surface faceting, heteroatom doping, defects formation, and strain modulation, are the main focus. Proper atomic structure engineering effectively adjusts the electronic structure, and thus enhances the electronic conductivity and facilitates the adsorption/desorption of reaction intermediates. By virtue, the cation exchange strategy greatly boosts the intrinsic and apparent activities of electrocatalysts and shows a great potential toward design of new energy conversion devices, such as water splitting devices and metal&#8211;air batteries. It is believed that cation exchange offers new insights and opportunities for the rational design of a new generation of electrocatalysts.

      <title>Air&#8208;Stable Low&#8208;Symmetry Narrow&#8208;Bandgap 2D Sulfide Niobium for Polarization Photodetection</title>
      <dc:description>
Novel 2D anisotropic sulfide niobium (NbS3) is introduced into the material family by demonstrating its in&#8208;plane structure, phonon vibrations, and electrical and optical anisotropies. Meaningfully, the NbS3 Schottky photodetectors exhibit broadband detection sensitivity (400&#8211;10&#8239;600&#160;nm), excellent response time (as fast as 11 &#181;s), photoelectrical dichroic ratio (1.84), and high&#8208;quality polarization imaging.








Abstract
Low&#8208;symmetry 2D materials with unique anisotropic optical and optoelectronic characteristics have attracted a lot of interest in fundamental research and manufacturing of novel optoelectronic devices. Exploring new and low&#8208;symmetry narrow&#8208;bandgap 2D materials will be rewarding for the development of nanoelectronics and nano&#8208;optoelectronics. Herein, sulfide niobium (NbS3), a novel transition metal trichalcogenide semiconductor with low&#8208;symmetry structure, is introduced into a narrowband 2D material with strong anisotropic physical properties both experimentally and theoretically. The indirect bandgap of NbS3 with highly anisotropic band structures slowly decreases from 0.42&#160;eV (monolayer) to 0.26&#160;eV (bulk). Moreover, NbS3 Schottky photodetectors have excellent photoelectric performance, which enables fast photoresponse (11.6 &#181;s), low specific noise current (4.6 &#215; 10&#8722;25 A2 Hz&#8722;1), photoelectrical dichroic ratio (1.84) and high&#8208;quality reflective polarization imaging (637 nm and 830&#160;nm). A room&#8208;temperature specific detectivity exceeding 107 Jones can be obtained at the wavelength of 3&#160;&#181;m. These excellent unique characteristics will make low&#8208;symmetry narrow&#8208;bandgap 2D materials become highly competitive candidates for future anisotropic optical investigations and mid&#8208;infrared optoelectronic applications.

      <title>Broad&#8208;Spectral&#8208;Range Sustainability and Controllable Excitation of Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3</title>
      <dc:description>
Hyperbolic phonon polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 are measured in a broad spectral range using electron energy loss spectroscopy. Polaritons with different dispersion types can be sustained in multiple Reststrahlen bands covering both mid&#8208; and far&#8208;infrared frequencies, and can be selectively excited by the electron beam. These findings provide new opportunities in nanophotonic applications such as directed light propagation and hyperlensing.








Abstract
Hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) in orthorhombic&#8208;phase molybdenum trioxide (&#945;&#8208;MoO3) show in&#8208;plane hyperbolicity, great wavelength compression, and ultralong lifetime, therefore holding great potential in nanophotonic applications. However, its polaritonic response in the far&#8208;infrared (FIR) range remains unexplored due to challenges in experimental characterization. Here, monochromated electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) is used to probe HPhPs in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 in both mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) and FIR frequencies and correlate their behaviors with microstructures and orientations. It is found that low structural symmetry leads to various phonon modes and multiple Reststrahlen bands (RBs) over a broad spectral range (over 70 meV) and in different directions (55&#8211;63 meV and 119&#8211;125 meV along the b&#8208;axis, 68&#8211;106 meV along the c&#8208;axis, and 101&#8211;121 meV along the a&#8208;axis). These HPhPs can be selectively excited by controlling the direction of swift electrons. These findings provide new opportunities in nanophotonic and optoelectronic applications, such as directed light propagation, hyperlenses, and heat transfer.

      <title>Advanced Materials and Systems for Biodegradable, Transient Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
An advanced class of electronic system, transient electronics, that entirely dissolves in certain circumstances in controlled manners after fulfilling their functions is presented. Such unique properties enable comprehensive contributions in research fields of biomedicine and environment&#8208;friendly and security system. This review describes the recent developments in materials and manufacturing processes, as well as various applications of transient technology.








Abstract
Transient electronics refers to an emerging class of advanced technology, defined by an ability to chemically or physically dissolve, disintegrate, and degrade in actively or passively controlled fashions to leave environmentally and physiologically harmless by&#8208;products in environments, particularly in bio&#8208;fluids or aqueous solutions. The unusual properties that are opposite to operational modes in conventional electronics for a nearly infinite time frame offer unprecedented opportunities in research areas of eco&#8208;friendly electronics, temporary biomedical implants, data&#8208;secure hardware systems, and others. This review highlights the developments of transient electronics, including materials, manufacturing strategies, electronic components, and transient kinetics, along with various potential applications.

      <title>Advances in the Design of 3D&#8208;Structured Electrode Materials for Lithium&#8211;Metal Anodes</title>
      <dc:description>
This progress report reviews the design of 3D&#8208;structured electrode materials for Li metal anode according to their categories, namely 1) metal&#8208;based materials, 2) carbon&#8208;based materials, and 3) their hybrids, and allows the results obtained under different experimental conditions to be seen at a single glance, thus being helpful for researchers working in related fields.








Abstract
Although the lithium&#8211;metal anode (LMA) can deliver a high theoretical capacity of &#8776;3860 mAh g&#8722;1 at a low redox potential of &#8722;3.040 V (vs the standard hydrogen electrode), its application in rechargeable batteries is hindered by the poor Coulombic efficiency and safety issues caused by dendritic metal growth. Consequently, careful electrode design, electrolyte engineering, solid&#8211;electrolyte interface control, protective layer introduction, and other strategies are suggested as possible solutions. In particular, one should note the great potential of 3D&#8208;structured electrode materials, which feature high active specific surface areas and stereoscopic structures with multitudinous lithiophilic sites and can therefore facilitate rapid Li&#8208;ion flux and metal nucleation as well as mitigate Li dendrite formation through the kinetic control of metal deposition even at high local current densities.

      <title>A Review of Shape Memory Polymers and Composites: Mechanisms, Materials, and Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Shape memory polymers are promising stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that have provoked the interest of scientists over the past several decades. Progress in the mechanisms and applications of shape memory polymers is summarized, with a focus on the design and regulation of the shape memory effect. Future prospects and challenges in this exciting field are also proposed.








Abstract
Over the past decades, interest in shape memory polymers (SMPs) has persisted, and immense efforts have been dedicated to developing SMPs and their multifunctional composites. As a class of stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers, SMPs can return to their initial shape from a programmed temporary shape under external stimuli, such as light, heat, magnetism, and electricity. The introduction of functional materials and nanostructures results in shape memory polymer composites (SMPCs) with large recoverable deformation, enhanced mechanical properties, and controllable remote actuation. Because of these unique features, SMPCs have a broad application prospect in many fields covering aerospace engineering, biomedical devices, flexible electronics, soft robotics, shape memory arrays, and 4D printing. Herein, a comprehensive analysis of the shape recovery mechanisms, multifunctionality, applications, and recent advances in SMPs and SMPCs is presented. Specifically, the combination of functional, reversible, multiple, and controllable shape recovery processes is discussed. Further, established products from such materials are highlighted. Finally, potential directions for the future advancement of SMPs are proposed.

      <title>State of the Art and Perspectives of Hierarchical Zeolites: Practical Overview of Synthesis Methods and Use in Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
A practical overview of the most recent literature on synthesis of hierarchical zeolites for most relevant zeolite topologies is presented. Several fine&#8208;tuning efforts of established and novel synthesis methods are discussed. Remaining challenges and points of attention and a personal view for future synthesis research to obtain the most sustainable and catalytically active hierarchical zeolites are also presented.








Abstract
Microporous zeolites have proven to be of great importance in many chemical processes. Yet, they often suffer from diffusion limitations causing inefficient use of the available catalytically active sites. To address this problem, hierarchical zeolites have been developed, which extensively improve the catalytic performance. There is a multitude of recent literature describing synthesis of and catalysis with these hierarchical zeolites. This review attempts to organize and overview this literature (of the last 5 years), with emphasis on the most important advances with regard to synthesis and application of such zeolites. Special attention is paid to the most common and important 10&#8208; and 12&#8208;membered ring zeolites (MTT, TON, FER, MFI, MOR, FAU, and *BEA). In contrast to previous reviews, the research per zeolite topology is brought together and discussed here. This allows the reader to instantly find the best synthesis method in accordance to the desired zeolite properties. A summarizing graph is made available to enable the reader to select suitable synthesis procedures based on zeolite acidity and mesoporosity, the two most important tunable properties.

      <title>A Self&#8208;Healing Amalgam Interface in Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
An effective, universal strategy, introducing an amalgam interface, to resolve the interfacial issues of metal anodes/electrolytes toward high&#8208;performance metal batteries is presented. Such amalgam interface in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state symmetric cells, which shows a high electron/ion dual&#8208;conductivity, can undergo a reversible isothermal phase transition from solid (Li&#8208;rich amalgam) to liquid (Li&#8208;deficient amalgam) during cycling process at room temperature.








Abstract
Poor cyclability and safety concerns caused by the uncontrollable dendrite growth and large interfacial resistance severely restrict the practical applications of metal batteries. Herein, a facile, universal strategy to fabricate ceramic and glass phase compatible, and self&#8208;healing metal anodes is proposed. Various amalgam&#8208;metal anodes (Li, Na, Zn, Al, and Mg) show a long cycle life in symmetric cells. It has been found that liquid Li amalgam shows a complete wetting with the surface of lanthanum lithium titanate electrolyte and a glass&#8208;phase solid&#8208;state electrolyte. The interfacial compatibility between the lithium metal anode and solid&#8208;state electrolyte is dramatically improved by using an in situ regenerated amalgam interface with high electron/ion dual&#8208;conductivity, obviously decreasing the anode/electrolyte interfacial impedance. The lithium&#8208;amalgam interface between the metal anode and electrolyte undergoes a reversible isothermal phase transition between solid and liquid during the cycling process at room temperature, resulting in a self&#8208;healing surface of metal anodes.

Abstract
A successful identification of DNA&#8211;DNA recognition, based on the waveguide effect of a 1D hybrid prismatic hexagon crystal interfacing of DNA with an organic semiconductor is achieved. This bio&#8208;hybrid 1D crystal simultaneously discerns the complementary case at its one end against a 1&#8208;mer mismatch in 27&#8208;mer nucleic acid sequence at the other end. The loss coefficient value of this waveguide is estimated to be 0.159&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1 for the perfect match, which is a stark discrepancy compared to 0.244&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1 for the 1&#8208;mer mismatch, implying waveguide performance with a higher efficiency. These results demonstrate successfully that multiple&#160;biological interactions can be realized by the optical waveguide of the single&#160;1D bio&#8208;hybrid&#8208;crystal and will push this class of materials into bio&#8208;related applications.

      <title>Large&#8208;Area Single&#8208;Crystal Graphene via Self&#8208;Organization at the Macroscale</title>
      <dc:description>
Graphene flakes, nucleated over a polycrystalline graphene film, are shown to synchronize during growth, so as to ultimately yield a common crystal orientation at the macroscale, namely, large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal growth. The work also demonstrates that graphene synthesis can be advanced to control the nucleated crystal shape, registry, and relative alignment between graphene crystals for wafer&#8208;scale areas.








Abstract
In 1665 Christiaan Huygens first noticed how two pendulums, regardless of their initial state, would synchronize.&#160; It is now known that the universe is full of complex self&#8208;organizing systems, from neural networks to correlated materials. Here, graphene flakes, nucleated over a polycrystalline graphene film, synchronize during growth so as to ultimately yield a common crystal orientation at the macroscale. Strain and diffusion gradients are argued as the probable causes for the long&#8208;range cross&#8208;talk between flakes and the formation of a single&#8208;grain graphene layer. The work demonstrates that graphene synthesis can be advanced to control the nucleated crystal shape, registry, and relative alignment between graphene crystals for large area, that is, a single&#8208;crystal bilayer, and (AB&#8208;stacked) few&#8208;layer graphene can been grown at the wafer scale.

      <title>Chelation Crosslinking of Biodegradable Elastomers</title>
      <dc:description>
A versatile metal chelation crosslink in biodegradable elastomers is reported. The types of metal ions, ligand density, and metal&#8211;ligand ratio offer fine control of the polymers&#8217; properties. A subcutaneous implantation in mice reveals higher biocompatibility than the widely use biomaterial, polycaprolactone.








Abstract
Widely present in nature and in manufactured goods, elastomers are network polymers typically crosslinked by strong covalent bonds. Elastomers crosslinked by weak bonds usually exhibit more plastic deformation. Here, chelation as a mechanism to produce biodegradable elastomers is reported. Polycondensation of sebacic acid, 1,3&#8208;propanediol, and a Schiff&#8208;base (2&#8208;[[(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) methylene]amino]&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanediol) forms a block copolymer that binds several biologically relevant metal ions. Chelation offers a unique advantage unseen in conventional elastomer design because one ligand binds multiple metal ions, yielding bonds of different strengths. Therefore, one polymeric ligand coordinated with different metal ions produces elastomers with vastly different characteristics. Mixing different metal ions in one polymer offers another degree of control on material properties. The density of the ligands in the block copolymer further regulates the mechanical properties. Moreover, a murine model reveals that Fe3+ crosslinked foam displays higher compatibility with subcutaneous tissues than the widely used biomaterial&#8212;polycaprolactone. The implantation sites restore to their normal architecture with little fibrosis upon degradation of the implants. The versatility of chelation&#8208;based design has already shown promise in hydrogels and highly stretchy nondegradable polymers. The biodegradable elastomers reported here would enable new materials and new possibilities in biomedicine and beyond.

      <title>Chemically Stable Black Phase CsPbI3 Inorganic Perovskites for High&#8208;Efficiency Photovoltaics</title>
      <dc:description>
The recent progress of CsPbI3 perovskite for highly efficient and stable photovoltaics are summarized. Furthermore, those important phase stabilization strategies for the black phase CsPbI3 are also discussed. With the advancing of fundamental study on CsPbI3 perovskite material properties, the CsPbI3 perovskite and other inorganic perovskite will become more and more promising for high&#8208;efficiency and stable perovskites solar cells.








Abstract
Research on chemically stable inorganic perovskites has achieved rapid progress in terms of high efficiency exceeding 19% and high thermal stabilities, making it one of the most promising candidates for thermodynamically stable and high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells. Among those inorganic perovskites, CsPbI3 with good chemical components stability possesses the suitable bandgap (&#8776;1.7&#160;eV) for single&#8208;junction and tandem solar cells. Comparing to the anisotropic organic cations, the isotropic cesium cation without hydrogen bond and cation orientation renders CsPbI3 exhibit unique optoelectronic properties. However, the unideal tolerance factor of CsPbI3 induces the challenges of different crystal phase competition and room temperature phase stability. Herein, the latest important developments regarding understanding of the crystal structure and phase of CsPbI3 perovskite are presented. The development of various solution chemistry approaches for depositing high&#8208;quality phase&#8208;pure CsPbI3 perovskite is summarized. Furthermore, some important phase stabilization strategies for black phase CsPbI3 are discussed. The latest experimental and theoretical studies on the fundamental physical properties of photoactive phase CsPbI3 have deepened the understanding of inorganic perovskites. The future development and research directions toward achieving highly stable CsPbI3 materials will further advance inorganic perovskite for highly stable and efficient photovoltaics.
