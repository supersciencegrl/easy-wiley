         <title>Solid Catholyte with Regulated Interphase Redox for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a strategy for regulating the redox behavior of the solid catholyte toward dynamic interphase stability, which in turn stabilizes the main reaction of solid&#8211;solid sulfur redox. Leveraging this stabilizing mechanism, a newly formulated Li6.2P0.8W0.2S5I electrolyte with high reversibility is developed to build high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur battery (ASSLSB) is considered one of the ultimate next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies due to the expected low cost, high safety, and high specific energy. The high&#8208;conductivity and low&#8208;modulus sulfide electrolytes hold promise as electrolytes in the cathode (i.e., solid catholytes) for ASSLSBs, but their parasitic decomposition and reactions over cycling lead to degradation of the active material&#8722;catholyte interphases and hence limited cycling life. Herein a strategy is described to stabilize the ASSLSBs by regulating the interphase redox reversibility of the sulfide catholyte, which is validated on a new sulfide electrolyte formulated as Li6+xP1&#8722;xWxS5I (LPWSI). The experiments show that the presence of mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting WS2 boosts the Li4P2S7&#8722;to&#8722;Li3PS4 reaction in the interphase, which prevents irreversible accumulation of impeding P2S74&#8722; and thereby improves the catholyte's interphase stability. With the LPWSI catholyte, the ambient&#8208;temperature ASSLSB exhibits stable cycling sustaining 92.2% capacity over 400 cycles at C/5 with an initial areal capacity of 1.95&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the cells demonstrate excellent high&#8208;rate stability over 1000 cycles at rates of 1C and 2C. The reported strategy contributes to reshaping the understanding of how solid catholyte can function in composite cathodes and provides new guidelines for designing catholyte for high&#8208;capacity conversion&#8208;based electrodes that involve complex evolution of interphases.

         <title>Synthesis and Light&#8208;Matter Interaction of Low&#8208;Dimension Ordered&#8211;Disordered Layered Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;dimension ordered&#8211;disordered Mo(1&#8722;x)WxSe2 2D alloy with in&#8208;plane nano&#8208;segregations exhibits unique excitonic properties, enhanced valley polarization (up to 50%), and high implied open&#8208;circuit voltage (up to 1130 mV). These features highlight its potential for advanced optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications.








Abstract
Well&#8208;structured and ordered 2D layered semiconducting materials have excellent optical properties but limited advanced optoelectronic applications in their natural state. Altering their natural arrangement, through artificial heterostructures, strain and pressure engineering, chemical doping, intercalation, and alloying, can impart them with unusual optical properties and potentially enhance their performance in various applications. Among these approaches, alloying is generally difficult to control and disrupts the well&#8208;ordered homophilic crystal phase of these 2D crystals, albeit with the capability to control materials as thin as a single atomic layer. In this work, the synthesis of a low&#8208;dimension ordered&#8211;disordered layered 2D alloy of Mo(1&#8722;x)WxSe2 with clearly ordered in&#8208;plane segregations of nano&#8208;sized islands of individual MoSe2 and WSe2 across the material surface is reported. The optical analysis of this ordered&#8211;disordered layered Mo(1&#8722;x)WxSe2 reveals unique interfacial and interlayer coupling physics, such as the co&#8208;existence of intralayer (interfacial) and interlayer excitons and enhanced valley polarization of up to 50%, which is traditionally absent in ordered MoSe2, WSe2, or their heterostructures. Furthermore, the structure exhibits implies open circuit voltage (up to 1130&#160;mV), signifying its excellent open&#8208;circuit voltage potential if employed in photovoltaic devices. Overall, the reported low&#8208;dimension ordered&#8211;disordered semiconductor alloys can be useful in various optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Tailoring Buried Interface and Minimizing Energy Loss Enable Efficient Narrow and Wide Bandgap Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells by Aluminum Glycinate Based Organometallic Molecule</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aluminum glycinate&#8208;based organometallic molecule is used to tailor buried interface and minimize interface&#8208;driven energy loss, which realizes high efficiencies of 26.74% and 20.71% for 1.55 and 1.785 eV bandgap perovskite solar cells, respectively.








Abstract
Rational regulation of Me&#8208;4PACz/perovskite interface has emerged as a significant challenge in the pursuit of highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, an organometallic molecule of aluminum glycinate (AG) that contained amine (&#8208;NH2) and aluminum hydroxyl (Al&#8208;OH) groups is developed to tailor the buried interface and minimize interface&#8208;driven energy losses. The Al&#8208;OH groups selectively bonded with unanchored O&#9552;P&#8208;OH and bare NiO&#8208;OH to optimize the surface morphology and energy levels, while the &#8208;NH2 group interacted specifically with Pb2+ to retard perovskite crystallization, passivate buried Pb&#8208;related defects, and release residual interface stress. These interactions facilitate the interface carrier extraction and reduce interface&#8208;driven energy losses, thereby realizing a balanced charge carrier transport. Consequently, AG&#8208;modified narrow bandgap (1.55 eV) PSC demonstrates an efficiency of 26.74% (certified 26.21%) with a fill factor of 86.65%; AG&#8208;modified wide bandgap (1.785 eV) PSC realizes 20.71% champion efficiency with excellent repeatability. These PSCs maintain 91.37%, 91.92%, and 92.00% of their initial efficiency after aging in air atmosphere, the nitrogen&#8208;filled atmosphere at 85&#160;&#176;C, and continuously tracking at the maximum power&#8208;point under one&#8208;sun illumination (100 mW cm&#8722;2) for 1200 h, respectively.

         <title>Trace Dual&#8208;Crosslinkable Additives Enable Direct Microlithography for Enhanced Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution patterning is crucial for advancing organic electronics, enabling miniaturization and high&#8208;density integration. A dual crosslinking strategy is developed using a polyrotaxane supramolecular crosslinker (PR) in polybenzodifurandione (PBFDO). At trace loading levels (&lt;0.1 wt%), PR enhances patterning precision (&lt;1&#160;&#181;m) and electrical performance, yielding a 42% &#181;C* increase and improved device stability, offering scalable solutions for organic electronics.








Abstract
Similar to silicon&#8208;based electronics, the implementation of micro/nano&#8208;patterning to facilitate complex device architectures and high&#8208;density integration is crucial to the development of organic electronics. Among various patterning techniques, direct microlithography (DML) is highly applicable and extensively adopted in organic electronics, such as organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). However, conventional DML often requires high crosslinker concentrations, leading to compromised electrical performance. To address this challenge, a novel strategy is developed that combines supramolecular and covalent interactions by incorporating a polyrotaxane supramolecular crosslinker (PR) into poly(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO). The PR forms a hydrogen bonding network with PBFDO and undergoes UV&#8208;triggered covalent crosslinking among its molecules, providing solvent resistance even at trace loading levels (&lt;0.1 wt%). This approach enables precise patterning of PBFDO with feature sizes below 1&#160;&#181;m while preserving high electrical performance. Notably, PR also serves as a performance enhancer, promoting molecular ordering and ionic conduction within PBFDO. OECTs fabricated with PR&#8208;crosslinked PBFDO exhibit about one&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude increase in ON/OFF ratio, a 42% increase in &#181;C* (reaching 2460&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1), and elevated operational stability compared to pristine ones. This multifunctional crosslinker offers a scalable solution for high&#8208;performance, high&#8208;density organic electronics and opens new avenues for supramolecular chemistry applications in this field.

         <title>Synergistic Enhancement of Fluorescence Through Plasmon Resonance and Interfacial Charge Transfer by AgNC@AgAux Core&#8211;Shell Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

The work reports on the synthesis and properties of AgNC@AgAux QDs with a core&#8211;shell heterostructure. This novel structure exhibits significantly enhanced photoluminescence, which can be attributed to electron injection and a strong local electric field induced by surface plasmons.








Abstract
Bimetallic core&#8211;shell quantum dots (QDs) hold great promise in elucidating the bimetallic synergism and optoelectronic devices. The synthesis and properties of AgNC@AgAux QDs of core&#8211;shell heterostructure are reported. Significantly enhanced photoluminescence emission on these heterostructures is observed. These enhancements are attributed to electron injection and the surface plasmon&#8208;induced strong local electric field, which are observed through time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure spectra and density functional theory confirms the electron injection from the Ag core to the AgAux shell. On the other hand, the plasmon resonance of the AgNC@AgAux QDs has been studied by finite&#8208;element method analysis and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence spectra. There are 94.06 times fluorescence enhancement and 32.40 times quantum yield improvement of oxygen content correlation compared to AgAu3 QDs. It shows a perfect correlation coefficient of 98.85% for the detection of heavy metal Cu2+ ions. Such Bimetallic core&#8211;shell heterostructures have great potential for future optoelectronic devices, optical imaging, and other energy&#8208;environmental applications.

         <title>Supramolecular Engineering of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework &#8211; Ruthenium Oxide Hybrids for Highly Active Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functionalized vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic framework adlayer is constructed to precisely tailor the orientation of interfacial water molecule to stabilize the transition state for intermediates adsorption/desorption, optimizing the proton exchange membrane water electrolysis performance.









Abstract
The controlled formation of a functional adlayer at the catalyst&#8208;water interface is a highly challenging yet potentially powerful strategy to accelerate proton transfer and deprotonation for ultimately improving the performance of proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). In this study, the synthesis of robust vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possessing high proton conductivities is reported, which are subsequently hybridized with ruthenium dioxide yielding high&#8208;performance anodic catalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In situ spectroscopic measurements corroborated by theoretical calculations reveal that the assembled hydrogen bonds formed between COFs and adsorbed oxo&#8208;intermediates effectively orient interfacial water molecules, stabilizing the transition states for intermediate formation of OER. This determines a decrease in the energy barriers of proton transfer and deprotonation, resulting in exceptional acidic OER performance. When integrated into a PEMWE device, the system achieves a record current density of 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 at only 1.54 V cell voltage, with a long&#8208;term stability exceeding 180 h at industrial&#8208;level 200 mA cm&#8722;2. The approach relying on the self&#8208;assembly of an oriented hydrogen&#8208;bonded adlayer highlights the disruptive potential of COFs with customizable structures and multifunctional sites for advancing PEMWE technologies.

         <title>Bioinspired Nanochitin&#8208;Based Porous Constructs for Light&#8208;Driven Whole&#8208;Cell Biotransformations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetically cross&#8208;linked nanochitin cryogels are used for immobilization matrix for a solid&#8208;state cell factory. The resulting cryogels with hierarchical porosity manage to overcome the conventional limitations of mass transfer and light transmittance, as demonstrated by a number of light&#8208;driven biotransformation reactions.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state photosynthetic cell factories (SSPCFs) are a new production concept that leverages the innate photosynthetic abilities of microbes to drive the production of valuable chemicals. It addresses practical challenges such as high energy and water demand and improper light distribution associated with suspension&#8208;based culturing; however, these systems often face significant challenges related to mass transfer. The approach focuses on overcoming these limitations by carefully engineering the microstructure of the immobilization matrix through freeze&#8208;induced assembly of nanochitin building blocks. The use of nanochitins with optimized size distribution enabled the formation of macropores with lamellar spatial organization, which significantly improves light transmittance and distribution, crucial for maximizing the efficiency of photosynthetic reactions. The biomimetic crosslinking strategy, leveraging specific interactions between polyphosphate anions and primary amine groups featured on chitin fibers, produced mechanically robust and wet&#8208;resilient cryogels that maintained their functionality under operational conditions. Various model biotransformation reactions leading to value&#8208;added chemicals are performed in chitin&#8208;based matrix. It demonstrates superior or comparable performance to existing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art matrices and suspension&#8208;based systems. The findings suggest that chitin&#8208;based cryogel approach holds significant promise for advancing the development of solid&#8208;state photosynthetic cell factories, offering a scalable solution to improve the efficiency and productivity of light&#8208;driven biotransformation.

&lt;p&gt;Solid-state photosynthetic cell factories (SSPCFs) are a new production concept that leverages the innate photosynthetic abilities of microbes to drive the production of valuable chemicals. It addresses practical challenges such as high energy and water demand and improper light distribution associated with suspension-based culturing; however, these systems often face significant challenges related to mass transfer. The approach focuses on overcoming these limitations by carefully engineering the microstructure of the immobilization matrix through freeze-induced assembly of nanochitin building blocks. The use of nanochitins with optimized size distribution enabled the formation of macropores with lamellar spatial organization, which significantly improves light transmittance and distribution, crucial for maximizing the efficiency of photosynthetic reactions. The biomimetic crosslinking strategy, leveraging specific interactions between polyphosphate anions and primary amine groups featured on chitin fibers, produced mechanically robust and wet-resilient cryogels that maintained their functionality under operational conditions. Various model biotransformation reactions leading to value-added chemicals are performed in chitin-based matrix. It demonstrates superior or comparable performance to existing state-of-the-art matrices and suspension-based systems. The findings suggest that chitin-based cryogel approach holds significant promise for advancing the development of solid-state photosynthetic cell factories, offering a scalable solution to improve the efficiency and productivity of light-driven biotransformation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Library of Polyphenol&#8208;Amino Acid Condensates for High&#8208;Throughput Continuous Flow Production of Nanomedicines with Ultra&#8208;High Drug Loading</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable and flexible library of natural, renewable tea polyphenol, and amino acid condensate colloidal spheres, synthesized via a one&#8208;step process, facilitates the preparation of ultra&#8208;high drug&#8208;loading nanomedicines with precise size control and uniform dispersion using continuous&#8208;flow microfluidics. This approach effectively addresses the challenges associated with the nanonization of poorly soluble drugs and holds significant promise for advancing pharmaceutical formulations.









Abstract
Synthesizing high drug&#8208;loading nanomedicines remains a formidable challenge, and achieving universally applicable, continuous, large&#8208;scale engineered production of such nanomedicines presents even greater difficulties. This study presents a scalable library of polyphenol&#8208;amino acid condensates. By selecting amino acids, the library enables precise customization of key properties, such as carrier capacity, bioactivity, and other critical attributes, offering a versatile range of options for various application scenarios. Leveraging the properties of solvent&#8208;mediated disassembly and reassembly of condensates achieved an ultra&#8208;high drug loading of 86% for paclitaxel. For a range of poorly soluble molecules, the drug loading capacity exceeded 50%, indicating broad applicability. Furthermore, employing a continuous microfluidic device, the production rate can reach 5 mL&#160;min&#8722;1 (36 g&#160;per day), with the nanoparticle size precisely tunable and a polydispersity index (PDI) below 0.2. The polyphenol&#8208;based carrier demonstrates efficient cellular uptake and, in three distinct animal models, has been shown to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel without significant side effects. This study presents a streamlined, efficient, and scalable approach using microfluidics to produce nanomedicines with ultra&#8208;high drug loading, offering a promising strategy for the nanoformulation of poorly soluble drugs.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Organic Spintronic Devices with Wide Range Magnetocurrent Tuning and Multifunctionality via Electro&#8208;Optical Compensation Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large, tunable room&#8208;temperature magnetocurrent (MC) are crucial for advancing spintronic technologies. This study introduces an electro&#8208;optical compensation strategy in organic semiconductor devices, achieving exceptionally high MC values of +13&#160;200% and &#8722;10&#160;600%. Leveraging this, a multifunctional device is activated, serving as the high&#8208;sensitivity magnetic field sensor, composite field sensor, magnetic current inverter, and magnetically&#8208;controlled artificial synaptic, etc.








Abstract
In spintronics, devices exhibiting large, widely tunable magnetocurrent (MC) values at room temperature are particularly appealing due to their potential in advanced sensing, data storage, and multifunctional technologies. Organic semiconductors (OSCs), with their rich and unique spin&#8208;dependent and (opto&#8208;)electronic properties, hold significant promise for realizing such devices. However, current organic devices are constrained by limited design strategies, yielding MC values typically confined to tens of percent, thereby restricting their potential for multifunctional applications. Here, this study introduces an electro&#8208;optical compensation strategy to modulate MC values, which synergistically integrates and manages the interplays among carrier transport, spin&#8208;dependent reactions, and photogenerated carrier dynamics in OSCs&#8208;based devices. This approach achieves ultrahigh room&#8208;temperature MC values of +13&#160;200% and &#8722;10&#160;600% in the designed devices, with continuous and precise tunability over this range&#8212;marking a breakthrough in organic spintronic devices. Building on this achievement, by integrating multiple controllable parameters&#8212;light, bias, magnetic field, and mechanical flexibility&#8212;into a single device, a flexible, room&#8208;temperature, multifunctional device is activated, functioning as the high&#8208;sensitivity magnetic field sensor, composite field sensor, magnetic current inverter, and magnetically&#8208;controlled artificial synaptic, etc. These findings open an avenue for designing high&#8208;performance, multifunctional devices with broad implications for future spintronic&#8208;related technologies.

         <title>Bioinspired Super&#8208;Robust Conductive Hydrogels for Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Tactile Perception System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired by naturally oriented structures of biological tissues, it developed super&#8208;robust conductive hydrogels with highly tunable mechanical property and anisotropic structure, and demonstrated, for the first time, the mechanical strength of the conductive hydrogels, used as flexible electrodes in triboelectric and piezoresistive device, affected both the accuracy and stability of machine learning&#8208;assisted tactile perception.








Abstract
Conductive hydrogels have attracted significant attention due to exceptional flexibility, electrochemical property, and biocompatibility. However, the low mechanical strength can compromise their stability under high stress, making the material susceptible to fracture in complex or harsh environments. Achieving a balance between conductivity and mechanical robustness remains a critical challenge. In this study, super&#8208;robust conductive hydrogels were designed and developed with highly oriented structures and densified networks, by employing techniques such as stretch&#8208;drying&#8208;induced directional assembly, salting&#8208;out, and ionic crosslinking. The hydrogels showed remarkable mechanical property (tensile strength: 17.13&#8211;142.1&#160;MPa; toughness: 50&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), high conductivity (30.1 S&#160;m&#8722;1), and reliable strain sensing performance. Additionally, it applied this hydrogel material to fabricate biomimetic electronic skin device, significantly improving signal quality and device stability. By integrating the device with 1D convolutional neural network algorithm, it further developed a real&#8208;time material recognition system based on triboelectric and piezoresistive signal collection, achieving a classification accuracy of up to 99.79% across eight materials. This study predicted the potential of the high&#8208;performance conductive hydrogels for various applications in flexible smart wearables, the Internet of Things, bioelectronics, and bionic robotics.

Synopsis: Utilizing a 2D framework matrix, a strategy is presented to balance Cr3&#8314;&#8208;pair emissions at high doping concentrations while effectively suppressing undesirable quenching, thereby ensuring sustained luminescent efficiency.








Abstract
Developing efficient and stable near&#8208;infrared emitters related to Cr3+&#8208;pairs for advanced optoelectronic devices remains a challenge due to concentration quenching effects and unclear luminescence mechanisms. In this study, Cr3+ ions are incorporated into a matrix structure consisting of ZnAl&#8322;O&#8324; spinel units separated by 11.312 &#197;, effectively restricting energy transfer between luminescent centers and alleviating quenching effects. Computational analysis identifies the lattice positions of isolated Cr3+ ions and Cr3+&#8208;pairs at different doping levels, providing insights into their spatial distribution and local structural environments. Photoluminescence measurements reveals a Cr3+&#8208;concentration&#8208;dependent emission broadening, with a Cr3+&#8208;pair emission band peak at 750&#160;nm, while detailed spectral analysis further clarified the energy level structure of Cr3+&#8208;pairs for the first time. Enhanced material performance is achieved through flux&#8208;assisted synthesis, reaching a high external quantum efficiency of 58.3%. Consequently, the assembled pc&#8208;LEDs exhibit minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off and achieve&#160;a high output of 183&#160;mW at 650&#160;mA, demonstrating their potential in near&#8208;infrared light sources and night vision technology application.

Angstrom&#8208;confined cobalt (Co) manganese (Mn) CoMn dual single atoms within the carbon nitride interlayer are constructed to efficiently activate peroxymonosulfate for water purification. The angstrom&#8208;confined strategy leads to the adaptive change of atomic spin state, and reduces the energy barrier for *SO5 formation and *O2 desorption during singlet oxygen generation, enabling a 38.6&#8208;fold increase in singlet oxygen production compared to the surface unconfined one.








Abstract
To achieve high selectivity in the transformation from peroxymonosulfate to singlet oxygen, adaptive tuning of atomic spin state as the peroxymonosulfate structure varied is crucial. The angstrom confinement can effectively tune spin state, but developing an adaptive angstrom&#8208;confined atomic system is challenging. Angstrom&#8208;confined cobalt (Co) manganese (Mn) dual single atoms within flexible 2D carbon nitride interlayer are constructed to drive adaptive tuning of spin state by changing atomic coordination under angstrom confinement. The in situ characterizations and density functional theory calculations showed that medium&#8208;spin Co in Co&#9472;N4 absorbed electrons after the adsorption of peroxymonosulfate on CoMn dual single&#8208;atom sites and then cleaved O&#9472;H of peroxymonosulfate to facilitate *SO5 generation, while the introduction of *SO5 increased interlayer distance and then cleaved Co&#9472;N and Mn&#9472;N, resulting in the spin state transition from medium to high. Subsequently, the high&#8208;spin Co and Mn in Co&#9472;N2 and Mn&#9472;N2 desorbed the *O2 from *SO5, restoring the initial medium spin state. The adaptive spin state transition enhanced 38.6&#8208;fold singlet oxygen yield compared to the unconfined control. The proposed angstrom&#8208;confined diatomic strategy is applicable to serial diatomic catalysts, providing an efficient and universal design scheme for singlet oxygen&#8208;mediated selective wastewater treatment technology at the atomic level.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Mediated Photoacoustic/NIR&#8208;II and Photodynamic Properties of pH&#8208;Reversible Thiopyrylium Agents: A Computational and Experimental Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article presents an innovative approach to developing pH&#8208;responsive thiopyrylium&#8208;based NIR&#8208;II fluorophores with enhanced photoacoustic and photodynamic properties. By precisely modulating molecular aggregation, the study demonstrates significant advances in tumor&#8208;targeted dual&#8208;modal imaging and therapy, providing a promising pathway for future cancer diagnosis and treatment.








Abstract
Aggregation profoundly influences the photophysical properties of molecules. Here, a new series of thiopyrylium&#8208;based hemicyanine near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) fluorophores is developed by meticulously adjusting their aggregation states. Notably, the star molecule HTPA exhibits a remarkable pH&#8208;responsive behavior and a significant increase in photoacoustic (PA) intensity when aggregated. Additionally, their behavior and pH reversibility during aggregation formation are systematically investigated, including computational optimization, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, NMR analysis, and single crystal analysis. Finally, an innovative &#8220;off&#8201;&#8221; nanoparticle specifically is designed for effective tumor&#8208;targeted PA/NIR&#8208;II dual&#8208;modal imaging and photodynamic therapy by utilizing a pH&#8208;responsive polymer. The signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) of PA signals significantly increased to 169 in the region of interest (ROI) in the mouse model when irradiated at 1064&#160;nm. These findings not only provide a promising avenue for future studies of NIR&#8208;II small molecules but also pave the way for significant advances in the field of integrated cancer diagnosis and therapy.

         <title>Ultralight Electrospun Composite Filters with Vertical Ternary Spatial Network for High&#8208;Performance PM0.3 Purification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative ultralight electrospun nanofiber composite filter,&#160;mass&#8208;produced via an one&#8208;step free surface electrospinning technology, is engineered with a vertical ternary spatial network (TSN) structure, featuring elongated internal aperture channels. This advanced TSN filter excels in high&#8208;performance filtration of ultrafine PM0.3 aerosols,&#160;while significantly minimizing material usage. It is designed for recyclability and operates with low energy requirements, ensuring both wearer comfort and environmental sustainability.








Abstract
Air pollutants, particularly highly permeable particulate matter (PM), threaten public health and environmental sustainability due to extensive filter media consumption. Existing melt&#8208;blown nonwoven filters struggle with PM0.3 removal, energy consumption, and disposal burdens. Here, an ultralight composite filter with a vertical ternary spatial network (TSN) structure that saves &#8776;98% of raw material usage and reduces fabrication time by 99.4%, while simultaneously achieving high&#8208;efficiency PM0.3 removal (&#8805;99.92%), eco&#8208;friendly regeneration (near&#8208;zero energy consumption), and enhanced wearing comfort (breathability &gt;80&#160;mm s&#8315;&#185;, infrared transmittance &gt;85%), is reported. The TSN filter consists of a hybrid layer of microspheres (average diameter &#8776;1&#160;&#181;m)/superfine nanofibers (&#8776;20&#160;nm) sandwiched between two nanofiber scaffolds (diameter &#8776;400&#160;nm and &#8776;100&#160;nm). This arrangement offers high porosity (&#8776;85%), ultralow areal density (&lt;1&#160;g m&#8722;2), alow airflow resistance (&lt;90&#160;Pa), guaranteeing superb thermal comfort. Notably, utilizing scalable one&#8208;step free surface electrospinning technology, TSN mats can be mass&#8208;produced at a rate of 60 meters per hour (width of 1.6 meters), which is critical and verified for various applications including window screens, individual respiratory protectors, and dust collectors. This work provides a viable strategy for designing high&#8208;performance nanofiber filter media through structural regulation in a scalable, cost&#8208;effective, and sustainable way.

         <title>Improving the Scintillation Performance of PEA2PbBr4 Through Zn2+ and Sb3+ Interstitial Doping Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEA2PbBr4 is a promising scintillator for &#947;&#8208;rays and nf detection. However, its energy resolution in &#947;&#8208;rays detection is poor and the ability to discriminate nf/&#947;&#8208;rays has not been accurately reported. It is demonstrated that Zn2+ and Sb3+ doping enhances light yield and optimizes luminescence. Improved scintillator achieves 4.84% and 5.65% energy resolution at 662 keV and effective discrimination in &#947;&#8208;rays/nf detection.








Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic halide 2D perovskite single crystals have recently emerged as promising scintillators for gamma (&#947;) rays and fast neutrons (nf) detection. However, their energy resolution in &#947;&#8208;rays detection still significantly lags behind that of perovskite semiconductor detectors. Improving crystal defects and enhancing light yield to optimize light output detected by the photomultiplier tube are crucial strategies for addressing this issue. Herein, it is demonstrated that Zn2+ and Sb3+ cation interstitial doping strategy can effectively reduce internal defects within the phenylethylammonium lead bromide (PEA2PbBr4) crystal by regulating lattice expansion. This approach also suppresses light loss caused by exciton&#8208;exciton annihilation and accelerates electron&#8208;hole recombination processes, optimizing both the luminescence intensity and decay lifetime of the scintillator. The Zn2+ and Sb3+ doping PEA2PbBr4 scintillator achieve an optimal energy resolution of 4.84% and 5.65% at 662&#160;keV for the photopeak, respectively. Additionally, in the 241Am&#8208;Be field, effective identification of nf and &#947;&#8208;rays around 1100 keVee is achieved using a pulse shape discrimination (PSD) method, with the figure of merit (FOM) being 0.85 and 1.03, respectively. This work provides a reliable new approach for optimizing the scintillation performance of 2D perovskite and promotes the application of 2D perovskite scintillator in &#947;&#8208;rays and nf detection.

Dual&#8208;site catalysts hold significant promise for accelerating complex electrochemical reactions, but a major challenge remains in balancing high loading with precise dual&#8208;site architecture to achieve optimal activity, stability, and specificity simultaneously. Herein, a strategy of stepwise targeted coordination engineering is introduced to co&#8208;anchor Pt single atoms (Pt1, 1.41&#160;wt.%) and Au25(SG)18 nanoclusters (Au25, 18.92 wt.%) with high loadings on graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4). This approach ensures that Pt1 and Au25 occupy distinct surface sites on the g&#8208;C3N4 substrate, providing excellent stability and unprecedented electrochemical activity. In the catalysis of As(III), a sensitivity of 8.32 &#181;A ppb&#8722;1 is achieved, more than double the previously reported values under neutral conditions. The enhanced detection limit (0.2&#160;ppb) is crucial for monitoring water quality and protecting public health from arsenic contamination, a significant environmental and health risk. Furthermore, the formation of Pt&#9472;As and As&#9472;S bonds facilitates the easier breakage of As&#9472;O bonds, thereby lowering the reaction barrier energy of the rate&#8208;determining step and significantly enhancing arsenious acid catalysis efficiency. These results not only offer an intriguing strategy for constructing highly efficient heterogeneous dual&#8208;site catalysts but also reveal the atomic&#8208;scale catalytic mechanisms that drive enhanced catalytic efficiency.

         <title>Supramolecular Chemistry in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights synergies between reticular chemistry and supramolecular chemistry. The role of supramolecular interactions in determining framework&#8230;guest interactions and attempts to understand dynamic behavior in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), particularly emphasizing the development of crystal sponges, studying reactions in frameworks and attempts to control pore behavior through the incorporation of mechanically&#8208;interlocked molecules, is explored.








Abstract
Far from being simply rigid, benign architectures, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit diverse interactions with their interior environment. From developing crystal sponges to studying reactions in framework materials, the role of both supramolecular chemistry and framework structure is evident.&#160;We explore the&#160;role of supramolecular chemistry in determining framework&#8230;guest interactions and attempts to understand the dynamic behavior in MOFs, including attempts to control pore behavior through the incorporation of mechanically&#8208;interlocked molecules. Appreciating and understanding the role of supramolecular interactions and dynamic behavior in metal&#8211;organic frameworks emerge as important directions for the field.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Thermophoretic Nanomotors for Superficial Tumor Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spherical core&#8208;shell nanomotor consisting of a polydopamine&#8208;indocyanine green composite shell and a rigid functional core is proposed in this work. This motor can be activated by the NIR&#8208;I irradiation to perform NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;directed thermoplastic propulsion in subcutaneous tissue, enabling an efficient peritumoral administration for low&#8208;risk superficial tumor photothermal therapy.








Abstract
Peritumoral subcutaneous injection has been highly envisioned as an efficient yet low&#8208;risk administration of photothermal agents for superficial tumor photothermal therapy. However, obstructed by complex subcutaneous tissue, the delivery of injected photothermal agents to the specific tumor remains a critical issue. Herein, the study reports a polydopamine (PDA)&#8208;encapsulated spherical core/shell nanomotor with fluorescent indocyanine green (ICG) immobilized on its PDA shell. Upon the first near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;I) irradiation, this motor can generate favorable photothermal heat, and meantime, emit a robust ICG fluorescence in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II). The heat turns the motor into an active photothermal agent able to perform thermophoretic propulsion along the irradiation direction in subcutaneous tissue, while the ICG fluorescence can direct the subcutaneous propulsion of motors toward specific tumor through real&#8208;time NIR&#8208;II imaging. These functions endow the motor with the ability of moving to tumor after being injected at peritumoral site, enabling an enhanced photothermal therapy (PTT). The results demonstrated herein suggest an integrated nanorobotic tool for the superficial PTT using peritumoral administration, highlighting an NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;directed subcutaneous propulsion.

         <title>Rational Design of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Pancreatic Cancer Therapy: from Machine Learning Screening to In Vivo Efficacy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explores the MOF landscape to select a single, optimal candidate for successfully delivering cancer drugs (gemcitabine, paclitaxel, SN&#8208;38) into tough pancreatic tumors. Machine learning and simulations guide this search, demonstrating colloidal stability, excellent biocompatibility, cellular uptake, and sustained release. With long&#8208;term stability, the paclitaxel&#8208;loaded hydrogel formulation achieves remarkable in vivo results, shrinking tumors and reducing metastasis.









Abstract
Despite improvements in cancer survival rates, metastatic and surgery&#8208;resistant cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, remain challenging, with poor prognoses and limited treatment options. Enhancing drug bioavailability in tumors, while minimizing off&#8208;target effects, is crucial. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising drug delivery vehicles owing to their high loading capacity, biocompatibility, and functional tunability. However, the vast chemical diversity of MOFs complicates the rational design of biocompatible materials. This study employed machine learning and molecular simulations to identify MOFs suitable for encapsulating gemcitabine, paclitaxel, and SN&#8208;38, and identified PCN&#8208;222 as an optimal candidate. Following drug loading, MOF formulations are improved for colloidal stability and biocompatibility. In vitro studies on pancreatic cancer cell lines have shown high biocompatibility, cellular internalization, and delayed drug release. Long&#8208;term stability tests demonstrated a consistent performance over 12 months. In vivo studies in pancreatic tumor&#8208;bearing mice revealed that paclitaxel&#8208;loaded PCN&#8208;222, particularly with a hydrogel for local administration, significantly reduced metastatic spread and tumor growth compared to the free drug. These findings underscore the potential of PCN&#8208;222 as an effective drug delivery system for the treatment of hard&#8208;to&#8208;treat cancers.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Tumor Strategies Targeting Nutritional Deprivation: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In view of the abnormal nutrient requirements of tumor cells and tumor tissues, this study focuses on the nutrient and metabolic characteristics of tumor cells and other cell members of the tumor microenvironment and summarizes relevant nutrient deprivation strategies based on targeted technologies, which is of great significance for the development of new nutrition&#8208;targeted anti&#8208;cancer therapies.








Abstract
Higher and richer nutrient requirements are typical features that distinguish tumor cells from AU: cells, ensuring adequate substrates and energy sources for tumor cell proliferation and migration. Therefore, nutrient deprivation strategies based on targeted technologies can induce impaired cell viability in tumor cells, which are more sensitive than normal cells. In this review, nutrients that are required by tumor cells and related metabolic pathways are introduced, and anti&#8208;tumor strategies developed to target nutrient deprivation are described. In addition to tumor cells, the nutritional and metabolic characteristics of other cells in the tumor microenvironment (including macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer cells, T cells, and cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts) and related new anti&#8208;tumor strategies are also summarized. In conclusion, recent advances in anti&#8208;tumor strategies targeting nutrient blockade are reviewed, and the challenges and prospects of these anti&#8208;tumor strategies are discussed, which are of theoretical significance for optimizing the clinical application of tumor nutrition deprivation strategies.

Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to valuable C2+ products emerges as a promising strategy for converting intermittent renewable energy into high&#8208;energy&#8208;density fuels and feedstock. Leveraging its substantial commercial potential and compatibility with existing energy infrastructure, the electrochemical conversion of CO2 into multicarbon hydrocarbons and oxygenates (C2+) holds great industrial promise. However, the process is hampered by complex multielectron&#8208;proton transfer reactions and difficulties in reactant activation, posing significant thermodynamic and kinetic barriers to the commercialization of C2+ production. Addressing these barriers necessitates a comprehensive approach encompassing multiple facets, including the effective control of C&#9472;C coupling in industrial electrolyzers using efficient catalysts in optimized local environments. This review delves into the advancements and outstanding challenges spanning from the microcosmic to macroscopic scales, including the design of nanocatalysts, optimization of the microenvironment, and the development of macroscopic electrolyzers. By elucidating the influence of the local electrolyte environment, and exploring the design of potential industrial flow cells, guidelines are provided for future research aimed at promoting C&#9472;C coupling, thereby bridging microscopic insights and macroscopic applications in the field of CO2 electroreduction.

         <title>Dielectric Regulation in Quasi&#8208;vdW Europium Oxysulfur Compounds by Compositional Engineering for 2D Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the first synthesis of 2D hexagonal Eu&#8322;SO&#8322; and tetragonal Eu&#8322;SO&#8326; with tunable dielectric properties. Eu&#8322;SO&#8322; offers high dielectric performance, while Eu&#8322;SO&#8326; provides a wider bandgap. Integrated into MoS&#8322; field&#8208;effect transistors, these materials demonstrate excellent performance, highlighting their potential as multifunctional dielectrics for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;power electronics.








Abstract
Advancing next&#8208;generation electronics necessitates precise control of dielectric properties in 2D materials. Here, the first synthesis of novel 2D quasi&#8208;van der Waals (vdW) europium oxysulfur (Eu2SOx) compounds, comprising hexagonal Eu&#8322;SO&#8322; and tetragonal Eu&#8322;SO&#8326; phases, with composition&#8208;tunable dielectric properties, is presented. Using a homodiffusive&#8208;controlled epitaxial growth method, materials are achieved with complementary characteristics: the hexagonal Eu&#8322;SO&#8322; phase exhibits a high dielectric constant (&#8776;30) paired with a moderate bandgap (&#8776;4.56 eV), while the tetragonal Eu&#8322;SO&#8326; phase offers a wider bandgap (&#8776;5.62 eV) but a lower dielectric constant (&#8776;20). The potential of these materials is demonstrated by integrating ultrathin Eu&#8322;SO&#8322; nanoplates with molybdenum disulfide (MoS&#8322;) field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) via vdW forces. The resulting devices achieve a near&#8208;ideal Ion/Ioff ratio (&#8776;10&#8312;), minimal hysteresis (&#8776;5.3 mV), a low subthreshold slope (&#8776;63.5 mV dec&#8315;&#185;), and ultralow leakage current (&#8776;10&#8315;&#185;&#8308; A). These results highlight the capacity of europium oxysulfur compounds to address the trade&#8208;off between dielectric constant and bandgap, offering tailored solutions for diverse 2D electronic applications. This work underscores the potential of composition engineering to expand the family of rare&#8208;earth oxysulfur compounds for nanoelectronics, paving the way for innovative gate dielectrics in next&#8208;generation devices.

         <title>The Optimized Lipid&#8208;Modified Prodrug for CNV Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modification of SU5402 (SU)&#160;with aliphatic chains containing 20 carbon atoms (SU&#8208;C20 NPs) exhibits an exceptional ability to penetrate the ocular barrier and ensure prolonged drug retention within the eye. These optimized prodrug nanoparticles show a remarkable therapeutic effect in choroidal neovascularization (CNV), resulting in minimal hyperfluorescent leakage and the smallest CNV lesion thickness.








Abstract
Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a prevalent cause of vision impairment. The primary treatment for CNV involves intravitreal injections of anti&#8208;vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies. Nevertheless, this approach still faces numerous limitations like poor patient compliance, high therapy expenditure and lack of response in some individuals. Herein, a series of anti&#8208;neovascularization prodrugs, SU5402 (SU), modified with lipids of varying chain lengths (C12, C16, C20, C24, C28) is synthesized (SU&#8208;C12, SU&#8208;C16, SU&#8208;C20, SU&#8208;C24, SU&#8208;C28). 1% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is used as a stabilizer to create nanoformulations of five prodrugs named SU&#8208;C12 NPs, SU&#8208;C16 NPs, SU&#8208;C20 NPs, SU&#8208;C24 NPs, SU&#8208;C28 NPs. Among these, SU&#8208;C20 NPs significantly prolong the retention of bioactive drug in the eye for up to 70 d. Moreover, SU&#8208;C20 NPs demonstrate superior tissue permeability via enhanced cellular endocytosis and exocytosis. With its prolonged retention and improved penetration, SU&#8208;C20 NPs reduce the fluorescence intensity of fundus leakage by 42.5% and the fluorescence area by 51.5% in CNV mice after four weeks, effectively inhibiting the progression of CNV. Altogether, small molecule drug SU is innovatively modified to improve its effectiveness for treating fundus neovascular diseases, proposing an alternative therapy for wet age&#8208;related macular degeneration (wAMD).

         <title>Zinc Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Encapsulated in Hierarchical Porous Bio&#8208;Carbon Synergistically Enhances Fast Iodine Conversion and Efficient Polyiodide Confinement for Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomass&#8208;derived carbon integrated with Zn single&#8208;atom catalysts for iodine hosting is designed, integrating the high specific surface area, hierarchical porosity, and nitrogen doping of carbon, along with the excellent chemical confinement and electrocatalytic properties of Zn single atoms. This enabled Zn&#8208;I2 batteries to achieve a long lifespan of 80&#160;000 cycles at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 with 93.6% capacity retention.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) batteries have attracted attention due to their low cost, environmental compatibility, and high specific capacity. However, their development is hindered by the severe shuttle effect of polyiodides and the slow redox conversion kinetics of the iodine (I2) cathode. Herein, a long&#8208;life Zn&#8208;I2 battery is developed by anchoring iodine within an edible fungus slag&#8208;derived carbon matrix encapsulated with Zn single&#8208;atom catalysts (SAZn@CFS). The high N content and microporous structure of SAZn@CFS provide a strong iodine confinement, while the Zn&#8208;N4&#8208;C sites chemical interact with polyiodides effectively mitigating the iodine dissolution and the polyiodide shuttle effect. Additionally, the uniformly distributed SAZn sites significantly enhance the redox conversion efficiency of I&#8722;/I3&#8722;/I5&#8722;/I2, leading to improved capacity. At a high current density of 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, the designed Zn&#8208;I2 battery delivers an excellent capacity of 147.2&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and a long lifespan of over 80&#160;000 cycles with 93.6% capacity retention. Furthermore, the battery exhibits stable operation for 3500 times even at 50&#160;&#176;C, demonstrating significant advances in iodine reversible storage. This synergistic strategy optimizes composite structure, offering a practical approach to meet the requirements of high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale High&#8208;Entropy Design for Superior Capacitive Energy Storage Performance in Lead&#8208;Free Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dielectric ceramics with high energy storage performance are crucial for advanced high&#8208;power capacitors.

Abstract
Dielectric ceramics with high energy storage performance are crucial for the development of advanced high&#8208;power capacitors. However, achieving ultrahigh recoverable energy storage density and efficiency remains challenging, limiting the progress of leading&#8208;edge energy storage applications. In this study, (Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3 (BNT) is selected as the matrix, and the effects of different A&#8208;site elements on domain morphology, lattice polarization, and dielectric and ferroelectric properties are systematically investigated. Mg, La, Ca, and Sr are shown to enhance relaxation behavior by different magnitudes; hence, a high&#8208;entropy strategy for designing local polymorphic distortions is proposed. Based on atomic&#8208;scale investigations, a series of BNT&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy compositions are designed by introducing trace amounts of Mg and La to improve the electric breakdown strength and further disrupt the polar nanoscale regions (PNRs). A disordered polarization distribution and ultrasmall PNRs with a minimum size of &#8776;1 nm are detected in the high&#8208;entropy ceramics. Ultimately, a high recoverable energy density of 10.1 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and an efficiency of 90% are achieved for (Ca0.2Sr0.2Ba0.2Mg0.05La0.05Bi0.15Na0.15)TiO3. Furthermore, it displays a high&#8208;power density of 584 MW&#160;cm&#8722;3 and an ultrashort discharge time of 27 ns. This work presents an effective approach for designing dielectric energy storage materials with superior comprehensive performance via a high&#8208;entropy strategy.

         <title>Strain Release via Glass Transition Temperature Regulation for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Tg (glass transition temperature) regulation (TR) strategy is developed to effectively release residual strain in the perovskite film through adjusting the ratio of monomeric additives. The resulting film exhibits significantly reduced tensile strain, decreased trap density and superior stability. The optimized perovskite solar cells achieve a high efficiency of 26.15% (certified as 25.59%) and excellent stability.








Abstract
Thermally induced tensile strain that remains in perovskite films after annealing is one of the key reasons for diminishing the performance and operational stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a glass transition temperature (Tg) regulation (TR) strategy is developed by introducing two polymerizable monomers, 2&#8208;(N&#8208;3&#8208;Sulfopropyl&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethyl ammonium)ethyl methacrylate (SBMA) and 2&#8208;Hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), into the perovskite layer. SBMA and HEA undergo in situ polymerization, which regulates the nucleation and crystal growth of the perovskite film. In addition, adjusting the ratio of SBMA and HEA to lower the Tg of the resulting polymer effectively releases the strain in the perovskite film. The modified film exhibits significantly reduced tensile strain, decreased trap density and improved stability. As a result, the optimized PSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.15% (certified as 25.59%). Furthermore, the encapsulated device demonstrates prominent enhanced operation stability, maintaining 90.3% of its initial efficiency after 500&#160;h of continuous sunlight exposure.

         <title>In Situ Formation of Ripplocations in Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic MXenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid MXenes (h&#8208;MXenes) are a family of 2D&#160;transition metal carbides with amino surface groups that exhibit interesting optical properties. The sensitivity of the organic material under high&#8208;energy electron beams complicates conventional TEM analysis. Using cryogenic STEM, we show h&#8208;MXenes are stable until a critical dose threshold. Beyond that threshold, the in situ generation of ripplocations is observed.









Abstract
Inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid MXenes (h&#8208;MXenes) are a family of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides functionalized with alkylimido and alkylamido surface groups. Using cryogenic and room temperature scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy (EELS), it is shown that ripplocations, a form of a fundamental defect in 2D and layered structures, are abundant in this family of materials. Furthermore, detailed studies of electron probe sample interactions, focusing on structural deformations caused by the electron beam are presented. The findings indicate that at cryogenic temperatures (&#8776;100&#160;K) and below a specific dose threshold, the structure of h&#8208;MXenes remains largely intact. However, exceeding this threshold leads to electron beam&#8208;induced deformation through ripplocations. Interestingly, the deformation behavior, required dose, and resultant structure are highly dependent on temperature. At 100&#160;K, it is demonstrated that the electron beam can induce ripplocations in situ with a high degree of precision.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Input Molecular Classifier Based on Digital DNA Strand Displacement for Disease Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Digital DNA Strand Displacement (DDSD) is developed for advanced molecular classification of processing multiple inputs. By minimizing oligonucleotide requirements, DDSD enables binary and multiclass molecular classification in a simplified manner. It has been successfully applied in infection diagnostics and pathogen identification using blood samples. Computing capability can be further enhanced by cascade DDSD and multiway junction DDSD.








Abstract
DNA&#8208;based molecular computing systems for biomarkers have emerged as powerful tools for intelligent diagnostics. However, with the variety of feature biomarkers expanding, current molecular computing systems suffer from the use of a large number of oligonucleotides and limited encoding capability. Here, the study develops an alternative molecular computing approach termed Digital DNA Strand Displacement (DDSD) which recognizes targets and operates target valence through DNA polymerase&#8208;based extension and strand release. DDSD significantly reduced the number of used oligonucleotide species, provided robust molecular classifiers. In clinical blood samples, a 96% accuracy rate is achieved with a DDSD&#8208;based binary classifier for distinguishing bacterial and viral infections, a 100% accuracy rate is achieved with a multiclass classifier for identifying pathogen types, surpassing existing classifier systems. Moreover, DDSD can be readily expanded. Cascade DDSD is developed, enabling simultaneous computing of up to 14 valence states with a maximum valence of 25. Multiway junction DDSD is implemented to achieve high&#8208;valence computing by compact DNA nanostructures rather than split DNA computing units, reducing the potential leakage. The implementation of DDSD enhances the capability of valence&#8208;based intelligent molecular diagnostics and multiplexed biomarker detection.

         <title>Embedding Carbon Nanotubes in Artificial Cells Enhances Probe Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liposome&#8208;based artificial cell is constructed to protect the signal probes and carbon nanotubes are embedded in the artificial cell membranes and employed as artificial channels to enhance intercellular probe transduction and mass transfer. The strategy accelerates cell&#8208;cell signal probe transmission and enables effective sensing of let&#8208;7a and visualizing let&#8208;7a in living colon cancer cells.








Abstract
Monitoring intracellular biomarkers is crucial for clinical disease diagnosis. However, the majority of signaling molecules face difficulties in slow transference across the cell membrane to reach intracellular detection sites, limiting their application in clinical settings. This study proposes an artificial cell&#8208;based signal probe transfer&#8208;enhanced sensing strategy to effectively detect microRNAs (miRNAs) by embedding carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in artificial cell membranes. The liposome&#8208;based artificial cell is constructed to protect the signal probes such as nucleic acids, metal ions, and fluorescent dyes. CNTs are embedded in artificial cell membranes and employed as artificial channels to enhance intercellular signal probe transduction and mass transfer. Through CNTs&#8208;mediate cell&#8208;cell signal probe transmission, the probes pass through the liposome membrane interface and fuse into target cells, selectively hybridizing with the intracellular target miRNAs, triggering a sensing process and resulting in enhanced fluorescence signal. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to prove the enhancement of CNTs&#8208;mediated cell&#8208;cell fusion. This strategy demonstrates excellent analytical performance by quantitatively detecting let&#8208;7a miRNA and visualizing it in living colon cancer cells. These findings hold great significance in promoting and accelerating cell&#8208;cell signal probe transmission and enabling effective sensing of intracellular biomarkers for diagnostic purposes.

         <title>Ultrafast Infrared Plasmonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive summary of ultrafast infrared plasmonics covering the fundamental principles, material systems, manipulation methods, detection techniques, and promising applications. Furthermore, it highlights the future potential of ultrafast infrared plasmonics as a novel platform for exploring ultrafast electronic correlation effects and many&#8208;body interactions.








Abstract
Ultrafast plasmonics represents a cutting&#8208;edge frontier in light&#8208;matter interactions, providing a unique platform to study electronic interactions and collective motions across femtosecond to picosecond timescales. In the infrared regime, where energy aligns with the rearrangements of low&#8208;energy electrons, molecular vibrations, and thermal fluctuations, ultrafast plasmonics can be a powerful tool for revealing ultrafast electronic phase transitions, controlling molecular reactions, and driving subwavelength thermal processes. Here, the evolution of ultrafast infrared plasmonics, discussing the recent progress in their manipulation, detection, and applications is reviewed. The future opportunities, including their potential to probe electronic correlations, investigate intrinsic ultrafast plasmonic interactions, and enable advanced applications in quantum information are highlighted, which may be promoted by multi&#8208;physical field integrated ultrafast techniques.

         <title>Designing Supported Nanoparticles via Synergistic Ex&#8208;Solution and Phosphorization for Tailored Active Site Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot process synchronizing nanoparticle ex&#8208;solution and phosphorization is developed for simultaneous phosphide nanoparticle synthesis and host oxide functionalization. The resulting IrRuP/WO2.9 catalyst achieves exceptional mass activity and low onset potential for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C and offering a promising alternative for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysis.









Abstract
Supported nanoparticles incorporating catalytically attractive nonmetal elements have gained significant attention as a promising strategy for enhancing catalytic activity in various industrial applications. This study presents an innovative one&#8208;pot synthesis method for fabricating hybrid catalysts, which simultaneously modifies surface properties through the precipitation of nanoparticles with the concurrent incorporation of nonmetal elements. The underlying concept is to synchronize the temperature required for particle formation with that of nonmetal incorporation by adjusting the oxygen chemical potential of the host oxide. As a case study, Ir&#8208; and Ru&#8208;doped WO3 are selected as the starting material, with phosphorus (P) as the representative nonmetal for surface functionalization. Notably, the hybrid catalyst, composed of amorphous (Ir,Ru)Px particles dispersed on P&#8208;rich WO2.9 sheets, is synthesized through a single heat treatment at 500&#160;&#176;C, avoiding undesirable sintering of the host material. When used as a hydrogen evolution catalyst, this material exhibits outstanding mass activity, durability, compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C catalysts. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the superior performance of the hybrid catalysts attributes to improved water dissociation and favorable adsorption and desorption of key reaction intermediates. This novel synthesis strategy offers considerable potential for advancing diverse areas of heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Conversion of Nitrogen and Water to Solid Fertilizer in an Outdoor 1 m2 Panel Reactor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallic MoO3&#8208;x is successfully prepared at the kilogram scale and exhibits an outstanding STA efficiency (&#8776;0.3%) under simulated&#8208;solar irradiation. Its potential scalability of the large&#8208;scale photocatalytic system stems from a high STA efficiency (0.03%) and good stability (6 days) of the 1&#160;m2 panel reactor system, yielding solar fertilizer ((NH4)2SO4).








Abstract
Harnessing solar energy to convert molecular N2 into nitrogen&#8208;rich chemicals (e.g., ammonia) provides a potential pathway for the manufacture of &#8220;solar fertilizers&#8221;. However, the solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia (STA) efficiency of most solar fertilizer systems developed to date is less than 0.1%. Herein, an outstanding STA efficiency of &#8776;0.3% using a metallic molybdenum trioxide (metallic MoO3&#8208;x) photocatalyst under simulated&#8208;solar irradiation is reported, with localized surface plasmon resonance phenomena in the metallic MoO3&#8208;x photocatalyst enhancing both light utilization and N2 activation. The potential scalability of the photocatalytic technology is demonstrated in a 1&#160;m2 panel reactor system, with a high STA efficiency and good stability demonstrated over 6 days of outdoor testing, yielding a solid (NH4)2SO4 product for easy collection. The as&#8208;designed square&#8208;meter outdoor reaction system facilitates the integration of solar fertilizer technology with existing agricultural infrastructure.

         <title>Simultaneous Isotropic Omnidirectional Hypersensitive Strain Sensing and Deep Learning&#8208;Assisted Direction Recognition in a Biomimetic Stretchable Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Omnidirectional strain sensing is crucial in healthcare monitoring, human motion detection, and human&#8208;machine interfaces. By mimicking the 3D structure of human fingers, this work introduces a novel heterogeneous substrate incorporating the involute of a circle which enables the device to achieve isotropic omnidirectional hypersensitive strain sensing and directional recognition simultaneously.








Abstract
Omnidirectional strain sensing and direction recognition ability are features of the human tactile sense, essential to address the intricate and dynamic requirements of real&#8208;world applications. Most of the current strain sensors work by converting uniaxial strain into electrical signals, which restricts their use in environments with multiaxial strain. Here, the first device with simultaneous isotropic omnidirectional hypersensitive strain sensing and direction recognition (IOHSDR) capabilities is introduced. By mimicking the human fingers from three dimensions, the IOHSDR device realizes a novel heterogeneous substrate that incorporates the involute of a circle, resulting in isotropic behavior in the radial direction and anisotropic property in the involute direction for hypersensitive strain sensing. With the assistance of a deep learning&#8208;based model, the IOHSDR device accomplishes an impressive accuracy of 99.58% in recognizing 360&#176; stretching directions. Additionally, it exhibits superior performance in the typical properties of stretchable strain sensors, with a gauge factor of 634.12, an ultralow detection limit of 0.01%, and outstanding durability exceeding 15&#160;000 cycles. The demonstration of radial artery pulse and throat vibration applications highlights the IOHSDR's unique characteristics of isotropic omnidirectional sensing and precise direction detection unleashing new classes of wearable health monitoring devices.

         <title>2D Molecular Crystals for Electronic and Optoelectronic Devices: Status and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an overview of the structures of 2D molecular crystals (2D MCs) and strategies to modify their morphology and properties. Next, it summarizes preparation methods for large&#8208;scale 2D MCs by solution&#8208;based processes or vapor deposition. Finally, it highlights the applications of 2D MCs in electronic and optoelectronic devices with the advantages of tunable properties and scalable preparation methods.








Abstract
2D molecular crystals (2D MCs) are an emerging family of 2D materials formed by organic or inorganic molecules held together entirely by weak intermolecular forces. 2D MCs are gaining attention in electronics and optoelectronics due to their structural diversity, scalability, and strong light&#8211;matter interactions. This review provides a comprehensive overview of 2D MCs and their potential in electronic and optoelectronic applications. It begins by highlighting the structural features and properties of key 2D MCs discovered to date, focusing on three strategies to manipulate intermolecular forces for better control over crystal morphology and properties. Then various methods are explored for fabricating large&#8208;area, highly&#8208;oriented 2D MCs, with an emphasis on vapor&#8208;phase and liquid&#8208;phase techniques. Last, their applications are reviewed in electronic and optoelectronic devices, such as channel materials, photosensitive components, and dielectrics. It is concluded by discussing future challenges and opportunities in the field, offering insights into scalable production and industrial applications of 2D MCs.

         <title>Bioinspired Disordered Aerogel for Omnidirectional Terahertz Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mimicking micro&#8208;pores structures from black butterflies, terahertz response behaviors with incidence&#8208;angle&#8208;insensitive and ultra&#8208;broadband can be effectively controlled through a disordered pore&#8208;induced structural orientation mechanism. In this research, the first investigation is presented into the regulation of terahertz response behaviors via optimized pore structure including disorder, pore parameters, and orientation, regarding as resonance sphere and waveguide system.








Abstract
The structural disorder of the black butterfly assists in capturing sunlight across a wider spectral and angular range, injecting infinite vitality for omnidirectional and stimuli&#8208;responsive wave&#8208;absorbing materials. Here, the disordered micro&#8208;pores responding to terahertz (THz) waves through electromagnetic simulations, and then prepared via ice templating technology are analyzed and optimized. The customized disordered aerogel makes possible perfect terahertz response property with incidence&#8208;angle&#8208;insensitive and ultra&#8208;broadband. Ti3C2Tx MXene/carboxymethyl cellulose aerogels realize excellent shielding effectiveness exceeding 70.32&#160;dB and reflection loss of more than 43.02&#160;dB over the frequency range of 0.3&#8211;1.5 THz. Tailoring the structural orientation of anisotropic aerogels functions as a versatile dynamic modulation approach along terahertz propagation direction. The porous structure with moderate conductivity gradually triggers the resonance effect of the cavity, approximating a resonance sphere (pore) and waveguide system (tube). Ultimately, gradient impedance aerogel is proposed integrating THz&#8208;infrared stealth, hydrophobicity, and mechanical strength. This inspired biomimetic structural strategy will also enable various terahertz applications such as terahertz imaging, line&#8208;of&#8208;sight telecommunication, information encryption, and space exploration.

         <title>Ultrafast Li&#8208;Rich Transport in Composite Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Li&#8208;rich transport mechanism is proposed to achieve ultrafast Li&#8208;ion conduction in composite solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Negatively charged cation defects intensify the concentration enrichment of Li ions on the nanofiller surface, inducing the formation of interconnected Li&#8208;rich transport networks. The composite electrolyte exhibits an unprecedented ionic conductivity of approaching 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8315;1 at room temperature.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) metal batteries (SSLMBs) have garnered considerable attention due to their potential for high energy density and intrinsic safety. However, their widespread development has been hindered by the low ionic conductivity of solid&#8208;state electrolytes. In this contribution, a novel Li&#8208;rich transport mechanism is proposed to achieve ultrafast Li&#8208;ion conduction in composite solid&#8208;state electrolytes. By incorporating cation&#8208;deficient dielectric nanofillers into polymer matrices, it is found that negatively charged cation defects effectively intensify the adsorption of Li ions, resulting in a high Li&#8208;ion concentration enrichment on the surface of fillers. More importantly, these formed Li&#8208;rich layers are interconnected to establish continuous ultrafast Li&#8208;ion transport networks. The composite electrolyte exhibited a remarkably low ion transport activation energy (0.17&#160;eV) and achieved an unprecedented ionic conductivity of approaching 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8315;1 at room temperature. The Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mo0.1O2 full cells demonstrated an extended cycling life of over 200 cycles with a capacity retention of 70.7%. This work provides a fresh insight into improving Li&#8208;ion transport by constructing interconnected Li&#8208;rich transport networks, paving the way for the development of high&#8208;performance SSLMBs.

         <title>A Bifunctional Lysosome&#8208;Targeting Chimera Nanoplatform for Tumor&#8208;Selective Protein Degradation and Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional lysosome&#8208;targeting chimera nanoplatform (NLTC) is synthesized for tumor&#8208;selective protein degradation and enhanced cancer immunotherapy. By rationally controlling surface properties and encapsulating catalase, NLTC can efficiently accumulate at tumor tissues and avoid on&#8208;target off&#8208;tumor toxicity, synergistically degrade cancer cell surface programmed death ligand&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;L1) and relieve immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment for effective cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Lysosome&#8208;targeting chimeras (LYTACs) have recently emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for degrading extracellular and membrane&#8208;associated pathogenic proteins by hijacking lysosome&#8208;targeting receptors. However, the antitumor performance of LYTAC is limited by its insufficient tumor accumulation and nonspecific activation. Additionally, the synergistic effects of LYTACs and other therapeutic modalities are crucial. To address these issues, a bifunctional LYTAC nanoplatform (NLTC) is developed for tumor&#8208;selective protein degradation and enhanced cancer immunotherapy. By rationally controlling the surface composition, the NLTC can effectively transport extracellular or membrane proteins into lysosomes for degradation via cation&#8208;independent mannose 6&#8208;phosphate receptors. With removable surface modification, an NLTC is obtained that efficiently accumulated in tumor tissues and avoided on&#8208;target off&#8208;tumor toxicity. Moreover, the synthesis method of NLTC is generally applicable to various enzymes. Thus, catalase (CAT) is encapsulated with NLTC to synergistically degrade cancer cell surface programmed death ligand&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;L1), relieve the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment for effective cancer immunotherapy, and significantly inhibit tumor growth, recurrence, and metastasis in B16F10&#8208;bearing mice. This work presents a bifunctional LYTAC nanoplatform that can not only perform tissue&#8208;selective protein degradation but also integrate other therapeutic modalities, providing insights into the design of advanced LYTAC technologies for clinical applications.

         <title>Rolling the Dice with Light Competition: Introducing a True Random Number Generator Powered by Photo&#8208;Induced Polarity Current</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces the ALTRNG, utilizing a BPPD to generate random bits via unpredictable&#160;arc discharge illumination. Validated by 15 NIST tests, ALTRNG produces highly random bit streams. With a 2&#8208;kbps readout circuit, it enables wireless random number transmission, offering potential for secure password systems and artificial X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
The pursuit of hardware&#8208;based security solutions has highlighted the true random number generator (TRNG). Various physical phenomena, from noise generation to quantum physics complexities, have been explored for random number generation. The arc discharge light&#8208;induced TRNG (ALTRNG) is introduced, featuring wavelength&#8208;dependent photocurrent generation and arc discharge irradiation. A bipolar photo&#8208;responsive photodetector (BPPD) differentiates &#8220;1&#8221; and &#8220;0&#8221; states, producing highly random bits validated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 15 tests. The BPPD's response to deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) and blue light enables distinct photocurrent generation under arc discharge illumination. The ALTRNG generates true random signals, yielding bit streams with unpredictability, uniform distribution, and stability. With a readout circuit achieving 2&#8208;kbps, wireless random number transmission is demonstrated, highlighting potential for secure password systems and artificial X&#8208;ray image generation.

         <title>Tissue Mimetic Membranes for Healing Augmentation of Tendon&#8211;Bone Interface in Rotator Cuff Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a tissue&#8208;mimetic membrane for functional tendon&#8211;bone interface regeneration is fabricated. During the implantation, a biomimicry and inductive microenvironment is created by the region&#8208;specific configuration and spatiotemporal release of chondroinductive kartogenin&#8208;conjugated nanogel (nGel&#8208;KGN) and osteoinductive struvite. The In Vitro and in vivo findings validate the prominent regenerative efficacy in rotator cuff repair.








Abstract
The globally prevalent rotator cuff tear has a high re&#8208;rupture rate, attributing to the failure to reproduce the interfacial fibrocartilaginous enthesis. Herein, a hierarchically organized membrane is developed that mimics the heterogeneous anatomy and properties of the natural enthesis and finely facilitates the reconstruction of tendon&#8211;bone interface. A biphasic membrane consisting of a microporous layer and a mineralized fibrous layer is constructed through the non&#8208;solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) strategy followed by a co&#8208;axial electrospinning procedure. Cationic kartogenin (KGN)&#8208;conjugated nanogel (nGel&#8208;KGN) and osteo&#8208;promotive struvite are incorporated within the membranes in a region&#8208;specific manner. During in vivo repair, the nGel&#8208;KGN&#8208;functionalized microporous layer is adjacent to the tendon which intends to suppress scar tissue formation at the lesion and simultaneously heightens chondrogenesis. Meanwhile, the struvite&#8208;containing fibrous layer covers the tubercula minus to enhance stem cell aggregation and bony ingrowth. Such tissue&#8208;specific features and spatiotemporal release behaviors contribute to effective guidance of specific defect&#8208;healing events at the transitional region, further leading to the remarkably promoted regenerative outcome in terms of the fibrocartilaginous tissue formation, collagen fiber alignment, and optimized functional motion of rotator cuff. These findings render a novel biomimetic membrane as a promising material for clinical rotator cuff repair.

Cationic kartogenin (KGN)-conjugated nanogel (nGel-KGN) and osteo-promotive struvite are incorporated within the membranes in a region-specific manner. During in vivo repair, the nGel-KGN-functionalized microporous layer is adjacent to the tendon which intends to suppress scar tissue formation at the lesion and simultaneously heightens chondrogenesis. Meanwhile, the struvite-containing fibrous layer covers the tubercula minus to enhance stem cell aggregation and bony ingrowth. Such tissue-specific features and spatiotemporal release behaviors contribute to effective guidance of specific defect-healing events at the transitional region, further leading to the remarkably promoted regenerative outcome in terms of the fibrocartilaginous tissue formation, collagen fiber alignment, and optimized functional motion of rotator cuff. These findings render a novel biomimetic membrane as a promising material for clinical rotator cuff repair.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;device Battery Failure Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study analyzes the failure of wireless earbud batteries within their intended usage context. By examining degradations from the material to device level, it reveals that failure patterns are linked to device configuration and operating conditions. The interplay of battery materials, structural design, and microenvironmental factors like temperature gradients offer crucial insights for improving battery integration and reliability.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries are indispensable power sources for a wide range of modern electronic devices. However, battery lifespan remains a critical limitation, directly affecting the sustainability and user experience. Conventional battery failure analysis in controlled lab settings may not capture the complex interactions and environmental factors encountered in real&#8208;world, in&#8208;device operating conditions. This study analyzes the failure of commercial wireless earbud batteries as a model system within their intended usage context. Through multiscale and multimodal characterizations, the degradations from the material level to the device level are correlated, elucidating a failure pattern that is closely tied to the specific device configuration and operating conditions. The findings indicate that the ultimate failure mode is determined by the interplay of battery materials, cell structural design, and the in&#8208;device microenvironment, such as temperature gradients and their fluctuations. This holistic, in&#8208;device perspective on environmental influences provides critical insights for battery integration design, enhancing the reliability of modern&#160;electronics.

         <title>Synergistic Hybrid&#8208;Ligand Passivation of Perovskite Quantum Dots: Suppressing Reduced&#8208;Dimensionality and Enhancing Optoelectronic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation and phase transition of reduced dimensional perovskites triggered by phenethylammonium iodide deteriorates the structural and optical properties of CsPbI3&#8208;perovskite quantum dots (PQDs). Triphenylphosphine oxide, introduced as an ancillary ligand, not only suppresses the phase transition but also further passivates the trap sites on the CsPbI3&#8208;PQDs, leading to improved device performance in CsPbI3&#8208;PQD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diode and solar cell devices.









Abstract
In terms of surface passivation for realizing efficient CsPbI3&#8208;perovskite quantum dot (CsPbI3&#8208;PQD)&#8208;based optoelectronic devices, phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) is widely used during the ligand exchange. However, the PEA cation, due to its large ionic radius incompatible with the 3D perovskite framework, acts as an organic spacer within polycrystalline perovskites, leading to the formation of reduced dimensional perovskites (RDPs). Despite sharing the identical 3D perovskite framework, the influence of PEAI on the structure of CsPbI3&#8208;PQDs remains unexplored. Here, it is revealed that PEAI can induce the formation of high&#8208;n RDPs (n&#160;&gt;&#160;2) within the CsPbI3&#8208;PQD solids, but these high&#8208;n RDPs undergo an undesirable phase transition to low&#8208;n RDPs, leading to the structural and optical degradation of CsPbI3&#8208;PQDs. To address the PEAI&#8208;induced issue, we employ triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) as an ancillary ligand during the ligand exchange process. The incorporation of TPPO prevents H2O penetration and regulates the rapid diffusion of PEAI, suppressing the formation of low&#8208;n RDPs. Moreover, TPPO can passivate the uncoordinated Pb2+ sites, reducing the nonradiative recombination. This hybrid&#8208;ligand exchange strategy using both PEAI and TPPO enables realizing efficient and stable CsPbI3&#8208;PQD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diode (external quantum efficiency of 21.8%) and solar cell (power conversion efficiency of 15.3%) devices.

&lt;p&gt;In terms of surface passivation for realizing efficient CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-perovskite quantum dot (CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-PQD)-based optoelectronic devices, phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) is widely used during the ligand exchange. However, the PEA cation, due to its large ionic radius incompatible with the 3D perovskite framework, acts as an organic spacer within polycrystalline perovskites, leading to the formation of reduced dimensional perovskites (RDPs). Despite sharing the identical 3D perovskite framework, the influence of PEAI on the structure of CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-PQDs remains unexplored. Here, it is revealed that PEAI can induce the formation of high-n RDPs (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;2) within the CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-PQD solids, but these high-n RDPs undergo an undesirable phase transition to low-n RDPs, leading to the structural and optical degradation of CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-PQDs. To address the PEAI-induced issue, we employ triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) as an ancillary ligand during the ligand exchange process. The incorporation of TPPO prevents H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O penetration and regulates the rapid diffusion of PEAI, suppressing the formation of low-n RDPs. Moreover, TPPO can passivate the uncoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sites, reducing the nonradiative recombination. This hybrid-ligand exchange strategy using both PEAI and TPPO enables realizing efficient and stable CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-PQD-based light-emitting diode (external quantum efficiency of 21.8%) and solar cell (power conversion efficiency of 15.3%) devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Critical Role of Atomic&#8208;Scale Polarization in Transition Metal Oxides on Vanadium&#8208;Redox Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals for the first time the underlying mechanism of vacancies in TOMEs and uncovers the effect of atomic&#8208;scale polarization on the redox reaction mechanism through in situ Raman and operando ATR&#8208;SEIRAS. Further, the stability of cation/anion vacancies is explored in long&#8208;term cycling. The findings standardize the fundamentals governing the utility and evolution of vacancies, thereby opening new avenues for a variety of sustainable energy storage schemes.








Abstract
Transition metal oxide electrocatalysts (TMOEs) are poised to revive grid&#8208;scale all&#8208;vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) due to their low&#8208;cost and unique electronic properties, while often inescapably harboring surface vacancies. The role of local vacancy&#8208;induced physicochemical properties on vanadium&#8208;redox electrochemistry (VRE), encompassing kinetics, and stability, remains profoundly unveiled. Herein, for the first time, it is revealed that vacancies induce atomic&#8208;scale polarization in TMOEs and elucidate its mechanism in VRE. Attributable to local polarization, particularly by cation vacancy, the activated nearest&#8208;coordinated Mn sites prominently augment the adsorption competence of the V2+/V3+ couple and expedite its round&#8208;tripping by forming an intermediate *Mn&#8211;O&#8211;V bridge. It is also affirmed that the anion vacancies are vulnerable to microstructure reconfiguration by feeble hydroxyl adsorption and thus performance degradation over long&#8208;term cycling, in contrast to cation vacancies. Accordingly, the VRFB employing cation&#8208;vacancy&#8208;functionalized electrode delivers an energy efficiency of 80.8% and a reliable 1000&#8208;cycle lifespan with a negligible decay of 0.57% per cycle at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outclassing others. The findings shed light on the fundamental rules governing the utility and evolution of vacancies in TMOEs, thereby moving a step closer toward their deployment in a wide range of sustainable energy storage schemes.

Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature operation or high&#8208;operation temperature (HOT) is essential for mid&#8208;wave infrared (MWIR) optoelectronics devices providing low&#8208;cost and compact systems for numerous applications. Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) have emerged as a rising candidate to enable photodetectors to operate at HOT or room temperature and develop the next&#8208;generation infrared focal plane array (FPA) imagers. Here, band&#8208;engineered heterojunctions are demonstrated to suppress dark current with well&#8208;passivated mercury telluride (HgTe) CQDs enabling room&#8208;temperature MWIR imaging by single&#8208;pixel scanning and 640&#160;&#215;&#160;512 FPA sensitive thermal imaging above 250&#160;K. As a result, the room&#8208;temperature detectivity reaches as high as 1.26&#160;&#215;&#160;1010 Jones, and the noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) is as good as 25&#160;mK up to 200&#160;K.

         <title>Spray&#8208;Assisted Fabrication of Cellulose Photonic Pigments on Superhydrophobic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to directly produce structurally colored microparticles by drying cholesteric cellulose nanocrystal microdroplets on a superhydrophobic surface is reported. This approach has several key advantages that can unlock large&#8208;scale fabrication of sustainable photonic pigments, including exploiting existing industrial techniques (e.g. aerosolization), reduction in chemicals required (e.g. surfactants), rapid production times (&#8776;40 min or less), and size&#8208;independent and robust color.









Abstract
Photonic pigments, especially those based on naturally&#8208;derived building blocks like cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), are emerging as a promising sustainable alternative to absorption&#8208;based colorants. However, the proposed manufacturing methods for CNC pigments, via either grinding films or emulsion&#8208;based production, usually require several processing steps. This limits their commercialization by increasing the costs, timescales, and environmental impacts of production. Toward addressing these challenges, it is reported that photonic pigments can be produced in a single process by drying microdroplets of aqueous CNC suspension on a superhydrophobic surface. Such liquid&#8208;repellent substrate ensures the microdroplets maintain a near&#8208;spherical shape, enabling the radial self&#8208;organization of the cholesteric phase. Upon drying under ambient conditions, the CNC mesophase becomes kinetically arrested, after which the strong capillary forces induced by water evaporation result in extensive buckling of the microparticle. This buckling, coupled with prior tuning of the CNC formulation, enables photonic pigments with adjustable color across the visible spectrum. Importantly, the elimination of an emulsifying oil phase to create microdroplets enables a much faster drying time (&#8776;40 min) and improved color stability (e.g., polar solvents, elevated temperatures), while the reduction in reagents (e.g., oils, surfactants) and post&#8208;processing steps (e.g., solvent, heat) improves the sustainability of the fabrication process.

         <title>Mesenchymal Stem Cells With Polydopamine&#8208;Coated NaGdF4 Nanoparticles with Ca2+ Chelation Ability for Ischemic Stroke Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NaGdF4@PDA&#8208;ALD nanoparticles (NPANs) protect mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from ischemic stroke by neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and chelating excess Ca2+. This dual action stabilizes Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, reduces oxidative stress, and prevents ROS&#8208;Ca2+ overload cycles, enhancing MSC survival and functionality, and ultimately improving stroke therapy outcomes.









Abstract
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation is a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke. However, the survival of transplanted MSCs is often compromised by the excessive levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium ions (Ca2+) in the ischemic microenvironment following blood flow occlusion. In this study, a protective strategy is developed using functional nanomaterials to escort and shield MSCs. Specifically, NaGdF4@PDA&#8208;ALD nanoparticles (NPANs) are synthesized, featuring a NaGdF4 core coated with polydopamine (PDA) for ROS scavenging and further modified with alendronate sodium (ALD) for Ca2+ chelation. The internalization of NPANs by MSCs protected them from oxidative damage and calcium overload, thereby promoting their viability and functionality. Furthermore, NaGdF4 generated T1 signal enhancement, enabling in vivo tracking of MSCs via magnetic resonance imaging. The NPANs&#8208;treated MSCs demonstrated improved survival and migration to the ischemic region, promoting blood flow restoration and angiogenesis. These findings confirm the feasibility of employing functional nanoparticles to augment MSCs&#8208;based therapies, offering a promising strategy to improve their therapeutic efficacy in ischemic stroke treatment.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Polarized Photoresponse in Organic Single&#8208;Crystal Phototransistors for Bionic Night&#8208;Time Polarization Perception</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;adaptive polarization&#8208;sensitive organic phototransistor (POL&#8208;OPT) based on highly anisotropic organic crystals is developed for bionic night&#8208;time polarization perception. Ultrahigh dichroic ratio (DR) of &gt;105 is achieved through time accumulation under ultraweak light of 200 nW&#160;cm&#8722;2. High&#8208;contrast polarization imaging is realized in artificial moonlit environment with a low degree of linear polarization (DoLP) of 0.26, reaching the detection threshold of night&#8208;active dung beetles.








Abstract
The emerging semiconductor micro/nanocrystals with intrinsic anisotropy have provided new perspectives for low&#8208;cost and simplified polarimetry. However, the low polarization sensitivity of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polarimeters based on anisotropic semiconductors under weak and partially polarized light severely hinders their practical application in complex dim environments. Here, a photo&#8208;adaptive polarization&#8208;sensitive organic phototransistor (POL&#8208;OPT) is demonstrated for bionic weak&#8208;light polarization perception. The combination of highly anisotropic organic crystals with charge&#8208;storage accumulative effect enables a self&#8208;adaptive polarized photoresponse of the phototransistor to imitate the bionic scotopic adaptation process. Consequently, an ultrahigh dichroic ratio (DR) of over 105 is achieved through time accumulation under an ultraweak light intensity of 200 nW cm&#8722;2, which is among the highest in polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors. Furthermore, POL&#8208;OPT array is constructed for effective polarization perception in an artificial moonlit environment with a low degree of linear polarization (DoLP) down to 0.26, reaching the detection threshold of night&#8208;active dung beetles. This study offers a new opportunity for the development of new&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance polarimeters for polarization imaging, bionic navigation, and artificial visual systems.

         <title>Efficient Spin&#8208;Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes With Tunable Red to Near&#8208;Infrared Emission at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of chiral quasi&#8208;2D perovskites are reported with efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in films and circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) in spin&#8208;LEDs in the red to near&#8208;infrared spectrum region. Spectroscopic studies show that the CPL and CPEL originate from an energy and spin funnel process in the chiral quasi&#8208;2D perovskites.








Abstract
Spin light&#8208;emitting diodes (spin&#8208;LEDs) are important for spin&#8208;based electronic circuits as they convert the carrier spin information to optical polarization. Recently, chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) has emerged as a new paradigm to enable spin&#8208;LED as it does not require any magnetic components and operates at room temperature. However, CISS&#8208;enabled spin&#8208;LED with tunable wavelengths ranging from red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) has yet to be demonstrated. Here, chiral quasi&#8208;2D perovskites are developed to fabricate efficient spin&#8208;LEDs with tunable wavelengths from red to NIR region by tuning the halide composition. The optimized chiral perovskite films exhibit efficient circularly polarized luminescence from 675 to 788&#160;nm, with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) exceeding 86% and a dissymmetry factor (glum) ranging from 8.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3 to 2.6 &#215; 10&#8722;2. More importantly, direct circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) is achieved at room temperature in spin&#8208;LEDs. This work demonstrated efficient red and NIR spin&#8208;LEDs with the highest external quantum efficiency (EQE) reaching 12.4% and the electroluminescence (EL) dissymmetry factors (gEL) ranging from 3.7 &#215; 10&#8722;3 to 1.48 &#215; 10&#8722;2 at room temperature. The composition&#8208;dependent CPEL performance is further attributed to the prolonged spin lifetime as revealed by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy.

         <title>Constructing Pillar&#8208;Layered Covalent Organic Frameworks via Metal&#8211;Ligand Coordination for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D Pillar&#8208;layered COFs (PL&#8208;COFs) with adjustable interlayer spacing, enhanced crystallinity, and increased porosity are designed and constructed using a pillaring strategy via metal&#8208;ligand coordination, which demonstrates significantly improved electrochemical activity and selectivity for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion compared to their 2D layered COF counterparts.








Abstract
Growing global concerns over energy security and climate change have intensified efforts to develop sustainable strategies for electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2RR). Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising electrocatalysts for eCO2RR due to their tunable structures, high surface areas, and abundance of active sites. However, the performance of 2D COFs is often limited by layer stacking, which restricts active site exposure and reduces selectivity. To overcome these challenges, a new class of COFs known as pillar&#8208;layered COFs (PL&#8208;COFs) is developed featuring adjustable interlayer spacing and a 3D architecture. Characterization using PXRD, TEM, XPS, and EIS confirmed the successful integration of pillar molecules, which leads to increased interlayer spacing, crystallinity, and porosity. These structural advancements result in significantly improved electrochemical activity and selectivity for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. Density functional theory simulations revealed that enhanced CO2 adsorption and CO desorption contribute to the outstanding performance of PL&#8208;COF&#8208;1, which boasts the largest interlayer spacing. This material achieved an impressive Faradaic efficiency of 91.3% and demonstrated a significant current density, outperforming both the original COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co and PL&#8208;COF&#8208;2. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the pillaring strategy in optimizing COF&#8208;based electrocatalysts, paving the way for next&#8208;generation materials for CO2 reduction and sustainable energy conversion.

         <title>Nonlinear Ion Dynamics Enable Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity of Electrochemical Ionic Synapses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlinear ion dynamics in electrochemical ionic synapses enable spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity (STDP) with low energy consumption and minimal variability. The approach supports diverse STDP forms and flexible learning rules across timescales from milliseconds to nanoseconds, enabling spiking neural network hardware with high throughput and adaptability while maintaining low energy consumption and high reliability.








Abstract
Programmable synaptic devices that can achieve timing&#8208;dependent weight updates are key components to implementing energy&#8208;efficient spiking neural networks (SNNs). Electrochemical ionic synapses (EIS) enable the programming of weight updates with very low energy consumption and low variability. Here, the strongly nonlinear kinetics of EIS, arising from nonlinear dynamics of ions and charge transfer reactions in solids, are leveraged to implement various forms of spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity (STDP). In particular, protons are used as the working ion. Different forms of the STDP function are deterministically predicted and emulated by a linear superposition of appropriately designed pre&#8208; and post&#8208;synaptic neuron signals. Heterogeneous STDP is also demonstrated within the array to capture different learning rules in the same system. STDP timescales are controllable, ranging from milliseconds to nanoseconds. The STDP resulting from EIS has lower variability than other hardware STDP implementations, due to the deterministic and uniform insertion of charge in the tunable channel material. The results indicate that the ion and charge transfer dynamics in EIS can enable bio&#8208;plausible synapses for SNN hardware with high energy efficiency, reliability, and throughput.

Here, the strongly nonlinear kinetics of EIS, arising from nonlinear dynamics of ions and charge transfer reactions in solids, are leveraged to implement various forms of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). In particular, protons are used as the working ion. Different forms of the STDP function are deterministically predicted and emulated by a linear superposition of appropriately designed pre- and post-synaptic neuron signals. Heterogeneous STDP is also demonstrated within the array to capture different learning rules in the same system. STDP timescales are controllable, ranging from milliseconds to nanoseconds. The STDP resulting from EIS has lower variability than other hardware STDP implementations, due to the deterministic and uniform insertion of charge in the tunable channel material. The results indicate that the ion and charge transfer dynamics in EIS can enable bio-plausible synapses for SNN hardware with high energy efficiency, reliability, and throughput.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Printed Devices to Vertically Stacked, 3D Flexible Hybrid Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Printed electronics, with their extensive versatility, resource efficiency, and fast&#8208;prototyping capabilities, offer an attractive alternative to Si&#8208;based CMOS technology. This paper reviews the recent advances in printed electronics, highlighting emerging printing technologies that could lead to high performance, as well as attributes such as resource efficiency, environmental impact, integration scale, and vertical stack leading to 3D integration.








Abstract
The pursuit of miniaturized Si electronics has revolutionized computing and communication. During recent years, the value addition in electronics has also been achieved through printing, flexible and stretchable electronics form factors, and integration over areas larger than wafer size. Unlike Si semiconductor manufacturing which takes months from tape&#8208;out to wafer production, printed electronics offers greater flexibility and fast&#8208;prototyping capabilities with lesser resources and waste generation. While significant advances have been made with various types of printed sensors and other passive devices, printed circuits still lag behind Si&#8208;based electronics in terms of performance, integration density, and functionality. In this regard, recent advances using high&#8208;resolution printing coupled with the use of high mobility materials and device engineering, for both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane integration, raise hopes. This paper focuses on the progress in printed electronics, highlighting emerging printing technologies and related aspects such as resource efficiency, environmental impact, integration scale, and the novel functionalities enabled by vertical integration of printed electronics. By highlighting these advances, this paper intends to reveal the future promise of printed electronics as a sustainable and resource&#8208;efficient route for realizing high&#8208;performance integrated circuits and systems.

         <title>Aggregate Science: from Molecules, beyond Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research of AIE elucidates that the structure&#8211;property relationships at the single molecular level are not always idoneous when expanded to an aggregate state. Aggregate science, from a philosophical viewpoint, emphasizes a holistic approach to explore such relationships, underlining it comes from molecules but beyond molecules.








Abstract
Over the past centuries, molecular science has played a dominant role in the advancement of physical science by exploring the structure&#8211;property relationships at a single molecular level. However, when molecules form aggregates, a dilemma arises as the structures and properties often differ significantly from those of molecular constituents. To address this, the concept of aggregate science emphasizes a holistic approach to understanding the structures&#8211;properties relationship of substances. Despite the recognition of holism in aggregate research, there are still challenges in investigating the complex operations and interplays, particularly in understanding the newly emergent structures and properties in the macroscopic world. Therefore, there is a need to further advance the concept and methodology. In this regard, this perspective highlights three types of influences that aggregation exerts on substance properties: activation, transformation, and emergence. Furthermore, examples from aggregation&#8208;induced emission research and related fields are provided to illustrate how aggregate science can be studied. This perspective emphasizes that the molecule is of significance and the structures and properties are also dramatically influenced by aggregation. Additionally, potential research methodologies, such as focusing on intra&#8208; and intermolecular interactions, adjusting aggregates morphology, and regulating the constituents, along with directions, and implications are offered for future studies.

         <title>Engineering Semiconducting Polymeric Nanoagonists Potentiate cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway Activation and Elicit Long Term Memory Against Recurrence in Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>

In this study, a comprehensive strategy is adopted that integrates innate immune responses with tumor&#8208;targeting PTT to simultaneously tackle multiple immune&#8208;suppressive mechanisms in breast cancer. The modulation of the TME is confirmed through the PTT&#8208;mediated ICD and the transactivation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway in immune cells (macrophages and DCs) of the TME due to the released dsDNA via ICD.








Abstract
Triple&#8208;negative breast cancer has an immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; microenvironment, which leads to resistance to current immunotherapy. The activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway has been thought a promising strategy to enhance immunotherapy efficacy. In this study, we adopted a comprehensive strategy that integrates innate immune responses with tumor&#8208;targeting photothermal therapy (PTT) to simultaneously tackle multiple immune&#8208;suppressive mechanisms in breast cancer. This semiconducting polymeric nanoagonists (DPTT&#8208;Mn Lipo NPs) mediated PTT can effectively initiate tumor cell apoptosis and induce ICD, thereby reprogramming the immunosuppressive TME and activating STING. We confirmed the modulation of the TME through the PTT&#8208;mediated ICD effect and the transactivation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway in immune cells of the TME due to the released dsDNA via ICD, such as macrophages and DCs. Indeed, DPTT&#8208;Mn Lipo NPs&#8208;mediated PTT promoted M1 polarization of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages, augmented T&#8208;cell infiltration, facilitated dendritic cell (DC) maturation, and regulated type I interferon factor secretion, leading to efficient tumor suppression. Most importantly, the combination of DPTT&#8208;Mn Lipo NPs&#8208;based PTT with a checkpoint blockade therapy (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1) can elicit long&#8208;term immune memory besides tumor eradication. Collectively, this nano&#8208;system can systemically activate antitumor immunity through STING activation and potentially establish long&#8208;term memory against tumor recurrence.

         <title>Organic Ink Multi&#8208;Material 3D Printing of Sustainable Soft Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel organic ink based on egg albumen and saccharides is developed to support gelatin&#8208;based hydrogel inks within a multi&#8208;material printing process. Triggered dissolution enables the removal of support structures in order to create internal cavities. This allows the printing of biodegradable, joint&#8208;like vacuum actuators with a 60&#176; maximum bending angle at 0.23 s response time, suitable for soft robotic devices.








Abstract
Drawing inspiration from nature, soft materials are at the core of a transformation toward adaptive and responsive engineered systems, capable of conquering demanding terrain and safe when interacting with biological life. Despite recent advances in 3D printing of soft materials, researchers are still far from being able to print complex soft systems where a multitude of different components need to work together symbiotically. Closing this gap necessitates a platform that unites diverse materials into one synergetic process. Here, a multi&#8208;material printing system is presented, combining gelatin&#8208;based hydrogels with a new biodegradable support material. This organic ink maintains up to 60&#176; overhang and is printable over gaps to structurally support the main biogel body, while triggered dissolution enables its selective removal and the formation of internal cavities. Therefore, the creation of vascular networks, tunable scaffolds, and embedded sensors within a single printing process becomes feasible. Furthermore, a perforation&#8208;resistant, joint&#8208;like vacuum actuator (VAc) is designed and 3D printed, capable of bending to angles up to 60&#176; at fast response times down to 0.23 s. Combining these approaches in an efficient, streamlined fabrication process with biodegradable materials will unlock new sustainability dimensions for complex and durable soft systems.

         <title>Oxychloride Polyanion Clustered Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes via Hydrate&#8208;Assisted Synthesis for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brand&#8208;new synthesis route for oxychloride SSEs that entails a hydrate&#8208;assisted strategy, based on the chemical reaction among LiCl, AlCl3, and AlCl3&#183;6H2O at low temperatures is proposed. In addition to showing kilogram&#8208;scale production capability, this synthesis route also applies to other oxychloride SSEs by simple substitution of ZrCl4, TaCl5, etc for AlCl3.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) play a vital role in the development of high&#8208;energy all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. However, most adopted mechanical ball milling and/or high&#8208;temperature annealing are ineffective approaches for large&#8208;scale synthesis. Herein, a universal and scalable hydrate&#8208;assisted strategy for the synthesis of oxychloride SSEs is developed based on the chemical reaction among alkali chlorides, AlCl3, and AlCl3&#183;6H2O.

The potential applications for this synthesis technique are further demonstrated by kilogram&#8208;scale reactions and synthesis of other oxychloride SSEs including zirconium&#8208;based and tantalum&#8208;based analogs. These findings not only provide a new simple, scalable, and energy&#8208;efficient synthesis route for oxychloride SSEs but also further promote their application in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

&lt;p&gt;A brand-new synthesis route for oxychloride SSEs that entails a hydrate-assisted strategy, based on the chemical reaction among LiCl, AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O at low temperatures is proposed. In addition to showing kilogram-scale production capability, this synthesis route also applies to other oxychloride SSEs by simple substitution of ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, TaCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, etc for AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) play a vital role in the development of high-energy all-solid-state batteries. However, most adopted mechanical ball milling and/or high-temperature annealing are ineffective approaches for large-scale synthesis. Herein, a universal and scalable hydrate-assisted strategy for the synthesis of oxychloride SSEs is developed based on the chemical reaction among alkali chlorides, AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The synthesized aluminum-based oxychloride SSEs possess a high Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity over 1&#160;mS&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 30&#160;&#176;C. The final aluminum-based oxychloride SSEs are structurally heterogeneous with nm-sized LiCl-like and LiAlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; crystallites and large amounts of amorphous [Al&lt;i&gt;

   &lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;(2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;)&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; components. Faster local mobility of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in amorphous structures is verified and is attributable to weakened Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-X&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; interactions ensured by the [Al&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Cl&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;(2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;)&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; polyanions. The potential applications for this synthesis technique are further demonstrated by kilogram-scale reactions and synthesis of other oxychloride SSEs including zirconium-based and tantalum-based analogs.

         <title>Ultraflexible Vertical Corbino Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Epidermal Signal Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultraflexible vertical Corbino organic electrochemical transistors with a novel 4&#8208;terminal design are successfully developed on a 1&#8208;&#181;m&#8208;thick parylene film. This ultraflexible device with high transconductance successfully detects epidermal bio&#8208;signals such as ECG, EMG, and EOG at a low voltage of 10 mV.








Abstract
Skin&#8208;conformal organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have attracted significant attention for real&#8208;time physiological signal monitoring and are vital for health diagnostics and treatments. However, mechanical harmonization amid the inherent dynamic nature of the skin surface and the acquisition of intrinsic physiological signals are significant challenges that hinder the integration of the ultimate skin interface. Thus, this study proposes a novel 4&#8208;terminal (4&#8208;T) vertical Corbino OECT, exhibiting high transconductance (&gt;400 mS) and offering remarkable resilience and operational stability at an extremely low voltage of 10&#160;mV (1.9% of minimal current change after 104 biasing cycles and endurance up to 103 cycles of repetitive deformation with a 5&#160;&#181;m bending radius). Consequently, ultralow&#8208;power, motion&#8208;resistant epidermal electrocardiogram, electromyogram, and electrooculogram sensors are developed with an exceptional signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of 40.1&#160;dB. The results of this study present a significant stride in non&#8208;invasive, skin&#8208;interfaced health&#8208;monitoring technologies and herald a new era in integrative health technologies.

         <title>Harnessing Defects in SnSe Film via Photo&#8208;Induced Doping for Fully Light&#8208;Controlled Artificial Synapse</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully light&#8208;controlled artificial synapse is fabricated based on the nonvolatile bidirectional photoresponse of SnSe films by PLD. The origin of negative persistent photoconductivity behavior with wavelength selectivity is systematically investigated by experiments and DFT calculations. The device is capable of mimicking various synaptic functions, recognizing handwritten digital and face images and simulating some biological behaviors of humans and anemonefish.








Abstract
2D&#8208;layered materials are recognized as up&#8208;and&#8208;coming candidates to overcome the intrinsic physical limitation of silicon&#8208;based devices. Herein, the coexistence of positive persistent photoconductivity (PPPC) and negative persistent photoconductivity (NPPC) in SnSe thin films prepared by pulsed laser deposition provides an excellent avenue for engineering novel devices. It is determined that surface oxygen is co&#8208;regulated by physisorption and chemisorption, and the NPPC is attributed to the photo&#8208;controllable oxygen desorption behavior. The dominant behavior of chemisorption induces high stability, while physisorption provides room for adjusting NPPC. A simple fully light&#8208;modulated artificial synaptic device based on SnSe film is constructed to operate various synaptic plasticity and reversible modulation of conductance by applying 430 and 255&#160;nm illuminations. A three&#8208;layer artificial neural network structure with a high accuracy of 95.33% to recognize handwritten digital images is implemented based on the device. Furthermore, the pressure&#8208;related cognition response of humans while climbing and the foraging and recognition behaviors of anemonefish are mimicked. This work demonstrates the potential of 2D&#8208;layered materials for developing neuromorphic computing and simulating biological behaviors without additional treatment. Furthermore, the one&#8208;step method for preparation is highly adaptable and expected to realize large&#8208;area growth and integration of SnSe&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Lab&#8208;on&#8208;Fiber Operando Deciphering of a MOF Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An entirely new concept of a lab&#8208;on&#8208;fiber operando method and its feasibility for deciphering reaction pathways of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) electrocatalysts are demonstrated. The developed method leverages the subtle refractive index (RI) evolution (both real and imaginary parts) of MOFs during electrocatalysis, enabling the tracking of self&#8208;reconstruction dynamics as well as the identification of underlying reactive intermediates.








Abstract
Despite the great success in deploying metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as efficient electrocatalysts, the low adoption of operando methods hinders the understanding of underlying mechanism. By leveraging the subtle refractive index evolution, including both the real and the imaginary parts, an entirely new concept of a lab&#8208;on&#8208;fiber operando method and its feasibility for &#8220;pristine&#8208;immersion&#8208;operando&#8208;post analysis&#8221; of electrocatalyts are demonstrated. Concurrent collection of absorption spectra and surface plasmon resonance is achieved by engineering fiber&#8208;optic waveguides&#160;to simultaneously induce guided light attenuation and plasmonic coupling. In situ&#8208;formed Co hydroxide and oxide reactive intermediates in zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) electrocatalyst are optically identified, which&#160;shows its underlying self&#8208;reconstruction conversions at different stages during electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reactions, and address the gap in knowledge concerning whether ZIF&#8208;67 is a precatalyst for real catalyst production. This illuminating operando method offers intriguing opportunities to collect all the observables in a single fiber, provides an exciting potential of a new class of device with long&#8208;sought integration and miniaturization capability, and is expected to enable the electrocatalysis community to conquer challenges with conducting multimodal operando experiments outside the laboratory.

A spatiotemporally&#8208;resolved 3D chiral color modulation method is proposed, utilizing diffusion&#8208;driven asymmetric lattice deformation in dual&#8208;chiral polymer&#8208;templated blue phases.

Abstract
Blue phase liquid crystals (BPLCs) have exhibited promising applications in 3D flexible displays due to their molecular&#8208;level self&#8208;assembled chiral structures, fast response, and tunable polarized colors. However, there remain challenges for spatiotemporal programming of 3D chiral color units for BPLC dynamic patterning. Herein, the programmable temporal evolution of micrometer&#8208;scale color units and spatial configuration switch of chiral modes are achieved by spontaneous ink diffusion&#8208;driven asymmetric lattice deformation in dual&#8208;chiral polymer&#8208;templated blue phases. Custom&#8208;printed colorful patterns are designed by machine learning&#8208;assisted parameter optimization, which displays programmable multidimensional encrypted information that incorporates temporal evolving colors (wavelength), spatial distribution (depth), chiral modes (L/R). The quantitative relationship between ink diffusion kinetics and blue&#8208;phase dynamic 3D structural optics is established by in situ characterization, finite element analysis, and mathematical geometry modeling. This work provides insights into the microgeometric manipulation of 3D chiral color of BPLCs in the application of information security and self&#8208;adaptive indicators.

         <title>Biomimetic Chlorosomes: Oxygen&#8208;Independent Photocatalytic Nanoreactors for Efficient Combination Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorosome&#8208;mimetic nanoreactors (Ru&#8208;Chlos) are created by the confined aggregation of photosensitive ruthenium&#8208;polypyridyl&#8208;silane monomers, which exhibit superior photocatalytic ability under acidic conditions without consuming oxygen. The photocatalytic activity of Ru&#8208;Chlos is impeded by the light&#8208;responsive disassembly of Ru&#8208;bridged matrix. Ru&#8208;Chlos&#8208;based combined therapy evokes strong immunogenic cell death effects and advances of efficient and safe light&#8208;controllable cancer photoimmunotherapy.








Abstract
Photocatalytic therapy for hypoxic tumors often suffers from inefficiencies due to its dependence on oxygen and the risk of uncontrolled activation. Inspired by the oxygen&#8208;independent and precisely regulated photocatalytic functions of natural light&#8208;harvesting chlorosomes, chlorosome&#8208;mimetic nanoreactors, termed Ru&#8208;Chlos, are engineered by confining the aggregation of photosensitive ruthenium&#8208;polypyridyl&#8208;silane monomers. These Ru&#8208;Chlos exhibit markedly enhanced photocatalytic performance compared to their monomeric counterparts under acidic conditions, while notably bypassing the consumption of oxygen or hydrogen peroxide. The photocatalytic activity of Ru&#8208;Chlos is finely tunable through light&#8208;responsive disassembly of the Ru&#8208;bridged matrix, with tunability governed by pre&#8208;irradiation duration. Utilization of Ru&#8208;Chlos loading prodrug [2,2&#8242;&#8208;azino&#8208;bis(3&#8208;ethylbenzothiazoline&#8208;6&#8208;sulfonic acid)] (ABTS) for phototherapy facilitates the generation of toxic radicals (oxABTS) and the photocatalytic conversion of endogenous NADH to NAD+, inducing oxidative stress in hypoxic cancer cells. Simultaneously, the light&#8208;responsive degradation of Ru&#8208;Chlos produces Ru&#8208;based toxins that further contribute to the therapeutic effect. This dual&#8208;action mechanism elicits potent immunogenic cell death effects and significantly enhances antitumor efficacy with the aid of a PD&#8208;l blockade. These biomimetic chlorosomes highlight their potential to advance oxygen&#8208;independent photocatalytic nanoreactors with controlled activity for novel cancer photoimmunotherapy strategies.

         <title>Reversible Anion&#8208;Cation Relay&#8208;Intercalation in a T&#8208;MnO2 Cathode to Boost the Efficiency of Aqueous Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The t&#8208;MnO2 cathode with an Mg&#8208;ion stabilized 3&#160;&#215;&#160;3 large&#8208;tunnel structure can withstand large structural deformation during the reversible anion&#8211;cation (SO42&#8722;&#8211;Zn2+/H+) intercalation. The SO42&#8722; and Zn2+&#8208;based aqueous dual&#8208;ion battery system delivered a high reversible capacity of 398 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 with an output voltage of &#8776;1.41 V and more than 1200 cycles at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Benefiting from the merits of intrinsic safety, high power density, environmental friendliness, and high&#8208;output voltage, aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries (ADIBs) have shown broad potential applications in future grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, since the ADIBs require the cathodes to undergo the intercalation reactions through different local structures and mechanisms, causing large structural deformation and cathode failure, their reversible cation&#8208;anion intercalation in the cathode remains a major challenge. To address this issue, based on a reasonable selection and theoretical simulation, this work finds that Todorokite manganese dioxide (t&#8208;MnO2) cathode with a metal&#8208;ion stabilized 3&#160;&#215;&#160;3 large&#8208;tunnel structure should be suitable for cation&#8208;anion intercalation of ADIBs. The comprehensive characterizations confirm that the unique tunnel structure of the t&#8208;MnO2 cathode can withstand large structural deformation during the sulfate radical anion&#8211; zinc/proton cation (SO42&#8722;&#8211;Zn2+/H+) intercalation. Due to the intercalation of SO42&#8722;, the ADIB delivered a high reversible capacity of 398&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 with an output voltage of &#8776;1.41 V, which is much higher than the theoretical capacity (308&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) of Zn&#8208;MnO2 based Zinc&#8208;ion batteries. This work provides the design principles for ADIBs cathode materials and demonstrates that t&#8208;MnO2 can be a promising cathode material for high&#8208;performance ADIBs.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Layer Metallization of Plasmonic Semiconductor Surface for Selectively Enhancing IR&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 into CH4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer metallization strategy is proposed and representatively implemented by grafting Sn2+ ions onto exposed O atoms on the surface of a plasmonic W18O49 nanowire array (NWA). This strategy can enhance both plasmonic absorption and CO2 adsorption, therefore resulting in over 98% selective infrared (IR)&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to CH4 with a &#8776;9.0&#8208;fold higher activity compared to bare W18O49 NWA.








Abstract
Efficient harvesting and utilization of abundant infrared (IR) photons from sunlight is crucial for the industrial application of photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Plasmonic semiconductors have significant potential in absorbing low&#8208;energy IR photons to generate energetic hot electrons. However, modulating these hot electrons to selectively enhance the activity of CO2 reduction into CH4 remains a challenge. Herein, the study proposes a single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer (SAL) metallization strategy to enhance the generation of IR&#8208;driven hot electrons and facilitate their transfer from plasmonic semiconductors to CO2 for producing CH4. This strategy is demonstrated using a paradigmatic W18O49@W&#8208;Sn nanowire array (NWA), where Sn2+ ions are grafted onto exposed O atoms on the surface of plasmonic W18O49 to form a surface W&#8208;Sn SAL. The incorporation of Sn single atoms enhances plasmonic absorption in IR light for W18O49 NWA. The W&#8208;Sn SAL not only promotes CO2 adsorption and reduces its reaction activation energy barrier but also shifts the endoergic CO&#8208;protonation process toward an exoergic reaction pathway. Thus, the W18O49@W&#8208;Sn NWA exhibits &gt;98% selectivity for IR&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to CH4 with an activity over 9.0 times higher than that of bare W18O49 NWA. This SAL metallization strategy can also be applied to other plasmonic semiconductors for selectively enhancing CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 reduction reactions.

This SAL metallization strategy can also be applied to other plasmonic semiconductors for selectively enhancing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Joule&#8208;Heated Interfacial Catalysis for Advanced Electrified Esterification with High Conversion and Energy Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The COF&#9472;SO3H@CF catalyst, with abundant acid sites, is employed to construct an advanced electrified esterification system (JIC. This system ingeniously combines interfacial catalysis with Joule&#8208;heated evaporation technique, enabling efficient in situ separation of products at the catalytic interface through Joule heating. Simultaneously, it sustains a high reactant concentration, significantly enhancing the forward progression of the esterification reaction.








Abstract
Esterification reactions are crucial in industries such as chemicals, fragrances, and pharmaceuticals but often face limitations due to high reversibility and low reactivity, leading to restricted yields. In this work, an electrified esterification pathway utilizing a Joule&#8208;heated interfacial catalysis (JIC) system is proposed, where a hydrophilic, sulfonic acid&#8208;functionalized covalent organic framework grown on carbon felt (COF&#9472;SO3H@CF) acts as the interfacial catalyst, and the carbon felt serves as the electric heat source. This approach achieves an acetic acid conversion of 80.5% at a heating power density of 0.49&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;3, without additional reagents by vaporizing reaction products, surpassing the theoretical equilibrium limit of 62.5% by 1.29 times. Comprehensive analysis indicates that the intimate contact between the electric heat source and the COF&#9472;SO3H catalyst enables efficient, localized Joule heating directly at catalytic sites, minimizing thermal losses and allowing precise control over reaction interfaces. This finding demonstrates that this JIC system not only enhances esterification efficiency but may also offer a sustainable, energy&#8208;efficient pathway for high&#8208;yield chemical processes.

         <title>Vertical&#8208;Structure Overcomes the Strain Limit of Stretchable Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces vertical, intrinsically stretchable organic electrochemical transistors (VIS&#8208;OECTs), which overcome the strain limitation of intrinsically stretchable semiconductors through 3D structure engineering. The VIS&#8208;OECTs exhibit enhanced stretchability (50% strain) compared to the reference planar&#8208;structured IS&#8208;OECTs (20% strain) and show over a hundredfold improvement in transconductance.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic electrochemical transistors (IS&#8208;OECTs), utilizing organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) as their channel materials, have drawn great attention recently because of their potential to enable seamless integration between bioelectronic devices and living systems. However, the fabrication of IS&#8208;OECTs presents challenges due to the limited availability of OMIEC materials that possess the desired combination of mechanical and electrical properties. In this work, 1) we report the first successful fabrication of a vertical intrinsically stretchable OECT (VIS&#8208;OECT), achieved by using elastoadhesive electrodes; 2) we experimentally proved&#160;that vertical architecture can push the strain limit of an IS&#8208;OECT from 20% to 50%; and 3) the above finding introduces an unconventional design concept: the strain limit of an IS&#8208;OECT can surpass the intrinsic stretchability of the constituent OMIECs by employing vertical structure.

         <title>Local Proton&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of a High&#8208;Entropy Borate Library</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high local protons&#8208;mediated room&#8208;temperature solution method is developed to synthesize a new type of high entropy borates nanosheets with arbitrary metal component numbers from 5 to 12 up to 3302 kinds in total within 1&#160;min.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy compounds (HECs) provide extensive possibilities for exploring distinctive properties and potential applications. However, most HECs reported so far are synthesized by an arduous high&#8208;temperature treatment and special equipment, which is clearly not scalable for practical application. Here a scalable room&#8208;temperature solution synthetic strategy is reported for a library of high&#8208;entropy borates with arbitrary metal component numbers from 5 to 12 up to 3302 kinds in total and more than a hundred grams per operation within one minute. In conjunction with theoretical and in situ investigations, it is uncovered that the highly local concentration of protons at ethanol/aqueous interface is favorable to the creation of a stable thermodynamic microenvironment and a desirable kinetic miscibility reservoir, thus enabling a formation of single&#8208;phase borates. With the FeCoNiMoCu high&#8208;entropy borate, it is further shows that it functions as a highly active catalyst for catalytic oxygen evolution reaction. The work opens up opportunities for the scalable synthesis of HECs for energy storage and conversion applications.

         <title>Optimizing the Electrical Microenvironment Provided by 3D Micropillar Topography on a Piezoelectric BaTiO3 Substrate to Enhance Osseointegration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Illustration of a biomimetic 3D spatial electrical microenvironment created by patterning of micropillar arrays on a piezoelectric BaTiO3 (BTO) ceramic substrate to enhance bone defect repair. The micropillar arrays with a positive&#8208;charge distribution sustainably maintained a 3D spatial electric microenvironment, which facilitated rapid osseointegration and the formation of a mature bone structure.








Abstract
The electrical properties of bone implant scaffolds are a pivotal factor in regulating cellular behavior and promoting osteogenesis. The previous study shows that built&#8208;in electric fields established between electropositive nanofilms and electronegative bone defect walls are beneficial for promoting bone defect healing. Considering that the physiological electrical microenvironment is spatially distributed in 3D, it is imperative to establish a 3D spatial charged microenvironment on bone scaffolds to optimize the efficacy of osseointegration. Nevertheless, this still poses a formidable challenge. Here, a bone repair strategy that utilizes micro&#8208;scale 3D topography is developed on a piezoelectric BaTiO3 (BTO) substrate to provide 3D spatial electrical stimulation. The BTO micropillar arrays, especially with a height of 50 &#181;m and positive&#8208;charge distribution (50 &#181;m positive), promote the spreading, cytoskeletal reorganization, focal adhesion maturation, and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). They enhanced the clustering of mechanosensing integrin &#945;5 in BMSCs. The biomimetic 3D spatial electrical microenvironment accelerated bone repair and osseointegration in a rat femoral diaphysis defect repair model. The study thus reveals that implants with a 3D spatial electrical microenvironment can significantly enhance osseointegration, thereby providing a new strategy to optimize the performance of electroactive biomaterials for tissue regenerative therapies.

         <title>Ultrafast Symmetry Control in Photoexcited Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead sulfide quantum dots undergo reversible symmetry changes upon photoexcitation. This process is driven by photogenerated charge carriers, which transitions ground state lower symmetry quantum dots into an excited state higher symmetry phase for about 100 ps. Light&#8208;induced symmetry manipulation offers new ways to control electronic, quantum, photonic and catalytic properties of quantum dots on ultrafast timescales. 








Abstract
Symmetry control is essential for realizing unconventional properties, such as ferroelectricity, nonlinear optical responses, and complex topological order, thus it holds promise for the design of emerging quantum and photonic systems.

&lt;p&gt;Lead sulfide quantum dots undergo reversible symmetry changes upon photoexcitation. This process is driven by photogenerated charge carriers, which transitions ground state lower symmetry quantum dots into an excited state higher symmetry phase for about 100 ps. Light-induced symmetry manipulation offers new ways to control electronic, quantum, photonic and catalytic properties of quantum dots on ultrafast timescales. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symmetry control is essential for realizing unconventional properties, such as ferroelectricity, nonlinear optical responses, and complex topological order, thus it holds promise for the design of emerging quantum and photonic systems. Nevertheless, fast and reversible control of symmetry in materials remains a challenge, especially for nanoscale systems. Here, reversible symmetry changes are unveiled in colloidal lead chalcogenide quantum dots on picosecond timescales. Using a combination of ultrafast electron diffraction and total X-ray scattering, in conjunction with atomic-scale structural modeling and first-principles calculations, it is revealed that symmetry-broken lead sulfide quantum dots restore to a centrosymmetric phase upon photoexcitation. The symmetry restoration is driven by photoexcited electronic carriers, which suppress lead off-centering for about 100&#160;ps. Furthermore, the change in symmetry is closely correlated with the electronic properties, and the bandgap transiently red-shifts in the symmetry-restored quantum dots. Overall, this study elucidates reversible symmetry changes in colloidal quantum dots, and more broadly defines a new methodology to optically control symmetry in nanoscale systems on ultrafast timescales.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Topological and Chemical Disorder in Pd Sites for Record&#8208;Breaking Formic Acid Electrocatalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel catalyst is constructed to regulate the geometric and electronic structure of palladium sites by topological and chemical disorder engineering. The deliberate design of palladium&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy amorphous alloys with porous frameworks (Net&#8208;Pd&#8208;HEAA) is successfully synthesized through thoughtful composition selection and precision experimental control, showcasing its outstanding efficacy as a formic acid oxidation reaction electrocatalyst.








Abstract
Designing palladium&#8208;based formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) catalysts to achieve significant breakthroughs in catalytic activity, pathway selectivity, and toxicity resistance is both urgent and challenging. Here, these challenges are addressed by pioneering a novel catalyst design that incorporates both topological and chemical disorder, developing a new class of PdCuLaYMnW high&#8208;entropy amorphous alloys with a porous network (Net&#8208;Pd&#8208;HEAA) as a highly active, selective, and stable FAOR electrocatalyst. This novel Net&#8208;Pd&#8208;HEAA demonstrates record&#8208;breaking FAOR performance, achieving the mass and specific activities of 5.94 A mgPd&#8722;1 and 8.94&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, surpassing all previously reported Pd&#8208;based catalysts and showing strong competitiveness against advanced Pt&#8208;based catalysts. Simulataneously, Net&#8208;Pd&#8208;HEAA exhibits extraordinary stability in accelerated durability tests (ADT) and chronoamperometry (CA) tests. Advanced characterization and in situ, spectral analysis reveal that the extremely disordered atomic structure effectively regulates the geometric and electronic structure of the Pd sites, enhancing active intermediate coverage, facilitating dehydrogenation pathway, and inhibiting the production/adsorption of CO. Furthermore, when employed as the anode catalyst in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), Net&#8208;Pd&#8208;HEAA only requires a potential of 1.28&#160;V to obtain a current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2, and operates stably in a highly corrosive electrolyte for over 100 h.

         <title>Ferroelectric Perovskite/MoS2 Channel Heterojunctions for Wide&#8208;Window Nonvolatile Memory and Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>

By integrating the family of 2D hybrid perovskite ferroelectric semiconductors into heterostructures channel field&#8208;effect transistors, the devices can achieve robust storage characteristics and intriguing carrier polarity modulation behavior, thereby holding promise for applications in medical diagnostics and beyond.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials commonly serve as gate insulators in typical field&#8208;effect transistors, where their polarization reversal enables effective modulation of the conductivity state of the channel material, thereby realizing non&#8208;volatile memory. Currently, novel 2D ferroelectrics unlock new prospects in next&#8208;generation electronics and neuromorphic computation. However, the advancement of these materials is impeded by limited selectivity and narrow memory windows. Here, new concepts of 2D ferroelectric perovskite/MoS2 channel heterostructures field&#8208;effect transistors are presented, in which 2D ferroelectric perovskite features customizable band structure, few&#8208;layered ferroelectricity, and submillimeter&#8208;size monolayer wafers. Further studies reveal that these devices exhibit unique charge polarity modulation (from n&#8208; to p&#8208;type channel) and remarkable nonvolatile memory behavior, especially record&#8208;wide hysteresis windows up to 177&#160;V, which enables efficient imitation of biological synapses and achieves high recognition accuracy for electrocardiogram patterns. This result provides a device paradigm for future nonvolatile memory and artificial synaptic applications.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptide Induced Superstructures Triggering Highly Efficient Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of efficient and biocompatible antibacterial system has already been established by a supramolecular strategy based on cell&#8208;penetrating peptide octa&#8208;arginine and anionic amphiphile sodium dodecyl sulfate. The formed lamellar superstructures can kill E. coli by typically disrupting the membrane, while they kill S. aureus through penetrating the membrane. The aggregates can accelerate the recovery of bacteria&#8208;infected wounds in the mice.








Abstract
To endow non&#8208;antibacterial molecules with highly efficient bactericide activity is an important but challenging issue. Herein, a kind of cell&#8208;penetrating peptide octa&#8208;arginine (R8) is found to be effective in activating antibacterial ability when assembling with anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), while individual R8 or SDS shows poor or no antibacterial ability. By combined electrostatic, hydrogen bond, and hydrophobic interactions, R8 and SDS associate into wormlike micelle and lamellar structure by forming supramolecular self&#8208;assembling units, depending on their charge ratio (CR). The lamellar aggregates show particularly high antibacterial activities against both Gram&#8208;negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Gram&#8208;positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Interestingly, E. coli and S. aureus are killed by membrane&#8208;disrupting and membrane&#8208;penetrating mechanisms, respectively. Furthermore, in vivo experiments evidence that the R8/SDS lamellar aggregates accelerate the recovery of bacteria&#8208;infected wounds, wherein the reduced inflammation and promoted angiogenesis are clearly presented. This study proves that highly efficient bactericidal activity is triggered by the synergistic action of penetrating peptide and anionic amphiphiles, thus providing a new strategy to realize highly efficient and targetable antibacterial application.

         <title>Two&#8208;Periodic MoS2&#8208;Type Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Intrinsic Intralayer Porosity for High&#8208;Capacity Water Sorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of mos&#8208;MOFs are successfully synthesized with the non&#8208;crystallographic (3,6)&#8208;connected molybdenum disulfide (mos) network featuring abundant intralayer voids, displaying impressive apparent BET surface areas. Highly porous and stable Cr&#8208;mos&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 demonstrates a high water vapor adsorption capacity. This approach can be extended to the rational design and synthesis of next&#8208;generation highly porous 2D&#8208;MOFs, or even 2D crystalline framework materials.



Abstract
2D metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D&#8208;MOFs) are an important class of functional porous materials. However, the low porosity and surface area of 2D&#8208;MOFs have greatly limited their functionalities and applications. Herein, the rational synthesis of a class of mos&#8208;MOFs with molybdenum disulfide (mos) net based on the assembly of trinuclear metal clusters and 3&#8208;connected tripodal organic ligands is reported. The non&#8208;crystallographic (3,6)&#8208;connected mos net, different from the 3&#8208;connected hcb net of graphene, offers abundant intralayer voids courtesy of the split of one node into two. Indeed, mos&#8208;MOFs exhibit high apparent Brunauer&#8208;Emmett&#8208;Teller surface areas, significantly superior to those of other 2D&#8208;MOF analogs. Markedly, hydrolytically stable Cr&#8208;mos&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 displays an impressive water vapor uptake of 0.75 g g&#8722;1 at 298 K and P/P0 = 0.9, among the highest in 2D&#8208;MOFs. The combined water adsorption and X&#8208;ray diffraction study reveal the water adsorption mechanisms, suggesting the importance of intralayer porosities of mos&#8208;MOFs for high&#8208;performance water capture. This study paves the way for a reliable approach to synthesizing 2D&#8208;MOFs with high porosity and surface areas for diverse applications.

Herein, the rational synthesis of a class of &lt;b&gt;mos&lt;/b&gt;-MOFs with molybdenum disulfide (&lt;b&gt;mos&lt;/b&gt;) net based on the assembly of trinuclear metal clusters and 3-connected tripodal organic ligands is reported. The non-crystallographic (3,6)-connected &lt;b&gt;mos&lt;/b&gt; net, different from the 3-connected &lt;b&gt;hcb&lt;/b&gt; net of graphene, offers abundant intralayer voids courtesy of the split of one node into two. Indeed, &lt;b&gt;mos&lt;/b&gt;-MOFs exhibit high apparent Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas, significantly superior to those of other 2D-MOF analogs. Markedly, hydrolytically stable Cr-&lt;b&gt;mos&lt;/b&gt;-MOF-1 displays an impressive water vapor uptake of 0.75 g g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 298 K and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.9, among the highest in 2D-MOFs. The combined water adsorption and X-ray diffraction study reveal the water adsorption mechanisms, suggesting the importance of intralayer porosities of &lt;b&gt;mos&lt;/b&gt;-MOFs for high-performance water capture. This study paves the way for a reliable approach to synthesizing 2D-MOFs with high porosity and surface areas for diverse applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Insights Into the Thermal Stability of High&#8208;Entropy Nanoalloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ transmission electron microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations are combined to investigate the thermal behavior of FCC AuCoCuNiPt nanoparticles from 298 to 973 K. The formation and melting of an AuCu layer at the surface of nanostructures are revealed at high temperatures, shedding new light on the structural properties and thermal stability of high&#8208;entropy nanoalloys.








Abstract
High entropy alloy nanoparticles bring hope to developing more efficient nanomaterials for high&#8208;temperature applications. Nevertheless, the enhanced thermal stability of nearly equiatomic nanoalloys containing at least 5 metals is nothing more than theoretical speculation about the impact of thermodynamic contributions on their structural properties and remains to be proven. Here, in situ aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and molecular dynamics simulations are combined to investigate at the atomic scale the thermal behavior of AuCoCuNiPt nanoparticles (NPs) from 298 to 973 K. Both in situ STEM heating and atomistic simulations reveal strong structural and chemical evolutions in the NPs with the formation and melting of an AuCu layer at the surface of NPs at high temperature. This phase separation that appears progressively with temperature is driven by pronounced atomic diffusion that is surprisingly more active in these quinary nanoalloys than in monometallic and bimetallic subsystems. Besides ruling out the existence of sluggish diffusion in AuCoCuNiPt nanoalloys and lowering their temperature range of application, the study allows distinguishing kinetic and thermodynamic effects on their structural properties, which is an essential prerequisite to better control the synthesis of complex nanomaterials.

         <title>Lattice Matching Anchoring of Hole&#8208;Selective Molecule on Halide Perovskite Surfaces for n&#8208;i&#8208;p Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled molecule semiconductor that possesses a matching size with perovskite lattice and a large anchoring strength has been developed as the hole&#8208;selective contact toward efficient and long&#8208;term stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Exploiting the self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) as hole&#8208;selective contacts has been an effective strategy to improve the efficiency and long&#8208;term stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Currently, research works are focusing on constructing SAMs on metal oxide surfaces in p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs, but realizing a stable and dense SAM contact on halide perovskite surfaces in n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs is still challenging. In this work, the hole&#8208;selective molecule for n&#8208;i&#8208;p device is developed featuring a terephthalic methylammonium core structure that possesses double&#8208;site anchoring ability and a matching diameter (6.36 &#197;) with the lattice constant of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) perovskite (6.33 &#197;), which facilitates an ordered and full&#8208;coverage SAM atop FAPbI3 perovskite. Moreover, theoretical calculations and experimental results indicate that compared to the frequently used acid or ester anchoring groups, this ionic anchoring group with a dipolar charge distribution has much larger adsorption energy on both organic halide terminated and lead halide terminated surfaces, resulting in synergistic improvement of carrier extraction and defect passivation ability. Benefiting from these merits, the efficiency of PSCs is increased from 21.68% to 24.22%. The long&#8208;term operational stability under white LED illumination (100 mW cm&#8722;2) and at a high temperature of 85&#160;&#176;C is also much improved.

         <title>Enhanced Stability and Brightness through Co&#8208;Substitution: Promoting Plant Growth with Green&#8208;Excited Deep Red Phosphor Ca1&#8208;zSrzLi1&#8208;xMg2xAl3&#8208;xN4:yEu2+</title>

         <dc:description>
This research presents a new phosphor that effectively converts green light into deep red light, which is advantageous for plant growth, thereby facilitating spectral regulation and enhancing luminescence. The phosphor can be efficiently excited by sunlight, thereby optimizing sunlight utilization. Furthermore, the material exhibits exceptional stability and efficiency for use in outdoor agricultural lighting applications.








Abstract
The research utilized a strategy of chemical unit co&#8208;substitution, successfully developing a novel blue&#8208;green to green excited, deep red&#8208;emitting phosphor, Ca1&#8208;zSrzLi1&#8208;xMg2xAl3&#8208;xN4:yEu2+ (CLA&#8208;2xM&#8208;zS:yEu, 0&#8804;x&#8804;0.8, 0.003&#8804;y&#8804;0.01, 0&#8804;z&#8804;1), through the replacement of [Li&#8722;Al]4+ by [Mg&#8722;Mg]4+. This phosphor uniquely converts unusable green light to growth&#8208;enhancing deep red, optimizing it for outdoor agriculture. Doping with Sr creates traps, causing a redshift in emission peaks, as confirmed by 7Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, indicating Li presence and lattice changes. Ca0.2Sr0.8Li0.5MgAl2.5N4:0.005Eu2+ (CLAM&#8208;0.8S) phosphor maintained high luminescence intensity under extreme conditions of 85&#160;&#176;C/85% RH, demonstrating excellent photoluminescence performance and chemical stability, compared with conventional SrLi0.5MgAl2.5N4:0.005Eu2+ (SLMA) and SrLiAl3N4:0.005Eu2+(SLA). Experimental results surprised that the unique Ca0.2Sr0.8Li0.8Mg0.4Al2.8N4:0.005Eu2+ (CLA&#8208;0.4M&#8208;0.8S) prepared light&#8208;converting film, which is mainly excited by green light, demonstrated a 20% increase in optical density of Chlorella compared to the PP film and a remarkable 97.5% increase compared to the control group without any film. These findings suggest that this film has significant potential for applications in outdoor agriculture and other fields.

         <title>Directional Reconstruction to Highly Active Tandem Sites for Superior Acidic CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bran&#8208;new self&#8208;reducing ion&#8208;mediated reconstruction is developed to harmonize reconstruction rate and directionally optimize tandem sites in operation of the tandem catalyst (CuO/AgIO3). As a direct outcome, the restructured CuO/AgIO3 achieves outstanding multi&#8208;carbon Faradaic efficiency of 82% at 1.2 A cm&#8722;2 and a peak jC2+ (1024 mA cm&#8722;2) in strong acid electrolyte.








Abstract
Acidic CO2 electroreduction (CO2R) to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) chemicals advance the carbon neutrality in the manner of high carbon utilization efficiency; however, it suffers from low selectivity. Designing tandem catalysts is the most promising remedy, yet achieving highly active tandem sites remains an immense challenge due to the potentiodynamic structural evolution. Here self&#8208;reducing ion (e.g., iodate) mediated reconstruction, which leverages the self&#8208;reduction of dissolved iodate ions is presented to harmonize reconstruction rate of the tandem catalyst and directionally optimize tandem sites in operation. Multiple in situ workflow clearly demonstrate that the exploited CuO/AgIO3 tandem catalysts occur rapid dissolution of iodate ions in AgIO3 during the CO2R, resulting in the formation of defective Ag. Subsequently, the preferential self&#8208;reduction of dissolved iodate as a reduction inhibitor delays the reconstruction rate of CuO and directs surface reconstruction toward highly active Cu(100). The asymmetric charge distribution of defective Ag facilitates the generation of *COOH and enhances local CO availability to further accelerate the C&#9472;C coupling step implemented on Cu(100).

&lt;p&gt;A bran-new self-reducing ion-mediated reconstruction is developed to harmonize reconstruction rate and directionally optimize tandem sites in operation of the tandem catalyst (CuO/AgIO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). As a direct outcome, the restructured CuO/AgIO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; achieves outstanding multi-carbon Faradaic efficiency of 82% at 1.2 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a peak &lt;i&gt;j&lt;sub&gt;C2+&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; (1024 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in strong acid electrolyte.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acidic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) to multi-carbon (C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt;) chemicals advance the carbon neutrality in the manner of high carbon utilization efficiency; however, it suffers from low selectivity. Designing tandem catalysts is the most promising remedy, yet achieving highly active tandem sites remains an immense challenge due to the potentiodynamic structural evolution. Here self-reducing ion (e.g., iodate) mediated reconstruction, which leverages the self-reduction of dissolved iodate ions is presented to harmonize reconstruction rate of the tandem catalyst and directionally optimize tandem sites in operation. Multiple in situ workflow clearly demonstrate that the exploited CuO/AgIO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; tandem catalysts occur rapid dissolution of iodate ions in AgIO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; during the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R, resulting in the formation of defective Ag. Subsequently, the preferential self-reduction of dissolved iodate as a reduction inhibitor delays the reconstruction rate of CuO and directs surface reconstruction toward highly active Cu(100). The asymmetric charge distribution of defective Ag facilitates the generation of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;COOH and enhances local CO availability to further accelerate the C&#9472;C coupling step implemented on Cu(100). The directionally reconstructed CuO/AgIO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; achieves outstanding C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; Faradaic efficiency of 82% at 1.2 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a peak &lt;i&gt;j&lt;sub&gt;C2+&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; (1024&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is &#8776;1.5 times higher than that reported in literature benchmark in strong acid electrolyte.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cellulose Nanofiber&#8208;Supported Electrochemical Percolation of Capacitive Nanomaterials with 0D, 1D, and 2D Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a systematic study of the electrochemical percolation of 0D, 1D, and 2D super&#8208;capacitive nanocarbons within the insulating CNF support. The electrochemical percolation behavior of the nanocarbon is highly dependent on their dimensionalities, and the 1D nanocarbon features the lowest percolation threshold. These results highlight the importance for controlling the dimensionality of the energy&#8208;storage nanomaterials to produce efficient insulator&#8208;supported supercapacitors.








Abstract
Cellulose nanofiber (CNF) represents a promising support material to strengthen the mechanical property of free&#8208;standing supercapacitor electrodes comprised of conducting nanomaterials. Although efforts have been focused on improving the performance of the CNF&#8208;supported electrode, the percolation of capacitive nanomaterials within the insulating CNF matrix, and its correlation with the nanomaterial's dimensionality are still underexplored. In this work, membrane supercapacitor electrodes are fabricated by incorporating CNF with 0D, 1D, and 2D capacitive nanocarbons respectively to study the impact of their dimensionality. It is found that the percolation pathway of the nanocarbons is dependent on their dimensionality. By introducing a new definition termed as electrochemical percolation threshold, the threshold weight percentages to realize effective electrochemical percolation are determined to be 60.0, 14.3, and 66.7% for 0D, 1D, and 2D nanocarbons, respectively. Increasing the weight percentage beyond the threshold typically results in improved electrochemical percolation but reduced mechanical strength, and both trends are dependent on the nanocarbon's dimensionality. The results provide guidance to design efficient and robust CNF&#8208;supported supercapacitor electrodes by controlling the dimensionality and density of the active material. The insights regarding the electrochemical percolation threshold can be applied to other energy&#8208;storage nanomaterials to advance the development of insulator&#8208;supported supercapacitors.

         <title>UOTe: Kondo&#8208;Interacting Topological Antiferromagnet in a Van der Waals Lattice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A van der Waals material UOTe displays antiferromagnet (AFM) ordering. A thorough study of the electronic structure, with experimental and theoretical methods, demonstrates Kondo coherence and non&#8208;trivial band structure topology. The bilayer form of UOTe is predicted to possess a long sought&#8208;after electronic phase of an AFM Chern insulator.








Abstract
Since the initial discovery of 2D van der Waals (vdW) materials, significant effort has been made to incorporate the three properties of magnetism, band structure topology, and strong electron correlations&#8212;to leverage emergent quantum phenomena and expand their potential applications. However, the discovery of a single vdW material that intrinsically hosts all three ingredients has remained an outstanding challenge. Here, the discovery of a Kondo&#8208;interacting topological antiferromagnet is reported in the vdW 5f electron system UOTe. It has a high antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition temperature of 150&#160;K, with a unique AFM configuration that breaks the combined parity and time reversal (PT) symmetry in an even number of layers while maintaining zero net magnetic moment. This angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements reveal Dirac bands near the Fermi level, which combined with the theoretical calculations demonstrate UOTe as an AFM Dirac semimetal. Within the AFM order, the presence of the Kondo interaction is observed, as evidenced by the emergence of a 5f flat band near the Fermi level below 100 K and hybridization between the Kondo band and the Dirac band. The density functional theory calculations in its bilayer form predict UOTe as a rare example of a fully&#8208;compensated AFM Chern&#160;insulator.

         <title>Stable Surface Contact with Tailored Alkylamine Pyridine Derivatives for High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the relationship between the configuration of the studied amino pyridine derivatives and their passivation effects has been meticulously investigated to enhance the electrical properties of perovskite surfaces, which enable the inverted FA1&#8208;xCsxPbI3 PSC to yield an encouraging efficiency of 25.65%&#8201;(certified 25.45%, certified steady&#8208;state efficiency 25.06%) with the tailored 3&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)pyridine (3&#8208;PyEA) surface passivator.








Abstract
Formamidinium&#8208;cesium lead triiodide (FA1&#8208;xCsxPbI3) perovskite holds great promise for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with both high efficiency and stability. However, the defective perovskite surfaces induced by defects and residual tensile strain largely limit the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding devices. Here, the passivation capability of alkylamine&#8208;modified pyridine derivatives for the surface defects of FA1&#8208;xCsxPbI3 perovskite is systematically studied. Among the studied surface passivators, 3&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)pyridine (3&#8208;PyEA) with the suitable size is demonstrated to be the most effective in reducing surface iodine impurities and defects (VI and I2) through its strong coordination with Npyridine. Additionally, the tail amino group (&#9472;NH2) from 3&#8208;PyEA can react with FA+ cations to reduce the surface roughness of perovskite films, and the reaction products can also passivate FA vacancies (VFA), and further strengthen their binding interaction to perovskite surfaces. These merits lead to suppressed nonradiative recombination loss, the release of residual tensile stress for the perovskite films, and a favorable energy&#8208;level alignment at the perovskite/[6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester interface. Consequently, the resulting inverted FA1&#8208;xCsxPbI3 PSCs obtain an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.65%&#8201;(certified 25.45%, certified steady&#8208;state efficiency 25.06%), along with retaining 96.5% of the initial PCE after 1800&#8201;h of 1&#8208;sun operation at 55&#8201;&#176;C in air.

Cuobpy complex is assembled into the cages of MAF&#8208;4 as a host&#8208;guest precursor, and pyrolyzed it into a highly loaded dual copper (21 wt%) nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalyst, which exhibits an exceptional performance for eCO2RR, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 52% and a current density of 180 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.4 V vs. RHE.








Abstract
Synthesis of high&#8208;loading atomic&#8208;level dispersed catalysts for highly efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) to ethylene&#160;(C2H4) in neutral electrolyte remain challenging tasks. To address common aggregation issues, a host&#8208;guest strategy is employed, by using a metal&#8208;azolate framework (MAF&#8208;4) with nanocages as the host and a dinuclear Cu(I) complex as the guest, to form precursors for pyrolysis into a series of nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbons (NPCs) with varying loadings of dual copper sites, namely NPCMAF&#8208;4&#8208;Cu2&#8208;21 (21.2 wt%), NPCMAF&#8208;4&#8208;Cu2&#8208;11 (10.6 wt%), and NPCMAF&#8208;4&#8208;Cu2&#8208;7 (6.9 wt%). Interestingly, as the loading of dual copper sites increased from 6.9 to 21.2 wt%, the partial current density for eCO2RR to yield C2H4 also gradually increased from 38.7 to 93.6 mA cm&#8722;2. In a 0.1 m KHCO3 electrolyte, at &#8722;1.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), NPCMAF&#8208;4&#8208;Cu2&#8208;21 exhibits the excellent performance with a Faradaic efficiency of 52% and a current density of 180 mA cm&#8722;2. Such performance can be attributed to the presence of ultrahigh&#8208;loading dual copper sites, which promotes C&#9472;C coupling and the formation of C2 products. The findings demonstrate the confinement effect of MAF&#8208;4 with nanocages is conducive to the preparation of high&#8208;loading atomic&#8208;level catalysts.

         <title>Tandem Upgrading of Bio&#8208;Furans to Benzene, Toluene, and p&#8208;xylene by Pt1Sn1 Intermetallic Coupling Ordered Mesoporous SnO2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Pt1Sn1 intermetallic coupling ordered&#8208;mesoporous SnO2 catalyst is reasonably designed to realize the efficient tandem upgrading of furan, furfural and 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfuran to benzene, toluene and p&#8208;xylene, respectively, representing a new tandem catalytic system to realize the high&#8208;yield BTpX productions from the corresponding bio&#8208;furans and biofeedstock acrylic acid.








Abstract
Benzene, toluene, and p&#8208;xylene (BTpX) are among the most important commodity chemicals, but their productions still heavily rely on fossil resources and thus pose serious environmental burdens and energy crisis. Herein, the tandem upgrading of bio&#8208;furans is reported to high&#8208;yield BTpX by rationally constructing a versatile Pt1Sn1 intermetallic coupling ordered&#8208;mesoporous SnO2 (OM&#8208;SnO2) catalyst. It is shown that with increasing reduction temperature from 200 to 350&#160;&#176;C, Pt nanoparticles (NPs) are first formed on OM&#8208;SnO2, then converted to Pt3Sn1 intermetallic nanoparticles (iNPs), and finally to Pt1Sn1 iNPs with a gradually&#8208;thickened SnO2 overlayer. Impressively, the Pt1Sn1 iNPs and defect&#8208;rich OM&#8208;SnO2 in the optimized Pt@OM&#8208;SnO2 can serve as the highly&#8208;active species for the hydrogenolysis of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfuran to 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran and the aromatization of 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran with acrylic acid to p&#8208;xylene, affording the highest yields of 99.1% and 96.1%, respectively. More importantly, it can perfectly realize the tandem upgrading of furan, furfural and 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfuran to benzene, toluene and p&#8208;xylene with high yields of 94.6%, 94.2% and 95.2%, respectively, representing a new tandem catalytic system to realize the high&#8208;yield BTpX productions from their corresponding bio&#8208;furans. This catalyst also shows good recyclability and excellent scalability, which together with its superior activity/selectivity suggest a high potential for sustainable BTpX productions.

         <title>Engineered Nickel&#8211;Iron Nitride Electrocatalyst for Industrial&#8208;Scale Seawater Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered Ni3FeN electrocatalyst, featuring a conductive nitride core and Cl&#8722;&#8208;resistant hydroxide shell, demonstrates robust hydrogen production in alkaline seawater. Phosphate&#8208;induced surface reconstruction enhances durability, enabling stable performance for over 2500 h at industrial current densities. This study advances seawater&#8208;resistant catalyst design for sustainable, large&#8208;scale hydrogen production.








Abstract
Seawater electrolysis under alkaline conditions is a crucial technology for sustainable hydrogen production. However, achieving the long&#8208;term stability of the electrocatalyst remains a significant challenge. In this study, it is demonstrated that surface reconstruction of a transition metal nitride (TMN) can be used to develop a highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst. Rapid introduction of phosphate groups (PO43&#8722;) accelerates the in situ surface reconstruction of Ni3FeN, generating a catalyst, with a conductive nitride core and Cl&#8722;&#8208;resistant hydroxide shell that demonstrates outstanding performance, maintaining stability for over 2500 h at 1 A cm&#8722;2 current density in alkaline seawater. In situ characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the dynamic evolution of active sites, providing insights into the mechanisms driving long&#8208;term stability. This work not only introduces an efficient approach to TMN&#8208;based catalyst design but also advances the development of durable electrocatalysts for industrial&#8208;scale seawater hydrogen production.

         <title>Rare&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Ultrabroadband Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of ultrabroadband NIR phosphors with excellent luminescence properties while free of rare&#8208;metal elements, is developed by revealing and then manipulating the weak&#8208;field&#8208;site occupation of Cr3+ in spinel compounds that are conventionally believed to only show strong&#8208;field&#8208;site occupation. The resulting NIR phosphor&#8208;converted LED possesses unprecedentedly high brightness, ultra&#8208;wide spectral coverage, and low cost.








Abstract
Trivalent chromium (Cr3+) is an attractive near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitter, but its ultrabroadband NIR emission is limited to host crystals containing large amounts of rare&#8208;metal elements and usually suffers from low internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and poor thermal stability. Here, a class of high&#8208;performance, rare&#8208;metal&#8208;free ultrabroadband NIR phosphors, are reported by revealing that weak&#8208;field Cr3+ centers featuring broadband NIR emission with near&#8208;unity IQEs are intrinsic, though in trace quantities, to Cr3+ doped MgAl2O4 spinel (MAS) and its derivatives well&#8208;known for their narrowband far&#8208;red emission. It is shown that such weak&#8208;field Cr3+ centers stem from cation inversion ubiquitous in spinel compounds, and their quantity can be increased simply by superstoichiometric Al2O3/Ga2O3. Then SiO2 is introduced into Al2O3&#8208;excess MAS to break the inversion symmetry of Cr3+ centers for greatly improving the probabilities of their otherwise parity&#8208;forbidden 3d&#8211;3d transitions. The as&#8208;fabricated phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes are capable of emitting ultrabroadband NIR light with high photoelectric efficiency (16.0%) and optical power (180.8&#160;mW), and excellent spectral stability, which apparently outperforms existing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices.

The as-fabricated phosphor-converted light-emitting diodes are capable of emitting ultrabroadband NIR light with high photoelectric efficiency (16.0%) and optical power (180.8&#160;mW), and excellent spectral stability, which apparently outperforms existing state-of-the-art devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Subtle Tuning of Catalytic Well Effect in Phthalocyanine Covalent Organic Frameworks for Selective CO2 Electroreduction into C2H4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Cu&#8208;salphen&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks with different levels of hydroxyl&#8208;induced catalytic well have been designed for selective electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction into multiple&#8208;electron transferred products.








Abstract
In the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), the strategic design of a catalytic well capable of regulating the overall confinement effects of catalytic sites holds significant promise for enhancing multiple&#8208;electron transfer and C&#9472;C coupling efficiency, particularly for the generation of C2+ products. Here, a series of Cu&#8208;salphen&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) featuring hydroxyl&#8208;induced catalytic well are synthesized, which demonstrate successful application in electrocatalytic CO2RR to yield multiple&#8208;electron transferred products. The meticulously engineered catalytic well, facilitated by multi&#8208;hydroxyl groups, manifests robust confinement effects, facilitating selective adsorption, enrichment, and activation of CO2, intermediate stabilization, and reduction of energy barriers for electrocatalytic CO2RR. Specifically, product selectivity can be finely tuned from CH4 to C2H4 by modulating the levels of catalytic well, with CuPc&#8208;DFP&#8208;4OH&#8208;Cu exhibiting the most pronounced catalytic well effect, yielding a high 56.86% faradaic efficiency (FE) for C2H4 at &#8722;0.7 V, while CuPc&#8208;DFP&#8208;Cu, with the weakest catalytic well effect, achieves a 75.24% FE for CH4 at &#8722;1.0 V. Notably, the attained FE for C2H4 (56.86%) surpasses that of all reported COFs to date. Complemented by theoretical calculations and in situ tests, this study delves deeply into the pivotal roles of hydroxyl&#8208;induced catalytic well with confinement effects.

         <title>Assessing the Effect of a Schwarz P Surface on the Oxygen Electroreduction Performance of Porous Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bicontinuous&#8208;structured porous catalyst with a Schwarz P surface and dense single&#8208;atom sites is prepared. The 3D continuous mesochannels enable smooth mass transfer into the deep internal of the catalyst and high accessibility of catalytic sites, while the Schwarz P surface reduces the reaction energy barrier, improving the intrinsic catalytic activity.









Abstract
The surface curvature of catalysts has a decisive impact on their catalytic performance. However, the influence of a negative&#8208;Gaussian&#8208;curvature surface on the catalytic performance of porous catalysts has remained unexplored due to the lack of suitable samples. Bicontinuous&#8208;structured porous structures can serve as ideal models, but they are known as &#8220;Plumber's nightmare&#8221; due to their highly difficult preparation. Here, using metal&#8211;organic frameworks as the precursor and polymer cubosomes as the template, a bicontinuous mesoporous Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst (named bmFeSAC) with a Schwarz P surface is synthesized. The bmFeSAC catalyst has a large specific surface area of 916&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1 and uniformly distributed Fe&#8208;N4 active sites with a 1.80&#160;wt.% Fe content. The continuous channels enabled high utilization efficiency of the Fe&#8208;N4 catalytic sites, while the negative&#8208;Gaussian&#8208;curvature surface enabled low reaction energy barrier. As an electrocatalyst of the oxygen reduction reaction, bmFeSAC delivered a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.931&#160;V versus. RHE in alkaline electrolyte, reaching the leading level among those of the reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the bmFeSAC&#8208;based Zn&#8208;air batteries exhibited excellent performance, demonstrating the potential application of bmFeSAC. This study revealed that a bicontinuous&#8208;structured porous structure can improve catalytic activity by increasing the utilization ratio of catalytic sites and, more importantly, by regulating the electronic structure of catalyst surfaces through the negative&#8208;Gaussian&#8208;curvature.

         <title>Dual Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Response S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction with Asymmetric Adsorption Sites for Enhanced Nitrogen Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual NIR&#8208;responsive S&#8208;scheme ZnCoSx/Fe3S4 heterojunction photocatalyst with hollow&#8208;on&#8208;hollow superstructure and asymmetric adsorption sites is designed for efficient nitrogen reduction. An excellent PNRR performance is achieved, with a high NH3 evolution rate of 2523.4&#160; &#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, AQY value of 9.4% at 400&#160;nm and 8% at 1000&#160;nm, and SCC efficiency of 0.32%.








Abstract
Photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (PNRR) holds immense promise for sustainable ammonia (NH3) synthesis. However, few photocatalysts can utilize NIR light that carries over 50% of the solar energy for NH3 production with high performance. Herein, a dual NIR&#8208;responsive S&#8208;scheme ZnCoSx/Fe3S4 heterojunction photocatalyst is designed with asymmetric adsorption sites and excellent PNRR performance. The heterojunction possesses a hollow&#8208;on&#8208;hollow superstructure: Fe3S4 nanocrystal&#8208;modified ZnCoSx nanocages as building blocks assemble into spindle&#8208;shaped particles with a spindle&#8208;like cavity. Both Fe3S4 and ZnCoSx are NIR active, allowing efficient utilization of full&#8208;spectrum light. Moreover, an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction is constructed that promotes charge separation. In addition, the Fe/Co dual&#8208;metal sites at the interface enable an asymmetric side&#8208;on adsorption mode of N2, favoring the polarization and activation of N2 molecules. In combination with the promoted mass transfer and active site exposure of hollow superstructure, a superior PNRR performance is achieved, with a high NH3 evolution rate of 2523.4&#160; &#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, an apparent quantum yield of 9.4% at 400&#160;nm and 8% at 1000&#160;nm, and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.32%. The work paves the way for the rational design of advanced heterojunction catalysts for PNRR.

         <title>Achieving Significant Multilevel Modulation in Superior&#8208;quality Organic Spin Valve</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work has integrated straintronics with organic spintronics to fabricate the first vertically structured three&#8208;terminal PMN&#8208;PT/LPCMO/P3HT/Co organic spin valve (OSV) device, which can be multilevel modulated by gate voltage. By harnessing the unique amplification effect of the spinterface, this device demonstrates both a substantial magnetoresistance value and highly efficient multilevel tunability.









Abstract
Organic semiconductors, characterized by their exceptionally long spin relaxation times (&#8776;ms) and unique spinterface effects, are considered game&#8208;changers in spintronics. However, achieving high&#8208;performance and wide&#8208;range tunable magnetoresistance (MR) in organic spintronic devices remains challenging, severely limiting the development of organic spintronics. This work combines straintronic multiferroic heterostructures with organic spin valve (OSV) to develop a three&#8208;terminal OSV device with a gate structure. The device exhibits a record&#8208;high MR ratio of 281% which 10 times higher than the average in polymer systems. More importantly, this work can perform multilevel writing operations on the device using gate voltages and create at least 10 stable spin&#8208;dependent working states within a single device. Both experiments and theoretical calculations confirm such an extraordinary tunability range originates from the synergistic effects of strain and charge accumulation that amplified by the spinterface. This study demonstrates the potential of OSV systems for efficient spin manipulation and highlights the spinterface as an ideal platform for amplifying spin effects for next&#8208;generation spintronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;This work has integrated straintronics with organic spintronics to fabricate the first vertically structured three-terminal PMN-PT/LPCMO/P3HT/Co organic spin valve (OSV) device, which can be multilevel modulated by gate voltage. By harnessing the unique amplification effect of the spinterface, this device demonstrates both a substantial magnetoresistance value and highly efficient multilevel tunability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic semiconductors, characterized by their exceptionally long spin relaxation times (&#8776;ms) and unique spinterface effects, are considered game-changers in spintronics. However, achieving high-performance and wide-range tunable magnetoresistance (MR) in organic spintronic devices remains challenging, severely limiting the development of organic spintronics. This work combines straintronic multiferroic heterostructures with organic spin valve (OSV) to develop a three-terminal OSV device with a gate structure. The device exhibits a record-high MR ratio of 281% which 10 times higher than the average in polymer systems. More importantly, this work can perform multilevel writing operations on the device using gate voltages and create at least 10 stable spin-dependent working states within a single device.

         <title>Motion&#8208;Adaptive Tessellated Skin Patches With Switchable Adhesion for Wearable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional skin adhesive patch that strategically integrates heterogeneous phase change elements in a tessellated configuration is presented. This patch simultaneously provides remarkable skin adhesion, dynamic motion adaptability, the ability to integrate bulky electronics, on&#8208;demand damage&#8208;free detachment, low skin contact impedance, a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and precise wireless health monitoring.








Abstract
Skin&#8208;interfaced electronics have emerged as a promising frontier in personalized healthcare. However, existing skin&#8208;interfaced patches often struggle to simultaneously achieve robust skin adhesion, adaptability to dynamic body motions, seamless integration of bulky devices, and on&#8208;demand, damage&#8208;free detachment. Here, a hybrid strategy that synergistically combines these critical features within a thin, flexible patch platform is introduced. This design leverages shape memory polymers (SMPs) arranged in a tessellated array, comprising both rigid and compliant SMPs. This configuration enables exceptional deformability, motion adaptability, and ultra&#8208;strong, repeatable skin adhesion while offering on&#8208;demand adhesion control. Furthermore, the design facilitates the seamless integration of bulky electronics without compromising skin adhesion. By incorporating sizeable electronics including signal acquisition circuits, sensors, and a battery, it is demonstrated that the proposed tessellated patch can be securely mounted on the skin, accommodate dynamic body motions, precisely detect physiological signals with an outstanding signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR), wirelessly transmit data, and be effortlessly released from the skin.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Strain Metal&#8208;Insulator Transition by the Local Fluctuation of Cation Dimerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving a zero&#8208;strain electronic MIT can overcome the fundamental limitations of MIT in solid materials. Here, this study demonstrates that iso&#8208;valent Ti dopants in supercooled VO2 epitaxial films cause MIT without changing unit&#8208;cell volume and crystal symmetry, which drastically enhances switching speed and endurance during electrically and optically driven MIT by decoupling electronic and structural transitions.








Abstract
The coupled electronic and structural transitions in metal&#8208;insulator transition (MIT) hinder ultrafast switching and ultimate endurance. Decoupling these transitions and achieving a zero&#8208;strain electronic MIT can overcome the fundamental limitations of MIT in solid materials. Here, this study demonstrates that iso&#8208;valent Ti dopants in supercooled VO2 epitaxial films cause MIT with minimal hysteresis without changing unit&#8208;cell volume and crystal symmetry. The Ti dopants in the VO2 lattice locally alter the configuration of V&#8208;V pairs, where the long&#8208;range ordering in V&#8208;V pairs is disrupted, and the nano&#8208;domains of V&#8208;V dimers are formed. Strikingly, these local V&#8208;V dimers persist even above the electronic transition temperature (TMI), facilitating the zero&#8208;strain electronic MIT with nanoscale structural heterogeneity. The geometrically compatible interface between insulating and metallic phases drastically enhances switching speed and endurance during electrically and optically driven zero&#8208;strain MIT. This discovery offers a fresh perspective on the scientific understanding of MIT and the improved functionality in terms of device speed and reliability by decoupling electronic and structural transitions.

         <title>Quantification of Interfacial Charges in Multilayered Nanocapacitors by Operando Electron Holography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando off&#8208;axis electron holography is used to quantify the charges trapped at the dielectric/dielectric interfaces and metal/dielectric interfaces in HfO2&#8208; and Al2O3&#8208;based nanocapacitors. The electrostatic potential maps, recorded with a sub&#8208;nanometer spatial resolution while applying a bias, demonstrate that these interfaces present a high density of trapped charges, which strongly influence the electric field distribution within the device.








Abstract
Interfaces in heterostructures play a major role in the functionality of electronic devices. Phenomena such as charge trapping/detrapping at interfaces under electric field affect the dynamics of metal/oxide/metal capacitors and metal/oxide/semiconductor transistors used for memory and logic applications. Charge traps are also key for the stabilization of a ferroelectric polarization and its ability to switch in ferroelectric devices such as ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs). However, electric&#8208;field induced charging phenomena remain unclear even in conventional dielectric heterostructures due to a lack of direct measurement methods. Here, it is shown how operando off&#8208;axis electron holography can be used to quantify the charges trapped at the dielectric/dielectric interfaces as well as metal/dielectric interfaces in HfO2&#8208; and Al2O3&#8208;based nanocapacitors. By mapping the electrostatic potential at sub&#8208;nanometer spatial resolution while applying a bias, it is demonstrated that these interfaces present a high density of trapped charges, which strongly influence the electric field distribution within the device. The unprecedented sensitivity of the electron holography experiments coupled with numerical simulations highlights for the first time the linear relationship between the trapped charges at each interface and the applied bias, and the effect of the trapped charges on the local electrical behavior.

         <title>A Simple Route for Open Fluidic Devices with Particle Walls</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Open fluidic devices are produced by integrating substrate patterning and particle walls, where there is a broad range of particle choices including carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and monolayers of SiO2 nanoparticles. The strategy allows for arbitrary production and extraordinary manipulation of open fluidic devices with significant potential for applications.








Abstract
Open fluidics, allowing liquid in a flow channel to interact with the external environment, is a revolutionary concept. However, fabricating a highly stable open fluidic device of arbitrary complexity, while maintaining reconfigurability, is still a challenge. This is achieved by the use of a patterned substrate and liquids that are covered with functional, readily available hydrophobic particles, providing great flexibility in the construction and use of open fluidic structures. Decorated with a coating of modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to encapsulate the fluids, the study capitalizes on the photothermal characteristics of CNTs to fabricate a device to probe the effects of temperature on tumor chemotherapy. The strategy substantially increases the availability and potential use of open fluidic devices.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study finds that the freestanding BiFeO3 membranes maintain&#160;the single&#8208;domain structure and exhibit a significantly enhanced bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), compared to the strained BiFeO3 films. This work provides a novel strategy to enhance the BPVE of ferroelectric oxide films and paves up a new way to integrate ferroelectric BPVE with Si&#8208;based semiconductors or 2D materials.








Abstract
The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), which uniquely exists in non&#8208;centrosymmetric materials, has been received extensive attention recently due to its potential to overcome the theoretical Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit in traditional p&#8211;n junction solar cells. Here, freestanding single&#8208;domain BiFeO3 membranes are exfoliated from miscut SrTiO3 substrates by dissolving Sr3Al2O6 sacrificial layers, and transferred on SiO2/Si substrates. This study finds that the freestanding BiFeO3 membranes maintain the single&#8208;domain structure and exhibits the significantly enhanced bulk photovoltaic response (&#8776;200% enhancement), compared to the strained BiFeO3 films. The comprehensive atomic imaging analyses manifest that the freestanding BiFeO3 membrane demonstrates the bigger noncentral ion (Fe) displacement, which results in the larger in&#8208;plane ferroelectric polarization and substantial increase in the BPVE photocurrent. This work not only provides an effective approach to enhance the BPVE of ferroelectric oxide films, but also can potentially promote the exploration of BPVE of oxide membranes integrated with silicon&#8208;based or 2D electronics.

         <title>Development of an Inhalable DNA Tetrahedron MicroRNA Sponge</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tetrahedral&#8208;like configuration of microRNA&#8208;155 Sponge (155&#8208;Sponge) enters the lungs by nebulization, releasing a 3 fold concentration of microRNA&#8208;155 (miR&#8208;155) inhibitor that binds to miR&#8208;155, which is highly expressed in the inflammation of the lungs, to regulate the polarization state of the local macrophages in the lungs and the chemotaxis of the immune cells, and to restore the immunological homeostatic microenvironment in the lungs.








Abstract
In designing aerosolized drugs, the challenge lies in achieving optimal penetration and retention. Existing delivery systems prioritize larger particles for prolonged intrapulmonary retention, compromising penetration speed. Conversely, smaller nanoparticles face rapid clearance and limited retention. RNA sponges featuring multiple microRNA binding sites exhibit promising potential for gene expression regulation. However, the complex structure of the frequently utilized cyclic RNA sponge impedes rapid penetration and cellular uptake, restricting its application. This study proposes an innovative approach using a compact tetrahedral framework of nucleic acid to construct an inhalable microRNA sponge. Distinguished by its simplified structure, this microRNA sponge ensures effective microRNA inhibition, rapid tissue penetration, and prolonged residency through prompt endocytosis. Validated in acute lung inflammation models, the approach demonstrates swift restoration of local immune homeostasis. This design addresses the critical need for aerosol vehicles that balance efficient penetration and sustained retention, offering a promising solution for effective gene expression regulation.

         <title>Optimizing Oxygen Redox Activity by Local Chemical Disorder toward Robust Co&#8208;Free Li&#8208;Rich Cathode with High Voltage Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lattice oxygen redox (LOR) activity is modulated from 22% to 92% by introducing controllable local chemical disorder, and the relationship between LOR activity and cycling stability is revealed. Excessive or over&#8208;suppressive LOR is demonstrated to damage electrochemical/structural stability. Appropriate LOR activation is necessary and its optimal degree is identified as 86% for balancing maximum reversible LOR and good stability.








Abstract
Despite extensive investigation on the lattice oxygen redox (LOR) in Li&#8208;rich cathodes, significant challenges remain in utilizing LOR activity without compromising structural and electrochemical stability. Related breakthroughs are hindered by the lack of understanding regarding how different LOR activity influences the structural evolution and electrochemical stability, and what is the optimal LOR activity. Herein, the degree of LOR activity is successfully regulated from 22% to 92% in Co&#8208;free Li&#8208;rich cathodes (Li1+xMn0.62Ni0.18O2) by controlling local chemical disorder, and the relationship between LOR activity and cycling stability is revealed. Conventional consensus is challenged by new findings that the over&#8208;suppressive LOR activity also undermines electrochemical/structural stability, and even causes more severe voltage fading compared to cases with excessive LOR. However, their failure mechanisms related to lattice strain present different characteristics. Based on the established understanding, the appropriate LOR activation is necessary to balance the maximum reversible LOR activity and good stability, and the optimal degree is identified as 86% in Li1.18Mn0.62Ni0.18O2 (LR&#8208;78). LR&#8208;78 exhibits remarkable voltage retention of 96% after 400 cycles at 1 C, and superior high&#8208;rate cyclability without capacity decay within 600 cycles at 5 C. These findings significantly broaden the understanding of LOR mechanisms and provide critical guidance for designing durable LOR&#8208;based cathodes.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Mediated Self&#8208;Assembly of Carbon Dots Enabling Precise Tuning of Particle and Cluster Luminescence for Advanced Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model in which the self&#8208;assembly of carbon dots (CDs) and the corresponding cluster luminescence are modulated by the competitive hydrogen bonding interaction between CDs&#8208;CDs and CDs&#8208;solvent molecules is established. This controlled self&#8208;assembly unlocks exciting potential for advanced optoelectronic applications, including customizable LEDs, secure encryption, and fingerprint authentication, offering new opportunities for technological innovation.








Abstract
The effective control over the self&#8208;assembly process of carbon dots (CDs) and their cluster luminescence in the aggregated state is of paramount significance and challenge. This study, for the first time, systematically explores the photoluminescent behavior of CDs in their aggregated state, which is less understood compared to their discrete state. By investigating the effects of concentration and solvent environment, it's demonstrated that CDs could exhibit dual emission properties, shifting from blue particle emissions to red cluster emissions as they aggregate. The key to this tunable luminescence lies in hydrogen bonding, which drives the self&#8208;assembly of CDs and modulates their photo physical properties. These findings reveal that through precise control of aggregation, CDs can be engineered for advanced optoelectronic applications, including tunable light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), secure information encryption, and fingerprint authentication. This report not only deepens the understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing CDs' cluster luminescence but also introduces a novel approach to exploiting their unique properties for technological innovation.

         <title>Balancing the Charge Separation and Surface Reaction Dynamics in Twin&#8208;Interface Photocatalysts for Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study thoroughly investigates the synergistic effects of charge separation and surface reaction dynamics in nano&#8208;twinned photocatalysts by combining multiple time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy (TRPL, fs&#8208;TA, and TRIR) techniques, underscoring the transformative potential of twin structures in photocatalysis, offering a new avenue to synchronize charge transport and surface reactions, and holding broad implications for the development of efficient solar energy conversion systems.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic green hydrogen (H2) evolution reaction presents a promising route toward solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical fuel conversion. However, its efficiency has been hindered by the desynchronization of fast photogenerated charge carriers and slow surface reaction kinetics. This work introduces a paradigm shift in photocatalyst design by focusing on the synchronization of charge transport and surface reactions through the use of twin structures as a unique platform. With CdS twin structure (CdS&#8208;T) as a model, the role of twin boundaries in modulating surface reactions and facilitating charge migration is systematically investigated. Utilizing transient absorption (TA) and time&#8208;resolved infrared (TRIR) spectroscopies, it is revealed that CdS&#8208;T achieves charge separation on a picosecond timescale and, importantly, the surface reaction at the twin boundary with the involvement of holes also occurs within 100&#160;ps to 3&#160;ns. This synchronization of charge donation and surface regeneration significantly enhances the hydrogen evolution process. Accordingly, CdS&#8208;T exhibits superior activity for visible light photocatalytic H2 production, withthe H2 production rate of 55.61&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 and remarkable stability (&gt;30&#160;h), outperforming pristine CdS significantly. This study underscores the transformative potential of twin structures in photocatalysis, offering a new avenue to synchronize charge transport and surface reactions.

Utilizing transient absorption (TA) and time-resolved infrared (TRIR) spectroscopies, it is revealed that CdS-T achieves charge separation on a picosecond timescale and, importantly, the surface reaction at the twin boundary with the involvement of holes also occurs within 100&#160;ps to 3&#160;ns. This synchronization of charge donation and surface regeneration significantly enhances the hydrogen evolution process. Accordingly, CdS-T exhibits superior activity for visible light photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, withthe H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 55.61&#160;mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and remarkable stability (&amp;gt;30&#160;h), outperforming pristine CdS significantly. This study underscores the transformative potential of twin structures in photocatalysis, offering a new avenue to synchronize charge transport and surface reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Mixed Index Facet Engineering Induces Defect Formation and Converts the Wave&#8208;Transmissive Mott Insulator NiO into Electromagnetic Wave Absorbent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work constructs a highly mixed index facet (HMIF) with a gradient work function and numerous oxygen vacancies. The HMIF configuration allows electrons to transport on the crystal surface and accumulate at specific facets to form polarization, achieves the Mott insulator&#8208;semiconductor transition (IST), and converts the wave&#8208;transmissive Mott insulator NiO into electromagnetic wave absorbent.








Abstract
Mott insulator possesses the property of converting into semiconductor under supernormal conditions and achieving the Mott insulator&#8208;semiconductor transition (IST) holds great scientific value. Nevertheless, current IST methodologies possess certain limitations because they are not capable of being implemented under conventional conditions, thereby limiting their practical applications. Herein, a highly mixed index facets (HMIF) strategy is proposed to construct homogeneous interfaces with gradient work function (WF) in Mott insulator NiO, accompanied by numerous oxygen vacancies. These vacancies provide additional defect energy levels and inhomogeneous charge distributions, resulting in a 180 fold enhancement of conductivity, realizing the IST process, and inducing the defect polarization. In addition, HMIF configuration induces electron transport along the index facets with gradient WF, ultimately leading to accumulation on the specific facet. This accumulation allows this facet can be considered as a dipole with its adjacent facets and makes NiO to attenuate electromagnetic waves (EMW) through dipole polarization. Therefore, NiO with exposed HMIF possesses improved EMW absorption properties (80&#8208;fold higher than that of commercial NiO), realizing the transition from EMW&#8208;transmissive to EMW&#8208;absorbing materials. This research presents an approach for the IST process, discovers the polarization behavior that occurred on specific index facet, and extends its potential application in EMW absorption.

         <title>Reassessing the Role of Thermal Convection in Simultaneous Water Production and Pollutant Degradation in Interfacial Photothermal&#8208;Photocatalytic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We created an interfacial system that utilizes photothermal evaporation to enhance the photocatalytic activity of the system. The results demonstrate that the introduction of a three&#8208;phase interface configuration utilizing solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation (SIE) technology can use enhanced thermal convection to dynamically mitigate the resistance to gas escape from the reaction system and improve the efficiency of interfacial photothermal&#8208;photocatalytic systems.








Abstract
The interfacial photothermal&#8208;photocatalytic&#160;systems&#160;can generate clean water while purifying wastewater containing organic pollutants, but the impact of thermal convection on synergistic effects remains unexplored. This paper aims to regulate the thermal convection at the interface to significantly enhance the synergistic effect of interfacial photothermal&#8208;photocatalytic systems. A novel heterogeneous structure comprising iron&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks and multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes with a gelatin&#8208;polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) double network hydrogel (MWCNTs@NM88B/PVA/gelatin hydrogel, denoted as MMH) is developed and employed in the construction of the solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation (SIE) system. The system shows high activity for solar water evaporation and simultaneous photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. MMH demonstrates an evaporation rate of 2.84&#160;kg m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1, achieving an efficiency of 95.3% under 1 sun. COMSOL simulations reveal that the implementation of a three&#8208;phase interface configuration with SIE technology significantly boosts thermal convection, effectively diminishing the barrier to gas release from the reaction system and consequently enhancing the efficiency of the interfacial photothermal&#8208;photocatalytic process. Furthermore, the potential mechanism of photocatalytic decomposition of organic pollutants in MMH/H2O2/visible light reaction system is proposed by combining the experiments of KPFM, in situ XPS, and ESR spectra. Therefore, this work offers a fresh perspective on evaluating the impact of thermal convection on water evaporation and pollutant degradation in interface photothermal&#8208;photocatalytic systems.

Biomimetic Chlorosomes
Photocatalytic therapy suffers from inefficiencies due to its reliance on oxygen and the attendant risk of unregulated activation. In article number 2413385, Wen Sun, Chao Yang, Wen&#8208;fei Dong, and their colleagues present a Chlorosome&#8208;mimetic nanoreactor (Ru&#8208;Chlos), made by aggregating ruthenium&#8208;polypyridyl&#8208;silane monomers, showing great photocatalytic ability in acidic conditions without oxygen consumption, and its photocatalytic activity of Ru&#8208;Chlos can be impeded by the light&#8208;responsive disassembly.

3D Printing
A novel organic ink based on egg albumen and saccharides is developed to create sacrificial supports for gelatin&#8208;based hydrogel prints. The cover photo shows biogel scaffolds with tunable pore size down to 0.4 mm, enabled by selective support removal. This allows printing of complex&#8208;shaped biodegradable joint&#8208;like vacuum actuators with 60&#176; maximum bending angle at 0.23 s response time. More details can be found in article number 2409403 by Martin Kaltenbrunner and co&#8208;workers.

&lt;p&gt;A novel organic ink based on egg albumen and saccharides is developed to create sacrificial supports for gelatin-based hydrogel prints. The cover photo shows biogel scaffolds with tunable pore size down to 0.4 mm, enabled by selective support removal. This allows printing of complex-shaped biodegradable joint-like vacuum actuators with 60&#176; maximum bending angle at 0.23 s response time. More details can be found in article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202409403"&gt;2409403&lt;/a&gt; by Martin Kaltenbrunner and co-workers.

Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes
In article number 2410402, Jianwen Liang, Xueliang Sun, Xiaona Li, and co&#8208;workers present a pioneering and universal strategy for the hydrate&#8208;assisted synthesis of LiAlOCl solid&#8208;state electrolytes, enabling the kilogram&#8208;scale synthesis of low&#8208;cost aluminum&#8208;based chloroxides. The oxychloride SSEs contain large amounts of amorphous [AlaObClc](2b+c&#8722;3a)&#8722; components, achieving faster local mobility of lithium ions. The technology is expected to promote the industrial application of high specific energy all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

Ultrafast Symmetry Control
In article 2414196, Burak Guzelturk and co&#8208;workers reveal an ultrafast symmetry change upon photoexcitation in PbS quantum dots using time&#8208;resolved structural techniques. The magnitude of symmetry change is tunable by quantum dot surface chemistry, opening a pathway to designed phase changes for applications in data storage, computing, and sensing in the future.

Spatiotemporal Programmable 3D Chiral Blue Phase Patterns
In article number 2411988, Wenjie Yang, Chenglin Zheng, Jingxia Wang, and co&#8208;workers propose a method for spatiotemporal control of inkjet printing 3D chiral patterns in blue phase liquid crystals (BPLCs). Spontaneous ink diffusion in dual&#8208;chiral polymer&#8208;templated BPLCs enables programmable evolution of photonic bandgaps, and spatial chiral modes. The study quantitatively links ink diffusion kinetics to 3D optical diffraction of BPLCs, offering potential applications in time&#8208;temperature indicators, multidimensional encryption, and advanced optical sensor devices.

MicroRNA Sponge
The illustration depicts a tetrahedral RNA sponge constructed using a DNA framework, capable of simultaneously carrying three microRNA inhibitors. It can adsorb target microRNA molecules and deplete reactive oxygen species. This modulation alters the inflammatory state, promoting the transition of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages, thereby alleviating pulmonary inflammatory damage and restoring microenvironmental homeostasis. More details can be found in article number 2414336 by Taoran Tian, Yunfeng Lin, and co&#8208;workers.

         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the stability challenges of organic solar cells with small molecule acceptors under stressors such as light, heat, oxygen, and moisture. It highlights the degradation mechanisms affecting chemical structure, morphology, and interfacial properties. Strategies for enhancing long&#8208;term stability are presented, along with key directions outlined for future research.








Abstract
Significant advancements in power conversion efficiency have been achieved in organic solar cells with small molecule acceptors. However, stability remains a primary challenge, impeding their widespread adoption in renewable energy applications. This review summarizes the degradation of different layers within the device structure in organic solar cells under varying conditions, including light, heat, moisture, and oxygen. For the photoactive layers, the chemical degradation pathways of polymer donors and small molecule acceptors are examined in detail, alongside the morphological stability of the bulk heterojunction structure, which plays a crucial role in device performance. The degradation mechanisms of commonly used anode and cathode interlayers and electrodes are addressed, as these layers significantly influence overall device efficiency and stability. Mitigation methods for the identified degradation mechanisms are provided in each section to offer practical insights for improving device longevity. Finally, an outlook presents the remaining challenges in achieving long&#8208;term stability, emphasizing research directions that require further investigation to enhance the reliability and performance of organic solar cells in real&#8208;world applications.

Functional hydrogel fibers for Biointerfacing: Functional hydrogel fibers are designed with optical guiding capabilities, electrical conductivity, and responsiveness to various physical stimuli (e.g., thermal, magnetic, and ultrasound waves), enabling their use in biointerfacing&#160;applications.









Abstract
The unique 1D structure of fibers offers intriguing attributes, including a high length&#8208;to&#8208;diameter ratio, miniatured size, light&#8208;weight, and flexibility, making them suitable for various biomedical applications, such as health monitoring, disease treatment, and minimally invasive surgeries. However, traditional fiber devices, typically composed of rigid, dry, and non&#8208;living materials, are intrinsically different from the soft, wet, and living essence of biological tissues, thereby posing grand challenges for long&#8208;term, reliable, and seamless interfacing with biological systems. Hydrogel fibers have recently emerged as a promising candidate, in light of their similarity to biological tissues in mechanical, chemical and biological aspects, as well as distinct fiber geometry. In this review, a comprehensive overview of recent progress in hydrogel fibers&#8208;based biointerfacing technology is provided. It thoroughly summarizes the manufacturing strategy and functional design, especially for hydrogel fibers with distinct optical and electron conductive performance, as well as responsiveness to triggers including thermal, magnetic field and ultrasonic wave, etc. Such unique attributes enable various biomedical applications, which are also examined in detail. Future challenges and potential directions, including biosafety, long&#8208;term reliability, sterilization, multi&#8208;modalities integration and intelligent therapeutic systems, are raised. This review will serve as a valuable resource for further advancement and implementation as next&#8208;generation biointerfacing technology.

         <title>Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis via Selective Oxygen Reduction Reactions Through Interfacial Reaction Microenvironment Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reviews the development of reaction microenvironments for the selective two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis from the perspective of interfacial electrolysis. In particular, it highlights key engineering strategies designed to optimize the interfacial reaction environment, thereby advancing the practical application of H2O2 electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The electrochemical two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) offers a compelling alternative for decentralized and on&#8208;site H2O2 production compared to the conventional anthraquinone process. To advance this electrosynthesis system, there is growing interest in optimizing the interfacial reaction microenvironment to boost electrocatalytic performance. This review consolidates recent advancements in reaction microenvironment engineering for the selective electrocatalytic conversion of O2 to H2O2. Starting with fundamental insights into interfacial electrocatalytic mechanisms, an overview of various strategies for constructing the favorable local reaction environment, including adjusting electrode wettability, enhancing mesoscale mass transfer, elevating local pH, incorporating electrolyte additives, and employing pulsed electrocatalysis techniques is provided. Alongside these regulation strategies, the corresponding analyses and technical remarks are also presented. Finally, a summary and outlook on critical challenges, suggesting future research directions to inspire microenvironment engineering and accelerate the practical application of H2O2 electrosynthesis is delivered.

         <title>Insight Into Intermediate Behaviors and Design Strategies of Platinum Group Metal&#8208;Based Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The primary focus of the review is on exploring the intermediate behaviors and catalyst strategies for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction on platinum group metal&#8208;based (Pt, Pd, Ir, Ru, Rh&#8208;based) materials. This review aims to provide strong support for comprehensively understanding the intricate alkaline HOR and vigorously developing the hydrogen fuel cell.








Abstract
Hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) can effectively convert the hydrogen energy through the hydrogen fuel cells, which plays an increasingly important role in the renewable hydrogen cycle. Nevertheless, when the electrolyte pH changes from acid to base, even with platinum group metal (PGM) catalysts, the HOR kinetics declines with several orders of magnitude. More critically, the pivotal role of reaction intermediates and interfacial environment during intermediate behaviors on alkaline HOR remains controversial.

     alt="Insight Into Intermediate Behaviors and Design Strategies of Platinum Group Metal-Based Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Catalysts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary focus of the review is on exploring the intermediate behaviors and catalyst strategies for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction on platinum group metal-based (Pt, Pd, Ir, Ru, Rh-based) materials. This review aims to provide strong support for comprehensively understanding the intricate alkaline HOR and vigorously developing the hydrogen fuel cell.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) can effectively convert the hydrogen energy through the hydrogen fuel cells, which plays an increasingly important role in the renewable hydrogen cycle. Nevertheless, when the electrolyte pH changes from acid to base, even with platinum group metal (PGM) catalysts, the HOR kinetics declines with several orders of magnitude. More critically, the pivotal role of reaction intermediates and interfacial environment during intermediate behaviors on alkaline HOR remains controversial. Therefore, exploring the exceptional PGM-based alkaline HOR electrocatalysts and identifying the reaction mechanism are indispensable for promoting the commercial development of hydrogen fuel cells. Consequently, the fundamental understanding of the HOR mechanism is first introduced, with emphases on the adsorption/desorption process of distinct reactive intermediates and the interfacial structure during catalytic process. Subsequently, with the guidance of reaction mechanism, the latest advances in the rational design of advanced PGM-based (Pt, Pd, Ir, Ru, Rh-based) alkaline HOR catalysts are discussed, focusing on the correlation between the intermediate behaviors and the electrocatalytic performance. Finally, given that the challenges standing in the development of the alkaline HOR, the prospect for the rational catalysts design and thorough mechanism investigation towards alkaline HOR are emphatically proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Segmented, Side&#8208;Emitting Hydrogel Optical Fibers for Multimaterial Extrusion Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft side&#8208;emitting optical fibers are fabricated by multimaterial extrusion printing of hydrogel inks with contrasting optical properties. Scattering segments are distributed along waveguiding fibers and allow tailored side emission of light. The side&#8208;emitting fibers can activate photophysical processes in a surrounding gel, showing potential for phototherapies.








Abstract
Side&#8208;emitting optical fibers allow light to be deliberately outcoupled along the fiber. Introducing a customized side&#8208;emission profile requires modulation of the guiding and emitting properties along the fiber length, which is a particular challenge in continuous processing of soft waveguides. In this work, it is demonstrated that multimaterial extrusion printing can generate hydrogel optical fibers with tailored segments for light&#8208;side emission. The fibers are based on diacrylated Pluronic F&#8208;127 (PluDA). 1&#160;mm diameter fibers are printed with segments of different optical properties by switching between a PluDA waveguiding ink and a PluDA scattering ink containing nanoparticles. The method allows the fabrication of fibers with segment lengths below 500 microns in a continuous process. The length of the segments is tailored by varying the switching time between inks during printing. Fibers with customized side&#8208;emission profiles along their length are presented. The functionality of the printed fibers is demonstrated by exciting fluorescence inside a surrounding 3D hydrogel. The presented technology and material combination allow unprecedented flexibility for designing soft optical fibers with customizable optical properties using simple processes and a medical material. This approach can be of interest to improve illumination inside tissues for photodynamic therapy (PDT).

         <title>Ba/Ti MOF: A Versatile Heterogeneous Photoredox Catalyst for Visible&#8208;Light Metallaphotocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile Ba/Ti&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Ba/Ti&#8208;MOF) is developed as a highly efficient photocatalyst, enabling the reduction and oxidation of both organic substrates and transition metals, including Ni, Cu, Co, and Pd, under ambient conditions. Unlike traditional homogeneous photocatalysts, this heterogeneous Ba/Ti&#8208;MOF addresses challenges related to scalability and recyclability, offering a robust platform for facilitating cross&#8208;coupling reactions via electron and energy transfer mechanisms. Notably, the Ba/Ti&#8208;MOF is reusable, cost&#8208;effective, and provides a sustainable, single&#8208;material solution for a wide range of efficient chemical processes, making it a promising candidate for industrial applications.








Abstract
The field of sustainable heterogeneous catalysis is evolving rapidly, with a strong emphasis on developing catalysts that enhance efficiency. Among various heterogeneous photocatalysts, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have gained significant attention for their exceptional performance in photocatalytic reactions. In this context, contrary to the conventional homogeneous iridium or ruthenium&#8208;based photocatalysts, which face significant challenges in terms of availability, cost, scalability, and recyclability, a new Ba/Ti MOF (ACM&#8208;4) is developed as a heterogeneous catalyst that can mimic/outperform the conventional photocatalysts, offering a more sustainable solution for efficient chemical processes. Its redox potential and triplet energy are comparable to or higher than the conventional catalysts, organic dyes, and metal semiconductors, enabling its use in both electron transfer and energy transfer applications. It facilitates a broad range of coupling reactions involving pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and natural products, and is compatible with various transition metals such as nickel, copper, cobalt, and palladium as co&#8208;catalysts. The effectiveness of the ACM&#8208;4 as a photocatalyst is supported by comprehensive material studies, photophysical, and recycling experiments. These significant findings underscore the potential of ACM&#8208;4 as a highly versatile and cost&#8208;effective photoredox catalyst, providing a sustainable, one&#8208;material solution for efficient chemical processes.

         <title>Metal Doping Enabling Defective CoMo&#8208;Layered Double Hydroxide Nanosheets as Highly Efficient Photosensitizers for NIR&#8208;II Photodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal doping is used to construct a series of defect&#8208;rich M&#8208;doped CoMo&#8208;layered double hydroxide (M = Mn, Cu, Al, Ni, Mg, Zn) photosensitizers for NIR&#8208;II photodynamic therapy (PDT). The defect&#8208;rich amorphous Zn&#8208;CoMo&#8208;LDH nanosheets exhibit the optimal PDT performance under NIR&#8208;II 1270 nm laser irradiation, achieving highly efficient cancer cell killing and tumor elimination.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is attracting widespread attention as a promising strategy for tumor treatment. However, the efficacy of PDT is severely limited by the insufficient tissue penetration depth of the light source and low reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation efficiency. Herein, the metal doping strategy is reported to construct a series of defect&#8208;rich M&#8208;doped amorphous CoMo&#8208;layered double hydroxide (a&#8208;M&#8208;CoMo&#8208;LDH, M = Mn, Cu, Al, Ni, Mg, Zn) photosensitizers (PSs) for NIR&#8208;II PDT. Especially, M&#8208;doped CoMo&#8208;LDH nanosheets are synthesized through a simple hydrothermal method and then etched by acid treatment to prepare defect&#8208;rich a&#8208;M&#8208;CoMo&#8208;LDH nanosheets. Under NIR&#8208;II 1270 nm laser irradiation, the defect&#8208;rich a&#8208;Zn&#8208;CoMo&#8208;LDH nanosheets exhibit the optimal PDT performance compared with other a&#8208;M&#8208;CoMo&#8208;LDH nanosheets, and also possess much higher ROS production activity (3.9 times) than that of the pristine a&#8208;CoMo&#8208;LDH, with a singlet oxygen quantum yield up to 1.86, which is the highest among all the reported PSs. After polyethylene glycol (PEG) modification, the a&#8208;Zn&#8208;CoMo&#8208;LDH&#8208;PEG nanosheets can function as an effective inorganic PS for PDT, effectively inducing cell apoptosis in vitro and eradicating tumors in vivo. Notably, transcriptome sequencing analysis and further molecular validation highlight the critical role of the apoptotic/p53/AMPK/oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathways in a&#8208;Zn&#8208;CoMo&#8208;LDH&#8208;PEG&#8208;induced cancer cell apoptosis.

         <title>Deep Learning&#8208;Assisted Design of Novel Donor&#8211;Acceptor Combinations for Organic Photovoltaic Materials with Enhanced Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors proposed a deep learning (DL)&#8208;assisted design framework for organic photovoltaic materials. A structure representation method (polymer fingerprints) is developed and DL models with high accuracy and generalizability are established. Novel D&#8208;A combinations with high efficiency are identified from 0.6 million virtual combinations. Experiments demonstrate that prediction accuracy is above 93% and one novel combination exhibits above 19.3% efficiency.








Abstract
Designing donor (D) and acceptor (A) structures and discovering promising D&#8208;A combinations can effectively improve organic photovoltaic (OPV) device performance. However, to obtain excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE), the trial&#8208;and&#8208;error structural design in the infinite chemical space is time&#8208;consuming and costly. Herein, a deep learning (DL)&#8208;assisted design framework for OPV materials is proposed. To effectively digitally represent the D and A structures, a structure representation method, polymer fingerprints, is developed, and a database of OPV materials is constructed. By applying an end&#8208;to&#8208;end graph neural network modeling method, high&#8208;precision DL models for predicting OPV performance are established. After combining the existing structures, &#8776;0.6 million virtual D&#8208;A combinations are generated. Then, the OPV performance of these candidate combinations is predicted by the well&#8208;trained models, and numbers of novel D&#8208;A combinations with high efficiency are identified. Experimental validations confirm that the prediction accuracy is greater than 93% and one of the screened combinations (i.e., D18:BTP&#8208;S11) exhibits an efficiency above 19.3% in single&#8208;junction organic solar cells. Finally, based on the structural gene analysis, the design rules to guide experimental explorations are suggested. The developed DL&#8208;assisted approach can accelerate the design of D&#8208;A combinations with ultrahigh efficiency and bring property breakthroughs for OPV devices.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing donor (D) and acceptor (A) structures and discovering promising D-A combinations can effectively improve organic photovoltaic (OPV) device performance. However, to obtain excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE), the trial-and-error structural design in the infinite chemical space is time-consuming and costly. Herein, a deep learning (DL)-assisted design framework for OPV materials is proposed. To effectively digitally represent the D and A structures, a structure representation method, polymer fingerprints, is developed, and a database of OPV materials is constructed. By applying an end-to-end graph neural network modeling method, high-precision DL models for predicting OPV performance are established. After combining the existing structures, &#8776;0.6 million virtual D-A combinations are generated. Then, the OPV performance of these candidate combinations is predicted by the well-trained models, and numbers of novel D-A combinations with high efficiency are identified. Experimental validations confirm that the prediction accuracy is greater than 93% and one of the screened combinations (i.e., D18:BTP-S11) exhibits an efficiency above 19.3% in single-junction organic solar cells. Finally, based on the structural gene analysis, the design rules to guide experimental explorations are suggested. The developed DL-assisted approach can accelerate the design of D-A combinations with ultrahigh efficiency and bring property breakthroughs for OPV devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constructing Highly Porous Low Iridium Anode Catalysts Via Dealloying for Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly porous iridium metal aerogels (MA), containing hierarchical pores and channels, are developed as efficient and durable oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). The developed Ir MA anode at a low Ir loading of 0.5 mgIr cm&#8722;2 demonstrated encouraging performance and durability in practical PEMWEs, significantly outperforming the commercial Ir black catalyst. The enhanced performance and durability of the Ir MA anode catalyst can be attributed to its unique morphological features for increased Ir utilization and favorable conversion from metallic Ir to oxidized Ir species during the OER with mitigated Ir dissolution.








Abstract
Iridium (Ir) is the most active and durable anode catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). However, their large&#8208;scale applications are hindered by high costs and scarcity of Ir. Lowering Ir loadings below 1.0 mgcm&#8722;2 causes significantly reduced PEMWE performance and durability. Therefore, developing efficient low Ir&#8208;based catalysts is critical to widely commercializing PEMWEs. Herein, an approach is presented for designing porous Ir metal aerogel (MA) catalysts via chemically dealloying IrCu alloys. The unique hierarchical pore structures and multiple channels of the Ir MA catalyst significantly increase electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and enhance OER activity compared to conventional Ir black catalysts, providing an effective solution to design low&#8208;Ir catalysts with improved Ir utilization and enhanced stability. An optimized membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with an Ir loading of 0.5 mgIr cm&#8722;2 generated 2.0 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.79&#160;V, higher than the Ir black at a loading of 2.0 mgIr cm&#8722;2 (1.63 A cm&#8722;2). The low&#8208;Ir MEA demonstrated an acceptable decay rate of &#8776;40 &#181;V h&#8722;1 during durability tests at 0.5 (&gt;1200 h) and 2.0 A cm&#8722;2 (400 h), outperforming the commercial Ir&#8208;based MEA (175 &#181;V h&#8722;1 at 2.0 mgIr cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Phase Engineering of Giant Second Harmonic Generation in Bi2O2Se</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain engineering of the ferroelectric phase transition leads to significant modulation of second harmonic generation (SHG) by six orders of magnitude in the high&#8208;performance semiconductor Bi2O2Se. The SHG signal of strained Bi2O2Se is an order of magnitude larger than that of NbOX2 (X = I, Cl) of similar thickness.









Abstract
2D materials with remarkable second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) hold promise for future on&#8208;chip nonlinear optics. Relevant materials with both giant SHG response and environmental stability are long&#8208;sought targets. Here, the enormous SHG from the phase engineering of a high&#8208;performance semiconductor, Bi2O2Se (BOS), under uniaxial strain, is demonstrated. SHG signals captured in strained 20 nm&#8208;BOS films exceed those of NbOI2 and NbOCl2 of similar thickness by a factor of 10, and are four orders of magnitude higher than monolayer&#8208;MoS2, resulting in a significant second&#8208;order nonlinear susceptibility on the order of 1 nm&#160;V&#8722;1. Intriguingly, the strain enables continuous adjustment of the ferroelectric phase transition across room temperature. An exceptionally large tunability of SHG, approximately six orders of magnitude, is achieved through strain modulation. This colossal SHG, originating from the geometric phase of Bloch wave functions and coupled with sensitive strain tunability in this air&#8208;stable 2D semiconductor, opens new possibilities for designing chip&#8208;scale, switchable nonlinear optical&#160;devices.

         <title>Extended Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Colloidal Quantum Dot Lasers with Nanosecond Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead sulphide (PbS) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are shown to be the first solution&#8208;processed gain medium to achieve lasing in the extended short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) spectral region. The size&#8208;dependent gain and charge dynamics are investigated to accurately predict, and realize, nanosecond lasing for the first time in PbS CQDs.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed gain media have great technological potential as lasers due to their ease of integration with on&#8208;chip photonics, scalability and tuneable optoelectronic properties. Currently, the spectral coverage of solution&#8208;processed lasers extends from visible up to telecom wavelengths in the short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) (&lt;1650&#160;nm). Here, the optical gain in the extended SWIR from 1600 nm to 2500&#160;nm is demonstrated, using PbSbased colloidal quantum dots (CQDs). This spectral region has many applications such as in LIDAR, biological imaging and environmental monitoring and is currently served by exotic, costly materials with limitedscalability. Using the CQDs in distributed feedback laser cavities, lasing with emission tuned between 2150 nm and 2500&#160;nm is reported. We show&#160;that due to the increased absorption cross&#8208;section of larger CQDs,&#160;the optical gain threshold is reduced by a factor of 36 compared to smaller&#8208;sized CQDs, reaching an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold down to 42 &#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, gain and lasing under nanosecond excitation are demonstrated for the first time from PbS CQDs and use transient absorption spectroscopy data to model nanosecond gain thresholds. This paves the way for realizing compact and practical CQD infrared lasers and potentially toward electrically driven laser diodes.

         <title>A Complex Concentrated Alloy with Record&#8208;High Strength&#8208;Toughness at 77 K</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assisted by domain&#8208;knowledge&#8208;informed machine learning, here a complex concentrated Fe35Co29Ni24Al10Ta2 alloy is designed, which uses twinnable L12 coherent nanoprecipitates in a high&#8208;volume fraction (&#8776;65 &#177; 3 vol.%) in a transformable FCC solid solution matrix. The combination of L12 twinning and FCC matrix transformation&#8208;induced plasticity are found to be highly effective in strengthening and strain hardening upon tensile straining at low temperature.








Abstract
High strength and large ductility, leading to a high material toughness (area under the stress&#8208;strain curve), are desirable for alloys used in cryogenic applications. Assisted by domain&#8208;knowledge&#8208;informed machine learning, here a complex concentrated Fe35Co29Ni24Al10Ta2 alloy is designed, which uses L12 coherent nanoprecipitates in a high volume fraction (&#8776;65 &#177; 3 vol.%) in a face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (FCC) solid solution matrix that undergoes FCC&#8208;to&#8208;body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) phase transformation upon tensile straining. Unlike FCC&#8208;to&#8208;BCT phase transformation involving brittle carbon&#8208;enriched martensite, the BCC martensite in this alloy does not cause brittleness at 77 K. The Fe35Co29Ni24Al10Ta2 multi&#8208;principal element alloy achieves a high yield strength &#8776;1.4&#160;GPa, a high work hardening rate &gt;4&#160;GPa, an ultimate tensile strength &#8776;2.25&#160;GPa, and a large uniform elongation &#8776;45%, leading to record&#8208;high material toughness compared with previous cryogenic alloys such as 316L series stainless steels and recent high&#8208;entropy alloys. The nanoprecipitates with nanoscale spacing (&#8776;7.5&#160;nm), apart from serving as dislocation obstacles for strengthening and dislocation sources for sustainable ductility, also undergo deformation twinning. Taken together, these mechanisms are found to be highly effective in strengthening and strain hardening upon tensile straining at liquid nitrogen temperature. These findings demonstrate how to effectively integrate strengthening mechanisms to synergize superior mechanical properties in special&#8208;purpose alloys.

The combination of L1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; twinning and FCC matrix transformation-induced plasticity are found to be highly effective in strengthening and strain hardening upon tensile straining at low temperature.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High strength and large ductility, leading to a high material toughness (area under the stress-strain curve), are desirable for alloys used in cryogenic applications. Assisted by domain-knowledge-informed machine learning, here a complex concentrated Fe&lt;sub&gt;35&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;29&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; alloy is designed, which uses L1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coherent nanoprecipitates in a high volume fraction (&#8776;65 &#177; 3 vol.%) in a face-centered-cubic (FCC) solid solution matrix that undergoes FCC-to-body-centered-cubic (BCC) phase transformation upon tensile straining. Unlike FCC-to-BCT phase transformation involving brittle carbon-enriched martensite, the BCC martensite in this alloy does not cause brittleness at 77 K. The Fe&lt;sub&gt;35&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;29&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; multi-principal element alloy achieves a high yield strength &#8776;1.4&#160;GPa, a high work hardening rate &amp;gt;4&#160;GPa, an ultimate tensile strength &#8776;2.25&#160;GPa, and a large uniform elongation &#8776;45%, leading to record-high material toughness compared with previous cryogenic alloys such as 316L series stainless steels and recent high-entropy alloys. The nanoprecipitates with nanoscale spacing (&#8776;7.5&#160;nm), apart from serving as dislocation obstacles for strengthening and dislocation sources for sustainable ductility, also undergo deformation twinning. Taken together, these mechanisms are found to be highly effective in strengthening and strain hardening upon tensile straining at liquid nitrogen temperature. These findings demonstrate how to effectively integrate strengthening mechanisms to synergize superior mechanical properties in special-purpose alloys.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydride&#8208;Induced Reconstruction of Pd Electrode Surfaces: A Combined Computational and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimizing electrocatalyst performance requires insights into surface and subsurface structures under reaction conditions. This study uncovers hydrogen&#8208;induced reconstruction processes on low&#8208;index palladium (Pd) surfaces during proton electroreduction by integrating computational and experimental approaches. The results reveal that surface roughness and morphological changes arise from hydrogen&#8208;induced hydride formation and subsequent reconstruction to minimize strain in PdHx/Pd&#8208;interfaces, and not from surface dissolution.








Abstract
Designing electrocatalysts with optimal activity and selectivity relies on a thorough understanding of the surface structure under reaction conditions. In this study, experimental and computational approaches are combined to elucidate reconstruction processes on low&#8208;index Pd surfaces during H&#8208;insertion following proton electroreduction. While electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy clearly reveals pronounced surface roughening and morphological changes on Pd(111), Pd(110), and Pd(100) surfaces during cyclic voltammetry, a complementary analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry excludes Pd dissolution as the primary cause of the observed restructuring. Large&#8208;scale molecular dynamics simulations further show that these surface alterations are related to the creation and propagation of structural defects as well as phase transformations that take place during hydride formation.

         <title>Bonding Optimization Strategies for Flexibly Preparing Multi&#8208;Component Piezoelectric Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible high piezoelectric film can be prepared by mixing crystal components with water&#8208;soluble polymer through co&#8208;dissolution&#8208;evaporation. Bonding optimization strategies, including choosing the PEO exhibiting weaker bonding interactions with crystal components, and slightly increasing the amount of either component of TMCM&#8208;CdCl3 during co&#8208;dissolution, can improve the crystallization yield and further enhance the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane d33 (&#8776;71 pC/N), and exceed most flexible piezoelectric materials.








Abstract
Flexible films with optimal piezoelectric performance and water&#8208;triggered dissolution behavior are fabricated using the co&#8208;dissolution&#8211;evaporation method by mixing trimethylchloromethyl ammonium chloride (TMCM&#8208;Cl), CdCl2, and polyethylene oxide (PEO, a water&#8208;soluble polymer). The resultant TMCM trichlorocadmium (TMCM&#8208;CdCl3) crystal/PEO film exhibited the highest piezoelectric coefficient (d33) compared to the films employing other polymers because PEO lacks electrophilic or nucleophilic side&#8208;chain groups and therefore exhibits relatively weaker and fewer bonding interactions with the crystal components. Furthermore, upon slightly increasing the amount of one precursor of TMCM&#8208;CdCl3 during co&#8208;dissolution, this component gained an advantage in the competition against PEO for bonding with the other precursor. This in turn improved the co&#8208;crystallization yield of TMCM&#8208;CdCl3 and further enhanced d33 to &#8776;71 pC/N, exceeding that of polyvinylidene fluoride (a commercial flexible piezoelectric) and most other molecular ferroelectric crystal&#8208;based flexible films. This study presents an important innovation and progress in the methodology and theory for maintaining a high piezoelectric performance during the preparation of flexible multi&#8208;component piezoelectric crystal films.

         <title>Tunable Mirror&#8208;Symmetric Type&#8208;III Ising Superconductivity in Atomically&#8208;Thin Natural Van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ising superconductors are known for remarkable resilience to external in&#8208;plane magnetic fields (B&#8741;) due to the protection of strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling fields &#945;SOC. By forming Cooper pairing states in mirror&#8208;symmetric Fermi surfaces with highly anisotropic &#945;SOC, a new type&#8208;III Ising superconductivity is discovered in atomically&#8208;thin natural van der Waals heterostructures of TaSe2/SnSe with anomalous B&#8741;&#8208;enhanced Tc.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) crystals with strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) provide great opportunities for exploring unconventional 2D superconductors, wherein new pairing states emerge due to the interplay of SOC with crystalline symmetries, electronic correlations, quenched disorders and external modulation forces, etc. Here, a distinct mirror&#8208;symmetry protected Ising pairing state with unprecedented &#915;&#8208; and M&#8208;valley symmetries in natural vdW heterostructures (vdWH) of interweaving tetragonal SnSe and trigonal 1H&#8208;TaSe2 monolayers is reported, in which the unidirectional lattice interlocking effectively suppresses the K&#8208;valley Ising pairing mechanism by incommensurate charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave (CDW) transitions. In the 2D limit of an TaSe2/SnSe bilayer with intact basal mirror symmetry (Mz), the mirror&#8208;symmetric vdWH Ising superconductors show anomalous in&#8208;plane magnetic field B&#8214;&#8208;controlled enhancements in the critical temperature Tc, which is completely absent for multilayer vdWHs with broken Mz induced by orthorhombic stacking between nearest&#8208;neighbour TaSe2 monolayers. The experimental observations consistently reveal a mirror symmetry&#8208;protected type&#8208;III Ising state in the inversion asymmetric lattice of 1H&#8208;TaSe2, which is predicted to be a mixture of spin&#8208;singlet and spin&#8208;triplet&#160;states.

         <title>Si&#8208;H Hydrosilane Reducing Agents for Size&#8208; and Shape&#8208;Controlled InAs Colloidal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel mild reducing agent that successfully produces large, uniform InAs colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) with excellent optoelectronic properties. The elimination of (TMS)3As in the synthesis overcomes a key practical barrier for exploiting and exploring the properties of large InAs CQDs in infrared optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
InAs colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are a promising heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free material for infrared optoelectronic devices. However, their synthesis is limited by their reagents: the acutely toxic and difficult to source tris(trimethylsilyl)arsine ((TMS)3As), as well as the strong reducing agents (e.g., Super Hydride). A reducing agent is introduced based on hydrosilanes (Si&#8208;H) to address both challenges. A synthesis strategy with this agent is demonstrated, resulting in monodisperse InAs CQDs with a tunable first excitonic peak between 520 and 900&#160;nm by hot injection, and between 900 and 1550&#160;nm by continuous injection. Furthermore, by avoiding the use of carboxyl group&#8208;containing compounds, such as oleic acid or indium acetate, the synthesis minimizes surface oxidation during InAs CQDs formation. The synthesized InAs CQDs are of high optoelectronic quality, with a lower concentration of deep trap states, as evident by the remarkable characteristics of photodetectors fabricated from these CQDs: low dark current (&#8776;150 nA&#160;cm&#8722;2), external quantum efficiency (32% at 900&#160;nm), and a fast photoresponse time (&#8776;4.4 &#181;s). The elimination of (TMS)3As in the synthesis overcomes a key practical barrier for exploiting and exploring the properties of large InAs CQDs in optoelectronic applications.

&lt;p&gt;This study introduces a novel mild reducing agent that successfully produces large, uniform InAs colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) with excellent optoelectronic properties. The elimination of (TMS)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;As in the synthesis overcomes a key practical barrier for exploiting and exploring the properties of large InAs CQDs in infrared optoelectronic applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InAs colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are a promising heavy-metal-free material for infrared optoelectronic devices. However, their synthesis is limited by their reagents: the acutely toxic and difficult to source tris(trimethylsilyl)arsine ((TMS)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;As), as well as the strong reducing agents (e.g., Super Hydride). A reducing agent is introduced based on hydrosilanes (Si-H) to address both challenges. A synthesis strategy with this agent is demonstrated, resulting in monodisperse InAs CQDs with a tunable first excitonic peak between 520 and 900&#160;nm by hot injection, and between 900 and 1550&#160;nm by continuous injection. Furthermore, by avoiding the use of carboxyl group-containing compounds, such as oleic acid or indium acetate, the synthesis minimizes surface oxidation during InAs CQDs formation. The synthesized InAs CQDs are of high optoelectronic quality, with a lower concentration of deep trap states, as evident by the remarkable characteristics of photodetectors fabricated from these CQDs: low dark current (&#8776;150 nA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), external quantum efficiency (32% at 900&#160;nm), and a fast photoresponse time (&#8776;4.4 &#181;s). The elimination of (TMS)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;As in the synthesis overcomes a key practical barrier for exploiting and exploring the properties of large InAs CQDs in optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Monolayer Magnetic Metal with Scalable Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design of metallic 2D magnets presents a formidable challenge to materials science. This work demonstrates that the recently discovered 2D magnet GdAlSi remains metallic down to a single monolayer. The material conductivity is scalable with the number of monolayers. The GdAlSi layers are monolithically integrated with Si and make a highly promising material for ultra&#8208;compact spintronics.








Abstract
2D magnets have emerged as a class of materials highly promising for studies of quantum phenomena and applications in ultra&#8208;compact spintronics. Current research aims at design of 2D magnets with particular functional properties. A formidable challenge is to produce metallic monolayers: the material landscape of layered magnetic systems is strongly dominated by insulators; rare metallic magnets, such as Fe3GeTe2, become insulating as they approach the monolayer limit. Here, electron transport measurements demonstrate that the recently discovered 2D magnet GdAlSi &#8211; graphene&#8208;like AlSi layers coupled to layers of Gd atoms &#8211; remains metallic down to a single monolayer. Band structure analysis indicates the material to be an electride, which may stabilize the metallic state. Remarkably, the sheet conductance of 2D GdAlSi is proportional to the number of monolayers &#8211; a manifestation of scalable conductivity. The GdAlSi layers are epitaxially integrated with silicon, facilitating applications in electronics.

         <title>Printable and Tunable Bioresin with Strategically Decorated Molecular Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Personalized medical implants require an advanced material system for bone integration and bio&#8208;acceptability. This research reports developing novel, printable, and agile resins that eclipse bio inertness asymptote and demonstrate tunable biomechanical performance with molecular decorations, including osteoinductive and antibacterial agents. Strategies to 3D print surrogates with bone microstructures are also introduced, accelerating the transformative potential in clinical settings.









Abstract
As personalized medicine rapidly evolves, there is a critical demand for advanced biocompatible materials surpassing current additive manufacturing capabilities. This study presents a novel printable bioresin engineered with tunable mechanical, thermal, and biocompatibility properties through strategic molecular modifications. The study introduces a new bioresin comprising methyl methacrylate (MMA), ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), and a photoinitiator, which is further enhanced by incorporating high molecular weight polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) to improve biostability and mechanical performance. The integration of printable PMMA presents several synthesis and processing challenges, necessitating substantial modifications to the 3D printing process. Additionally, the bioresin is functionalized with antibacterial silver oxide and bone&#8208;growth&#8208;promoting hydroxyapatite at various weight ratios to extend its application further. The results demonstrate the agile printability of the novel bioresin and its potential for transformative impact in biomedical applications, offering a versatile material platform for additive manufacturing&#8208;enabled personalized medicine. This work highlights the adaptability of the novel printable bioresin for real&#8208;life applications and its capacity for multiscale structural tailoring, potentially achieving properties comparable to native tissues and extending beyond conventional additive manufacturing techniques.

         <title>Probiotics Bi&#8208;Enzymatic Cascade Repair System for Editing the Inflammatory Microenvironment to Boost Probiotic Therapy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel cascade repair system that enhances probiotic therapy for inflammatory bowel disease. By utilizing iMXene to neutralize harmful reactive oxygen species and delivering a gene&#8208;editing system, it activates the NLRP12 gene to reduce inflammation. The approach significantly improves intestinal health and restores microbial balance, showing promise for broader applications in managing inflammatory conditions.








Abstract
Inflammatory bowel disease presents significant treatment challenges owing to its complex pathology. Although probiotics have shown promise as a therapeutic option, their effectiveness is often limited by low concentrations at sites of inflammation, exacerbated by excessive reactive oxygen species and inflammatory triggers. To address this, an innovative cascade repair system is developed to enhance probiotic therapeutic impact by modulating the intestinal microenvironment. This system uses iMXene's catalytic properties to neutralize reactive oxygen species in the gut and its capacity to deliver the CRISPR/dCas9 gene editing system to activate the NLR family pyrin domain containing 12 genes, helping suppress inflammation. By promoting the colonization of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, the system inhibits inflammation pathways and supports the restoration of a balanced intestinal flora through a cascade repair mechanism. These findings demonstrate significant therapeutic benefits in experimental models, with improvements in the overall well&#8208;being of treated mice and effective repair of intestinal inflammation damage. This pioneering approach holds promise for inflammatory bowel disease treatment and opens new avenues for managing other inflammatory conditions, offering valuable insights and guidance for future research into inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Ternary Compensation Enables High&#8208;sensitive Efficient Upconversion Device for NIR Visualization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic upconversion devices (UCDs) offer a promising alternative to crystalline photodiodes for infrared visualization, overcoming opacity and complex processes. A ternary compensation strategy is implemented in a non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based active layer, reducing dark current and enhancing detection. The device achieved 16.68% upconversion efficiency at 980 nm and features a large&#8208;area, lightweight, pixel&#8208;less, and semitransparent design, advancing infrared visualization technology.








Abstract
Beyond the crystalline photodiodes for infrared visualization, with the limitation of opacity and complex lithographic processes, organic upconversion device (UCD) have emerged as a potential alternative. In this research, a ternary compensation strategy is implemented in a non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based active layer to reduce the dark current of the detector and enhance its detection performance, which enables high&#8208;sensitive efficient upconversion device for near&#8208;infrared light (NIR) visualization. The device achieves an infrared&#8208;to&#8208;visible upconversion efficiency of 16.68% when resolving the 980 nm infrared signal at a power density of 0.4 mW cm&#8722;2. In addition, by replacing the semitransparent matrix electrodes, a large&#8208;area (12.25 cm2) is further fabricated, lightweight (6.5&#160;g containing encapsulation), pixel&#8208;less (equivalent resolution 1270 ppi), and semitransparent (AVT &#8776;40%) UCD with microsecond response time. The fabricated UCD is demonstrated in pixel&#8208;less active infrared naked&#8208;eye visualization and infrared counter&#8208;surveillance, fostering the advancement of infrared visualization technology.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Optoelectronic Graded Neurons for Dual&#8208;Waveband Image Fusion and Motion Perception</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;waveband image fusion and motion perception have been achieved in optoelectronic synaptic devices featuring nano&#8208;wedge/MoS&#8322; heterostructure channels. The arrayed optoelectronic graded neurons in these devices enable in&#8208;memory simultaneous encoding and processing of spatiotemporal motion information at both 633 and 980 nm wavelengths.








Abstract
Motion recognition based on vision detectors requires the synchronous encoding and processing of temporal and spatial information in wide wavebands. Here, the dual&#8208;waveband sensitive optoelectronic synapses performing as graded neurons are reported for high&#8208;accuracy motion recognition and perception. Wedge&#8208;shaped nanostructures are designed and fabricated on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) monolayers, leading to plasmon&#8208;enhanced wideband absorption across the visible to near&#8208;infrared spectral range. Due to the charge trapping and release at shallow trapping centers within the device channel, the optoelectronic graded neurons demonstrate remarkable photo&#8208;induced conductance plasticity at both 633 and 980&#160;nm wavelengths. A dynamic vision system consisting of 20 &#215; 20 optoelectronic neurons demonstrates remarkable capabilities in the precise detection and perception of various motions. Moreover, neural network computing systems have been built as visual motion perceptron to identify target object movement. The recognition accuracy of dual&#8208;wavelength fused images for various motion trajectories has experienced a remarkable enhancement, transcending the previous level of less than 80% to impressive values exceeding 99%.

         <title>Efficient Quasi&#8208;Homogenous Photocatalysis Enabled by Molecular Nanophotocatalysts with Donor&#8208;Acceptor Motif</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small molecule&#8208;based quasi&#8208;homogeneous nanophotocatalyst is developed by solution&#8208;processing of donor&#8208;acceptor molecules from micrometer&#8208;sized powder into &#8776;60&#160;nm uniform nanoparticles assisted by hydrophilic surfactants. This quasi&#8208;homogeneous photocatalyst demonstrated greatly improved light&#8208;harvesting, water&#8208;wettability, and exciton dissociation, resulting in distinctly enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate from a negligible level.








Abstract
Polymer semiconductors have attracted much attention for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, but they typically exhibit micrometer&#8208;sized particles in water&#8208;suspension, causing severe loss in light absorption and exciton recombination. Here a molecular nanophotocatalyst featuring a donor&#8208;acceptor motif is presented that solution is processed via a facile stirring nanoprecipitation method assisted by hydrophilic surfactants, enabling an efficient quasi&#8208;homogenous hydrogen evolution. In contrast to the original bulk powder (heterogeneous system), these quasi&#8208;homogenous nanophotocatalysts exhibit significantly improved light&#8208;harvesting, water&#8208;wettability, and exciton dissociation, resulting in distinctly enhanced (by four&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude) photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate. The optimized nanophotocatalysts (4CzPN/DDBAB/SDBS) generate an outstanding hydrogen evolution rate&#160;of 116.42&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and apparent quantum yield of 30.2% at 365&#160;nm, which are among the highest reported for single&#8208;junction organic photocatalysts. The scalability of the quasi&#8208;homogenous photocatalysts is further demonstrated using a flow&#8208;based flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) processing.

         <title>Electrical Dissipation Factor Measurements of Droplet Impact&#8208;Derived Microgels with Different Topological Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing rapid cross&#8208;linking, the study captures magnetic microgels with different macroscopic topological structures from droplet evolution. The study investigates the effect of the topological structures on the physical properties of macroscopic model materials and discovers that the toroidal structures of genus (1) exhibit a high intensity of electrical dissipation and can be tuned through assembling and symmetry breaking at low frequencies.








Abstract
Topology, the study of properties that are invariant under continuous transformations, in which the number of pores (genus) is a profound concept that determines a number of properties that have been verified in many microscopic systems, but have not been studied in macroscopic materials. Microgels are widely used materials, and based on microfluidics, regular, stable, and reproducible microgels can be prepared, but studies from the perspective of topological principles have not been reported. In this paper, a system based on a boric acid ester rapid cross&#8208;linking strategy that can rapidly capture topological changes during the transient process of droplet&#8208;to&#8208;ring transition is proposed. The electrical dissipation properties associated with different transient topologies during the process are also investigated, demonstrating that the change of topological structures in macroscopic materials also affected their electrical properties, laying the foundation for the design of modulated macroscopic micro structured materials based on topology theory.

         <title>Thermionic Emission in Artificially Structured Single&#8208;Crystalline Elemental Metal/Compound Semiconductor Superlattices</title>

         <dc:description>
Rawat et al. present a novel class of epitaxial lattice&#8208;matched metal/semiconductor superlattice by pairing refractory hexagonal elemental metals and wide&#8208;bandgap III&#8208;nitride semiconductors. Exemplified by the Hf/AlN as an archetypical system, cross&#8208;plane thermionic emission and significant enhancement in cross&#8208;plane Seebeck coefficient attributed to carrier energy filtering by Schottky barriers are demonstrated.








Abstract
Metal/semiconductor superlattices represent a fascinating frontier in materials science and nanotechnology, where alternating layers of metals and semiconductors are precisely engineered at the atomic and nano&#8208;scales. Traditionally, epitaxial metal/semiconductor superlattice growth requires constituent materials from the same family, exhibiting identical structural symmetry and low lattice mismatch. Here, beyond this conventional constraint, a novel class of epitaxial lattice&#8208;matched metal/semiconductor superlattices is introduced that utilizes refractory hexagonal elemental transition metals and wide&#8208;bandgap III&#8208;nitride semiconductors. Exemplified by the Hf/AlN superlattices exhibiting coherent layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer epitaxial growth, cross&#8208;plane thermionic emission is observed through current&#8211;voltage measurements accomplished for the first time in any metal/semiconductor superlattices. Further, thermoreflectance measurements reveal significant enhancement in cross&#8208;plane Seebeck coefficients attributed to carrier energy filtering by Schottky barriers. Demonstration of artificially structured elemental&#8208;metal/wide&#8208;bandgap compound&#8208;semiconductor superlattices promises to usher in new fundamental physics studies and cutting&#8208;edge applications such as tunable hyperbolic metamaterials, quantum computing, and thermionic&#8208;emission&#8208;based thermoelectric and thermophotonic energy conversion devices.

         <title>Sonoactivated Z&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction for Enhanced Sonodynamic Mitophagy Inhibition and Triple Negative Breast Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports on the engineering of a liquid Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction nanosonosensitizer&#8208;based sonodynamic mitophagy inhibition strategy for inducing enhanced sonodynamic therapy (SDT) efficacy synergistic with self&#8208;protective mitophagy inhibition against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer, offering a promising &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; tumor&#8208;killing paradigm.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has emerged as a potent therapeutic modality to generate intratumoral toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) in combating refractory triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, its therapeutic efficacy is compromised due to pro&#8208;survival cancer&#8208;cell mitophagy to mitigate mitochondrial oxidative damage. Here, an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; tumor&#8208;therapeutic strategy that integrates nanosonosensitizer&#8208;augmented noninvasive SDT with mitophagy inhibition is reported. This is achieved using a rationally constructed sonoactivated liquid Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction that connects sonosensitizer PtCu3 nanocages and mitophagy&#8208;blocking sonosensitizer BP nanosheets via an amphipathic organic linker (PEI&#8208;PEG5000&#8208;C18). The conjugated electron mediator (M, Cp*Rh(phen)Cl) is strategically positioned between the 2 sonosensitizers to facilitate electron transfer. This M&#8208;based Z&#8208;scheme configuration prolongs the separation of sonoactivated electron&#8208;hole pairs, leading to efficient ROS generation upon ultrasound stimulation. Importantly, Cu2+ released from PtCu3 expedites BP degradation by reducing phosphorus vacancy formation energy, improving the overall biodegradability of BP&#8208;M&#8208;PtCu3 and favoring phosphate ions production. These ions elevate lysosomal pH, inhibiting the hydrolysis of damaged mitochondria within autophagic lysosomes, thus preventing cancer cell self&#8208;preservation under oxidative stress and effectively eliminating TNBC.

     alt="Sonoactivated Z-Scheme Heterojunction for Enhanced Sonodynamic Mitophagy Inhibition and Triple Negative Breast Cancer Treatment"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work reports on the engineering of a liquid Z-scheme heterojunction nanosonosensitizer-based sonodynamic mitophagy inhibition strategy for inducing enhanced sonodynamic therapy (SDT) efficacy synergistic with self-protective mitophagy inhibition against triple-negative breast cancer, offering a promising &#8220;all-in-one&#8221; tumor-killing paradigm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has emerged as a potent therapeutic modality to generate intratumoral toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) in combating refractory triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, its therapeutic efficacy is compromised due to pro-survival cancer-cell mitophagy to mitigate mitochondrial oxidative damage. Here, an &#8220;all-in-one&#8221; tumor-therapeutic strategy that integrates nanosonosensitizer-augmented noninvasive SDT with mitophagy inhibition is reported. This is achieved using a rationally constructed sonoactivated liquid Z-scheme heterojunction that connects sonosensitizer PtCu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanocages and mitophagy-blocking sonosensitizer BP nanosheets via an amphipathic organic linker (PEI-PEG&lt;sub&gt;5000&lt;/sub&gt;-C18). The conjugated electron mediator (M, Cp*Rh(phen)Cl) is strategically positioned between the 2 sonosensitizers to facilitate electron transfer. This M-based Z-scheme configuration prolongs the separation of sonoactivated electron-hole pairs, leading to efficient ROS generation upon ultrasound stimulation. Importantly, Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; released from PtCu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; expedites BP degradation by reducing phosphorus vacancy formation energy, improving the overall biodegradability of BP-M-PtCu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and favoring phosphate ions production. These ions elevate lysosomal pH, inhibiting the hydrolysis of damaged mitochondria within autophagic lysosomes, thus preventing cancer cell self-preservation under oxidative stress and effectively eliminating TNBC. It is believe that the M-based sonoactivated Z-scheme heterojunction will be a promising sonosensitizer structure, and the sonodynamic mitophagy inhibition strategy offers valuable prospects for cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystallinity&#8208;Controlled Hexagonal Boron Nitride&#8208;Based Memristors for Fully Integrated Reservoir Computing Processors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallinity&#8208;controlled h&#8208;BN films are synthesized using the PECVD method. Memristors based on h&#8208;BN films exhibit reservoir dynamics and synaptic characteristics depending on the films&#8217; crystallinity. The fully integrated reservoir computing processor is realized by integrating the physical reservoir and readout synapse devices in three dimensions. The integrated processor demonstrates excellent temporal data processing capabilities.








Abstract
Memristors based on 2D materials (2DMs) have attracted considerable research interest due to their excellent switching performance. Former synthesis methods for 2DMs aimed to synthesize 2DMs with a large grain size. However, these methods cause a stochastic distribution of defects in high&#8208;density memristor arrays, resulting in device nonuniformity. Moreover, high synthesis temperatures and mechanical transfer make it difficult to implement large&#8208;area memristor arrays and additional integration. Therefore, synthesis methods of nanocrystalline 2DMs for memristors are essential. In this study, crystallinity&#8208;controlled hexagonal boron nitride is&#160;directly synthesized&#160;on metal electrodes, and a fully integrated memristor&#8208;based reservoir computing processor is implemented. Memristors using nanocrystalline hexagonal boron nitride (NC h&#8208;BN) exhibit volatile switching and reliable reservoir dynamics. Memristors using amorphous boron nitride (a&#8208;BN) exhibit nonvolatile switching and linear potentiation/depression curves (&#945;P = &#8722;0.475, &#945;D = 0.656). By integrating NC h&#8208;BN and a&#8208;BN memristors in three dimensions, an efficient reservoir computing processor with integrated reservoir and readout layers is realized. Overall, the neural network of the integrated processor shows high accuracy for inferring temporal data. Hence, the crystallinity&#8208;controlled hexagonal boron nitride synthesis method paves the way for the realization of fully integrated reservoir computing processors.

         <title>Large Scale Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Polycrystalline Wafer Achieved by Hot&#8208;Pressed Strategy for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hot&#8208;pressed AG3Bi2I9 (AG: aminoguanidinium) polycrystalline wafers possess a high mobility&#8208;lifetime product of 5.66 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1 and therefore achieve high X&#8208;ray sensitivity of 2675 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. Besides, the wafers have the X&#8208;ray detection limit as low as 11.8 nGy s&#8722;1, excellent long&#8208;term working stability, and high spatial resolution of 5.9 lp mm&#8722;1 in imaging.








Abstract
Halide perovskites (HPs) have demonstrated excellent direct X&#8208;ray detection performance. Lead&#8208;free perovskite polycrystalline wafers have outstanding advantages in large&#8208;area X&#8208;ray imaging applications due to their area&#8208;scalability, thickness&#8208;controllability, large bulk resistivity, and ease of integration with large&#8208;area thin film transistor arrays. However, currently lead&#8208;free perovskite polycrystalline wafers possess low sensitivity, typically less than 1000 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, which severely limits their X&#8208;ray detection applications. Here, high&#8208;quality and large scale polycrystalline wafers of AG3Bi2I9 (AG: aminoguanidinium) with short intercluster distances are successfully prepared using a hot&#8208;pressing method. The wafers possess high mobility&#8208;lifetime product of 5.66 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1 and therefore achieve high X&#8208;ray sensitivity of 2675 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, which can be comparable to those of the high&#8208;quality single crystal counterpart reported by the previous research (7.94 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1 and 5791 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2), and represent the best results of the currently lead&#8208;free HP polycrystalline wafers. Besides, the wafers exhibit the X&#8208;ray detection limit as low as 11.8 nGy s&#8722;1, excellent long&#8208;term working stability, and high spatial resolution of 5.9 lp mm&#8722;1 in imaging. The findings demonstrate that AG3Bi2I9 polycrystalline wafers are feasible for high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detection and imaging system.

         <title>Macro&#8208;Superlubricity Induced by Tribocatalysis of High&#8208;Entropy Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach harnessed High&#8208;Entropy Ceramics (CrNbTiAlV)N to achieve durable superlubricity. This solid&#8211;liquid composite lubrication system demonstrates an exceptionally long lifespan and minimal wear rate. In situ formation of High&#8208;Entropy Ceramics nanocrystals expedited PA molecule hydrolysis, leading to inositol generation and decreased frictional resistance.








Abstract
Macroscale superlubricity has attracted considerable attention as a promising strategy to minimize frictional energy dissipation and achieve near&#8208;zero wear. However, realizing macroscale superlubricity with prolonged durability remains an immense challenge, particularly on engineering steels. Current superlubricants render steel surfaces susceptible to corrosion, causing severe wear and superlubrication failure. Herein, high&#8208;entropy ceramics (HEC) with catalytic properties are innovatively introduced to prevent corrosion of engineering steels and achieve macro&#8208;superlubricity through tribo&#8208;catalytic effect. Furthermore, this catalytically induced superlubricity system exhibits an ultra&#8208;low friction coefficient of 0.0037 under contact pressure up to 1.47 GPa, an ultra&#8208;long cycle lifetime of 1.25 &#215; 106 cycles (corresponding sliding distance up to 5 km), and an extremely low wear rate of 3.032 &#215; 10&#8722;10 mm3&#183;N&#8722;1&#183;m&#8722;1 on the HEC surface. Based on the experimental analysis and theoretical simulation, the in situ formed HEC nanocrystals reduce the Gibbs free energy of hydrolysis of PA molecules into inositol and phosphoric acid molecules in the lubricant. Notably, the hydrolysis products favorably contributed to the reduction of shear force in the lubrication system, which is essential for achieving macroscale superlubricity over a long time. This study provides a new perspective for designing robust superlubricity systems by harnessing the tribocatalytic effect of high&#8208;entropy materials.

         <title>Grain&#8208;Boundary Elimination via Liquid Medium Annealing toward High&#8208;Efficiency Sb2Se3 Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8208;medium annealing strategy is demonstrated to regulate the crystallization of Sb2Se3 thin films. The resultant Sb2Se3 thin films show high&#8208;quality crystallinity, large grain size, benign [hk1]&#8208;orientation, and low&#8208;density defects. As a result, the film delivers a solar cell efficiency of 9.28%, which is one of the highest efficiencies among Sb2Se3 solar cells fabricated by the thermal evaporation method.








Abstract
Suppression of charge recombination caused by unfavorable grain boundaries (GBs) in polycrystalline thin films is essential for improving the optoelectronic performance of semiconductor devices. For emerging antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) materials, the unique quasi&#8208;1D structure intensifies the dependence of GB properties on the grain size and orientation, which also increases the impact of defects related to grain structure on device performance. However, these characteristics pose significant challenges in the preparation of thin films. In this study, a novel annealing approach using ammonia&#8211;thiourea is developed mixed solution as the liquid medium (LM) to finely regulate the crystallization of Sb2Se3 films, resulting in micron&#8208;sized large grains with enhanced [hk1] orientation and fewer defects. Mechanistic studies indicate that the intermediate phase formed at the GBs promotes the growth of large grains. Moreover, LM creates a closed and uniform environment for thin&#8208;film annealing, suppressing the volatilization of Se and reducing the types of deep&#8208;level defects. Consequently, the film delivers a device efficiency of 9.28%, the highest efficiency achieved for Sb2Se3 solar cells fabricated via thermal evaporation. Hence, this study provides a facile and effective annealing method for controlling the crystallization of low&#8208;dimensional materials and offers valuable guidance for the development of chalcogenide materials.

         <title>Highly&#8208;Buckled Nanofibrous Ceramic Aerogels with Ultra&#8208;Large Stretchability and Tensile&#8208;Insensitive Thermal Insulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bio&#8208;inspired design and synthesis of ultra&#8208;stretchable ceramic aerogels based on highly buckled nanofibers is reported to solve the formidable fiber fracture in ceramic aerogels. The resulting material features unusual combination of ultra&#8208;large stretchability, excellent thermomechanical stability and tensile&#8208;insensitive thermal insulating property, which addresses the critical and bottleneck problem of low structural stability induced thermal runaway in ceramic aerogels.








Abstract
Ceramic aerogels have exhibited many superior characteristics with promising applications. As an attractive material system for thermal insulation under extreme conditions, ceramic aerogels are required to withstand complex thermomechanical stress to retain their super&#8208;insulating properties but, they often suffer from severe fracture damage that can lead to catastrophic failure. Herein, inspired by the tendrils of Parthenocissus, we report a design and synthesis of ultra&#8208;stretchable ceramic aerogels constructed by highly buckled nanofibers. The buckling of nanofibers is formed by asymmetric deformation through two&#8208;component off&#8208;axial electrospinning method. The resulting aerogels feature an ultra&#8208;large stretchability with a tensile strain of up to 150% and high restorability with a tensile strain of up to 80%. They also display a near&#8208;zero Poisson's ratio (4.3 &#215; 10&#8722;2) and a near&#8208;zero thermal expansion coefficient (2.6 &#215; 10&#8722;7 per&#160;&#176;C), resulting in excellent thermomechanical stability. Benefiting from this ultra&#8208;stretchability, the aerogels exhibit a unique tensile&#8208;insensitive thermal insulation performance with thermal conductivities remaining only &#8776;106.7 mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 1000&#160;&#176;C. This work promotes the development of ceramic aerogels for robust thermal insulation under extreme conditions and establishes a set of fundamental considerations in structural design of stretchable aerogels for a wide spectrum of applications.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Electric Polarization in Entropy&#8208;Driven Perovskites for Boosting Dielectric Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing advanced electron microscopy and differential phase contrast imaging techniques, entropy&#8208;driven atomic fluctuations, structural disorder, and atomic&#8208;level electric field polarization are visualized in perovskite oxides. This study reveals the atomic&#8208;scale mechanisms by which structural disorder&#8208;induced electric polarization enhances macroscopic dielectric response properties.








Abstract
Dielectric oxides with robust relaxation responses&#160;are fundamental for electronic devices utilized in energy absorption, conversion, and storage. However, the structural origins governing the dielectric response remain elusive due to the involvement of atomically complex compositional and structural environments. Herein, configurational entropy is introduced as a regulatory factor to precisely control the structural heterogeneity in representative perovskite dielectric oxides. Through advanced structural and electric field visualization studies, a novel quantitative relationship is established between atomic&#8208;level structural disorder&#8208;induced electric field polarization and macroscopic dielectric properties. The results indicate that the degree of atomic delocalization in perovskite oxides exhibits a near&#8208;parabolic trend with increasing entropy, reaching a maximum in medium&#8208;entropy perovskite. Correspondingly, the atomic electric field vectors display significant asymmetrical distribution, thus greatly enhancing angstrom&#8208;scale electric field polarization. Then, it is experimentally proven that entropy&#8208;driven electric polarization can improve the dielectric relaxation behavior characterized by broader frequency and stronger intensity of electromagnetic energy absorption, with improvements of approximately 160% and 413% compared to structurally homogeneous control. This study unveils the quantitative correlation between angstrom&#8208;scale electric field polarization and dielectric response in perovskite oxides, offering a novel perspective for exploring the structure&#8211;property&#160;relationship in dielectric materials.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processable Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Featuring Highly Tunable Dynamic Aggregation States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Processibility tuning of MOFs has always been a significant but challenging goal. Herein, a solution&#8208;processable MOF, NKU&#8208;Mg&#8208;1, is successfully constructed by utilizing the behavior of dynamic coordination bonds, achieving facile manipulation of the aggregation state. Its intrinsic solution processability and multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive emission features make it a promising candidate material for expanding multifunctional luminescent (e.g. circularly polarized luminescence) applications.








Abstract
The limited processability of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is hindered flexibility in the manipulation of their aggregation state and applications. Therefore, achieving highly processable MOFs is of great significance but a challenging goal. Herein, a facile strategy is presented for achieving the construction of solution&#8208;processable Mg&#8208;based MOF, NKU&#8208;Mg&#8208;1, allowing for dynamic control of the aggregation state through dynamic self&#8208;assembly (DySA) process and reversible circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switcher modulation. Notably, micron&#8208;sized crystals of NKU&#8208;Mg&#8208;1 can be readily dispersed in water to form nano&#8208;sized colloids, triggered by the dynamic COO&#8208;Mg coordination bonding interruption by the competitive H2O&#8208;Mg bonding. Accordingly, the aggregation state of the colloid MOF can be readily tuned from 50&#8211;80&#160;nm up to 1000&#160;nm, in turn enabling control of aggregation&#8208;dependent emission. Specially, the solid&#8208;phase aggregation can be controlled via structural transitions between 3D NKU&#8208;Mg&#8208;1&#8208;rec&#8208;1 and 2D NKU&#8208;Mg&#8208;1&#8208;rec&#8208;2 nano&#8208;crystals, as confirmed by 3D electron diffraction. Furthermore, benefiting from its highly dynamic tunable aggregation nature, the rational incorporation of the chiral module confers significant CPL activity (glum up to 0.01). Importantly, controllable dynamic aggregation enables reversible switching of the CPL activity by precisely regulating the aggregation states. The solution&#8208;processable and dynamic aggregation&#8208;tunable features endow it highly promising for applications.

In this study, thiomalic acid (TA) is introduced into the perovskite precursor solution to suppress defects caused by light&#8208;induced iodide ion migration, thereby enhancing the photo&#8208;stability of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites. The sulfhydryl group on TA can resist oxygen corrosion, which also imparts good air stability to the Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite. Ultimately, it is fabricated a two&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cell that achieved a power conversion efficiency of 28.6% with improved operational stability.








Abstract
Research on mixed Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is gaining significant attention due to their potential for high efficiency in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. However, Sn2+ in Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite is susceptible to oxidation, leading to a high defect density. The oxidation primarily occurs through two pathways: one involving a reaction with oxygen, and the other related to iodine defects, which generate I2 and further accelerate the oxidation of Sn2&#8314;, greatly reducing stability. First, to tackle the photo&#8208;stability issues caused by iodine defects, amber acid (AA) is screened as the additive. The Carboxyl group on AA can strongly coordinate with Sn2+, reinforcing the Sn&#9472;I bond and electrostatically interacting with negatively charged defects. This interaction inhibits the photoinduced formation of I2 and the subsequent oxidation of Sn2+, thereby enhancing the stability of Sn&#9472;Pb PSCs under continuous illumination. Building on the foundation of AA, a reductive sulfhydryl group is introduced to synthesize thiomalic acid (TA). It inhibits the formation of Sn4+ in both the perovskite precursor and the perovskite film, thereby improving air stability while maintaining strong photostability. Consequently, single PSCs achieved a champion efficiency of 22.7%. The best&#8208;performing two&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 28.6% with improved operational stability.

         <title>Superconductivity up to 14.2 K in MnB4 Under Pressure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superconductivity in 3d&#8208;transition metal&#8208;based compounds with magnetic elements is important and rare. This study reports the discovery of pressure induced superconductivity in MnB4 with the highest onset transition temperature (14.2 K) among the stoichiometric Mn&#8208;based superconductors. This work offers a promising avenue to explore high&#8208;Tc superconductivity by combining the 3d&#8208;transition metal magnetic elements and light elements.








Abstract
The discovery of superconductivity in 3d transition&#8208;metal compounds with strong magnetism is interesting but rare. Especially for Mn&#8208;based compounds, there exist only very limited materials that show superconductivity. Here, the discovery of superconductivity is reported with an onset transition temperature up to 14.2 K in a Mn&#8208;based material MnB4, which is the highest value among the stoichiometric Mn&#8208;based superconductors. By applying high pressure, the continuous suppression of a weak semiconducting behavior and the occurrence of superconductivity after &#8776;30 GPa are found. With further increasing pressure, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is gradually enhanced and reaches the maximum onset transition value of &#8776;14.2&#160;K at 150 GPa. The synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction data reveal the unchanged monoclinic (S.G: P21/c) symmetry but an unusual crossover of the lattice parameters b and c in a certain pressure region as confirmed by the theoretical calculation. The findings show a promising way to explore high Tc superconductivity by combining the 3d&#8208;transition metal magnetic elements and light elements.

         <title>The First Kr&#8208;Selective Carbon Molecular Sieve for Inverse Adsorption of Krypton Over Xenon at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study introduces a novel &#8220;molecular cut&#8208;off method&#8221; paired with thermal&#8208;regulated pyrolysis to tailor ultramicropores within carbon molecular sieves. This approach reveals the thermal&#8208;evolution of the carbon structure and enables the molecular sieving of krypton from xenon at room temperature. This pioneering material demonstrates unprecedented selectivity, marking the first instance of achieving such targeted Kr/Xe separation through these innovative techniques.








Abstract
The efficient adsorption&#8208;based separation of krypton (Kr) and xenon (Xe) is of paramount importance but is challenged by their similar physicochemical properties. While carbon adsorbents are theoretically promising for Kr/Xe sieving, practical success has remained elusive. Here, a series of ultramicroporous carbon molecular sieves synthesized from sucrose&#8208;derived hydrochar is reported. The study employs careful characterization and controlled thermal pyrolysis to tailor ultramicropore formation and elucidate the evolution of the carbon framework. The leading material, C&#8208;Suc&#8208;750, has an ideal pore size of &#8776;4.0 &#197;. In particular, C&#8208;Suc&#8208;750 has achieved a remarkable Kr/Xe uptake ratio of 39.3 at ambient conditions, setting a new benchmark for selective Kr adsorption and molecular sieving of Kr/Xe. Breakthrough experiments further confirm the superior molecular sieving performance of C&#8208;Suc&#8208;750, highlighting its potential for Kr recovery in nuclear waste treatment. Moreover, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrate the critical role of narrow slit&#8208;pore of the carbon molecular sieve in molecular sieving separation of Kr/Xe, providing insights into the mechanism driving this selectivity.

         <title>Tailoring Non&#8208;Covalent Interaction Via Single Atom to Boost Interfacial Charge Transfer Toward Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 4, January 29, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Co&#8208;N4 is coordinated with 5&#8208;fluoroanthranilic acid (FAA) molecules, and used as a non&#8208;covalent hole&#8208;extracting layer on a BiVO4 substrate. The interfacial non&#8208;covalent interaction reduces the energy barrier of charge transfer between the BiVO4 and hole&#8208;extracting layer. The current density increased to 5.47 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and continuous operation for 105 h.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting for hydrogen generation holds immense potential for addressing environmental and energy crises. Tailoring non&#8208;covalent interaction via a single atom is anticipated to realize prominent hole extracting facilitating PEC performance, but it has never been reported. In this study, single atom Co&#8208;N4 is coordinated with 5&#8208;fluoroanthranilic acid (FAA) molecules, then used as a non&#8208;covalent hole&#8208;extracting layer on a BiVO4 substrate. Experiments including X&#8208;ray absorption fine spectra, Kelvin probe force microscopy, transient absorption, and theoretical calculation demonstrate the FAA coordination alters the local configuration of the central Co atom, adjusting the interfacial non&#8208;covalent interaction, thereby reducing the barrier of charge transfer between BiVO4 and the hole&#8208;extracting layer. Consequently, photogenerated carriers are more effectively separated, and the PEC water oxidation performance is significantly enhanced with the photocurrent density of 5.47&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V versus RHE, much higher than those of previously reported BiVO4 photoanodes composited with porphyrin&#8208;based compounds. Experiments and theoretical simulation confirm that the boosted PEC performance originates from exceptional interfacial charge transfer rather than surface catalysis dynamic. This study provides an efficient strategy for tailoring non&#8208;covalent interaction by regulating single&#8208;atom coordination and promoting hole extract to boost PEC water oxidation activity.

         <title>Vertical Memristive Crossbar Array for Multilayer Graph Embedding and Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the challenge of embedding multilayer graphs with minimal complexity and information loss, this study introduces a vertical m&#8208;CBA (vm&#8208;CBA) capable of directly mapping multilayer relationships. By accurately representing inter&#8208;layer and intra&#8208;layer connections in three dimensions, vm&#8208;CBA outperforms conventional embeddings in link prediction and information scores while requiring fewer operations.








Abstract
Graph data structures effectively represent objects and their relationships, enabling the modeling of complex connections in various fields. Recent work demonstrate that metal at diagonal crossbar arrays (m&#8208;CBA) can effectively represent planar graphs. However, they are unsuitable for representing multilayer graphs having multiple relationships across different layers. Using conventional software, embedding multilayer graphs in high&#8208;dimensional Euclidean spaces introduces significant mathematical complexity and computational burden, often resulting in information loss.

&lt;p&gt;To address the challenge of embedding multilayer graphs with minimal complexity and information loss, this study introduces a vertical m-CBA (vm-CBA) capable of directly mapping multilayer relationships. By accurately representing inter-layer and intra-layer connections in three dimensions, vm-CBA outperforms conventional embeddings in link prediction and information scores while requiring fewer operations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graph data structures effectively represent objects and their relationships, enabling the modeling of complex connections in various fields. Recent work demonstrate that metal at diagonal crossbar arrays (m-CBA) can effectively represent planar graphs. However, they are unsuitable for representing multilayer graphs having multiple relationships across different layers. Using conventional software, embedding multilayer graphs in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces introduces significant mathematical complexity and computational burden, often resulting in information loss. This study proposes a unique graph embedding (mapping) method utilizing a fabricated vertical m-CBA (vm-CBA), where a custom-built measurement system thoroughly validated its functionality. This structure directly maps multilayer graphs into a 3D vm-CBA, accurately representing inter-layer and intra-layer connections. The practical link prediction and information scores across various real-world datasets demonstrated that vm-CBA achieved enhanced accuracy compared to conventional embeddings, even with a significantly decreased number of operations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Flexible metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) present significant potential for gas storage and separation due to their structural dynamic. This review explores the rationale behind the flexible MOFs' enhanced working capacity and separation factors. It also addresses key challenges, including phase transition kinetics, crystal robustness, cycling, shaping, and thermal management, and highlights advanced characterization methods essential for global understanding of flexibility phenomena.








Abstract
Flexible metal&#8211;organic frameworks&#160;(MOFs) offer unique opportunities due to their dynamic structural adaptability. This review explores the impact of flexibility on gas adsorption, highlighting key concepts for gas storage and separation. Specific examples demonstrate the principal effectiveness of flexible frameworks in enhancing gas uptake and working capacity. Additionally, mixed gas adsorption and separation of mixtures are reviewed, showcasing their potential in selective gas separation. The review also discusses the critical role of the single gas isotherms analysis and adsorption conditions in designing separation experiments. Advanced combined characterization techniques are crucial for understanding the behavior of flexible MOFs, including monitoring of phase transitions, framework&#8211;guest and guest&#8211;guest interactions. Key challenges in the practical application of flexible adsorbents are addressed, such as the kinetics of switching, volume change, and potential crystal damage during phase transitions. Furthermore, the effects of additives and shaping on flexibility and the &#8220;slipping off effect&#8221; are discussed. Finally, the benefits of phase transitions beyond improved working capacity and selectivity are outlined, with a particular focus on the advantages of intrinsic thermal management. This review highlights the potential and challenges of using flexible MOFs in gas storage and separation technologies, offering insights for future research and application.

         <title>Self&#8208;assembled Gap&#8208;Rich PdMn Nanofibers with High Mass/Electron Transport Highways for Electrocatalytic Reforming of Waste Plastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique self&#8208;assembled gap&#8208;rich PdMn nanofibers, featuring with high mass/electron transport highways, which is used as an efficient catalyst of polyethylene terephthalate to high&#8208;valued glycolic acid at an industrial current.








Abstract
Innovating nanocatalysts with both high intrinsic catalytic activity and high selectivity is crucial for multi&#8208;electron reactions, however, their low mass/electron transport at industrial&#8208;level currents is often overlooked, which usually leads to low comprehensive performance at the device level. Herein, a Cl&#8722;/O2 etching&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly strategy is reported for synthesizing a self&#8208;assembled gap&#8208;rich PdMn nanofibers with high mass/electron transport highway for greatly enhancing the electrocatalytic reforming of waste plastics at industrial&#8208;level currents. The self&#8208;assembled PdMn nanofiber shows excellent catalytic activity in upcycling waste plastics into glycolic acid, with a high current density of 223 mA cm&#8722;2@0.75 V (vs RHE), high selectivity (95.6%), and Faraday efficiency (94.3%) to glycolic acid in a flow electrolyzer. Density functional theory calculation, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy combined with in situ electrochemical Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveals that the introduction of highly oxophilic Mn induces a downshift of the d&#8208;band center of Pd, which optimizes the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates on PdMn surface, thereby facilitating the desorption of glycolic acid as a high&#8208;value product. Computational fluid dynamics simulations confirm that the gap&#8208;rich nanofiber structure is conducive for mass transfer to deliver an industrial&#8208;level current.

         <title>Self&#8208;Regulatory Lean&#8208;Electrolyte Flow for Building 600&#160;Wh Kg&#8722;1&#8208;Level Rechargeable Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intra&#8208;particle pores play a practical role in cutting down the electrolyte quantity needed during wetting. A high pore&#8208;throat ratio empowers Li&#8208;rich layered oxides to withstand lean electrolyte conditions at 1.4 g Ah&#8722;1 and achieve a specific energy of 600 Wh kg&#8722;1 in a pouch cell. This accomplishment charts a course for pore&#8208;based regulation in high&#8208;energy storage devices.








Abstract
Reducing excess electrolytes offers a promising approach to improve the specific energy of electrochemical energy storage devices. However, using lean electrolytes presents a significant challenge for porous electrode materials due to heterogeneous wetting. The spontaneous wetting of nano&#8208; or meso&#8208;pores within particles, though seldom discussed, adversely affects wetting under lean electrolyte conditions. Herein, this undesired wetting behavior is mitigated by enlarging the pore&#8208;throat ratio, enabling Li&#8208;rich layered oxide to function effectively at very low electrolyte/capacity (E/C) ratio of 1.4&#160;g Ah&#8722;1. The resulting pouch cell achieves 606&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and retains 80% capacity (75% energy) after 70 cycles. Through imaging techniques and molecular dynamics simulations, it is demonstrated that the pore&#8208;throat ratio effectively determines the permeability of electrolyte within particles. By elucidating pore&#8208;relating mechanisms, this work unveils promising potential of manipulating pore structures in porous electrode materials, an approach that can be applied to improve the specific energy of other devices including semi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <dc:description>
Regenerative biohybrid bioelectronics represent an emerging class of technology combining the therapeutic potential of implantable bioelectronic devices and cell transplantations. In this perspective the future of this class of technology is evaluated, outlining therapeutic targets and applications. It is finished by discussing the technology challenges that remain to be overcome to enable their clinical potential.








Abstract
Biohybrid regenerative bioelectronics are an emerging technology combining implantable devices with cell transplantation. Once implanted, biohybrid regenerative devices integrate with host tissue. The combination of transplant and device provides an avenue to both replace damaged or dysfunctional tissue, and monitor or control its function with high precision. While early challenges in the fusion of the biological and technological components limited development of biohybrid regenerative technologies, progress in the field has resulted in a rapidly increasing number of applications. In this perspective the great potential of this emerging technology for the delivery of therapy is discussed, including both recent research progress and potential new directions. Then the technology barriers are discussed that will need to be addressed to unlock the full potential of biohybrid regenerative devices.

         <title>Rational Design of Advanced Gene Delivery Carriers: Macrophage Phenotype Matters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, it is first revealed that M2 phenotype macrophages with lowered mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) levels are harder to transfect than M1 phenotype (A). To enhance the transfection efficiency in M2 phenotype macrophages, chloroquine is applied to shift M2 to M1 phenotype. This strategy is translated to functional nucleic acid transfection in M2 phenotype macrophages upon bacteria immune evasion (B).








Abstract
Nucleic acid delivery in hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect macrophages have attracted increasing attention in diverse applications such as defence against bacterial infection. Regulated by microenvironments in specific applications, macrophages have a heterogenous nature and exist in different phenotypes with diverse functions, e.g., pro&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;inflammatory. However, it is not clear whether macrophage phenotype affects nucleic acid delivery, and which one is harder to transfect, and the design of nucleic acid carriers in harder&#8208;to&#8208;transfect macrophage phenotypes is largely unexplored. Herein, it is first revealed that nucleic acid delivery efficacy in macrophages is influenced by phenotype: IL&#8208;4&#8208;treated &#8220;M2&#8208;like&#8221; macrophages with suppressed mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) levels are harder&#8208;to&#8208;transfect than &#8220;M1&#8208;like&#8221; macrophages for mRNA and DNA. This knowledge is then translated to the purpose&#8208;design of gene delivery carriers for harder&#8208;to&#8208;transfect M2 phenotype macrophages dominant upon bacteria immune evasion. By loading chloroquine in tetrasulfide bond&#8208;containing organosilica nanoparticles, the resultant composite promotes macrophage M2 polarization to M1 and increases mTORC1 levels for enhanced translation. The design is demonstrated in vitro and in vivo for pathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) and methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. It is expected that the findings may provide new knowledge and gene delivery solutions in other applications where the M2 phenotype macrophage is dominant.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, it is first revealed that M2 phenotype macrophages with lowered mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) levels are harder to transfect than M1 phenotype (A). To enhance the transfection efficiency in M2 phenotype macrophages, chloroquine is applied to shift M2 to M1 phenotype. This strategy is translated to functional nucleic acid transfection in M2 phenotype macrophages upon bacteria immune evasion (B).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nucleic acid delivery in hard-to-transfect macrophages have attracted increasing attention in diverse applications such as defence against bacterial infection. Regulated by microenvironments in specific applications, macrophages have a heterogenous nature and exist in different phenotypes with diverse functions, e.g., pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory. However, it is not clear whether macrophage phenotype affects nucleic acid delivery, and which one is harder to transfect, and the design of nucleic acid carriers in harder-to-transfect macrophage phenotypes is largely unexplored. Herein, it is first revealed that nucleic acid delivery efficacy in macrophages is influenced by phenotype: IL-4-treated &#8220;M2-like&#8221; macrophages with suppressed mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) levels are harder-to-transfect than &#8220;M1-like&#8221; macrophages for mRNA and DNA. This knowledge is then translated to the purpose-design of gene delivery carriers for harder-to-transfect M2 phenotype macrophages dominant upon bacteria immune evasion. By loading chloroquine in tetrasulfide bond-containing organosilica nanoparticles, the resultant composite promotes macrophage M2 polarization to M1 and increases mTORC1 levels for enhanced translation. The design is demonstrated in vitro and in vivo for pathogenic &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;) and methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA) infections.

         <title>Materials Design by Constructing Phase Diagrams for Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic way to develop defect phase diagrams is proposed for advanced materials design. Phase transformation of a Mg grain boundary is triggered by Ga implantation on a microscopy sample. Transformations of structural units and chemical ordering at the same grain boundary are experimentally traced at atomic resolution and modeled by ab initio simulations to construct the defect phase diagram.









Abstract
Phase transformations and crystallographic defects are two essential tools to drive innovations in materials. Bulk materials design via tuning chemical compositions is systematized using phase diagrams. It is shown here that the same thermodynamic concept can be applied to manipulate the chemistry at defects. Grain boundaries in Mg&#8211;Ga system are chosen as a model system, because Ga segregates to the boundaries, while simultaneously improving the strength and ductility of Mg alloys. To reveal the role of grain boundaries, correlated atomic&#8208;scale characterization and simulation to scope and build phase diagrams for defects are presented. The discovery is enabled by triggering phase transformations of individual grain boundaries through local alloying, and sequentially imaging the structural and chemical changes using atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. Ab initio simulations determined the thermodynamic stability of grain boundary phases, and found out that increasing Ga content enhances grain boundary cohesion, relating to improved ductility. The methodology to trigger, trace, and simulate defect transformation at atomic resolution enables a systematic development of defect phase diagrams, providing a valuable tool to utilize chemical complexity and phase transformations at&#160;defects.

         <title>Band Alignment Semimetal Heterojunction&#8208;Based Ultrabroadband Photodetector for Noncontact Gesture Interaction with Low Latency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silicon&#8208;based semimetal heterojunction photodetector, designed with band alignment theory, has been developed which exhibits exceptional sensitivity, an ultra&#8208;broad spectral range, and swift response times. Integrating this detector with a sophisticated spatial&#8208;temporal comparison algorithm and a multi&#8208;channel high&#8208;frequency sampling system, the Infrared Gesture Recognition and Interaction System (IGRIS) is achieved with ultra&#8208;low latency, minimal energy consumption (zero bias), and adaptability to diverse scenarios.








Abstract
Non&#8208;contact gesture recognition and interaction (NGRI) revolutionizes the natural user interface, fundamentally transforming human interactions with daily&#8208;use technology. Conventional NGRI systems frequently encounter obstacles such as pronounced latency and environmental disturbances, including humidity or lighting conditions, resulting in compromised system fluidity and robustness. This study highlights the utilization of silicon&#8208;based semimetal heterojunction photodetectors for precise gesture recognition and seamless human&#8208;machine interaction. Through the application of band alignment theory and sophisticated TCAD simulation, heterojunction barriers are successfully optimized by fine&#8208;tuning parameters including Si doping concentration and semimetal thickness. By strategically aligning vertical material growth and implementing vertical heterojunction configuration, a room temperature detector with exceptional sensitivity (specific detectivity (D*): &#8776;1011 Jones), ultra&#8208;broad spectral range (405&#8211;10600 nm), and rapid response time (&#8776; &#181;s) is achieved. Harnessing its distinguished speed and sensitivity in detecting human infrared radiation, in conjunction with an advanced spatial&#8208;temporal comparison algorithm and a multi&#8208;channel high&#8208;frequency sampling processing design, a NGRI system with low latency, high precision, minimal energy consumption, and versatility across diverse scenarios has been developed. The results pave the way for non&#8208;contact sensor design and may further enhance the practicality and user experience of non&#8208;contact human&#8208;machine interaction systems.

         <title>Taming Prolonged Ionic Drift&#8211;Diffusion Dynamics for Brain&#8208;Inspired Computation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To mimic the energy efficiency of biological neural networks, an artificial neural device that works on long timescales with minimal energy consumption is needed. By leveraging the drift&#8211;diffusion dynamics of oxygen vacancies, a field&#8208;effect transistor made of an oxide semiconductor achieves a timescale of the order of one second, comparable to that of biological neurons, with negligible power loss.








Abstract
Recent advances in neural network&#8208;based computing have enabled human&#8208;like information processing in areas such as image classification and voice recognition. However, many neural networks run on conventional computers that operate at GHz clock frequency and consume considerable power compared to biological neural networks, such as human brains, which work with a much slower spiking rate. Although many electronic devices aiming to emulate the energy efficiency of biological neural networks have been explored, achieving long timescales while maintaining scalability remains an important challenge. In this study, a field&#8208;effect transistor based on the oxide semiconductor strontium titanate (SrTiO3) achieves leaky integration on a long timescale by leveraging the drift&#8211;diffusion of oxygen vacancies in this material. Experimental analysis and finite&#8208;element model simulations reveal the mechanism behind the leaky integration of the SrTiO3 transistor. With a timescale in the order of one second, which is close to that of biological neuron activity, this transistor is a promising component for biomimicking neuromorphic&#160;computing.

         <title>NADPH Oxidases&#8208;Inspired Reactive Oxygen Biocatalysts with Electron&#8208;Rich Pt Sites to Potently Amplify Immune Checkpoint Blockade Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NADPH oxidases&#8208;inspired reactive oxygen biocatalysts with electron&#8208;rich Pt sites are designed to potently amplify immune checkpoint blockade therapy. The synthesized Pt&#9472;WOx presents rapid electron transfer capability for superior reactive oxygen biocatalysis, which directly triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress, stimulates tumor&#8208;specific immune responses, and alleviates the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment potently for amplifying the anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;based immune checkpoint blockade therapy.








Abstract
Clinical immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)&#8208;based immunotherapy of malignant tumors only elicits durable responses in a minority of patients, primarily due to the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Although inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) through reactive oxygen biocatalyst represents an attractive therapeutic strategy to amplify ICB, currently reported biocatalysts encounter insurmountable challenges in achieving high ROS&#8208;generating activity to induce potent ICD. Here, inspired by the natural catalytic characteristics of NADPH oxidases, the design of efficient, robust, and electron&#8208;rich Pt&#8208;based redox centers on the non&#8208;stoichiometric W18O49 substrates (Pt&#9472;WOx) to serve as bioinspired reactive oxygen biocatalysts to potently activate the ICD, which eventually enhance cancer immune responses and amplifies the ICB&#8208;based immunotherapy is reported. These studies demonstrate that the Pt&#9472;WOx exhibits rapid electron transfer capability and can promote the formation of electron&#8208;rich and low oxophilic Pt redox centers for superior reactive oxygen biocatalysis, which enables the Pt&#9472;WOx&#8208;based inducers to trigger endoplasmic reticulum stress directly and stimulate immune responses potently for amplifying the anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;based ICB therapy. This bioinspired design provides a straightforward strategy to engineer efficient, robust, and electron&#8208;rich reactive oxygen biocatalysts and also opens up a new avenue to create efficient ICD inducers for primary/metastatic tumor treatments.

These studies demonstrate that the Pt&#9472;WO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits rapid electron transfer capability and can promote the formation of electron-rich and low oxophilic Pt redox centers for superior reactive oxygen biocatalysis, which enables the Pt&#9472;WO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-based inducers to trigger endoplasmic reticulum stress directly and stimulate immune responses potently for amplifying the anti-PD-L1-based ICB therapy. This bioinspired design provides a straightforward strategy to engineer efficient, robust, and electron-rich reactive oxygen biocatalysts and also opens up a new avenue to create efficient ICD inducers for primary/metastatic tumor treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Architectures of Dendritic Polymers Provide Irreversible Inhibitor to Block Viral Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work introduces functional antiviral polymers that can bind to virus particles and inhibit their interaction with cells. The antiviral polymers can inhibit the cell infection irreversibly only when self&#8208;assembled into 2D supramolecular structures. Monomeric analogs of the dendritic polymer can only inhibit the virus reversibly, thus allowing for the virus to regain infectivity after dilution.








Abstract
In Nature, most known objects can perform their functions only when in supramolecular self&#8208;assembled from, e.g. protein complexes and cell membranes. Here, a dendritic polymer is presented that inhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) with an irreversible (virucidal) mechanism only when self&#8208;assembled into a Two&#8208;dimmensional supramolecular polymer (2D&#8208;SupraPol). Monomeric analogs of the dendritic polymer can only inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 reversibly, thus allowing for the virus to regain infectivity after dilution. Upon assembly, 2D&#8208;SupraPol shows a remarkable half&#8208;inhibitory concentration (IC50 30&#160;nM) in vitro and in vivo in a Syrian Hamster model has a good efficacy. Using cryo&#8208;TEM, it is shown that the 2D&#8208;SupraPol has a controllable lateral size that can be tuned by adjusting the pH and use small angle X&#8208;ray and neutron scattering to unveil the architecture of the supramolecular assembly. This functional 2D&#8208;SupraPol, and its supramolecular architecture are proposed, as a prophylaxis nasal spray to inhibit the virus interaction with the respiratory tract.

         <title>Synergistic effect of Hypoxic Conditioning and Cell&#8208;Tethering Colloidal Gels enhanced Productivity of MSC Paracrine Factors and Accelerated Vessel Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces cell&#8208;tethering and oxygenating colloidal hydrogels that prevent cell egression and maintain mild hypoxic conditions while providing mechanical stimulation and interconnected microporous networks. These synergistic multiple factors significantly increase the productivity of paracrine factors of mesenchymal stem cells locally and in a long&#8208;term manner, improving blood flow restoration and muscle regeneration in response to hindlimb ischemia.








Abstract
Microporous hydrogels have been widely used for delivering therapeutic cells. However, several critical issues, such as the lack of control over the harsh environment they are subjected to under pathological conditions and rapid egression of cells from the hydrogels, have produced limited therapeutic outcomes. To address these critical challenges, cell&#8208;tethering and hypoxic conditioning colloidal hydrogels containing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are introduced to increase the productivity of paracrine factors locally and in a long&#8208;term manner. Cell&#8208;tethering colloidal hydrogels that are composed of tyramine&#8208;conjugated gelatin prevent cells from egressing through on&#8208;cell oxidative phenolic crosslinks while providing mechanical stimulation and interconnected microporous networks to allow for host&#8208;implant interactions. Oxygenating microparticles&#160;encapsulated in tyramine&#8208;conjugated colloidal microgels continuously generated oxygen for 2 weeks with rapid diffusion, resulting in maintaining a mild hypoxic condition while MSCs consumed oxygen under severe hypoxia. Synergistically, local retention of MSCs within the mild hypoxic&#8208;conditioned and mechanically robust colloidal hydrogels significantly increased the secretion of various angiogenic cytokines and chemokines. The oxygenating colloidal hydrogels induced anti&#8208;inflammatory responses, reduced cellular apoptosis, and promoted numerous large blood vessels in vivo. Finally, mice injected with the MSC&#8208;tethered oxygenating colloidal hydrogels significantly improved blood flow restoration and muscle regeneration in a hindlimb ischemia (HLI) model.

         <title>Quantitative Identification of Dopant Occupation in Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quantitative identification of dopant occupation in Li&#8208;rich cathode materials is proposed by macroscopic sample characterizations. The doping sites of Al and Mg are thus statistically revealed, showing an important influence on the activity of oxygen anions for Li&#8208;rich cathode materials.








Abstract
Elemental doping is widely used to improve the performance of cathode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, macroscopic/statistical investigation on how doping sites are distributed in the material lattice, despite being a key prerequisite for understanding and manipulating the doping effect, has not been effectively established. Herein, to solve this predicament, a universal strategy is proposed to quantitatively identify the locations of Al and Mg dopants in lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs). Solid evidence confirms that Al prefers to occupy the transition metal (TM) layer, while Mg evenly occupies both TM and Li layers. As a result, Mg significantly reduces the thickness of LiO2 slabs at room temperature, which will increase the energy barrier of oxygen activation and enhance the structure stability of LLOs. The suppressed oxygen activity in Mg&#8208;doped LLO can be kinetically unlocked at 55&#160;&#176;C. The different characteristics of Al and Mg enlighten an Al/Mg co&#8208;doping strategy to optimize LLOs, which significantly improves the cycle performance while lifting the capacity. These insights from the quantitative identification of doping sites shed light on the manipulation of doping effects toward better cathodes.

         <title>Tillandsia&#8208;Inspired Ultra&#8208;Efficient Thermo&#8208;Responsive Hygroscopic Nanofibers for Solar&#8208;Driven Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Tillandsia, a thermo&#8208;responsive hygroscopic nanofiber called PCP@LiCl is prepared for atmospheric water harvesting. PCP@LiCl exhibits unique kinetics due to the porous structure, capable of adsorbing moisture to saturation within 2&#160;h at 25&#160;&#176;C and 15%&#8211;30% relative humidity and oozing liquid water within 5&#160;min under sunlight.








Abstract
Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) is a promising approach for supplying water in off&#8208;grid arid regions. However, it is difficult to improve the SAWH efficiency because water undergoes multiple phase transformations, such as water vapor&#8211;water (desorption and condensation) in the desorption phase. To address this issue, an ultrahygroscopic temperature&#8208;responsive hydrogel nanofiber inspired by Tillandsia is developed, comprising poly N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide, poly N&#8208;dimethylacetamide, and carbon nanotubes and impregnated with lithium chloride (PCP@LiCl). The hydrophobicity of the nanofiber membrane is enhanced with increasing temperature, facilitating water separation from the hydrogel in liquid form. Moreover, PCP@LiCl exhibits unique kinetics at 25 &#176;C and 15%&#8211;30% relative humidity, capable of adsorbing moisture to saturation within 2&#160;h, and oozing liquid water within 5&#160;min under sunlight. Through global potential modeling, it is demonstrated that PCP@LiCl has potential applications in arid and semiarid regions. This study provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance composites for solar&#8208;powered atmospheric water harvesting.

         <title>Orientation&#8208;Selective Memory Switching in Quasi&#8208;1D NbSe3 Neuromorphic Device for Omnibearing Motion Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefitting from the directional formation of conductive filaments, quasi&#8208;1D NbSe3 memristor demonstrates excellent resistive switching behavior with small operating voltages. Anisotropic ion migration in NbSe3 crystals leads to the high orientation selectivity in conductance update, thus contributing to the hardware implementation of omnibearing motion recognition for intelligent driving application with a high accuracy of 95.9%.








Abstract
Intelligent neuromorphic hardware holds considerable promise in addressing the growing demand for massive real&#8208;time data processing in edge computing. Resistive switching materials with intrinsic anisotropy and a compact design of non&#8208;volatile memory devices with the capability of handling spatiotemporally reconstructed data is crucial to perform sophisticated tasks in complex application scenarios. In this study, an anisotropic resistive switching cell with a planar configuration based on lithiated NbSe3 nanosheets is demonstrated. Benefitting from the highly aligned diffusive channel associated with a quasi&#8208;1D van der Waals structure, the memristor patterned along NbSe3 atomic chains presents robust memory switching behavior with superior stability, particularly the low set/reset voltages (0.4&#160;V/&#8722;0.36&#160;V) and extremely small standard deviation (0.041&#160;V/0.051&#160;V), among the best compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices. More importantly, unlike traditional resistive switching materials, anisotropic ion migration in NbSe3 crystals leads to a high orientation selectivity in the conductance update. Custom&#8208;designed neuromorphic hardware contributes to the implementation of omnibearing motion recognition for automatic pilot applications, yielding a high accuracy of 95.9% considering variations. This article presents a new strategy based on NbSe3 crystals to develop a neuromorphic computing system with intelligent application scenarios.

         <title>Conformation Influences Biological Fates of Peptide&#8208;Based Nanofilaments by Modulating Protein Adsorption and Interfilament Entanglement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformation&#8208;modulated bio&#8208;interaction of nanofilaments and their biological fates can be controlled by tuning the secondary structure and the density of intermolecular backbone hydrogen bonds. The tetrahydroxyproline&#8208;modified nanofilaments (P5Fs) with a lower degree of &#946;&#8208;sheet display minimal protein adsorption, interfilament entanglement, and phagocytosis, ultimately prolonging in vivo circulation and improving antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Filamentous structures exert biological functions mediated by multivalent interactions with their counterparts in sharp contrast with spherical ones. The physicochemical properties and unique behaviors of nanofilaments that are associated with multivalent interaction with protein are poorly understood. Here, peptide&#8208;based nanofilaments containing different homotetrapeptidic inserts are reported and their protein adsorption and biological fates are tested. By altering the homotetrapeptides, different peptidic conformations are imposed within the nanofilaments, which result in notable differences in the density of the intermolecular hydrogen bond, determining the amount of adsorbed proteins. The adsorbed proteins can further induce interfilament entanglement of different degrees and patterns, which influences biodistribution and phagocytosis. The nanofilaments with tetrahydroxyproline segment exhibit diminish interfilament entanglement, phagocytosis, and improve circulation, biodistribution, and antitumor efficacy. These findings can deepen the understanding of nanofilament&#8208;protein interactions and filament&#8208;filament interactions as in the case of amyloid&#8208;&#946; plaque, and facilitate the rational design of nanofilaments through peptide conformation control for chemical engineering and anticancer drug delivery.

         <title>Biomimetic Nanomotors for Deep Ischemia Penetration and Ferroptosis Inhibition in Neuroprotective Therapy of Ischemic Stroke</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt@LF penetrated into cerebral ischemic area deeply and alleviated &#8220;no&#8208;reflow&#8221; phenomenon efficiently through mechanical thrombolysis. Subsequently, Pt@LF prevented ferroptosis of neurons via ROS clearing, iron chelating, and excess NH4
+ scavenging. Meanwhile, Pt@LF protected M2&#8208;type microglia from ferroptosis and promoted microglia into anti&#8208;inflammatory M2&#8208;type, as well as relieved hypoxic microenvironment, hence effectively regulating the inflammatory microenvironment.








Abstract
Nerve injury represents the primary reason of mortality and disability in ischemic stroke, but effective drug delivery to the region of cerebral ischemia and hypoxia poses a significant challenge in neuroprotective treatment. To address these clinical challenges, a biomimetic nanomotor, Pt@LF is designed, to facilitate deep delivery of neuroprotective agents and inhibit ferroptosis in ischemic stroke. Pt@LF traverses the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and penetrates into deep cerebral ischemic&#8208;hypoxic areas due to the active targeting capacity of apo&#8208;lactoferrin (Apo&#8208;LF) and the self&#8208;propelling motion properties of nanomotors. Subsequently, Pt@LF loosens thrombus and alleviates the &#8220;no reflow&#8221; phenomenon via mechanical thrombolysis. Thanks to the various enzyme&#8208;like abilities and multi&#8208;target ferroptosis inhibition capability, Pt@LF ameliorates the inflammatory microenvironment and rescues dying neurons. In conclusion, Pt@LF demonstrates efficiently deep penetration and neuroprotective effects in vitro and vivo. And this study provides a promising therapeutic platform for the treatment of ischemic stroke.

         <title>Hardware&#8208;Feasible and Efficient N&#8208;Type Organic Neuromorphic Signal Recognition via Reservoir Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;type organic electrochemical synaptic transistor (n&#8208;OEST) is integrated within a simple and hardware&#8208;feasible reservoir computing (RC) framework, enabling efficient recognition of complex signals. This physical RC comprises n&#8208;OESTs for both adaptive reservoirs and single&#8208;layer readout. It achieves image and speech recognition with &gt;90% accuracy and snoring recognition with 98.0% accuracy for practical sleep monitoring.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical synaptic transistors (OESTs), inspired by the biological nervous system, have garnered increasing attention due to their multifunctional applications in neuromorphic computing. However, the practical implementation of OESTs for signal recognition&#8212;particularly those utilizing n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs)&#8212;still faces significant challenges at the hardware level. Here, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art small&#8208;molecule n&#8208;type OEST integrated within a physically simple and hardware feasible reservoir&#8208;computing (RC) framework for practical temporal signal recognition is presented. This integration is achieved by leveraging the adjustable synaptic properties of the n&#8208;OEST, which exhibits tunable nonlinear short&#8208;term memory, transitioning from volatility to nonvolatility, and demonstrating adaptive temporal specificity. Additionally, the nonvolatile OEST offers 256 conductance levels and a wide dynamic range (&#8776;147) in long&#8208;term potentiation/depression (LTP/LTD), surpassing previously reported n&#8208;OESTs. By combining volatile n&#8208;OESTs as reservoirs with a single&#8208;layer perceptron readout composed of nonvolatile n&#8208;OEST networks, this physical RC system achieves substantial recognition accuracy for both handwritten&#8208;digit images (94.9%) and spoken digit (90.7%), along with ultrahigh weight efficiency. Furthermore, this system demonstrates outstanding accuracy (98.0%) by grouped RC in practical sleep monitoring, specifically in snoring recognition. Here, a reliable pathway for OMIEC&#8208;driven computing is presented to advance bioinspired hardware&#8208;based neuromorphic computing in the physical world.

         <title>UNLEASH: Ultralow Nanocluster Loading of Pt via Electro&#8208;Acoustic Seasoning of Heterocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High frequency (10 MHz) acoustic wave exposure during Pt electrodeposition onto Au electrodes is shown to enable the&#160;'seasoning' of its surface with a high&#8208;density dispersion of Pt nanoclusters, resulting in an Au/Pt bimetallic catalyst with superior performance for methanol oxidation, and therefore demonstrating the efficient atomic utilization and dispersion afforded by this dynamic surface deposition process.








Abstract
The shift toward sustainable energy has fueled the development of advanced electrocatalysts to enable green fuel production and chemical synthesis.

         <title>Microgels With Electrostatically Controlled Molecular Affinity to Direct Morphogenesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a precision toolbox to modulate morphogen gradients in tissue cultures. Spatial and temporal gradient control is achieved using sulfated glycosaminoglycan&#8208;based microgels (&#181;GUIDEs) with electrostatically tunable morphogen affinity for tailored release. Individual &#181;GUIDEs act as artificial signaling centers, locally directing vascular morphogenesis with high resolution.








Abstract
Concentration gradients of soluble signaling molecules&#8212;morphogens&#8212;determine the cellular organization in tissue development. Morphogen&#8208;releasing microgels have shown potential to recapitulate this principle in engineered tissue constructs, however, with limited control over the molecular cues in space and time. Inspired by the functionality of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAGs) in morphogen signaling in vivo, a library of sGAG&#8208;based microgels is developed and designated as &#181;Gel Units to Instruct Development (&#181;GUIDEs). Adjustment of the microgel's sGAG sulfation patterns and concentration enabled the programming of electrostatic affinities that control the release of morphogens. Based on computational analyses of molecular transport processes, &#181;GUIDEs provided unprecedented precision in the spatiotemporal modulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gradients in a microgel&#8208;in&#8208;gel vasculogenesis model and kidney organoid cultures. The versatile approach offers new options for creating morphogen signaling centers to advance the understanding of tissue and organ development.

         <title>Spatially Precise Light&#8208;Activated Dedoping in Wafer&#8208;Scale MoS2 Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Authors demonstrate light activated dedoping (photo&#8208;dedoping) in wafer scale MoS2 with high spatial fidelity. They highlight the critical role of the hole trap states within the oxide interface between the MoS2 and the substrate for driving stable dedoping in wafer scale monolayer MoS2 upon illumination addressing the long&#8208;standing challenges associated with doping these atomically thin materials with high spatial fidelity.








Abstract
2D materials, particularly transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), have shown great potential for microelectronics and optoelectronics. However, a major challenge in commercializing these materials is the inability to control their doping&#160;at a wafer scale with high spatial fidelity. Interface chemistry is used with the underlying substrate oxide and concomitant exposure to visible light in ambient conditions for photo&#8208;dedoping wafer scale MoS2. It is hypothesized that the oxide layer traps photoexcited holes, leaving behind long&#8208;lived electrons that become available for surface reactions with ambient air at sulfur vacancies (defect sites) resulting in dedoping. Additionally, high fidelity spatial control is showcased over the dedoping process, by laser writing, and fine control achieved over the degree of doping by modulating the illumination time and power density. This localized change in MoS2 doping density is very stable (at least 7 days) and robust to processing conditions like high temperature and vacuum. The scalability and ease of implementation of this approach can address one of the major issues preventing the &#8220;Lab to Fab&#8221; transition of 2D materials and facilitate its seamless integration for commercial applications in multi&#8208;logic devices, inverters, and other optoelectronic devices.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel porous polymer based on triphenylamine (LPCMP) is demonstrated as an exceptional cathode for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. This study highlights improvements in intrinsic conductivity, practical capacity, and redox potential. The protonated LPCMP cathode shows a capacity of 146&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185; at 3.6&#160;V, high power density, and maintains stability over 1000 cycles, offering a significant breakthrough for high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;power organic LIBs.








Abstract
This paper presents a study on a novel porous polymer based on triphenylamine (LPCMP) as an excellent cathode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Through structural design and a scalable post&#8208;synthesis approach, improvements in intrinsic conductivity, practical capacity, and redox potential in an organic cathode material is reported. The designed cathode achieves a notable capacity of 146&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185; with an average potential of 3.6&#160;V, using 70% active material content in the electrode. Additionally, through appropriate structural design, the capacity can increase to 160&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. Even at a high current density of 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185; (360C), the cathode maintains a capacity of 74&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185;, enabling full charge within 10 s. A high specific energy density of 569&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; (at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;) is combined with a very high power density of 94.5&#160;kW&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; (at 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185; corresponding to a specific energy density of 263&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8315;&#185;) surpassing the power density of graphene&#8208;based supercapacitors. It exhibits highly stable cyclic performance across various current densities, retaining almost 95% of its initial capacity after 1000 cycles at 5.5C. This work presents a significant breakthrough in developing high&#8208;capacity, high&#8208;potential organic materials for sustainable, high&#8208;energy, and high&#8208;power lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Triggered Self&#8208;Welding Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced self&#8208;welding method is used to repair defects and cracks in the perovskite layer, thereby improving the long&#8208;term mechanical stability of flexible perovskite cells and modules. The flexible large&#8208;scale module with an active area of 15.82 cm2 achieves a record PCE of 21.65% and retains 93.7% of its initial efficiency after undergoing 15&#160;000 bending cycles.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (F&#8208;PSCs) are highly promising for both stationary and mobile applications because of their advantageous features, including mechanical flexibility, their lightweight and thin nature, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, a number of drawbacks, such as mechanical instability, make their practical application difficult. Here, self&#8208;welding dynamic diselenide that is triggered by visible light into the structure of F&#8208;PSCs to improve their long&#8208;term stability by repairing cracks and defects in the absorber layer is incorporated. The diselenide confers the flexibility and self&#8208;welding properties to the Cs0.05MA0.05FA0.9PbI3 perovskite layer, enabling optimized F&#8208;PSC devices to achieve a power conversion efficiency of 24.85% while retaining ca. 92% of their initial efficiency after undergoing 15&#160;000 bending cycles at a curvature radius of 3 mm. The corresponding flexible large&#8208;scale module with an active area of 15.82 cm2 achieved a record PCE of 21.65%.

&lt;p&gt;A visible-light-induced self-welding method is used to repair defects and cracks in the perovskite layer, thereby improving the long-term mechanical stability of flexible perovskite cells and modules. The flexible large-scale module with an active area of 15.82 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; achieves a record PCE of 21.65% and retains 93.7% of its initial efficiency after undergoing 15&#160;000 bending cycles.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexible perovskite solar cells (F-PSCs) are highly promising for both stationary and mobile applications because of their advantageous features, including mechanical flexibility, their lightweight and thin nature, and cost-effectiveness. However, a number of drawbacks, such as mechanical instability, make their practical application difficult. Here, self-welding dynamic diselenide that is triggered by visible light into the structure of F-PSCs to improve their long-term stability by repairing cracks and defects in the absorber layer is incorporated. The diselenide confers the flexibility and self-welding properties to the Cs&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;MA&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;FA&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite layer, enabling optimized F-PSC devices to achieve a power conversion efficiency of 24.85% while retaining ca. 92% of their initial efficiency after undergoing 15&#160;000 bending cycles at a curvature radius of 3 mm. The corresponding flexible large-scale module with an active area of 15.82 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; achieved a record PCE of 21.65%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Stepwise Melting&#8208;Polymerizing Molecule for Hydrophobic Grain&#8208;Scale Encapsulated Perovskite Solar Cell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise melting&#8208;polymerizing molecule (SMPM) additive enables grain&#8208;scale encapsulated perovskite, achieving highly water&#8208;resistant perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with 25.21% efficiency and over 2000h T95 stability under 85% relative humidity. Unencapsulated SMPM&#8208;PSCs even operate underwater and show effectively suppressed Pb&#8208;leakage, potentially solving stability and environmental concerns for PSC commercialization.








Abstract
Despite the ongoing increase in the efficiency of perovskite solar cells, the stability issues of perovskite have been a significant hindrance to its commercialization. In response to this challenge, a stepwise melting&#8208;polymerizing molecule (SMPM) is designed as an additive into FAPbI3 perovskite. SMPM undergoes a three&#8208;stage phase transition during the perovskite annealing process: initially melting from solid to liquid state, followed by overflowing grain boundaries, and finally self&#8208;polymerizing to form a hydrophobic grain&#8208;scale encapsulation in perovskite solar cells, providing protection against humidity&#8208;induced degradation. With this unique property, coupled with the advantages of improved crystallization, diminished non&#8208;radiative recombination, and energy level alignment, FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskite solar cells with a 25.21% (small&#8208;area) and 22.94% (1 cm2) power conversion efficiency and over 2000 h T95% stability under 85% relative humidity is achieved. Furthermore, the SMPM&#8208;based perovskite solar cells without external encapsulations sustain impressive stability during underwater operation, in which the black FAPbI3 phase is maintained and Pb&#8208;leakage is also effectively suppressed. Therefore, the SMPM strategy can offer a sustainable settlement in both stability and environmental issues for the commercialization of perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Additively Manufactured Biodegradable Zn&#8208;Based Porous Scaffolds to Suppress Osteosarcoma and Promote Osteogenesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>

This work shows the schematic diagram showing the potential application of 3D&#8208;printed Zn&#8208;Li porous scaffold in osteosarcoma postoperative therapy. The L&#8208;PBF fabricated Zn&#8208;0.8Li Gyroid scaffold with favorable mechanical properties can optimally balance the co&#8208;release of Zn2+ and Li+, inhibiting the malignant biological behavior of tumor and promoting osteogenesis in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Postoperative therapies for osteosarcoma present substantial challenges due to tumor recurrence and extensive bone defects. To tackle these challenges, laser powder bed fusion is utilized to fabricate biodegradable Zn&#8208;Li porous scaffolds that supress tumors and promote osteogenesis. After the structure design and composition selection, the Zn&#8208;0.8Li porous scaffold with Gyroid unit optimally balances the co&#8208;release of Zn2+ and Li+ during degradation, resulting in favorable antitumor and osteogenic effects. In vitro, the Zn&#8208;0.8Li scaffold significantly inhibits osteosarcoma progression by suppressing tumor cell proliferation, promoting apoptosis, alleviating migration, and simultaneously promotes osteogenic differentiation through the enhanced expression of osteogenic markers. In vivo, the Zn&#8208;0.8Li scaffold inhibits the malignant osteosarcoma behavior and facilitates bone regeneration in areas with bone defects. Transcriptomic analysis further reveals that the simultaneous release of Zn2+ and Li+ from the biodegradable Zn&#8208;0.8Li scaffold contributes to anti&#8208;osteosarcoma activity by downregulating PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Taken together, the Zn&#8208;0.8Li porous scaffold fabricated using laser powder bed fusion with enhanced antitumor and osteogenic properties is a promising alternative for the postoperative management of osteosarcoma.

         <title>Efficient PFAS Removal Using Reusable and Non&#8208;Toxic 3D Printed Porous Trianglamine Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, trianglamine, a class of Schiff base macrocycles is used. Combining with pluronic to design by stereolithography process, a novel 3D&#8208;Porous Hydrogel (3D&#8208;PSH&#916;) is made. This innovative material, with no fluoride groups, is capable of picking up a broad spectrum of PFAS from aqueous solutions via fast kinetics. This new adsorbent is non&#8208;toxic, cheap, stable, and scalable.








Abstract
Per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are now a paramount concern in water remediation. Nowadays, urgent action is required for the development of advanced technologies aimed at capturing PFAS and mitigating their impact. To offer a solution, a functional 3D printed hydrogel tailored is designed to trap a broad spectrum of PFAS contaminants. The hydrogel is made of a photo&#8208;crosslinked dimethacrylate&#8208;ureido&#8208;trianglamine (DMU&#8208;&#916;) and Pluronic P123 dimethacrylate (PDM) fabricated by stereolithography (SLA). With the aid of 3D&#8208;printing, porous and nonporous hydrogels (3D&#8208;PSH&#916;, 3D&#8208;SH&#916;) as well as quaternized hydrogels (3D&#8208;PSH&#916;Q+) are prepared. These tailored hydrogels, show high uptake capacities and fast removal kinetics for PFAS from aqueous sources. The PFAS removal efficiency of these hydrogels are then compared to P123 hydrogels with no trianglamine (3D&#8208;SH). The 3D&#8208;SH hydrogel shows no affinity to PFAS, proving that the sorption is due to the interaction between the trianglamine (&#916;) and PFAS. Metadynamic simulations also confirmed this interaction. The porous matrices showed the fastest and highest uptake capacity. 3D&#8208;PSH&#916; is able to capture &#8776; 91% of PFAS within 5 h using initial concentrations of 5 and 0.5 ppm in both deionized and river water. The sorption of PFAS is further enhanced by introducing permanent positive charges to the structure of the porous hydrogels, resulting in even faster sorption kinetics for both long and short PFAS chains with diverse polar heads. Besides the remarkable efficiency in capturing PFAS, these designed hydrogels are non&#8208;toxic and have outstanding chemical and thermal stability, making them a brilliant candidate for mass use in the combat against PFAS pollution.

         <title>Universal Approach for Managing Iodine Migration in Inverted Single&#8208;Junction and Tandem Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study improves the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by introducing a Lewis&#8208;acid boronic ester&#8208;containing agent&#160;2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole,5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4,7&#8208;bis(4,4,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborolan&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#160;(BT2F&#8208;2B) into the perovskite precursor solution. It also provides a universal method for enhancing the stability of PSCs and a feasible approach for developing high&#8208;performance and durable PSCs for perovskite systems with different bandgaps.








Abstract
Despite significant progress in the power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the instability of devices remains a considerable obstacle for commercial applications. This instability primarily originates from the migration of halide ions&#8212;particularly iodide ions (I&#8722;). Under light exposure and thermal stress, I&#8722; migrates and transforms into I2, leading to irreversible degradation and performance loss. To address this issue, we introduced the additive 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole,5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4,7&#8208;bis(4,4,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborolan&#8208;2&#8208;yl) (BT2F&#8208;2B) into the perovskite.

&lt;p&gt;This study improves the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by introducing a Lewis-acid boronic ester-containing agent&#160;2,1,3-benzothiadiazole,5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)&#160;(BT2F-2B) into the perovskite precursor solution. It also provides a universal method for enhancing the stability of PSCs and a feasible approach for developing high-performance and durable PSCs for perovskite systems with different bandgaps.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite significant progress in the power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the instability of devices remains a considerable obstacle for commercial applications. This instability primarily originates from the migration of halide ions&#8212;particularly iodide ions (I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;). Under light exposure and thermal stress, I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; migrates and transforms into I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, leading to irreversible degradation and performance loss. To address this issue, we introduced the additive 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole,5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl) (BT2F-2B) into the perovskite. The strong coordination between the unhybridized p orbital and lone-pair electrons from I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; inhibits the deprotonation of MAI/FAI and the subsequent conversion of I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to I&#8322;. The highly electronegative fluorine enhances its electrostatic interaction with I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Consequently, the synergistic effect of BT2F-2B effectively suppresses the decomposition of perovskite and the defect density of the iodide vacancies. This approach delivers a PCE over 26% for inverted single-junction PSCs, with exceptional operational stability. According to the ISOS-L-3 testing protocol (maximum power point tracking at 85&#160;&#176;C and 50% relative humidity), treated PSCs retain 85% of their original PCE after 1000 h of aging. When the BT2F-2B is applied to a wide-bandgap (1.77 eV) perovskite system, the PCE of all-perovskite tandem solar cells reaches 27.8%, confirming the universality of the proposed strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Naturally Inspired Tree&#8208;Ring Structured Dressing Provides Sustained Wound Tightening and Accelerates Closure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the tree ring structure, a core ring structure hydrogel dressing with mechanical modulation has been designed. The ring portion adheres tightly to the wound edge, while the core portion spontaneously contracts with body temperature, continuously pulling and contracting the wound. This ingenious design provides excellent therapeutic benefits including epidermal regeneration, collagen deposition, extracellular matrix organization, and vascular maturation.








Abstract
Mechanically regulated wound dressings require a rational combination of contraction and adhesion functions as well as balancing exudate&#8208;induced swelling issues. However, many of the reported dressings face the dilemma of impaired function and impeded wound self&#8208;contraction due to fluid&#8208;absorbing swelling. In this study, inspired by the tree ring, a core&#8211;ring structured hydrogel dressing capable of mechanical modulation is designed, and prepare it using a simple two&#8208;step photopolymerization process. The core covers the center of the wound, contracts spontaneously at body temperature to generate a contractile force of 3.4&#160;kPa, and resists swelling. Meanwhile, the ring adheres to the normal epidermis around the wound and transfers the contraction stress to the wound edge. The integration of a functionally independent core and ring ultimately achieves effective wound traction and avoids dressing swelling. In murine and porcine skin wound&#8208;healing models, this hydrogel with a closely connected core and ring promotes healing by accelerating epidermal closure (50% closure in mouse skin on day 2, 85% closure in pig skin on day 8), collagen deposition, vascular maturation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. These results can guide further research on mechanical force modulation in wound healing, with the potential for clinical translation.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reporting Multiple Microscopic Stresses Through Tunable Microcapsule Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a method for detecting localized stress variations with micrometer resolution. It utilizes embedded microcapsule arrays that fluoresce in distinct colors at specific stress thresholds. First, microfluidic synthesis creates fluorescent dye&#8208;filled microcapsules with precise stress response. Afterward, these microcapsules are organized into arrays and embedded in elastomer films via a capillary assembly process.








Abstract
Self&#8208;reporting materials have emerged as a promising tool for real&#8208;time monitoring of stress and damage in structural materials. When critical stress is applied to these materials, an optical response is triggered &#8211; for example by dye release, or molecular cleavage. A key challenge is to extend these systems to respond to multiple different stress levels. To achieve this, a novel microcapsule&#8208;based assembly strategy is presented. Microfluidic synthesis is used to create microcapsules that release dye at a precise level of applied force. Subsequently, capillary assembly is used to combine microcapsules with different stress&#8208;responsiveness and different fluorescent dyes into chains, which are uniformly patterned into regular arrays, and embed these into the self&#8208;reporting materials. Through indentation experiments, it is shown that these materials can distinguish and record spatially resolved local stresses based on the fluorescence emitted upon microcapsule rupture. Crucially, the technique's accuracy is significantly improved when microcapsules are spatially organized within the material. This versatile technique can be applied to a range of different materials, via the use of thin coatings containing the regularly patterned microcapsule chains.

         <title>Cooling&#8208;Induced Order&#8211;Disorder Phase Transition in CsPbBr3 Nanocrystal Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a temperature&#8208;driven order&#8211;disorder phase transition occurring in CsPbBr3 nanocrystal superlattices. Temperature&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy reveal the loss of crystallinity of superlattices upon cooling and identify ligands solidification as the main driving force for this transition. Surface ligand engineering mitigates the structural degradation and results in strong exciton migration within the superlattice at cryogenic temperatures.








Abstract
Perovskite nanocrystal superlattices are being actively studied after reports have emerged on collective excitonic properties at cryogenic temperatures, where energetic disorder is minimized due to the frozen lattice vibrations. However, an important issue related to structural disorder of superlattices at low temperatures has received little attention to date. In this work, it is shown that CsPbBr3 nanocrystal superlattices undergo a reversible order&#8211;disorder transition upon cooling to 90 K. The transition consists of the loss of structural coherence, that is, increased nanocrystal misalignment, and contraction of the superlattices, as revealed by temperature&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray diffraction, and is ascribed to the solidification of ligands (on the basis of Raman spectroscopy). Introducing shorter amines on the nanocrystal surface allows to mitigate these changes, improve order, and shorten interparticle distance. It is demonstrated that the low temperature phase of the short ligand&#8208;capped nanocrystal superlattices is characterized by a strong exciton migration observable in the photoluminescence decay, which is due to the shrinkage of the inter&#8208;nanocrystal distance.

         <title>Thermal&#8208;Assisted Dry Coating Electrode Unlocking Sustainable and High&#8208;Performance Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermal&#8208;assistant dry coating approach is reported for solvent&#8208;free preparation of Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich (LMR) electrodes. The lithium difluoro(oxalate)borate (LiDFOB) and succinonitrile (SN) serve as key mediators for Li+ transport, and the melting of SN&#8208;LiDFOB can significantly improve the distribution of electrode components. The resulting LMR electrodes exhibit a remarkable energy density and rate capability.








Abstract
Current battery production relies on the use of large amounts of N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidnone (NMP) solvent during electrode preparation, which raises serious concerns in material cost, energy consumption, and toxicity, thus demanding the innovation of dry electrodes with excellent performance. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art dry electrodes show inferior energy densities, particularly under high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity and fast charge/discharge conditions required for practical applications. Here dry production of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich (LMR) cathodes is shown based on a thermal&#8208;assistant approach. The lithium difluoro(oxalate)borate (LiDFOB) and succinonitrile (SN) serve as two key electrode mediators to facilitate Li+ transport, and the mild heating process for melting SN&#8208;LiDFOB has significantly improved the distribution of various components in the electrode. These synergistic effects enable dry LMR cathodes with a maximum rate capability of 4 C (12 mA cm&#8722;2) and an areal capacity of 11.0 mAh cm&#8722;2. The resulting Li metal/LMR full cell exhibits the maximum energy and power densities of 609&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 2,183&#160;W kg&#8722;1, respectively, based on the total mass of the cathode and anode. These results not only break through the key bottleneck in energy density for dry electrodes but, in a broader context, open a new avenue for green and sustainable battery production.

These synergistic effects enable dry LMR cathodes with a maximum rate capability of 4 C (12 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and an areal capacity of 11.0 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The resulting Li metal/LMR full cell exhibits the maximum energy and power densities of 609&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 2,183&#160;W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, based on the total mass of the cathode and anode. These results not only break through the key bottleneck in energy density for dry electrodes but, in a broader context, open a new avenue for green and sustainable battery production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sustainable Lithography Paradigm Enabled by Mechanically Peelable Resists</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable lithography paradigm enabled by mechanically peelable resists is demonstrated. This paradigm involves chemical&#8208;free resist stripping, and 100%&#8208;yield mechanical lift&#8208;off, and enables reliable conformal manufacturing of transient electronics. Various exemplary demonstrations indicate this technology could potentially establish a standard lift&#8208;off process for the pan&#8208;semiconductor industry and open new avenues for the mass production of transient electronics and integrated biodegradable devices.








Abstract
Lithography is critical in micro&#8208; and nanofabrication processes, enabling the development of integrated circuits, semiconductor devices, and various advanced electronic and photonic systems. However, there are challenges related to sustainability, efficiency, and yield, as well as compatibility with transient electronics. This work introduces a sustainable lithography paradigm employing mechanically peelable resists compatible with existing cleanroom processes. The resists exhibit near&#8208;zero adhesion to various substrates, facilitating efficient, cost&#8208;effective, environmentally friendly, and chemical&#8208;free mechanical stripping without observable particulate residues. The mechanical lift&#8208;off process enables scalable and 100%&#8208;yield pattern transfer using commercially available tape within seconds. Furthermore, the new paradigm supports distributed and in situ conformal manufacturing using the peelable resist as a &#8220;transferable stencil mask&#8221; to fabricate various functional devices on flexible and nonplanar surfaces, as well as ultra&#8208;thin biodegradable substrates. Overall, this work expands the potential for using lift&#8208;off as a standard process in the pan&#8208;semiconductor industry and opens new avenues for lithographic procedures aimed at the reliable mass production of transient electronics and integrated biodegradable devices, addressing growing sustainability issues caused by electronic waste.

         <title>A Metal&#8211;Polyphenol&#8208;Based Antidepressant for Alleviating Colitis&#8208;Associated Mental Disorders</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research develops a metal&#8211;polyphenol&#8208;based nanomaterial for use as an antidepressant, which can be orally administered for modulating the microbiota&#8211;gut&#8211;brain axis in colitis mice. The nanomaterial reduces neuroinflammation, enhances hippocampal neural plasticity, modulates hippocampal immune responses, and restores neurotransmitter homeostasis in colitis mice, eventually alleviating colitis&#8208;associated mental disorders, including depression&#8208;like behavior, anxiety&#8208;like behavior, cognitive impairment, and despair.








Abstract
Emerging evidence suggests that patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are predisposed to psychosocial disturbances, such as depression and anxiety. Regrettably, clinical antidepressants exhibit unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy in IBD&#8208;associated psychosocial disturbances, primarily attributed to the inherent intestinal disorders and intricate bidirectional relationship between the gut and the brain. Herein, we report a metal&#8211;polyphenol&#8208;based antidepressant to alleviate mental disorders in dextran sulfate sodium&#8208;induced experimental acute colitis mice via modulating the microbiota&#8211;gut&#8211;brain axis. The antidepressant, termed CSMTC, comprises a core of melittin&#8208;encapsulated natural antioxidant enzymes (i.e., catalase and superoxide dismutase) and a protective shell composed of tannic acid&#8211;cerium ion network. Upon oral administration to colitis mice, CSMTC can effectively restore colonic redox balance, reinforce the intestinal barrier, modulate gut microbiota composition, maintain the blood&#8211;brain barrier integrity, and regulate systemic immune responses. Notably, behavioral test results reveal that CSMTC significantly alleviates the colitis&#8208;associated mental disorder (e.g., depression&#8208;like behavior) via the microbiota&#8211;gut&#8211;brain axis by reducing neuroinflammation, enhancing hippocampal neural plasticity, modulating hippocampal immune responses, and restoring neurotransmitter homeostasis. This work may have implications for the development of new nanodrugs for treating inflammation&#8208;associated complications.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II AIE Liposomes for Boosting Type&#8208;I Photodynamic and Mild&#8208;Temperature Photothermal Therapy in Breast Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant NIR&#8208;II FLI and improved type&#8208;I PDT/mild&#8208;temperature PTT therapy in breast cancer treatment are achieved using NIR&#8208;II AIE photosensitizers constructed by dual&#8208;strategy methods combining donor group engineering and fluorination engineering.








Abstract
Phototheranositcs has recently aroused extreme attention due to its exceptional advantages. However, the poor photothernostic efficiency, limited penetration depth, strong oxygen&#8208;dependence, and inevitable damage to normal tissue of conventional photothernostic materials severely hindered their total theranostic efficacy. Herein, a series of near&#8208;infrared second (NIR&#8208;II) photosensitizers (PSs) featuring aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging (FLI), type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) and mild&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy (PTT) are constructed through dual&#8208;strategy methods combining donor group engineering and fluorination engineering. Profiting from sufficient molecular rotors and high electronegativity of fluorine, the developed 2&#8208;(2&#8208;((5&#8208;(4&#8208;((4&#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl)(phenyl)amino)phenyl)thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methylene)&#8208;5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene)malononitrile (BTS&#8208;2F) and 2&#8208;(2&#8208;((5&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl)amino)phenyl)thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methylene)&#8208;5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene)malononitrile (TTS&#8208;2F) are endowed with NIR&#8208;II AIE property, high radical reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation ability and mild&#8208;temperature photothermal conversion. Through thin film hydration method, the prepared BTS&#8208;2F and TTS&#8208;2F&#160;loaded liposomes exhibit significant NIR&#8208;II FLI and improved type&#8208;I PDT/mild&#8208;temperature PTT therapy under laser irradiation both in vitro and orthotopic 4T1 mice models.

         <title>Bacteriophage&#8208;Activated DNAzyme Hydrogels Combined with Machine Learning Enable Point&#8208;of&#8208;Use Colorimetric Detection of Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A colorimetric hydrogel sensing platform for the detection of pathogens in water and clinical samples is described. The polyacrylamide hydrogel is held together with pathogen&#8208;responsive DNAzyme&#8208;substrate cross&#8208;linking and has demonstrated high sensitivity for detecting E. coli in lake water and urine. The bacteriophage&#8208;mediated signal amplification effect outlined in the design has potential applications for future biosensor development.








Abstract
Developing cost&#8208;effective, consumer&#8208;accessible platforms for point&#8208;of&#8208;use environmental and clinical pathogen testing is a priority, to reduce reliance on laborious, time&#8208;consuming culturing approaches. Unfortunately, a system offering ultrasensitive detection capabilities in a form that requires little auxiliary equipment or training has remained elusive. Here, a colorimetric DNAzyme&#8208;crosslinked hydrogel sensor is presented. In the presence of a target pathogen, DNAzyme cleavage results in hydrogel dissolution, yielding the release of entrapped gold nanoparticles in a manner visible to the naked eye. Recognizing that Escherichia coli holds high relevance within both environmental and clinical environments, an E. coli&#8208;responsive DNAzyme is incorporated into this platform. Through the optimization of the hydrogel polymerization process and the discovery of bacteriophage&#8208;induced DNAzyme signal amplification, 101 CFU mL&#8722;1 E. coli is detected within real&#8208;world lake water samples. Subsequent pairing with an artificial intelligence model removed ambiguity in sensor readout, offering 96% true positive and 100% true negative accuracy. Finally, high sensor specificity and stability results supported clinical use, where 100% of urine samples collected from patients with E. coli urinary tract infections are accurately identified. No false positives are observed when testing healthy samples. Ultimately, this platform stands to significantly improve population health by substantially increasing pathogen testing accessibility.

Ultimately, this platform stands to significantly improve population health by substantially increasing pathogen testing accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multilevel Optical Storage, Dynamic Light Modulation, and Polarization Control in Filamented Memristor System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study proposes a multifunction metallic filamented memristor offering wavelength&#8208;dependent optical storage, light modulation, and polarization control. The optical readout of the structure's state provides more accurate information than electrical measurements, enabling the recovery of the complete record of applied voltages even in the presence of stochastic filament breaks. Spectroscopic ellipsometry gives real&#8208;time insights into cation dynamics and permittivity changes.








Abstract
The electrochemical metallization (ECM) mechanism is emerging as a promising approach for the development of optical memristors&#8212;nonvolatile memory systems proposed for use as artificial synapses in neuromorphic computing applications. ECM memristors offer exceptional operating dynamics and power efficiency compared to other systems, but challenges with reproducible cycle&#8208;to&#8208;cycle state switching and the absence of advanced optical functionalities hinder their integration into photonic systems. In this work, an ECM free&#8208;standing memristor structure is proposed, which simultaneously offers wavelength&#8208;dependent multilevel nonvolatile optical storage, volatile light modulation, and dynamic polarization control. It is demonstrated that in the presence of a resonance, the optical readout provides noise&#8208;free, robust, and significantly more accurate information about the memristor's state than electrical measurement. The use of light allows to gain insight into the intermediate electrical levels of the device as it transitions between high and low resistance states and to recover the complete record of applied voltages even when stochastic filament ruptures occur. Finally, the investigations show that spectroscopic ellipsometry provides real&#8208;time information on the dynamics of cation movement and the corresponding permittivity changes at the interfaces between the switching layer and the electrodes, thus becoming a complementary characterization method for ECM memristors alongside state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques.

         <title>Screening Fluorination Additives for Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep investigation is conducted to evaluate the impact of diverse fluorinated additives on the domain distribution within the quasi&#8208;2D perovskite. By utilizing the fluorinated additive with minimal dipole moment, the undesirable small&#8208;n domain is successfully inhibited, which enables the fabrication of efficient PeLED with an impressive EQE of 20.38% at 488&#160;nm.








Abstract
Fluorinated additives are proposed to address the issue of domain polydispersity in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites. However, the lack of established screening criteria for these additives necessitates a laborious and costly trial&#8208;and&#8208;error process. Herein, this work explores the behind nature for the first time how various fluorination in fluorinated additives affect domain distribution in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites. The studies reveal that fully fluorinated additives could suppress undesirable low&#8208;dimensional domains, facilitating efficient energy transfer, while partially fluorinated additives adversely cause deteriorated optical properties. The observed trend is ascribed to the molecular dipole moment of the fluorinated additives, offering a reasonable explanation for experimental phenomena that has never been reported before. By employing fully fluorinated additives, the fabricated sky&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) deliver a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 20.38% (@488&#160;nm), marking as one of the highest efficiencies reported to date. The finding provides a screening criterion for fluorinated additives to realize efficient PeLEDs.

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Electrical Synergetic Control of Non&#8208;Volatile States in Bilayer Graphene&#8208;CrOCl Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study explores the effect of chromium oxychloride (CrOCl) spin states on bilayer graphene (BLG) using capacitance measurements. A unique hysteretic behavior in charging states is observed, influenced by magnetization history, not electrical gating. This behavior can be electrically controlled. First&#8208;principles calculations show it results from charge transfer during CrOCl's phase transition, offering new insights for 2D device design.








Abstract
Anti&#8208;ferromagnetic insulator chromium oxychloride (CrOCl) has shown peculiar charge transfer and correlation&#8208;enhanced emerging properties when interfaced with other van der Waals conductive channels. However, the influence of its spin states to the channel material remains largely unknown. Here, this issue is addressed by directly measuring the density of states in bilayer graphene (BLG) interfaced with CrOCl via a high&#8208;precision capacitance measurement technique and a surprising hysteretic behavior in the charging states of the heterostructure is observed. Such hysteretic behavior depends only on the history of magnetization, but not on the history of electrical gating; it can also be turned off electrically, providing a synergetic control of these non&#8208;volatile states. First&#8208;principles calculations attribute this observation to magnetic field&#8208;controlled charge transfer between BLG and CrOCl during the phase transition of CrOCl from antiferromagnetic (AFM) to ferrimagnetic&#8208;like (FiM) states. This magnetic&#8208;electrical synergetic control mechanism broadens the scope of proximity effects and opens new possibilities for the design of advanced 2D heterostructures and devices.

         <title>Molecular Design of a Diketopyrrolopyrrole Conjugated Oligoelectrolyte Capable of Imaging Intracellular Vesicle Membrane Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study designs a novel lipid bilayer probe, COE&#8208;KP, that features record fluorogenic characteristics and responsiveness to protic environments through acceptor modulation within the conjugated oligoelectrolyte backbone. COE&#8208;KP is capable of differentiating between cells of different growth states based on its fluorescence lifetime. Stimulated emission depletion (STED) imaging using COE&#8208;KP also enables direct visualization of intracellular vesicle membrane structures.








Abstract
Conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) are lipid bilayer spanning optical reporters that hold promise for delineating spatiotemporal changes in subcellular compartments. However, their ability to probe a broader range of biological processes remains restricted due to the lack of environmentally&#8208;responsive chemical functionalities. Herein, the study reports a novel COE, namely COE&#8208;KP, for monitoring spatiotemporal changes in the endolysosomal vesicles. COE&#8208;KP features a central diketopyrrolopyrrole functional group in the optically active conjugated core that confers photophysical properties suitable for bioimaging, in particular responding to the presence of hydrogen bonding functionalities within the hydrophobic domain of the lipid bilayer. COE&#8208;KP can thus discriminate cells in different growth states through two&#8208;photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) with excitation in the NIR&#8208;II range. These changes in lifetime most reasonably reflect the degree of water permeability through the membrane and are not linked to notable differences in membrane tension or solvent polarity. Furthermore, using stimulated emission depletion (STED) nanoscopy, it is possible to directly visualize membrane&#8208;bound COEs within cellular vesicles. These results illustrate further opportunities for applying COE&#8208;based reporters for super&#8208;resolution microscopy of organelle membranes, visualization of subcellular membrane morphologies, and imaging long&#8208;term changes in membrane properties.

C&#8208;2PACz&#8208;based thermally evaporated sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs obtains a champion EQE of 10.41% @65.59 cd&#160;m&#8722;2. This work provides new insights into design strategies for dual&#8208;function SAMs to achieve higher performance in PeLEDs.








Abstract
Thermally evaporated perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) hold immense potential for future applications in the display industry. However, the performance of blue PeLEDs is far behind, one of the most important reasons is the lack of suitable hole&#8208;transporting materials. Herein, the study designs and synthesizes a new class of self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) materials, namely, (2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;bis(4&#8208;formylphenyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid (C&#8208;2PACz) and (2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(methylsulfonyl)phenyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid&#160;(S&#8208;2PACz). First, the phosphonic acid is induced to form bidentate bonds with ITO. Second, the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups are integrated to increase the electron cloud density of the termini contacting with perovskite, which enhances the electrostatic interaction with the Pb2+, reduces the interfacial defects. These advantages improve their carrier transport ability and reduce the non&#8208;radiative recombination at the interface. Meanwhile, it is found that compound C&#8208;2PACz possessing the smaller steric hindrance makes the SAMs have a&#160;more homogeneous film and a&#160;better interfacial passivation effect. By employing C&#8208;2PACz as hole&#8208;transporting layer in blue PeLEDs with metal halides as the emitting layer, the device exhibits a high brightness (1843&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2) and a maximum external quantum efficiency (10.41% @65.59&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2), which among the best of reported thermally evaporated sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs. The work provides new insights into design strategies for dual&#8208;function SAMs to achieve higher performance in PeLEDs.

         <title>An Oral PROTAC Targeting HPK1 Degradation Potentiates Anti&#8208;Solid Tumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel oral PROTAC is developed to potentiate the immune response by targeting the degradation of HPK1 in T cells. Conveniently modifiable in dose and duration of administration, the oral PROTAC provides a promising tool for CAR&#8208;T cell&#8208; and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody&#8208;mediated immunotherapy for treating cancers such as cervical and colon cancers.








Abstract
Hematopoietic progenitor pinase1 (HPK1) knockout has been identified as an efficient route to enhance anti&#8208;tumor immune response. Here, this work develops an oral proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) targeting HPK1 to efficiently and selectively degrade HPK1 to augment immunotherapeutic outcomes. In a postoperative tumor model of human cervical cancer in NSG mice, the orally&#8208;administrated PROTAC can reach tumors, down&#8208;regulate HPK1 levels in locally&#8208;administrated CAR&#8208;T cells, and promote their efficiency in inhibiting solid tumor recurrence, achieving 50% partial response (PR) and 50% complete response (CR). In addition, oral administration of PROTAC can amplify the suppression capability of the anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody on the growth of CT26 solid tumors in BALB/c mice by promoting the infiltration of CD45&#8208;positive immune cells from 0.7% to 1.5% and CD3&#8208;positive T cells from 0.2% to 0.5% within the tumors.

Abstract
Humidity sensors are vital for ambient monitoring, but existing sensors focus on moisture absorption, overlooking the indispensable role of ion channels in the water&#8208;electricity conversion process. Here, an ultra&#8208;miniaturized fiber humidity (MFH) sensor based on near&#8208;parallel ion pathways is presented. The well&#8208;designed nanochannels significantly facilitate ion transport due to the stable charge distribution and the confined ions migration within near&#8208;parallel nanostructure, which improves the water&#8208;electricity conversion efficiency of moisture&#8208;sensitive fibers. Optimized nanochannels enable the MFH sensor to improve the response/recovery speed by &#8776;5 times compared to the disordered nanochannels. Additionally, the MFH sensor can be woven for ultra&#8208;miniaturization (0.50 mm2), which is much smaller than current sensors. Therefore, the integrated MFH sensor array demonstrated exceptionally high spatial resolution (sensor density of 1 mm&#8722;1), highlighting its potential in flexible wearables. This work provides new optimization strategies and assembly means for designing the high&#8208;performance humidity sensors of the next generation.

         <title>Design Principles for Enhancing Both Carrier Mobility and Stretchability in Polymer Semiconductors via Lewis Acid Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study systematically investigates the molecular interactions between the host polymer and Lewis acid dopants, offering an effective strategy to simultaneously enhance the carrier mobility and stretchability of polymer semiconductors. Optimizing lamellar stacking distance and reducing crystallinity promote the dispersion of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane within the side&#8208;chain regions. Reducing the strength of Lewis base groups in the polymer prevents the formation of excessively strong Lewis acid&#8208;base complexes, thus maintaining chain flexibility.








Abstract
With the rise of skin&#8208;like electronics, devices are increasingly coming into close contact with the human body, creating a demand for polymer semiconductors (PSCs) that combine stretchability with reliable electrical performance. However, balancing mechanical robustness with high carrier mobility remains a challenge. To address this, tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF) for Lewis acid doping is proposed to improve charge mobility while enhancing stretchability by increasing structural disorder. Through systematic investigation, several key structural principles have been identified to maximize the effectiveness of BCF doping in stretchable PSCs. Notably, increasing the lamellar stacking distance and reducing crystallinity facilitate the incorporation of BCF into the alkyl side&#8208;chain regions, thereby enhancing both mobility and stretchability. Conversely, stronger Lewis base groups in the main chain negatively impact these improvements. These results demonstrate that with a small addition of BCF, a two&#8208;fold increase in carrier mobility is achieved while simultaneously enhancing the crack onset strain to 100%. Furthermore, doped PSCs exhibit stable mobility retention under repeated 30% strains over 1000 cycles. This method of decoupling carrier mobility from mechanical properties opens up new avenues in the search for high&#8208;mobility stretchable PSCs.

         <title>A High&#8208;Stability Pressure&#8208;Sensitive Implantable Memristor for Pulmonary Hypertension Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the potential of implantable memristors with Ag/MnO2/BaTiO3/FTO structure for pulmonary artery pressure monitoring. It shows excellent stability and biocompatibility, providing new inspiration for the design of efficient, real&#8208;time, and reliable implantable pressure monitoring device in medical health monitoring.








Abstract
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) significantly affects the quality of life and lifespan of humans and has promoted the development of flexible implantable electronic devices for PH diagnosis and prevention. Traditional implantable devices based on the von Neumann architecture face insurmountable challenges in processing large amounts of biological data due to computational bottlenecks. Memristors, with integrated in&#8208;memory sensing and computing capabilities, can effectively eliminate computational bottlenecks and become one of the most promising products in implantable devices for health monitoring. Here, a memristor with the Ag/MnO2/BaTiO3/FTO structure is implemented and implanted into Sprague&#8210;Dawley (SD) rats. With polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) packaging, the device can be continuously worked in vivo for up to four weeks, demonstrating excellent stability and biocompatibility. Furthermore, a memristive sensor array is designed for pulmonary artery blood pressure monitoring based on the pressure&#8208;responsive characteristics of the as&#8208;prepared memristive device. The front&#8208;end memristive sensor array can collect and feedback pressure signal, while noise reduction is achieved through memristive logic circuits, and ultimately the memristor neural network processes and classifies the information. Therefore, this work demonstrates the potential of implantable memristors for pulmonary artery pressure monitoring and provides new inspiration for the design of efficient, real&#8208;time, and reliable implantable pressure monitoring devices in medical health monitoring.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary hypertension (PH) significantly affects the quality of life and lifespan of humans and has promoted the development of flexible implantable electronic devices for PH diagnosis and prevention. Traditional implantable devices based on the von Neumann architecture face insurmountable challenges in processing large amounts of biological data due to computational bottlenecks. Memristors, with integrated in-memory sensing and computing capabilities, can effectively eliminate computational bottlenecks and become one of the most promising products in implantable devices for health monitoring. Here, a memristor with the Ag/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/FTO structure is implemented and implanted into Sprague&#8210;Dawley (SD) rats. With polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) packaging, the device can be continuously worked in vivo for up to four weeks, demonstrating excellent stability and biocompatibility. Furthermore, a memristive sensor array is designed for pulmonary artery blood pressure monitoring based on the pressure-responsive characteristics of the as-prepared memristive device. The front-end memristive sensor array can collect and feedback pressure signal, while noise reduction is achieved through memristive logic circuits, and ultimately the memristor neural network processes and classifies the information. Therefore, this work demonstrates the potential of implantable memristors for pulmonary artery pressure monitoring and provides new inspiration for the design of efficient, real-time, and reliable implantable pressure monitoring devices in medical health monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Doping Ti into RuO2 to Accelerate Bridged&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Assisted Deprotonation for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing an additional proton acceptor is essential for achieving rapid deprotonation kinetics of oxo intermediates during acidic oxygenevolution reaction (OER). In this work, the construction of a RuTiOx solid solution optimizes proton adsorption energy at Obri sites, thereby activating an Obri&#8208;assisted deprotonation mechanism. Consequently, RuTiOx exhibits excellent electrochemical performance for OER.








Abstract
The development of efficient and durable electrocatalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for advancing renewable hydrogen energy technology. However, the slow deprotonation kinetics of oxo&#8208;intermediates, involving the four proton&#8208;coupled electron steps, hinder the acidic OER progress. Herein, a RuTiOx solid solution electrocatalyst is investigated, which features bridged oxygen (Obri) sites that act as proton acceptors, accelerating the deprotonation of oxo&#8208;intermediates. Electrochemical tests, infrared spectroscopy, and density functional theory results reveal that the moderate proton adsorption energy on Obri sites facilitates fast deprotonation kinetics through the adsorbate evolution mechanism. This process effectively prevents the over&#8208;oxidation and deactivation of Ru sites caused by the lattice oxygen mechanism. Consequently, RuTiOx shows a low overpotential of 198&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2geo and performance exceeding 1400&#160;h at 50&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2geo with negligible deactivation. These insights into the OER mechanism and the structure&#8208;function relationship are crucial for the advancement of catalytic systems.

         <title>Optimizing Si&#9472;O Conjugation to Enhance Interfacial Kinetics for Low&#8208;Temperature Rechargeable Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategic molecular bond design has led to the identification of siloxanes as novel low&#8208;temperature solvents for high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The d&#8208;p conjugation of the Si&#9472;O bond enhances voltage resistance and weakens Li+&#8208;solvent interactions.








Abstract
With the growing demand for high&#8208;voltage and wide&#8208;temperature range applications of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), the requirements for electrolytes have become increasingly stringent. While fluorination engineering has enhanced the performance of traditional solvent systems, it has also raised concerns regarding cost, environmental hazards, and low reduction stability. Through strategic molecular bond design, a novel class of low&#8208;temperature (LT) solvents&#8212;siloxanes&#8212;is identified, meeting the demands of LT and high&#8208;voltage applications in LIBs. The d&#8208;p conjugation of the Si&#9472;O bond enhances voltage resistance and weakens the Li+&#8208;solvent interactions. By modulating the number of Si&#9472;O conjugated bonds, the type of anion clusters in the solvation structure can be controlled, ultimately leading to the formation of a LiF and Si&#9472;O&#8208;rich interfacial layer and facilitating rapid Li+ conduction. Consequently, the graphite||NCM811 pouch cell (2.3 Ah, 4.45 V) with a siloxane&#8208;based electrolyte retains 75.1% of room temperature capacity (RTC) at &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C. The rapid interface kinetics allow a superior reversible charging capacity retention of 67.6% at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, with good cycle stability at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. This study provides new insights into solvent design to fortify LIB performance in harsh conditions.

A novel formulation referred to water&#8208;stable magnetic lipiodol micro&#8208;droplets (MLMD) possesses properties such as flowability, shape adaptability, efficient drug loading, and compatibility with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) imaging is presented.

Abstract
Magnetic microrobots, designed to navigate the complex environments of the human body, show promise for minimally invasive diagnosis and treatment. However, their clinical adoption faces hurdles such as biocompatibility, precise control, and intelligent tracking. Here a novel formulation (referred to water&#8208;stable magnetic lipiodol micro&#8208;droplets, MLMD), integrating clinically approved lipiodol, gelatin, and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) with a fundamental understanding of the structure&#8208;property relationships is presented. This formulation demonstrates multiple improved properties including flowability, shape adaptability, efficient drug loading, and compatibility with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) imaging in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. This enables the MLMD as a versatile tool for image&#8208;guided therapy, supported by a close&#8208;looped magnetic navigation system featuring artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;driven visual feedback for autonomous control. The system effectively performs navigational tasks, including pinpointing specific locations of MLMD, recognizing and avoiding obstacles, mapping and following predetermined paths, and utilizing magnetic fields for precise motion planning to achieve visual drug delivery. The MLMD combines magnetic actuation with an AI&#8208;directed close&#8208;looped navigation, offering a transformative platform for targeted therapeutic delivery.

         <title>Vertical Graphene&#8208;Based Multiparametric Sensing Array for Integration of Smart Catheter to Electrochemically Monitor Peritoneal Dialysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertical graphene&#8208;based multiparametric sensing array (VG&#8208;MSA) developed for smart catheter integration to electrochemically monitor peritoneal dialysis. Vertical graphene electrode with good electrochemical properties serves as a core module to develop a miniatured sensing array&#160;with sufficient electrochemical performance. The VG&#8208;MSA enabled sensitive and multiplexed measurement of dialysate components, realizing in situ, real&#8208;time, and continuous biochemical information collection during peritoneal dialysis.








Abstract
Renal failure is typical chronic kidney disease that required peritoneal dialysis as the primary treatment, but current catheter devices lack functionality to monitor changes in chemical analytes during peritoneal dialysis. Fabrication of miniatured sensing modules with good electrochemical performance in tiny catheter devices is the key to realize the smart monitoring of peritoneal dialysis. In this work, a vertical graphene&#8208;based multiparametric sensing array (VG&#8208;MSA) is developed to continuously measure fluctuations of various analyte concentrations for peritoneal dialysis monitoring. Vertical graphene (VG) electrode with good electrochemical properties serves as the core module in VG&#8208;MSA, allowing the development of miniatured sensing modules with sufficient electrochemical performance. The VG&#8208;MSA enables sensitive and multiplexed measurement of dialysate components like metabolites (reactive oxygen species, uric acid, and glucose) and ions (K+, Ca2+, and H+). The VG&#8208;MSA is demonstrated to effectively detect biochemical signals in peritoneal dialysate in vivo on rat models. The VG&#8208;MSA catheter can be inserted into abdominal cavity, allowing full contact with dialysate for in situ, real&#8208;time, and continuous collection of biochemical information during peritoneal dialysis. The VG&#8208;MSA catheter device offers a valuable tool for monitoring dialysis quality and facilitating treatment adjustments, potentially as a promising platform for high&#8208;quality therapy of renal failure.

The VG-MSA is demonstrated to effectively detect biochemical signals in peritoneal dialysate in vivo on rat models. The VG-MSA catheter can be inserted into abdominal cavity, allowing full contact with dialysate for in situ, real-time, and continuous collection of biochemical information during peritoneal dialysis. The VG-MSA catheter device offers a valuable tool for monitoring dialysis quality and facilitating treatment adjustments, potentially as a promising platform for high-quality therapy of renal failure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>4H&#8208;SiC Metalens: Mitigating Thermal Drift Effect in High&#8208;Power Laser Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monolithic 4H&#8208;SiC metalens with exceptional thermal stability is applied in high&#8208;power laser applications, achieving diffraction&#8208;limited focusing (NA 0.5, focal length 1 cm). After 1 h of 15W, 1030 nm pulsed laser irradiation, it exhibits only a 3.2&#160;&#176;C temperature rise and a 14 &#181;m focal shift. Cutting 4H&#8208;SiC wafers results in just an 11.4% depth change, marking a significant advance for high&#8208;power laser systems and expanding their application potential.








Abstract
Enhancing energy density and efficiency in laser processing hinges on precise beam focusing, yet this often causes severe heat absorption and focus shifts in optical lenses. Traditional cooling methods increase cost and complexity, severely limiting versatility. Here, monolithic silicon carbide (SiC) metalens is introduced, which shows unparalleled thermal stability, integrated with a high&#8208;power laser. This metalens achieves diffraction&#8208;limited focusing with a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.5 and a focal length of 1&#160;cm. Under a 1030&#160;nm pulsed laser at 15&#160;W for 1 h, it shows a minimal temperature rise of 3.2&#160;&#176;C and a tiny focal shift of 14&#160;&#181;m (0.1% relative), only 6% of the shift in conventional lenses. When used to cut a 4H&#8208;SiC substrate with the same laser, the metalens exhibit only an 11.4% change in cutting depth after 1 h of operation, correlating with the focal shift results. The results unveil a groundbreaking class of compact SiC photonics devices nearly impervious to heat absorption, representing a monumental leap for high&#8208;power laser systems and opening new horizons for their applications and efficiency.

         <title>Synergistic Degradation of Durable Polymer Networks by Light and Acid Enabled by Pyrenylsilicon Crosslinks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significant advancement in resolving the incompatibility between photodegradablity and photostability of polymer materials is reported by developing a novel cleavage reaction of the C&#8211;Si bond under simultaneous exposure to light and acid. The synergistic activation of polymer materials can be applied to a wide range of materials, including color&#8208;tunable optical materials, tough elastic materials, and additive/subtractive 3D&#8208;photoprinting materials.








Abstract
Material photocontrol has gained importance in process engineering and biomedical applications. However, highly photoreactive materials are intrinsically unstable to light, which limits their continuous use in lit environments owing to their gradual deterioration. Herein, synergistically photocontrollable materials in the presence of acid are developed to overcome the conventional trade&#8208;off between their photoreactivity and photostability. Pyrenylsilicon derivatives are designed as synergistically cleavable moieties on C&#8211;Si bonds under simultaneous treatment with light and acid through photoinduced dearomatization and protonation to generate the Wheland intermediate, whereas the derivatives are highly stable to light or acid alone. The unique reactivity of pyrenylsilicon derivatives is applied to various polymer network crosslinkers, enabling synergistic control and degradation of materials with light and acids. Because of their high photostability in the absence of acids, these materials can be utilized as optical materials, robust elastomers, and 3D photoprinted gels.

         <title>Hyaluronic Acid&#8208;Nanocoated Bacteria Generate an Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Tissue&#8208;Repair Effect in Impaired Gut and Extraintestinal Organs</title>

         <dc:description>
Nanocoating Clostridium butyricum with hyaluronic acid is reported to develop a dual&#8208;functionality and dual&#8208;location intervention strategy, which can attenuate intestinal mucosal inflammation and recover gut barrier integrity, as well as alleviate interstitial inflammation and pathological damage of extraintestinal organs via remodeling microbial metabolites and decreasing microbial translocation. This work proposes a type of next&#8208;generation living therapeutics for treating extraintestinal diseases.








Abstract
Diverse extraintestinal diseases are characterized by localized inflammatory responses and tissue damage, accompanied with intestinal inflammation and injury. Here, a dual&#8208;functionality and dual&#8208;location intervention strategy is reported, which is the use of hyaluronic acid&#8208;nanocoated Clostridium butyricum to generate an anti&#8208;inflammatory tissue&#8208;repair effect in the impaired gut and extraintestinal organs. Nanocoated bacteria attenuate intestinal mucosal inflammation and recover gut barrier integrity by leveraging the immunosuppressive nature of hyaluronic acid and the butyrate&#8208;producing ability of Clostridium butyricum. Nanocoated bacteria also alleviate the interstitial inflammation and pathological damage of extraintestinal organs via remodeling microbial metabolites and decreasing microbial translocation. In murine models of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, oral delivery of nanocoated bacteria demonstrates the potency to restore renal function and eliminate renal fibrosis. This work proposes a type of next&#8208;generation living therapeutics for treating extraintestinal diseases.

         <dc:description>
A new treatment using a polymer&#8208;formulated nerve growth factor that can cross the blood&#8208;brain barrier, which effectively reduced oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis, reshaped microglia polarization at infarct sites, and decreased the overall microinfarct burden, leading to improvements in behavioral and cognitive functions in a mouse model. This work provides a promising new therapeutic for cerebral microinfarcts and other neurodegeneration diseases.








Abstract
Cerebral microinfarcts represent the most prevalent form of ischemic brain injury in the elderly, particularly among those suffering from dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular risk factors. Despite their commonality, effective treatments have remained elusive. Herein, a novel treatment utilizing a polymer&#8208;formulated nerve growth factor capable of crossing the blood&#8208;brain barrier is reported, which effectively reduced oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis, reshaped microglia polarization at infarct sites, and decreased the overall microinfarct burden, leading to notable improvements in behavioral and cognitive functions in a mouse model. This work provides a promising new avenue for the treatment of cerebral microinfarcts and other neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Eutectogel with Cell Permeation and Multiple Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Abilities for Treating Chronic Periodontitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article fabricates an injectable eutectogel via self&#8208;assembly of ChCl/M DES, gallic acid, and lysozyme fibers. The eutectogels exhibit the potential to enhance the efficacy if treatments/therapies against inflammatory diseases by facilitating bacterial control, reactive oxygen species scavenging, and the regulation of macrophages by promoting cell permeation of small&#8208;molecule drugs.








Abstract
Eutectogels represent an attractive option for various industrial applications that use deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as effective liquid active ingredients and offer remarkable stability, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and environmental friendliness. However, the biological applications of these compounds are limited. DESs are highly structurally tunable and exhibit remarkable biofunctionality and biocompatibility, conferring substantial benefits in the treatment of diseases. In this study, choline&#8208;chloride and mannose are used to fabricate ChCl/M DES, followed by introduction of lysozyme fibers and gallic acid for self&#8208;assembly into injectable eutectogels through hydrogen bonding and hydrophilic/hydrophobic interaction interactions.

&lt;p&gt;This article fabricates an injectable eutectogel via self-assembly of ChCl/M DES, gallic acid, and lysozyme fibers. The eutectogels exhibit the potential to enhance the efficacy if treatments/therapies against inflammatory diseases by facilitating bacterial control, reactive oxygen species scavenging, and the regulation of macrophages by promoting cell permeation of small-molecule drugs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eutectogels represent an attractive option for various industrial applications that use deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as effective liquid active ingredients and offer remarkable stability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental friendliness. However, the biological applications of these compounds are limited. DESs are highly structurally tunable and exhibit remarkable biofunctionality and biocompatibility, conferring substantial benefits in the treatment of diseases. In this study, choline-chloride and mannose are used to fabricate ChCl/M DES, followed by introduction of lysozyme fibers and gallic acid for self-assembly into injectable eutectogels through hydrogen bonding and hydrophilic/hydrophobic interaction interactions. The eutectogels demonstrate almost 100% bactericidal activities against three strains and significant immune-regulation. This is supported by a decrease in the proportion of CD86-expressing cells from 64.02% to 18.17% and an increase in CD206-expressing cells from 2.53% to 29.96% through flow cytometry experiments. The eutectogels effectively inhibit alveolar bone loss and alleviated local inflammation in a rat model of chronic periodontitis owing to the promotion of gallic acid in the cell membrane by the ChCl/M DES. Hence, self-assembled eutectogels exhibit the potential to enhance the efficacy if treatments/therapies against inflammatory diseases by facilitating bacterial control, reactive oxygen species scavenging, and the regulation of macrophages by promoting cell permeation of small-molecule drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The researchers successfully synthesized a novel cathode material, T#2&#8208;Li0.69CoO2. Owing to the unique Li&#9472;O tetrahedral coordination structure and the dominant cobalt oxidation under high voltage, T#2&#8208;Li0.69CoO2 delivers an ultra&#8208;high specific capacity of 258 mAh g&#8722;1, close to the theoretical capacity, thereby exhibiting a record&#8208;high volumetric energy density of up to 4410 Wh L&#8722;1 among all reported cathodes.








Abstract
Efficient utilization of resources is crucial for the sustainable development of the lithium&#8208;ion battery industry. Although the traditional R3&#175;$\bar{3}$m space group LiCoO2 can provide a current advanced discharge capacity of 215&#8211;220 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at an upper cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#160;V (relative to Li&#8314;/Li), it still falls far short of its theoretical specific capacity of 273 mAh g&#8315;&#185;, and exhibits structural instability and labile oxygen loss, leading to rapid capacity degradation. T#2&#8208;Li0.69CoO2 is synthesized with Cmca space group and Li&#9472;O tetrahedral coordination. Owing to the unique Li&#9472;O tetrahedral coordination structure and the dominant cobalt oxidation under high voltage, T#2&#8208;Li0.69CoO2 delivers an ultra&#8208;high specific capacity of 258 mAh g&#8722;1, close to the theoretical capacity, in liquid electrolyte batteries and 253 mAh g&#8722;1 in solid state batteries, overcoming the structural instability of layered oxide cathodes during charging and discharging processes. This study broadens the possibilities of creating high energy&#8208;density cathodes for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Breaking the Mutual&#8208;Constraint of Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysis via Direct O&#9472;O Coupling on High&#8208;Valence Ir Single&#8208;Atom on MnOx</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mutual constraint of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) bifunctional electrocatalysis is ingenuously broken on a high&#8208;valence Ir single atom anchored on manganese oxide bifunctional catalyst through direct O&#9472;O coupling, which shows independent pathways for ORR and OER, i.e., associated 4e&#8722; pathway for ORR and a novel chemical&#8208;activated concerted mechanism for OER.









Abstract
Insufficient bifunctional activity of electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the major obstruction to the application of rechargeable metal&#8211;air batteries. The primary reason is the mutual constraint of ORR and OER mechanism, involving the same oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and demonstrating the scaling limitations of the adsorption energies. Herein, it is reported a high&#8208;valence Ir single atom anchored on manganese oxide (IrSA&#8208;MnOx) bifunctional catalyst showing independent pathways for ORR and OER, i.e., associated 4e&#8722; pathway on high&#8208;valence Ir site for ORR and a novel chemical&#8208;activated concerted mechanism for OER, where a distinct spontaneous chemical activation process triggers direct O&#9472;O coupling. The IrSA&#8208;MnOx therefore delivers outstanding bifunctional activities with remarkably low potential difference (0.635&#160;V) between OER potential at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and ORR half&#8208;wave potential in alkaline solution. This work breaks the scaling limitations and provides a new avenue to design efficient and multifunctional electrocatalysts.

         <title>Programmable Shape&#8208;Morphing Enables Ceramic Meta&#8208;Aerogel Highly Stretchable for Thermal Protection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stretchable ceramic meta&#8208;aerogel with a binary cellular structure, combining anisotropic lamellated aerogel (grid section) and isotropic random aerogel (mesh section), is fabricated using kirigami stacking and subsequent nanofiber freeze&#8208;drying techniques. This specific topological structure design enables the meta&#8208;aerogel robust structure, highly elastic tensile deformation, exceptional fatigue resistance for tensile, compressive, and buckling cycles, temperature&#8208;invariant superelastic, superior thermal insulation; and these properties make it a potential application for exploring thermal protective materials.








Abstract
Ceramic aerogels hold significant potential for thermal insulation, yet their mechanical stretchability and thermal stability fall short in extreme environments. Here, the study presents a programmable shape&#8208;morphing strategy aimed at engineering a binary network topology structure within ceramic aerogels to effectively dissipate stress and block heat transfer. The special topology design, which includes kirigami lamellated aerogels for bearing loading stress and randomly assembled aerogels for mechanical energy pre&#8208;storage to transfer tensile stress, effectively achieves unexpected mechanical tensile properties and thermal stability. The resulting robust meta&#8208;aerogels demonstrate remarkable structural stability with topology&#8208;derived mechanical tensile of up to 85% strain, excellent resilience to 500 cycles of 50% tensile strain, 1000 cycles of 60% buckling strain, and 500 cycles of 50% compressive strain, temperature&#8208;invariant tensile recovery capability; simultaneously, low thermal conductivity of 33.01&#160;mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 and tensile&#8208;invariant thermal insulation makes the ceramic meta&#8208;aerogels an ideal substitute material for various applications.

         <title>Electric&#8208;Field Control of the Local Thermal Conductivity in Charge Transfer Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;volatile thermal states can be written on the surface of Fe and Co oxides by conductive Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) lithography. Spatially resolved Frequency Domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR)&#160;demonstrates an excellent control over the local thermal conductivity, with reductions up to 50%, controlled by the applied electric field.









Abstract
Phonons, the collective excitations responsible for heat transport in crystalline insulating solids, lack electric charge or magnetic moment, which complicates their active control via external fields. This presents a significant challenge in designing thermal equivalents of basic electronic circuit elements, such as transistors or diodes. Achieving these goals requires precise and reversible modification of thermal conductivity in materials. In this work, the continuous tuning of local thermal conductivity in charge&#8208;transfer SrFeO3&#8208;x and La0.6Sr0.4CoO3&#8208;x oxides using a voltage&#8208;biased Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)&#160;tip at room temperature is demonstrated. This method allows the creation of micron&#8208;sized domains with well&#8208;defined thermal conductivity, achieving reductions of up to 50%, measured by spatially resolved Frequency Domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR). By optimizing the oxide's chemical composition, the thermal states remain stable under normal atmospheric conditions but can be reverted to their original values through thermal annealing in air. A comparison between Mott&#8211;Hubbard and charge&#8208;transfer oxides reveals the critical role of redox&#8208;active lattice oxygen in ensuring full reversibility of the process. This approach marks a significant step toward fabricating oxide&#8208;based tunable microthermal resistances and other elements for thermal circuits.

&lt;p&gt;Non-volatile thermal states can be written on the surface of Fe and Co oxides by conductive Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) lithography. Spatially resolved Frequency Domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR)&#160;demonstrates an excellent control over the local thermal conductivity, with reductions up to 50%, controlled by the applied electric field.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phonons, the collective excitations responsible for heat transport in crystalline insulating solids, lack electric charge or magnetic moment, which complicates their active control via external fields. This presents a significant challenge in designing thermal equivalents of basic electronic circuit elements, such as transistors or diodes. Achieving these goals requires precise and reversible modification of thermal conductivity in materials. In this work, the continuous tuning of local thermal conductivity in charge-transfer SrFeO&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt; and La&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;CoO&lt;sub&gt;3-x&lt;/sub&gt; oxides using a voltage-biased Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)&#160;tip at room temperature is demonstrated. This method allows the creation of micron-sized domains with well-defined thermal conductivity, achieving reductions of up to 50%, measured by spatially resolved Frequency Domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR). By optimizing the oxide's chemical composition, the thermal states remain stable under normal atmospheric conditions but can be reverted to their original values through thermal annealing in air. A comparison between Mott&#8211;Hubbard and charge-transfer oxides reveals the critical role of redox-active lattice oxygen in ensuring full reversibility of the process. This approach marks a significant step toward fabricating oxide-based tunable microthermal resistances and other elements for thermal circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Promoting Piezoelectricity in Amino Acids by Fluorination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high piezoelectric amino acid (Cbz&#8208;Phe(4F)) is designed by simple fluorination. Cbz&#8208;Phe(4F) self&#8208;assembles into single crystals with C2 space group. Importantly, Cbz&#8208;Phe(4F) crystals serve as a flexible piezoelectric sensor for the classification of various nuts and their quality sorting, which includes those as small as individual pumpkin seeds with high sensitivity and accuracy of sorting and quality checks.









Abstract
Bioinspired piezoelectric amino acids and peptides are attracting attention due to their designable sequences, versatile structures, low cost, and biodegradability. However, it remains a challenge to design amino acids and peptides with high piezoelectricity. Herein, a high piezoelectric amino acid by simple fluorination in its side chain is presented. The three phenylalanine derivatives are designed: Cbz&#8208;Phe, Cbz&#8208;Phe(4F), and Cbz&#8208;pentafluoro&#8208;Phe. The effect of fluorination on self&#8208;assembly and piezoelectricity is investigated. Cbz&#8208;Phe(4F) can self&#8208;assemble into crystals with a C2 space group, while Cbz&#8208;Phe and Cbz&#8208;pentafluoro&#8208;Phe form aggregated self&#8208;assemblies. Moreover, Cbz&#8208;Phe(4F) crystals exhibit a remarkably higher piezoelectric coefficient (d33eff$d_{\ 33}^{\ eff}$) of &#8776;17.9 pm V&#8722;1 than Cbz&#8208;Phe and Cbz&#8208;pentafluoro&#8208;Phe. When fabricated as a piezoelectric nanogenerator, it generates an open&#8208;circuit voltage of &#8776;2.4 V. Importantly, Cbz&#8208;Phe(4F) crystals serve as a flexible piezoelectric sensor for the classification of various nuts and their quality sorting, which includes those as small as individual pumpkin seeds with high sensitivity and accuracy of sorting and quality checks. When mounted onto soft grippers, the sensor performs the tactile self&#8208;sensing functions. This work provides a promising approach to designing high piezoelectric amino acids by simple fluorination, offering exciting prospects for advancements in bioinspired piezoelectric materials in the application of smart agriculture and soft robotics.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Specific Protein Induced in Situ Self&#8208;Assembly of Peptide Drugs for Synergistic Mitochondria Disruption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces RC&#8208;K&#8208;FX, a peptide nanomaterial that self&#8208;assembles into spherical structures within cells, addressing the impact of the tumor's intrinsic repair mechanisms on therapeutic efficacy. RC&#8208;K&#8208;FX not only damages mitochondria but also stably inhibits MUC1&#8208;C dimerization, blocking the repair of stress&#8208;induced mitochondrial damage in tumor cells. RC&#8208;K&#8208;FX can treat tumors while simultaneously inhibiting tumor metastasis.








Abstract
Mitochondria&#8208;targeted cancer therapy is an effective method for controlling tumor growth. However, the presence of repair mechanisms in tumor cells in response to mitochondrial damage poses significant challenges for treatment. By taking advantage of intracellular self&#8208;assembly technology, a peptide nanomaterial, RC&#8208;K&#8208;FX, that enters tumor cells in a monomeric form is designed. After binding to MUC1&#8208;C inside the cell membrane, RC&#8208;K&#8208;FX assembles into a spherical structure that stably encapsulates MUC1&#8208;C, inhibiting its dimerization and blocking the repair of stress&#8208;induced mitochondrial damage in tumor cells. Moreover, the self&#8208;assembled mitochondrial toxic peptide effectively destroys the mitochondria, and the loss of mitochondrial repair significantly increases tumor cytotoxicity by disrupting the redox balance, enhancing reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibiting the nuclear factor (NF)&#8208;&#954;B pathway, and suppressing the epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. After intravenous administration, RC&#8208;G&#8208;FX accumulated at the tumor site, exhibiting improved anti&#8208;tumor effects and extending the overall survival of tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Therefore, the integration of the in situ self&#8208;assembly of peptide drugs and damage to mitochondrial repair mechanisms provides effective therapeutic options for malignancy.

         <title>Multifunctional High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanolayer Toward Long&#8208;Life Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thin high&#8208;entropy alloy (NbMoTaWV) interfacial layer is developed on commercial aluminum foil for anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries. The NbMoTaWV, characterized by enhanced sodiophilicity, abundant active sites, and plentiful nanoplates, significantly reduces Na nucleation barrier, accelerates interfacial reaction kinetics, and homogenizes electric field distribution. These improvements result in superior cycling stability, achieving over 300 cycles for the anode&#8208;free NbMoTaWV@Al||Na3V2(PO4)3 battery.









Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) hold great promise due to high energy density and low cost. Unfortunately, their practical applications are hindered by poor cycling stability, which is attributed to Na dendrite growth and inferior Na plating/stripping reversibility on conventional sodiophobic current collectors. Here, a thin high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA, NbMoTaWV) interfacial layer composed of densely packed nanoplates is constructed on commercial aluminum foil (NbMoTaWV@Al) for AFSMBs. The enhanced sodiophilicity of the HEA greatly reduces Na nucleation barrier with low nucleation overpotential. Simultaneously, abundant active sites of the HEA can boost interfacial reaction kinetics and guide uniform Na deposition. Furthermore, plentiful HEA nanoplates can homogenize electric field distribution and decrease the local current density. Benefiting from the advantageous properties of NbMoTaWV@Al, outstanding electrochemical performances, including an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% over 1000 cycles at 2 mA cm&#8722;2/2 mAh cm&#8722;2 in asymmetric cells, alongside a small overpotential (10 mV at 1 mA cm&#8722;2) and a long lifespan of 2500 cycles in symmetric cells, are achieved. More impressively, the anode&#8208;free NbMoTaWV@Al||Na3V2(PO4)3 batteries display superior cycling stability over 300 cycles. This work presents an efficient method of employing multifunctional HEA materials to manipulate the interfacial properties of current collector for high&#8208;performance AFSMBs.

         <title>Photoreceptor&#8208;Like Signal Transduction Between Polymer&#8208;Based Protocells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents polymer&#8208;based protocells containing light&#8208;sensitive and catalytic artificial organelles (AOs), forming a communicating protocellular system. Light&#8208;triggered substrate release from AOs in sender protocells is used to relay a signal to a receiver protocell where its conversion takes place in catalytic AOs. This system, modulated by environmental calcium, can enhance the understanding of cellular communication networks.








Abstract
Deciphering inter&#8208; and intracellular signaling pathways is pivotal for understanding the intricate communication networks that orchestrate life's dynamics. Communication models involving bottom&#8208;up construction of protocells are emerging but often lack specialized compartments sufficiently robust and hierarchically organized to perform spatiotemporally defined signaling. Here, the modular construction of communicating polymer&#8208;based protocells designed to mimic the transduction of information in retinal photoreceptors is presented. Microfluidics is used to generate polymeric protocells subcompartmentalized by specialized artificial organelles. In one protocell population, light triggers artificial organelles with membrane&#8208;embedded photoresponsive rotary molecular motors to set off a sequence of reactions starting with the release of encapsulated signaling molecules into the lumen. Intercellular communication is mediated by signal transfer across membranes to protocells containing catalytic artificial organelles as subcompartments, whose signal conversion can be modulated by environmental calcium. Signal propagation also requires selective permeability of the diverse compartments. By segregating artificial organelles in distinct protocells, a sequential chain of reactions mediating intercellular communication is created that is further modulated by adding extracellular messengers. This connective behavior offers the potential for a deeper understanding of signaling pathways and faster integration of proto&#8208; and living cells, with the unique advantage of controlling each step by bio&#8208;relevant signals.

Communication models involving bottom-up construction of protocells are emerging but often lack specialized compartments sufficiently robust and hierarchically organized to perform spatiotemporally defined signaling. Here, the modular construction of communicating polymer-based protocells designed to mimic the transduction of information in retinal photoreceptors is presented. Microfluidics is used to generate polymeric protocells subcompartmentalized by specialized artificial organelles. In one protocell population, light triggers artificial organelles with membrane-embedded photoresponsive rotary molecular motors to set off a sequence of reactions starting with the release of encapsulated signaling molecules into the lumen. Intercellular communication is mediated by signal transfer across membranes to protocells containing catalytic artificial organelles as subcompartments, whose signal conversion can be modulated by environmental calcium. Signal propagation also requires selective permeability of the diverse compartments. By segregating artificial organelles in distinct protocells, a sequential chain of reactions mediating intercellular communication is created that is further modulated by adding extracellular messengers. This connective behavior offers the potential for a deeper understanding of signaling pathways and faster integration of proto- and living cells, with the unique advantage of controlling each step by bio-relevant signals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spintronic Pathways in a Nonconjugated Radical Polymer Glass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonconjugated radical polymer with high spin density displays large effective spin mixing conductance, enabling efficient spin transport over long distances at room temperature.








Abstract
Radical chemistries have attracted burgeoning attention due to their intriguing technological applications in organic electronics, optoelectronics, and magneto&#8208;responsive systems. However, the potential of these magnetically active glassy polymers to transport spin&#8208;selective currents has not been demonstrated. Here, the spin&#8208;transport characteristics of the radical polymer poly(4&#8208;glycidyloxy&#8208;2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl) (PTEO) allow for sustained spin&#8208;selective currents when incorporated into typical device geometries with magnetically polarized electrodes. Annealing thin films of PTEO above its glass transition temperature results in a giant magnetoresistance effect (i.e., an MR of &#8776;80%) at 4 K. Additionally, ferromagnetic resonance spin&#8208;pumping results in a relatively large effective spin&#8208;mixing conductance of 1.18 &#215; 1019 m&#8722;2 at the NiFe/PTEO interface. Due to the large spin&#8208;density and radical&#8208;radical exchange interactions, there is effective propagation of pure spin currents through PTEO in the NiFe/PTEO/Pd multilayer devices. This results in the transport of spin current over long distances with a spin diffusion length of 90.4 nm. The spin diffusion length and spin mixing conductance values surpass those reported in inorganic and metallic systems and are comparable to conventional doped conjugated polymers. This is the first example of spin transport in a nonconjugated radical polymer, and these findings underscore the promising spin&#8208;transporting potential of radical polymers.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Giant InP Quantum Dots with Stress&#8208;Released Morphological ZnSe&#8208;ZnSeS&#8208;ZnS Shell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indium phosphide (InP) quantum dots (QDs) are promising alternatives to cadmium&#8208;based QDs, yet face stability challenges. This study presents a synthetic method for giant InP with morphological ZnSe/ZnSeS/ZnS shell with over 90% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). By addressing lattice mismatch strain, these giant QDs achieve improved stability, advancing future applications in eco&#8208;friendly displays and energy&#8208;efficient lighting.








Abstract
Indium phosphide (InP) quantum dots (QDs) are increasingly considered potent alternatives to traditional cadmium&#8208;based QDs. Notwithstanding, the material stability of InP, especially when juxtaposed with its cadmium&#8208;based counterparts, poses significant challenges in its application. Generally, a thick ZnS shell is applied to InP cores to thwart photo&#8208;oxidation and diminish nonradiative recombination. Yet, the pronounced lattice mismatch between the InP core and the ZnS shell can introduce lattice defects, consequently attenuating the luminescence efficiency. This makes the cultivation of a flawless thick shell a paramount challenge. In the present research, a synthetic methodology is elucidated to fabricate highly efficient InP QDs with dimensions exceeding 20&#160;nm, achieved by alleviating the lattice mismatch strain during the shell growth. By regulating the shell composition and morphology, InP/ZnSe/ZnSeS/ZnS QDs with shield&#8208;like morphology are prepared and demonstrate a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of &#8776;90%, exhibiting significantly enhanced photostability and thermal stability. This discovery is expected to greatly advance the preparation of highly efficient InP&#8208;based or other QDs, expanding their potential in various applications such as environmentally friendly displays and energy&#8208;saving lighting.

         <title>Bridging to Commercialization: Record&#8208;Breaking of Ultra&#8208;Large and Superior Cyclic Stability Tungsten Oxide Electrochromic Smart Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;performance WO3&#8208;x&#183;nH2O films are prepared by the 2D black phosphorus&#8208;assisted in situ growth (TAIG) method. Record&#8208;breaking large&#8208;scale electrochromic smart windows are fabricated, exhibiting excellent electrochromic performance, including significant transmittance modulation, high coloration efficiency, and superior cyclic stability. This research marks a milestone in enhancing performance and industrial&#8208;scale production, bridging the gap to commercialization.








Abstract
Electrochromic smart windows (ESWs) can significantly reduce energy consumption in buildings, but their cost&#8208;effective, large&#8208;scale production remains a challenge. In this study, the instability of black phosphorus is leveraged to induce the growth of the tungsten oxide film through its decomposition process, inspired by the 2D material&#8208;assisted in situ growth (TAIG) method. This approach results in the preparation of large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;performance WO3&#8208;x&#183;nH2O (n&#160;&lt;&#160;2) films. Characterization techniques and DFT calculations confirm efficient regulation of&#160;structural water and oxygen vacancies during TAIG preparation. The WO3&#8208;x&#183;nH2O films exhibit excellent electrochromic (EC) properties, including high transmittance modulation (74.2%@1100&#160;nm), fast switching time (tc&#160;=&#160;5.5&#160;s, tb&#160;=&#160;3.8&#160;s), high coloration efficiency (124.7&#160;cm2&#160;C&#8722;1), and superior cyclic stability (transmittance modulation retained 94.7% after 20&#160;000 cycles). Ultra&#8208;large&#160;WO3&#8208;x&#183;nH2O film are prepared via a simple immersion process, and fabricated into a large&#8208;area ESW under facile laboratory conditions, demonstrating the economic and practical feasibility of this approach in industrial&#8208;scale production. Operated by the intelligent control circuit,&#160; the ESW&#160;exhibits remarkable EC properties and cyclic stability This research represents a milestone in improving the performance and industrial&#8208;scale production of ESWs, bridging the gap to the commercialization of EC technology.

         <title>High Electrical Conductance in Magnetic Emission Junction of Fe3GeTe2/ZnO/Ni Heterostructure via Selective Spin Emission through ZnO Ohmic Barrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;conductance magnetic emission junction (MEJ) is demonstrated using an Fe&#8323;GeTe&#8322;/ZnO/Ni heterostructure, where the ZnO barrier forms an Ohmic contact, enabling free spin&#8208;electron emission. Unlike conventional magnetic tunneling junctions (MTJs), the MEJ exhibits negative magnetoresistance (MR) through minority spin emission, achieving up to 10&#8211;1000 times higher conductance while maintaining a comparable MR ratio to other 2D&#8208;MTJs.








Abstract
The insulator is essential for magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) that increases magnetoresistance (MR) by decoupling magnetization directions between two ferromagnets. However, wide bandgap tunnel barrier blocks the thermionic emission of electrons, significantly reducing electrical conductance through MTJ. Here, a magnetic emission junction (MEJ) is demonstrated for the first time using an Fe3GeTe2 (FGT)/ZnO/Ni heterostructure with very high electrical conductance. The conduction band of ZnO (electron affinity 4.6&#160;eV) aligns with Fermi levels (EF) of FGT (4.47&#160;eV) and Ni (4.58&#160;eV) ferromagnets and forms an Ohmic barrier, enabling free spin&#8208;electron emission through ZnO barrier and high electrical conductance. In contrast to the typical positive MR in MTJ by majority spin tunneling, negative MR is observed in FGT/ZnO/Ni MEJ. The minority spin electrons of Ni, with maximum states near the EF, are dominantly emitted to FGT over the ZnO barrier, while majority spin electrons of Ni, with maximum states below the EF, are blocked by it. In the FGT/FGT/ZnO/Ni heterostructure, the MR ratio is further increased by combining positive and negative MR at the MTJ (FGT/FGT) and MEJ (FGT/ZnO/Ni), respectively. As a result, FGT&#8208;MEJ exhibits 10&#8211;1000 orders higher conductance than other 2D&#8208;MTJs, while MR ratio remains similar to other 2D&#8208;MTJs.

The conduction band of ZnO (electron affinity 4.6&#160;eV) aligns with Fermi levels (E&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;) of FGT (4.47&#160;eV) and Ni (4.58&#160;eV) ferromagnets and forms an Ohmic barrier, enabling free spin-electron emission through ZnO barrier and high electrical conductance. In contrast to the typical positive MR in MTJ by majority spin tunneling, negative MR is observed in FGT/ZnO/Ni MEJ. The minority spin electrons of Ni, with maximum states near the E&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, are dominantly emitted to FGT over the ZnO barrier, while majority spin electrons of Ni, with maximum states below the E&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, are blocked by it. In the FGT/FGT/ZnO/Ni heterostructure, the MR ratio is further increased by combining positive and negative MR at the MTJ (FGT/FGT) and MEJ (FGT/ZnO/Ni), respectively. As a result, FGT-MEJ exhibits 10&#8211;1000 orders higher conductance than other 2D-MTJs, while MR ratio remains similar to other 2D-MTJs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Managing Solvent Complexes to Amplify Ripening Process by Covalent Interaction Driving Force Under External Field for Perovskite Photovoltaic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal molecule is utilized to promote the movement of solvent complexes under external field, thus amplifying ripening process and optimizing the buried interface. Based on this, the efficiency of device reaches 25.24%, and it still maintains 75% of the original efficiency after 1400 h in a damp heat test.








Abstract
Up to now, post&#8208;annealing is most commonly used to post treat the perovskite film to accelerate the ripening process. Nonetheless, the top&#8208;down crystallization mechanism impedes the efficient desolvation of solvent complexes. Thus, residual solvent complexes tend to accumulate at the bottom of the film during the ripening process and deteriorate the device. Here, a new strategy with unique concept is promoted to amplify ripening process of perovskite film, in which a nematic thermotropic liquid crystal (LC) molecular is introduced to facilitate the conversion of solvent complexes by utilizing the liquid crystalline behavior under external field. Upon the concurrent application of thermal and force fields, the covalent interaction between LC and solvent complexes generates a driving force, which promotes upward migration of solvent complexes, thereby facilitating their engagement in the ripening process. In addition, the driving force under external fields assists the flattening of grain boundary grooves. Therefore, film quality is improved efficiently with amplified ripening process and adequately handled buried interface. Based on the positive effects, the devices achieve a champion efficiency of 25.24%, and sustained &#8776;75% of its initial efficiency level even after undergoing a damp heat test (85&#160;&#176;C/85% RH) for 1400 h.

         <title>Combined Photopolymerization and Localized Photochromism by Aza&#8208;Diarylethene and Hemiindigo Synergy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four levels of advanced photoresponsive materials are reported using aza&#8208;diarylethene and hemiindigo photoswitches. Starting from blending photochromes with polymers, a novel photopolymerization by aza&#8208;diarylethene is demonstrated next, which can be combined with subsequent photochrome addition. Finally, synergistic and simultaneous photopolymerization and photochrome localization in a multi&#8208;photoresponsive materials application is realized.








Abstract
Molecular photoswitches produce light&#8208;controlled changes at the nanometer scale and can therefore be used to alter the states and behavior of materials in a truly bottom&#8208;up fashion. Here an escalating photonic complexity of material property control with light is shown using a recently developed aza&#8208;diarylethene in combination with hemiindigo (HI) photoswitches. First, aza&#8208;diarylethene can be used as a photoswitch in polystyrene (PS) to reversibly inscribe relief&#8208;type 3D structures into PS. Second, aza&#8208;diarylethene can further be used as a photoinitiator for light&#8208;induced polymerization of methyl acrylate (MA), demonstrating for the first time light&#8208;controlled chemical reactivity control with its zwitterionic switching state. Third, aza&#8208;diarylethene and HIs are implemented into aza&#8208;diarylethene polymerized MA, generating photochromic polymers. At the fourth level, a binary mixture allows to synergize aza&#8208;diarylethene&#8208;induced photopolymerization with localized photochromism changes of the simultaneously entrapped functional HI. With such multilevel light response, the utility of this particular photoswitch combination for applications in advanced photonic materials is demonstrated.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Narrowband Pure&#8208;Green OLEDs with Gamut Approaching BT.2020 Standard: Deuteration Promotes Device Efficiency and Lifetime Simultaneously</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deuteration strategy enables a versatile multi&#8208;resonance fluorescent emitter. The resulting OLED achieves pure&#8208;green emission approaching BT 2020 gamut, high device efficiency with EQEmax of 35.2% and PEmax of 187.0 lm&#160;W&#8722;1, and long lifetime (LT50 = 3020 h @ 1000 cd&#160;m&#8722;2).








Abstract
In order to fulfill the demand for ultrahigh definition organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), pure&#8208;green emitters with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) y&#8208;coordinate over 0.71 are in urgent demand. Meanwhile, the high device efficiency, small efficiency roll&#8208;off, and operational lifetime also remain challenging issues. In this work, a series of narrowband pure&#8208;green fluorescent emitters based on a double&#8208;boron (B) doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) framework fused with naphthalene units is reported. The newly designed emitters realize green emission with peaks of 512&#8211;521&#160;nm and extremely narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maxima (FWHMs) of 16&#8211;17&#160;nm in toluene solution. Utilizing these emitters in a phosphor&#8208;sensitized fluorescence (PSF) system, the resulting OLEDs exhibit pure green emission with peaks in the range of 514&#8211;526&#160;nm and very narrow FWHMs of 19&#8211;20&#160;nm. Notably, the devices based on the partially deuterated emitter, DBN&#8208;NaPh&#8208;d, not only achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) as high as 35.2%, small efficiency roll&#8208;off, along with a CIEy of 0.74 but also showcase impressive operational stability with a long lifetime (LT50) of over 3000&#160;h at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. This work represents one of the highest device efficiencies and superior device stability among fluorescence emitter&#8208;based OLEDs.

         <title>Synergistic Cationic Shielding and Anionic Chemistry of Potassium Hydrogen Phthalate for Ultrastable Zn&#9472;I2 Full Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional additives of potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) are rationally designed to achieve synergistic cationic shielding and anionic chemistry for ultrastable Zn||I2 full batteries. Electrostatic shielding K cations could construct the smooth deposition morphology effectively balancing the electric field distribution, while HP anions can reduce the activities of H2O and accelerate the charge transfer kinetics by the formation of SEI.








Abstract
Electrolyte additives are investigated to resolve dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction, and corrosion of Zn metal. In particular, the electrostatic shielding cationic strategy is considered an effective method to regulate deposition morphology. However, it is very difficult for such a simple cationic modification to avoid competitive hydrogen evolution reactions, corrosion, and interfacial pH fluctuations. Herein, multifunctional additives of potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) based on the synergistic design of cationic shielding and anionic chemistry for ultrastable Zn||I2 full batteries are demonstrated. K cations, acting as electrostatic shielding cations, constructed the smooth deposition morphology. HP anions can enter the first solvation shell of Zn2+ for the reduced activities of H2O, while they remain in the primary solvation shell and are finally involved in the formation of SEI, thus accelerating the charge transfer kinetics. Furthermore, by in situ monitoring the near&#8208;surface pH of the Zn electrode, the KHP additives can effectively inhibit the accumulation of OH&#8722; and the formation of by&#8208;products. Consequently, the symmetric cells achieve a high stripping&#8211;plating reversibility of over 4500 and 2600 h at 1.0 and 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. The Zn||I2 full cells deliver an ultralong term stability of over 1400 cycles with a high&#8208;capacity retention of 78.5%.

         <title>Effective Dual Cation Release in Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskites for Ultrafast UV Light&#8208;Powered Imaging</title>

Dual cations released from the pre&#8208;deposited inorganic buffer layer effectively repair deep&#8208;level defects in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films by inducing low&#8208;dimensional phase reconstruction and undercoordinated ion interaction. With enhanced film quality and residual strain modulation, the fabricated photodetector exhibits a drastically improved self&#8208;powered photoresponse, demonstrating high compatibility with pixelated array design for ultrafast image sensing.








Abstract
Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper quasi&#8208;2D perovskites represent robust candidates for optoelectronic applications, achieving a delicate balance between outstanding photoresponse and stability. However, mitigating the internal defects in polycrystalline films remains challenging, and their optoelectronic performances still lag behind that of their 3D counterparts. This work highlights the profound impact of defect passivation at the buried interface and grain boundaries through a dual&#8208;cation&#8208;release strategy. Cations released from the pre&#8208;deposited inorganic iodide buffer layer effectively repair deep&#8208;level defects by inducing low&#8208;dimensional phase reconstruction and interacting with undercoordinated ions. The resulting quasi&#8208;2D perovskite polycrystalline films feature large grain size (&gt;2 &#181;m) and minimum surface roughness, along with alleviated out&#8208;of&#8208;plane residual tensile strain, which is beneficial for inhibiting the initiation and propagation of cracks. The fabricated photodetector demonstrates drastically improved self&#8208;powered photoresponse capability, with maximum responsivity up to 0.41 A W&#8722;1 at 430&#160;nm and an ultrafast response speed of 161&#160;ns / 1.91 &#181;s. Moreover, this strategy is compatible with the photolithography&#8208;assisted hydrophobic&#8208;hydrophilic patterning process for fabricating pixelated photodetector arrays, which enables high&#8208;sensitivity imaging. This study presents a feasible defect passivation approach in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites, thereby providing insights into the fabrication of high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Giant Piezoelectric Coefficient of Polyvinylidene Fluoride with Rationally Engineered Ultrafine Domains Achieved by Rapid Freezing Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)&#8208;homopolymer with nanoscale TTTGTTTG&#8217;&#8208;conformational domain is fabricated by a simple modeling method of cyclic compression and rapid freezing. The domain engineered PVDF is able to provide ultrahigh d33 of 191.4 pC N&#8722;1. Meanwhile, only physical processing method is applied, indicating a method for preparing piezoelectric polymer with low cost, good mechanical properties, and ultra&#8208;high piezoelectric coefficient.








Abstract
Domains play an essential role in determining the piezoelectric properties of polymers. The conventional method for achieving ultrafine piezoelectric domain structures for polymers is multiphase polymerization, which is not the primary choice for industrial&#8208;scale applications because of its complex synthesis and weak mechanical properties. In this study, it is demonstrated for the first time that a nanoscale domain design can be achieved in a commercially available polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) homopolymer through a simple fabrication method involving cyclic compression and rapid freezing. The domain&#8208;engineered PVDF exhibits largely enhanced piezoelectric output with a record&#8208;breaking piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of 191.4 picocoulombs per Newton (8.9 times higher than that of PVDF without engineered domain structure) and electromechanical coupling factor (k33) of 77.1%. Moreover, nanoscale domain&#8208;induced ferroelectric and dielectric evolutions are revealed. A smaller domain is found to be beneficial for domain switching. An in&#8208;depth understanding of the interplay between the domain structure and piezoelectric properties reveals a simple, low&#8208;cost method for fabricating high&#8208;performance polymeric piezoelectric.

         <title>Differentiated Intra&#8208;Ligand Charge Transfer Boosting Multicolor Responsive MOF Heterostructures as Robust Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Labels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The differentiated design on intra&#8208;ligand charge transfer is first reported to realize multicolor responsive metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) heterostructures, which display the distinct responsive MOF regions under the same mild stimuli and generate multiple tunable color patterns, further functioning as robust photonic barcodes with high&#8208;security convert states. These results provide enlightenment on the development of a smart&#8208;responsive MOF heterosystem for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) heterostructures with hybrid architectures and abundant functional sites possess great potential applications in advanced information security, yet still suffer from the harsh stimuli mechanisms with restrained emission control. Herein, the differentiated design strategy on intra&#8208;ligand charge transfer is first reported to realize smart&#8208;responsive multicolor MOF heterostructures as robust anticounterfeiting labels. Designed similar MOF blocks with the differentiated intra&#8208;ligand charge transfer are integrated via time&#8208;dependent epitaxial growth to form multicolor MOF heterostructures. Different numbers of electron&#8208;donating groups in MOF blocks offer distinct space regulation on the torsion of charge transfer ligands, which trigger the diverse responsive emissions under the same mild stimuli, thus generating multiple tunable color patterns in heterostructures. These spatial&#8208;resolved MOF heterostructures with stable multicolor responsive modes permit the encoding of fingerprint information, which further functions as robust anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels with high&#8208;security convert states. These results offer a promising route for the function&#8208;oriented exploitation of smart&#8208;responsive MOF heterosystems for advanced information anticounterfeiting.

         <title>A Sucker&#8208;Reactor Polyoxometalate Assembled Superstructures for Efficient Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functional ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;polyoxometalate (POM) hybrid architecture is successfully constructed through simple self&#8208;assembly process, achieving high N2 fixation efficiency (98 &#181;mol&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1) at room temperature. IL and POM serve as the &#8220;sucker&#8221; and &#8220;reactor&#8221; for N2 capture and conversion into ammonia. The incorporation of ILs with variable alkyl chain lengths promotes N2 activation by manipulating electronic band structure.








Abstract
Designing a reaction system that integrates reactant capture and transformation in an artificial photosynthesis system to achieve high reaction efficiency remains challenging. Here, an ionic liquid (IL) &#8208;polyoxometalate (POM) superstructure photocatalyst (P2HPMo) is reported, where the anisotropy of the superstructure is allowed by adjusting the alkyl chain lengths of ILs. Experimental data and theoretical simulation show that ILs and POM serve as the &#8220;sucker&#8221; and &#8220;reactor&#8221; of the reaction system to capture and transform the reactants, respectively. In particular, the addition of quaternary phosphorous IL cations is not only conducive to the adsorption of N2 but also effectively promotes the activation of N2 by manipulating the energy band and electronic structure. Consequently, the synthesized P2HPMo exhibits an ammonia synthesis rate of 98 &#181;mol&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1, which is one of the highest values available in a sacrificial agent&#8208;free system.

Artificial Signaling Centers
In article number 2409731, Carsten Werner and co&#8208;workers develop a precision toolbox to modulate signaling gradients in tissue cultures. Spatial and temporal gradient control is achieved using sulfated glycosaminoglycan&#8208;based microgels (&#956;GUIDEs) with electrostatically tunable morphogen affinity for tailored release. Individual &#956;GUIDEs act as artificial signaling centers, locally directing vascular morphogenesis with high resolution.

Vessel Regeneration
Mesenchymal stem cells tethered to mechanically robust oxygen&#8208;generating injectable colloidal hydrogel significantly increased the secretion of various angiogenic cytokines and a chemokine that induced anti&#8208;inflammatory responses, reduced cellular apoptosis, and improved blood flow restoration and muscle regeneration in ischemic diseases. More details can be found in article number 2408488 by Mark W. Feinberg, Su Ryon Shin, and co&#8208;workers.

2D Supramolecular Nanomaterials for Virus Inhibition
In article number 2408294, Rainer Haag, Francesco Stellacci, Kai Ludwig, and their research team successfully inhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) with an irreversible (virucidal) mechanism with self&#8208;assembled 2D supramolecular nanomaterials, based on a dendritic polymer. The cover image illustrates a &#8220;virus like&#8221; sea mine targeting a sailing ship (human lung). The forming 2D nanomaterials catch and trap it, like a fishing net and prevent it from reaching its target.

         <title>Fire&#8208;Safe Aerogels and Foams for Thermal Insulation: From Materials to Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aerogels/foams are ideal thermally insulating materials owing to their low density and low thermal conductivity. To meet their practical applications, these aerogels/foams need to be thermally insulating, mechanically robust and fire&#8208;resistant. Recent advances on fire&#8208;safe thermal&#8208;insulating aerogels/foams are reviewed. Future research opportunities are proposed in response to key challenges for expediting the creation of next&#8208;generation aerogels/foams for better thermal management.








Abstract
The ambition of human beings to create a comfortable environment for work and life in a sustainable way has triggered a great need for advanced thermal insulation materials in past decades. Aerogels and foams present great prospects as thermal insulators owing to their low density, good thermal insulation, mechanical robustness, and even high fire resistance. These merits make them suitable for many real&#8208;world applications, such as energy&#8208;saving building materials, thermally protective materials in aircrafts and battery, and warming fabrics. Despite great advances, to date there remains a lack of a comprehensive yet critical review on the thermal insulation materials. Herein, recent progresses in fire&#8208;safe thermal&#8208;insulating aerogels and foams are summarized, and pros/cons of three major categories of aerogels/foams (inorganic, organic and their hybrids) are discussed. Finally, key challenges associated with existing aerogels are discussed and some future opportunities are proposed. This review is expected to expedite the development of advanced aerogels and foams as fire&#8208;safe thermally insulating materials, and to help create a sustainable, safe, and energy&#8208;efficient society.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Level High Entropy&#8208;Dissipative Structure Enables Efficient Self&#8208;Decoupling of Triple Signals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, new synthesis concept is the first time to fabricate high entropy&#8208;dissipative conductive layer of smart sensors within poly&#8208;pyrrole/zinc oxide system. The sensor achieves the triple self&#8208;decoupling effect of pressure and gas in the complex temperature&#8208;humidity field. Additionally, it inherits the strong robustness and endurance of traditional high&#8208;entropy materials for information transmission and smart alarm.








Abstract
The theory of high entropy&#8208;dissipative structure is confined to high&#8208;entropy alloys and their oxide materials under harsh conditions, but it is very difficult to obtain high entropy&#8208;dissipative structure for smart sensors based on polymers and metal oxides under mild conditions. Moreover, multiple signal coupling effect heavily hinder the sensor applications, and current multimodal integrated devices can solve two signal&#8208;decoupling, but need very complicated process way. In this work, new synthesis concept is the first time to fabricate high entropy&#8208;dissipative conductive layer of smart sensors with triple&#8208;signal response and self&#8208;decoupling ability within poly&#8208;pyrrole/zinc oxide (PPy/ZnO) system. The sensor (SPZ20) amplifies pressure (17.54%/kPa) and gas (0.37%/ppm), reduces humidity (0.41%/% RH) and temperature (0.12%/&#176;C) signals, simultaneously achieving the triple self&#8208;decoupling effect of pressure and gas in the complex temperature&#8208;humidity field because of the enlarged pressure&#8208;contact area, enhanced gas&#8208;responsive sites, altered vapor path and its own heat insulation function. Additionally, it inherits the strong robustness (500 rubbing, washing, and heating or freezing cycles) and endurance (10&#160;000 photo&#8208;purification cycles) of traditional high&#8208;entropy materials for information transmission and smart alarms in emergencies or harsh environments. This work gives a new insight into the multiple&#8208;signal response and smart flexible electronic design from natural fibers.

         <title>Integrating Interactive Ir Atoms into Titanium Oxide Lattice for Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interactive Ir atoms with varied geometric structure play a crucial role in promoting the intrinsic oxygen&#8208;evolution activity, as it can optimize the intermediate adsorption by adjusting the d&#8208;band center of active Ir sites. This correlation of Ir atoms benefits their valence stability, suppressing the over&#8208;oxidation of active Ir and synergistically improving the catalyst durability.








Abstract
Iridium (Ir)&#8208;based oxide is the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalyst for acidic water oxidation, yet it is restricted to a few Ir&#8208;O octahedral packing modes with limited structural flexibility. Herein, the geometric structure diversification of Ir is achieved by integrating spatially correlated Ir atoms into the surface lattice of TiO2 and its booting effect on oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is investigated. Notably, the resultant i&#8208;Ir/TiO2 catalyst exhibits much higher electrocatalytic activity, with an overpotential of 240 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and excellent stability of 315 h at 100 mA cm&#8722;2 in acidic electrolyte. Both experimental and theoretical findings reveal that flexible Ir&#9472;O&#9472;Ir coordination with varied geometric structure plays a crucial role in enhancing OER activity, which optimize the intermediate adsorption by adjusting the d&#8208;band center of active Ir sites. Operando characterizations demonstrate that the interactive Ir&#9472;O&#9472;Ir units can suppress over&#8208;oxidation of Ir, effectively widening the stable region of Ir species during the catalytic process. The proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, equipped with i&#8208;Ir/TiO2 as an anode, gives a low driving voltage of 1.63 V at 2 A cm&#8722;2 and maintains stable performance for over 440 h. This work presents a general strategy to eliminate the inherent geometric limitations of IrOx species, thereby inspiring further development of advanced catalyst designs.

Both experimental and theoretical findings reveal that flexible Ir&#9472;O&#9472;Ir coordination with varied geometric structure plays a crucial role in enhancing OER activity, which optimize the intermediate adsorption by adjusting the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center of active Ir sites. Operando characterizations demonstrate that the interactive Ir&#9472;O&#9472;Ir units can suppress over-oxidation of Ir, effectively widening the stable region of Ir species during the catalytic process. The proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, equipped with &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Ir/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as an anode, gives a low driving voltage of 1.63 V at 2 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and maintains stable performance for over 440 h. This work presents a general strategy to eliminate the inherent geometric limitations of IrO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; species, thereby inspiring further development of advanced catalyst designs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust and Versatile Biodegradable Unclonable Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Labels with Multi&#8208;Mode Optical Encoding Using Protein&#8208;Mediated Luminescent Calcite Signatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biodegradable, robust, and versatile PUF platform with multi&#8208;mode encoding, multi&#8208;level cryptographic keys, and multiple authentication operations is developed by imprinting chaotically grown calcites on a versatile protein film. This all&#8208;biomaterial&#8208;based PUF exhibits superior encoding diversity, eco&#8208;friendly manufacturing, authentication ease, stability, and versatility over existing biocompatible PUF labels, providing a practical, high&#8208;security solution for combating counterfeiting across various applications.








Abstract
Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are emerging as a cutting&#8208;edge technology for enhancing information security by providing robust security authentication and non&#8208;reproducible cryptographic keys. Incorporating renewable and biocompatible materials into PUFs ensures safety for handling, compatibility with biological systems, and reduced environmental impact. However, existing PUF platforms struggle to balance high encoding capacity, diversified encryption signatures, and versatile functionalities with sustainability and biocompatibility. Here, all&#8208;biomaterial&#8208;based unclonable anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels featuring multi&#8208;mode encoding, multi&#8208;level cryptographic keys, and multiple authentication operations are developed by imprinting biomimetic&#8208;grown calcites on versatile silk protein films. In this label, the inherent non&#8208;clonability comes from the randomized characteristics of calcites, mediated by silk protein during crystal growth. The successful embedding of photoluminescent molecules into calcite lattices, assisted by silk protein, allows the resulting platform to utilize fluorescence patterns alongside birefringence for high&#8208;capacity encoding. This design facilitates easy and rapid authentication through Hamming distance and convolutional neural networks using standard cameras and portable microscopes. Moreover, angle&#8208;dependent polarization patterns enable multi&#8208;level key generation, while multi&#8208;spectral fluorescence signals offer multi&#8208;channel keys. The developed anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels combine biodegradability, green manufacture, easy authentication, high&#8208;level complexity, low cost, robustness, patternability, and versatility, offering a practical and high&#8208;security solution to combat counterfeiting across various applications.

         <title>Ultrafast H&#8208;Spillover in Intermetallic PtZn Induced by the Local Disorder for Excellent Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordered intermetallic Platinum&#8208;Zinc (PtZn) nanoparticles with the local disorder confined in NPC (I&#8208;PtZn@NPC) are realized by a confinement&#8208;high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis strategy. The simultaneous exposure of Pt and Zinc (Zn) atoms enables I&#8208;PtZn@NPC with excellent HER performance in acid through an ultra&#8208;short spillover channel (Pt site &#8594; Pt&#8208;Zn bridge site&#8594; Zn site).








Abstract
Ordered intermetallic Platinum&#8208;Zinc (PtZn) shows potential in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but faces a huge challenge in activity enhancement due to the H&#8208;repulsion properties of Zinc (Zn). Here, local disorder in ordered intermetallic PtZn nanoparticles confined in N&#8208;doped porous carbon (I&#8208;PtZn@NPC) via a confinement&#8208;high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis strategy is realized to boost the HER performance. Experiments and calculations demonstrate that the local substitution of Pt atoms for Zn atoms creates an ultra&#8208;short H&#8208;spillover channel (Pt site&#8594;Pt&#8208;Zn bridge site &#8594;Zn site). Benefiting from such an ultra&#8208;fast H&#8208;migration from Pt site to Zn site, I&#8208;PtZn@NPC exhibits enhanced intrinsic activity with an ultralow overpotential (&#951;10: 2.3&#160;mV, &#951;100: 24&#160;mV) than commercial Pt black catalyst. Furthermore, a 25 cm2 commercial proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer equipped with I&#8208;PtZn@NPC achieved stable operation at 1.60 Vcell for 200&#160;h at a current density of 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8315;2. This design of local Zn disorder in the ordered intermetallic PtZn sheds new light on the rational development of efficient Zn&#8208;based alloy HER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Giant Topological Hall Effect and Colossal Magnetoresistance in Heusler Ferromagnet near Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferromagnetic shape memory Heusler alloy Ni2Mn1.4In0.6 exhibits colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and giant topological Hall effect (THE) near room temperature, which is attributed to the enhanced spin chirality emerging from the formation of domains and domain walls, which in turn resulted from the combined effect of magnetic field induced martensite twin variant reorientation and magnetic field induced structural phase transformation.








Abstract
Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) is an exotic phenomenon that allows for the efficient magnetic control of electrical resistivity and has attracted significant attention in condensed matter due to its potential for memory and spintronic applications. Heusler alloys are the subject of considerable interest in this context due to the electronic properties that result from the nontrivial band topology. Here, the observation of CMR near room temperature is reported in the shape memory Heusler alloy Ni2Mn1.4In0.6, which is attributed to the combined effects of magnetic field&#8208;induced martensite twin variant reorientation (MFIR) and magnetic field&#8208;induced structural phase transformation (MFIPT). This compound undergoes a structural phase transition from a cubic (austenite&#8208;L21) ferromagnetic (FM) to a monoclinic (martensite) antiferromagnetic (AFM), which leads to an effective increase in the size of the Fermi surface and consequently in CMR. Additionally, it exhibits significant anomalous Hall conductivity in both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases. Furthermore, it demonstrates a giant topological Hall resistivity (THR) &#961;yxT$\rho _{{\mathrm{yx}}}^{\mathrm{T}}$ &#8776;6&#160;&#181;&#937;.cm in the vicinity of martensite transition due to the enhanced spin chirality resulting from the formation of magnetic domains with Bloch&#8208;type domain walls. The findings contribute to the understanding of the magnetotransport of Ni&#8208;Mn&#8208;In Heusler alloys, which are prospective candidates for room&#8208;temperature spintronic applications.

         <title>An Immunomodulatory Hydrogel Featuring Antibacterial and Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenging Properties for Treating Periodontitis in Diabetes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An immunomodulatory hydrogel is developed to treat periodontitis in diabetes. This formulation combines chlorhexidine acetate, epigallocatechin&#8208;3&#8208;gallate, gelatin methacryloyl, and oxidized hyaluronic acid, endowing the hydrogel with strong antibacterial capabilities and effective reactive oxygen species scavenging properties.








Abstract
Periodontal disease is a multifactorial, bacterially induced inflammatory disorder characterized by progressive destruction of periodontal tissues. Additionally, diabetes mellitus exacerbates periodontitis, resulting in expedited resorption of periodontal bone. However, methods such as mechanical debridement, anti&#8208;inflammatory medications, and surgical approaches often fail to eradicate local infections and inflammation, complicating the reconstruction of periodontal tissue structures. Consequently, there is an urgent need to devise a novel strategy for managing diabetic periodontal conditions. Here, a multifunctional controlled&#8208;release drug delivery system (GOE1) is developed by encapsulating self&#8208;assembled nanoparticles (consisting of chlorhexidine acetate and epigallocatechin&#8208;3&#8208;gallate) into a hydrogel matrix composed of gelatin methacryloyl and oxidized hyaluronic acid. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the GOE1 hydrogel possesses good antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties, and transgenic sequence genomics further illustrates that IL&#8208;17&#8208;producing RAW 264.7 macrophages are critical for mediating M1/M2 macrophage transition and provide favorable immune microenvironment. In addition, in vivo experiments reveal that GOE1 significantly ameliorates periodontal tissue inflammation and reduces the loss of alveolar bone by reducing inflammatory infiltration and collagen destruction. Overall, the GOE1 hydrogel offers a promising therapeutic option for managing diabetic periodontitis.

In vitro experiments demonstrate that the GOE1 hydrogel possesses good antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and transgenic sequence genomics further illustrates that IL-17-producing RAW 264.7 macrophages are critical for mediating M1/M2 macrophage transition and provide favorable immune microenvironment. In addition, in vivo experiments reveal that GOE1 significantly ameliorates periodontal tissue inflammation and reduces the loss of alveolar bone by reducing inflammatory infiltration and collagen destruction. Overall, the GOE1 hydrogel offers a promising therapeutic option for managing diabetic periodontitis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Superior Capacitive Energy Storage Enabled by Molecularly Interpenetrating Interfaces in Layered Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer dielectrics are ubiquitous in electronics and electrical power systems, but suffer from low energy density (Ue) and charge&#8211;dischage efficiency (&#951;). Here a scalable approach utilizing the designed molecularly interpenetrating interfaces is presented to achieve all&#8208;organic dielectric polymers with an ultahigh Ue of 22.89&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 at &#951; &#8805; 90%, far outperforming exisitng polymer dielectrics.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics are essential for advanced electronics and electrical power systems, yet they suffer from low energy density (Ue) due to their low dielectric constant (K) and the inverse relationship between K and breakdown stength (Eb). Here a scalable approach utilizing the designed molecularly interpenetrating interfaces is presented to achieve all&#8208;organic dielectric polymers with high Ue and charge&#8211;dischage efficiency (&#951;). Distinctive intermolecular interactions and microstructural changes, as demonstrated experimentally and theoretically, are introduced by the molecularly interpenetrating interfaces, resulting in simultaneous improvements in dielectric responses and mechanical strength while inhibiting electrical conduction &#8211; outcomes unattainable in conventional layered polymers. Consequently, exceptional improvments in both K and Eb are achieved, yielding a very high Ue of 22.89&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 with &#951; &#8805; 90%, outperforming current layered polymer dielectrics. The bilayers can be easily fabricated into large&#8208;area films with high uniformity and outstanding capacitive stability (&gt;500&#8201;000 cycles), offering a practical route to scalable high&#8208;Ue polymer dielectrics for electrical energy storage.

         <title>Root&#8208;Growth&#8208;Inspired Self&#8208;Morphology&#8208;Evolution of Microsized Bismuth Surrounded by Microsized Hard Carbon for Stabilized Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>

Inspired by &#8220;root growth in soil&#8221;, microsized Bi particles (&#181;m&#8208;Bi, as &#8220;seeds&#8221;) surrounded by microsized hard carbon particles (&#181;m&#8208;HC) matrix (as &#8220;soil&#8221;) are ingeniously dispersed through a simple mixing approach. This design utilizes the morphological self&#8208;evolution of &#181;m&#8208;Bi into Bi&#8208;nanonetworks between dispersed &#181;m&#8208;HC, leading to 2000 stable cycles.








Abstract
Alloy&#8208;type materials are desirable for high&#8208;energy sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Different from nanoengineering with pre&#8208;reserving void space and confined carbon coatings, microsized particles promise high specific/volumetric capacities, easy manufacturing, and low cost but are prone to rapid capacity loss. Herein, inspired by the process of &#8220;root growth in soil&#8221;, microsized Bi particles (&#181;m&#8208;Bi, as &#8220;seeds&#8221;) surrounded by microsized hard carbon particles (&#181;m&#8208;HC, as &#8220;soil&#8221;) are ingeniously dispersed through a simple mixing approach. This design utilizes the morphological self&#8208;evolution of &#181;m&#8208;Bi into Bi&#8208;nanonetworks between dispersed &#181;m&#8208;HC during repeated (de)sodiations, leading to a stable capacity retention of 99.8% for 2000 cycles, higher than that of the &#181;m&#8208;Bi electrode (7.2%) at a high mass loading of 5.5 mg cm&#8722;2. The interconnected Bi&#8208;nanonetworks and &#181;m&#8208;HC particles provide continuous electron pathways and facilitate electrolyte infiltration, which effectively boosts electrical contact, stable cycling, and high&#8208;rate capability. Especially, the hybrid Bi40HC60 (optimized weight ratio) thick&#8208;film electrode shows boosted comprehensive electrochemical performance, superior to HC and &#181;m&#8208;Bi electrodes. The Bi40HC60||Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell, assembled without any pre&#8208;treatment, delivers 4500 stable cycles. This nature&#8208;inspired strategy provides a simple yet practical approach for employing the electrochemically driven evolution of micro&#8208;sized active materials and realizing high specific/volumetric capacities, fast kinetics, and long&#8208;term cycling stability.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Assisted Passivation Growth of 2D Ultrathin &#946;&#8208;Bi2O3 Crystals for High&#8208;Performance Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 3, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface&#8208;assisted passivation growth strategy is designed to synthesize ultrathin and large size &#946;&#8208;Bi2O3 crystals with the thickness down to 0.77 nm and the lateral size up to 163 &#181;m. Experiments and theoretical calculations substantiate the growth mechanism. Remarkably, &#946;&#8208;Bi2O3 flakes based photodetectors exhibit excellent performance and anisotropic photodetection that surpass or are comparable to other 2D materials devices.








Abstract
2D nonlayered materials (NLMs) have garnered considerable attention due to unique surface structure and bright application prospect. However, owing to the strong interatomic forces caused by intrinsic isotropic chemical bonds in all directions, the direct synthesis of ultrathin and large area 2D NLMs remains a tremendous challenge. Here, the surface&#8208;assisted passivation growth strategy is designed to synthesize ultrathin and large size &#946;&#8208;Bi2O3 crystals with the thickness down to 0.77 nm and the lateral size up to 163 &#181;m. These results are primarily ascribed to the bonding between Se atoms and the unsaturated Bi atoms on the surface of &#946;&#8208;Bi2O3, resulting in the surface passivation and promoting the obtaining of ultrathin &#946;&#8208;Bi2O3. Strikingly, the photodetectors based on &#946;&#8208;Bi2O3 flakes exhibit a high photoresponsivity of 71.91 A W&#8722;1, an excellent detectivity of 6.09 &#215; 1013 Jones, a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 2.4 &#215; 104%, an outstanding anisotropic photodetection and excellent UV imaging capability at 365 nm. This work sheds light on the synthesis of 2D ultrathin NLMs and promotes their applications in multifunctional optoelectronics.

         <title>Scalable Synaptic Transistor Memory from Solution&#8208;Processed Carbon Nanotubes for High&#8208;Speed Neuromorphic Data Processing</title>

Scalable synaptic transistor memory from solution&#8208;processed carbon nanotubes, exhibiting&#160;reconfigurable weights and long&#8208;term synaptic plasticity, enables parallel neuromorphic data processing with a speed of 1 M bit per second per input channel.








Abstract
Neural networks as a core information processing technology in machine learning and artificial intelligence demand substantial computational resources to deal with the extensive multiply&#8208;accumulate operations. Neuromorphic computing is an emergent solution to address this problem, allowing the computation performed in memory arrays in parallel with high efficiencies conforming to the neural networks. Here, scalable synaptic transistor memories are developed from solution&#8208;sorted carbon nanotubes. The transistors exhibit a large switching ratio of over 105, a significant memory window of &#8776;12&#160;V arising from charge trapping, and low response delays down to tens of nanoseconds.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neural networks as a core information processing technology in machine learning and artificial intelligence demand substantial computational resources to deal with the extensive multiply-accumulate operations. Neuromorphic computing is an emergent solution to address this problem, allowing the computation performed in memory arrays in parallel with high efficiencies conforming to the neural networks. Here, scalable synaptic transistor memories are developed from solution-sorted carbon nanotubes.

         <title>Magnesium Nanocomposite Hydrogel Reverses the Pathologies to Enhance Mandible Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The innovative design offers an injectable bone substitute that addresses various detrimental pathologies associated with medication&#8208;related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). It promotes vascularization, reduces inflammation, activates stem cells, and inhibits pathogens. The convenient implantation, assistance in blood clotting, and robust osteopromotive effects make it a promising solution for filling irregular bone defects and realizing functional regeneration.








Abstract
The healing of bone defects after debridement in medication&#8208;related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a challenging medical condition with impaired angiogenesis, susceptible infection, and pro&#8208;inflammatory responses. Magnesium (Mg) nanocomposite hydrogel is developed to specifically tackle multiple factors involved in MRONJ. Mg&#8208;oxide nanoparticles tune the gelation kinetics in the reaction between N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide&#8208;functionalized hyperbranched poly (ethylene glycol) and proteins. This reaction allows an enhanced mechanical property after instant solidification and, more importantly, also stable gelation in challenging environments such as wet and hemorrhagic conditions. The synthesized hydrogel guides mandible regeneration in MRONJ rats by triggering the formation of type H vessels, activating Osterix+ osteoprogenitor cells, and generating anti&#8208;inflammatory microenvironments. Additionally, this approach demonstrates its ability to suppress infection by inhibiting specific pathogens while strengthening stress tolerance in the affected alveolar bone. Furthermore, the enhanced osteogenic properties and feasibility of implantation of the hydrogel are validated in mandible defect and iliac crest defect created in minipigs, respectively. Collectively, this study offers an injectable and innovative bone substitute to enhance mandible defect healing by tackling multiple detrimental pathologies.

         <title>Transcriptome&#8208;Optimized Hydrogel Design of a Stem Cell Niche for Enhanced Tendon Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a pioneering materiomics approach to rationally design a stem cell&#8208;laden hydrogel (TenoGel) for tendon repair. Unlike traditional biomaterial empiricism, this systematic, data&#8208;driven strategy integrates RNA&#8208;seq bioinformatics and mathematical modeling, providing in&#8208;depth mechanistic insights with quantitative assessment and prediction of optimal tenogenic design parameters. This presents a transformative advancement in biomaterial engineering for regenerative medicine.








Abstract
Bioactive hydrogels have emerged as promising artificial niches for enhancing stem cell&#8208;mediated tendon repair. However, a substantial knowledge gap remains regarding the optimal combination of niche features for targeted cellular responses, which often leads to lengthy development cycles and uncontrolled healing outcomes. To address this critical gap, an innovative, data&#8208;driven materiomics strategy is developed. This approach is based on in&#8208;house RNA&#8208;seq data that integrates bioinformatics and mathematical modeling, which is a significant departure from traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods. It aims to provide both mechanistic insights and quantitative assessments and predictions of the tenogenic effects of adipose&#8208;derived stem cells induced by systematically modulated features of a tendon&#8208;mimetic hydrogel (TenoGel). The knowledge generated has enabled a rational approach for TenoGel design, addressing key considerations, such as tendon extracellular matrix concentration, uniaxial tensile loading, and in vitro pre&#8208;conditioning duration. Remarkably, our optimized TenoGel demonstrated robust tenogenesis in vitro and facilitated tendon regeneration while preventing undesired ectopic ossification in a rat tendon injury model. These findings shed light on the importance of tailoring hydrogel features for efficient tendon repair. They also highlight the tremendous potential of the innovative materiomics strategy as a powerful predictive and assessment tool in biomaterial development for regenerative medicine.

         <title>Extracellular Silica Nanomatrices Promote In Vitro Maturation of Anti&#8208;tumor Dendritic Cells via Activation of Focal Adhesion Kinase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silica nanozigzags (NZs) facilitate the in vitro maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) via mechanoactivation of focal adhesion kinase. The NZ&#8208;maturated DCs in vitro prime the cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocytes (CTLs) into the programmed cell death protein&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1)lowCD44high effector memory CTLs, and in vivo suppress the growth of tumors, indicating a promising new strategy for cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
The efficacy of dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based cancer vaccines is critically determined by the functionalities of in vitro maturated DCs. The maturation of DCs typically relies on chemicals that are cytotoxic or hinder the ability of DCs to efficiently activate the antigen&#8208;specific cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocytes (CTLs) against tumors. Herein, the maturation chemicals are replaced with extracellular silica nanomatrices, fabricated by glancing angle deposition, to promote in vitro maturation of murine bone marrow&#8208;derived DCs (mBMDCs). The extracellular nanomatrices composed of silica nanozigzags (NZs) enable the generation of mature mBMDCs with upregulated levels of co&#8208;stimulatory molecules, C&#8208;C chemokine receptor type&#8208;7, X&#8208;C motif chemokine recetpor&#8208;1, DC&#8208;specific ICAM&#8208;3 grabbing nonintegrin, and enhanced endocytic capacity. The in vitro maturation is partially governed by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) that is mechanically activated in the curved cell adhesions formed at the DC&#8208;NZ interfaces. The NZ&#8208;maturated mBMDCs can prime the antigen&#8208;specific CTLs into programmed cell death protein&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1)lowCD44high memory phenotypes in vitro and suppress the growth of tumors in vivo. Meanwhile, the NZ&#8208;mediated beneficial effects are also observed in human monocyte&#8208;derived DCs. This work demonstrates that the silica NZs promote the anti&#8208;tumor capacity of in vitro maturated DCs via the mechanoactivation of FAK, supporting the potential of silica NZs being a promising biomaterial for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Angular&#8208;Inertia Regulated Stable and Nanoscale Sensing of Single Molecules Using Nanopore&#8208;In&#8208;A&#8208;Tube</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study develops a nanopore&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;tube (NIAT) device that precisely regulates molecule translocation in a funnel&#8208;shaped nanopore by controlling the inertial angle and centrifugation speed in a centrifuge. This ensures stable signal readout with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, enabling nanoscale sensing of single molecules.








Abstract
Nanopore is commonly used for high&#8208;resolution, label&#8208;free sensing, and analysis of single molecules. However, controlling the speed and trajectory of molecular translocation in nanopores remains challenging, hampering sensing accuracy. Here, the study proposes a nanopore&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;tube (NIAT) device that enables decoupling of the current signal detection from molecular translocation and provides precise angular inertia&#8208;kinetic translocation of single molecules through a nanopore, thus ensuring stable signal readout with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR). Specifically, the funnel&#8208;shaped silicon nanopore, fabricated at a 10&#8208;nm resolution, is placed into a centrifugal tube. A light&#8208;induced photovoltaic effect is utilized to achieve a counter&#8208;balanced state of electrokinetic effects in the nanopore. By controlling the inertial angle and centrifugation speed, the angular inertial force is harnessed effectively for regulating the translocation process with high precision. Consequently, the speed and trajectory of the molecules are able to be adjusted in and around the nanopore, enabling controllable and high SNR current signals. Numerical simulation reveals the decisive role of inertial angle in achieving uniform translocation trajectories and enhancing analyte&#8208;nanopore interactions. The performance of the device is validated by discriminating rigid Au nanoparticles with a 1.6&#8208;nm size difference and differentiating a 1.3&#8208;nm size difference and subtle stiffness variations in flexible polyethylene glycol molecules.

Consequently, the speed and trajectory of the molecules are able to be adjusted in and around the nanopore, enabling controllable and high SNR current signals. Numerical simulation reveals the decisive role of inertial angle in achieving uniform translocation trajectories and enhancing analyte-nanopore interactions. The performance of the device is validated by discriminating rigid Au nanoparticles with a 1.6-nm size difference and differentiating a 1.3-nm size difference and subtle stiffness variations in flexible polyethylene glycol molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208;metallo&#8208;immunotherapy: Fabricating Chromium&#8208;Based Nanocomposites to Enhance CAR&#8208;T Cell Infiltration and Cytotoxicity against Solid Tumors</title>

         <dc:description>
Chromium nanoparticles (Cr NPs) coated with a layer of biodegradable polydopamine can empower the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)&#8208;T cell therapy against solid tumors. Upon laser irradiation, the induced hyperthermia can &#8220;warm&#8221; the &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor microenvironment (TME) and boost the therapeutic effect of CAR&#8208;T cells. The Cr3+ ions released can also promote the CAR&#8208;T cell migration and infiltration for effective inhibition of tumor growth in tumor&#8208;bearing mice.








Abstract
The infiltration and cytotoxicity of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)&#8208;T cells are crucial for effective elimination of solid tumors. While metallo&#8208;immunotherapy is a promising strategy that can activate the antitumor immunity, its role in promoting CAR&#8208;T cell therapy remains elusive. The first single&#8208;element nanomaterial based on chromium nanoparticles (Cr NPs) for cancer photo&#8208;metallo&#8208;immunotherapy has been reported previously. Herein, an extended study using biodegradable polydopamine as a versatile carrier for these nanoparticles, enabling synergistic CAR&#8208;T cell therapy, is reported. The results show that these nanocomposites with or without further encapsulation of the anticancer drug alpelisib can promote the CAR&#8208;T cell migration and antitumor effect. Upon irradiation with near&#8208;infrared light, they caused mild hyperthermia that can &#8220;warm&#8221; the &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor microenvironment (TME). The administration of B7&#8208;H3 CAR&#8208;T cells to NOD severe combined immunodeficiency gamma mice bearing a human hepatoma or PIK3CA&#8208;mutated breast tumor can significantly inhibit the tumor growth after the induction of tumor hyperthermia by the nanocomposites and promote the secretion of serum cytokines, including IL&#8208;2, IFN&#8208;&#947;, and TNF&#8208;&#945;. The trivalent Cr3+ ions, which are the major degradation product of these nanocomposites, can increase the CXCL13 and CCL3 chemokine expressions to generate tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) in the tumor tissues, facilitating the CAR&#8208;T cell infiltration.

         <title>A Topological Parametric Phonon Oscillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A topological parametric phonon oscillator is experimentally realized based on a nonlinear nano&#8208;electromechanical Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity with strong squeezed interaction. Fabrication&#8208;disorder&#8208;induced random frequency variation can be suppressed effectively by increasing the cavity size, while the free spectral range reduces at a much slower rate. These results represent an important advance in topological physics with large bosonic nonlinearities and parametric gain.








Abstract
Topological bosonic systems have recently aroused intense interests in exploring exotic phenomena that have no counterparts in electronic systems. The squeezed bosonic interaction in these systems is particularly interesting, because it can modify the vacuum fluctuations of topological states, drive them into instabilities, and lead to topological parametric oscillators. However, these phenomena remain experimentally elusive because of limited nonlinearities in most existing topological bosonic systems. Here, a topological parametric phonon oscillator is experimentally realized based on a nonlinear nano&#8208;electromechanical Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity with strong squeezed interaction. Specifically, the Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity is parametrically driven to provide phase&#8208;sensitive amplification for topological phonons, leading to the observation of coherent parametric phonon oscillation above the threshold. Additionally, it is confirmed that the random frequency variation caused by fabrication disorders can be suppressed effectively by increasing the cavity size while the free spectral range reduces at a much slower rate, which benefits the realization of large&#8208;area single&#8208;mode lasers. These results represent an important advance in experimental investigations of topological physics with large bosonic nonlinearities and parametric gain.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Homing Phage Nanofibers for Nanozyme&#8208;Enhanced Targeted Breast Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetically engineered phages display a nanozyme&#8208;nucleating peptide on the sidewall and a tumor&#8208;homing peptide at the tip. They site&#8208;specifically nucleate Pt nanozyme on the sidewall. The resultant phages can home to breast tumor and catalyze the conversion of tumoral hydrogen peroxide into oxygen. This strategy solves the problem of tumor hypoxia and improves the efficacy of photodynamic cancer therapy.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) eliminates cancer cells by converting endogenous oxygen into reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, its efficacy is significantly hindered by hypoxia in solid tumors. Hence, to engineer filamentous fd phage, a human&#8208;friendly bacteria&#8208;specific virus is proposed, into a nanozyme&#8208;nucleating photosensitizer&#8208;loaded tumor&#8208;homing nanofiber for enhanced production of ROS in a hypoxic tumor. Specifically, Pt&#8208;binding and tumor&#8208;homing peptides are genetically displayed on the sidewall and tip of the fd phage, respectively. The Pt&#8208;binding peptides induced nucleation and orientation of Pt nanozymes (PtNEs) on the sidewall of the phage. The resultant PtNE&#8208;coated tumor&#8208;homing phage exhibits significantly enhanced sustained catalytic conversion of hydrogen peroxide in hypoxic tumors into O2 for producing ROS needed for PDT, compared to non&#8208;phage&#8208;templated PtNE. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify the catalytic mechanism of the phage&#8208;templated PtNE. After intravenous injection of the PtNE&#8208;coated indocyanine green (ICG)&#8208;loaded tumor&#8208;homing phages into breast tumor&#8208;bearing mice, the nanofibers home to the tumors and effectively inhibit tumor growth by the PtNE&#8208;enhanced PDT. The nanofibers can also serve as a tumor&#8208;homing imaging probe due to the fluorescence of ICG. This work demonstrates that filamentous phage, engineered to become tumor&#8208;homing nanozyme&#8208;nucleating tumor&#8208;hypoxia&#8208;relieving nanofibers, can act as cancer&#8208;targeting nanozymes with improved catalytic performance for effective targeted PDT.

Magnesium Nanocomposite Hydrogel
Inspired by &#8220;Jingwei Reclamation&#8221;, the cover with a phoenix, symbolizes nirvana and rebirth, representing hope and resilience in challenging environments. The phoenix utilizes magnesium nanocomposite hydrogel as a &#8220;stone&#8221; to fill the vast sea that represents challenging mandible defects. The surrounding mountains intricately portray the structure of trabecular bones. The shape of phoenix and hydrogel looks like &#8220;60&#8221;, celebrating the 60th anniversary of CUHK. More details can be found in article number 2312920 by Ling Qin, Jiankun Xu, and co&#8208;workers.

Single Molecules
Ho&#8221;Pui Ho, Wu Yuan, and co&#8221;workers have developed a nanopore&#8221;in&#8221;a&#8221;tube (NIAT) device that precisely regulates molecule translocation in a funnel&#8221;shaped nanopore by controlling the inertial angle and centrifugation speed in a centrifuge. This ensures stable signal readout with a high signal&#8221;to&#8221;noise ratio, enabling nanoscale sensing of single molecules. More details can be found in article number 2400018.

         <title>3D Nanofabrication via Directed Material Assembly: Mechanism, Method, and Future</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided material assembly, as an important mechanism of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) nanofabrication, has led to breakthroughs in fabrication resolution, material generality, and throughput, and enabled numerous new opportunities for nanotechnology. This review summarizes recent advances in this promising strategy with an emphasis on the synergy among different microscopic driving forces with different regioselective designs to achieve nanoscale assembly precision and sophisticated 3D structure design.








Abstract
Fabrication of complex three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structures at nanoscale is the core of nanotechnology, as it enables the creation of various micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;devices such as micro&#8208;robots, metamaterials, sensors, photonic devices, etc. Among most 3D nanofabrication strategies, the guided material assembly, an efficient bottom&#8208;up approach capable of directly constructing designed structures from precise integration of material building blocks, possesses compelling advantages in diverse material compatibility, sufficient driving forces, facile processing steps, and nanoscale resolution. In this review, we focus on assembly&#8208;based fabrication methods capable of creating complex 3D nanostructures (instead of periodic or 2.5D&#8208;only structures). Recent advances are classified based on the different assembly mechanisms, i.e., assembly driven by chemical reactions, physical interactions, and the synergy of multiple microscopic interactions. The design principles of representative fabrication strategies with an emphasis on their respective advantages, e.g., structural design flexibility, material compatibility, resolution, or applications are analyzed. In the summary and outlook, existing challenges, as well as possible paths to solutions for future development are reviewed. We believe that with recent advances in assembly&#8208;based nanofabrication strategies, 3D nanofabrication has achieved tremendous progress in resolution, material generality, and manufacturing cost, for it to make a greater impact in the near future.

         <title>Topological Spin Textures: Basic Physics and Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review offers a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in the realm of topological spin structures in a variety of magnetic materials. It delves into the fundamental magnetic properties of these spin textures, experimental observations in various materials, and their potential applications, highlighting the significant influence these advancements may have on future technological innovations.








Abstract
In the face of escalating modern data storage demands and the constraints of Moore's Law, exploring spintronic solutions, particularly the devices based on magnetic skyrmions, has emerged as a promising frontier in scientific research. Since the first experimental observation of skyrmions, topological spin textures have been extensively studied for their great potential as efficient information carriers in spintronic devices. However, significant challenges have emerged alongside this progress. This review aims to synthesize recent advances in skyrmion research while addressing the major issues encountered in the field. Additionally, current research on promising topological spin structures in addition to skyrmions is summarized. Beyond 2D structures, exploration also extends to 1D magnetic solitons and 3D spin textures. In addition, a diverse array of emerging magnetic materials is introduced, including antiferromagnets and 2D van der Waals magnets, broadening the scope of potential materials hosting topological spin textures. Through a systematic examination of magnetic principles, topological categorization, and the dynamics of spin textures, a comprehensive overview of experimental and theoretical advances in the research of topological magnetism is provided. Finally, both conventional and unconventional applications are summarized based on spin textures proposed thus far. This review provides an outlook on future development in applied spintronics.

         <title>Swarm Autonomy: From Agent Functionalization to Machine Intelligence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Swarm behaviors observed in nature have inspired the development of synthetic swarms. This review covers key aspects of synthetic swarms, including features of individual agents, external stimuli, swarm behaviors, and applications, examines underlying mechanisms of swarm generation and the emergence of machine intelligence, and envisions the realization of swarm autonomy.








Abstract
Swarm behaviors are common in nature, where individual organisms collaborate via perception, communication, and adaptation. Emulating these dynamics, large groups of active agents can self&#8208;organize through localized interactions, giving rise to complex swarm behaviors, which exhibit potential for applications across various domains. This review presents a comprehensive summary and perspective of synthetic swarms, to bridge the gap between the microscale individual agents and potential applications of synthetic swarms. It is begun by examining active agents, the fundamental units of synthetic swarms, to understand the origins of their motility and functionality in the presence of external stimuli. Then inter&#8208;agent communications and agent&#8208;environment communications that contribute to the swarm generation are summarized. Furthermore, the swarm behaviors reported to date and the emergence of machine intelligence within these behaviors are reviewed. Eventually, the applications enabled by distinct synthetic swarms are summarized. By discussing the emergent machine intelligence in swarm behaviors, insights are offered into the design and deployment of autonomous synthetic swarms for real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>In Vivo Interactions of Nucleic Acid Nanostructures With Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleic acid nanostructures have been intracellular drug carriers for nanomedicine applications for two decades, but their interaction with cells in vivo has gained clarity only recently. This review features their cellular&#8208;level distribution in various organs and the cellular responses induced in rodents, large animals, and humans. It concludes with directions for probing cell&#8208;nanoparticle interactions and regulatory updates for clinical translation.








Abstract

Nucleic acid nanostructures, derived from the assembly of nucleic acid building blocks (e.g., plasmids and oligonucleotides), are important intracellular carriers of therapeutic cargoes widely utilized in preclinical nanomedicine applications, yet their clinical translation remains scarce. In the era of &#8220;translational nucleic acid nanotechnology&#8221;, a deeper mechanistic understanding of the interactions of nucleic acid nanostructures with cells in vivo will guide the development of more efficacious nanomedicines. This review showcases the recent progress in dissecting the in vivo interactions of four key types of nucleic acid nanostructures (i.e., tile&#8208;based, origami, spherical nucleic acid, and nucleic acid nanogel) with cells in rodents over the past five years. Emphasis lies on the cellular&#8208;level distribution of nucleic acid nanostructures in various organs and tissues and the cellular responses induced by their cellular entry. Next, in the spirit of preclinical translation, this review features the latest interactions of nucleic acid nanostructures with cells in large animals and humans. Finally, the review offers directions for studying the interactions of nucleic acid nanostructures with cells from both materials and biology perspectives and concludes with some regulatory updates.

         <title>Embedded Physical Intelligence in Liquid Crystalline Polymer Actuators and Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal polymers have garnered substantial interest in the pursuit of intelligent robots, thanks to their capacity for reversible shape transformation and the vast potential for manifesting physical intelligence. In this review, a focused summary of the stimulation methodologies employed from various perspectives is provided and discusses current research trends in robotics to imbue physical intelligence into LC polymer systems.








Abstract
Responsive materials possess the inherent capacity to autonomously sense and respond to various external stimuli, demonstrating physical intelligence. Among the diverse array of responsive materials, liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs) stand out for their remarkable reversible stimuli&#8208;responsive shape&#8208;morphing properties and their potential for creating soft robots. While numerous reviews have extensively detailed the progress in developing LCP&#8208;based actuators and robots, there exists a need for comprehensive summaries that elucidate the underlying principles governing actuation and how physical intelligence is embedded within these systems. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in developing actuators and robots endowed with physical intelligence using LCPs. This review is structured around the stimulus conditions and categorizes the studies involving responsive LCPs based on the fundamental control and stimulation logic and approach. Specifically, three main categories are examined: systems that respond to changing stimuli, those operating under constant stimuli, and those equip with learning and logic control capabilities. Furthermore, the persisting challenges that need to be addressed are outlined and discuss the future avenues of research in this dynamic field.

         <title>Photonics for Neuromorphic Computing: Fundamentals, Devices, and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines advancements in integrated photonic neuromorphic systems, focusing on materials and device engineering breakthroughs needed to advance the field. We analyze various technologies in neuromorphic photonic AI accelerators, evaluating energy efficiency and compute density. Highlighting components like PCSEL lasers and optical interconnects, we discuss recent breakthroughs and recognize obstacles to achieving peta&#8208;level performance. Potential innovations in devices, materials, and integration are explored to overcome these challenges and transform AI and scientific computing in the near future.









Abstract
In the dynamic landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI), two notable phenomena are becoming predominant: the exponential growth of large AI model sizes and the explosion of massive amount of data. Meanwhile, scientific research such as quantum computing and protein synthesis increasingly demand higher computing capacities. As the Moore's Law approaches its terminus, there is an urgent need for alternative computing paradigms that satisfy this growing computing demand and break through the barrier of the von Neumann model. Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the mechanism and functionality of human brains, uses physical artificial neurons to do computations and is drawing widespread attention. This review studies the expansion of optoelectronic devices on photonic integration platforms that has led to significant growth in photonic computing, where photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have enabled ultrafast artificial neural networks (ANN) with sub&#8208;nanosecond latencies, low heat dissipation, and high parallelism. In particular, various technologies and devices employed in neuromorphic photonic AI accelerators, spanning from traditional optics to PCSEL lasers are examined. Lastly, it is recognized that existing neuromorphic technologies encounter obstacles in meeting the peta&#8208;level computing speed and energy efficiency threshold, and potential approaches in new devices, fabrication, materials, and integration to drive innovation are also explored. As the current challenges and barriers in cost, scalability, footprint, and computing capacity are resolved one&#8208;by&#8208;one, photonic neuromorphic systems are bound to co&#8208;exist with, if not replace, conventional electronic computers and transform the landscape of AI and scientific computing in the foreseeable&#160;future.

         <title>Bioactive Glass in Tissue Regeneration: Unveiling Recent Advances in Regenerative Strategies and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, various regenerative strategies based on bioactive glass (BG) (e.g. application of BG dissolution products, surface functionalization of BG, loading of biochemical factor/gene in BG particles/nanoparticles, composite polymer&#8208;BG scaffold, and BG&#8208;induced production of extracellular vesicles) targeting different tissues/organs (e.g. muscle, cartilage, skin, oral tissue, gastrointestinal tissue) are introduced.








Abstract
Bioactive glass (BG) is a class of biocompatible, biodegradable, multifunctional inorganic glass materials, which is successfully used for orthopedic and dental applications, with several products already approved for clinical use. Apart from exhibiting osteogenic properties, BG is also known to be angiogenic and antibacterial. Recently, BG's role in immunomodulation has been gradually revealed. While the therapeutic effect of BG is mostly reported in the context of bone and skin&#8208;related regeneration, its application in regenerating other tissues/organs, such as muscle, cartilage, and gastrointestinal tissue, has also been explored recently. The strategies of applying BG have also expanded from powder or cement form to more advanced strategies such as fabrication of composite polymer&#8208;BG scaffold, 3D printing of BG&#8208;loaded scaffold, and BG&#8208;induced extracellular vesicle production. This review presents a concise overview of the recent applications of BG in regenerative medicine. Various regenerative strategies of BG will be first introduced. Next, the applications of BG in regenerating various tissues/organs, such as bone, cartilage, muscle, tendon, skin, and gastrointestinal tissue, will be discussed. Finally, clinical applications of BG for tissue regeneration will be summarized, and future challenges and directions for the clinical translation of BG will be outlined.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Materials in Droplet Manipulation for Biochemical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;driven droplet manipulation strategies, featured in contactless interaction, high&#8208;spatiotemporal resolution, and biocompatibility, are considered promising, particularly for biochemical applications. Special attention is paid to the underlying mechanisms, recent advancements of light&#8208;responsive materials, and the most notable applications of light&#8208;driven droplet manipulation in this review.








Abstract
Miniaturized droplets, characterized by well&#8208;controlled microenvironments and capability for parallel processing, have significantly advanced the studies on enzymatic evolution, molecular diagnostics, and single&#8208;cell analysis. However, manipulation of small&#8208;sized droplets, including moving, merging, and trapping of the targeted droplets for complex biochemical assays and subsequent analysis, is not trivial and remains technically demanding. Among various techniques, light&#8208;driven methods stand out as a promising candidate for droplet manipulation in a facile and flexible manner, given the features of contactless interaction, high spatiotemporal resolution, and biocompatibility. This review therefore compiles an in&#8208;depth discussion of the governing mechanisms underpinning light&#8208;driven droplet manipulation. Besides, light&#8208;responsive materials, representing the core of light&#8211;matter interaction and the key character converting light into different forms of energy, are particularly assessed in this review. Recent advancements in light&#8208;responsive materials and the most notable applications are comprehensively archived and evaluated. Continuous innovations and rational engineering of light&#8208;responsive materials are expected to propel the development of light&#8208;driven droplet manipulation, equip droplets with enhanced functionality, and broaden the applications of droplets for biochemical studies and routine biochemical investigations.

         <title>Emerging 2D Ferroelectric Devices for In&#8208;Sensor and In&#8208;Memory Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reviews the recent progress of 2D ferroelectric devices for in&#8208;sensing and in&#8208;memory neuromorphic computing. Experimental and theoretical progresses on 2D ferroelectric devices, including passive ferroelectrics&#8208;integrated 2D devices and active ferroelectrics&#8208;integrated 2D devices are reviewed followed by the integration of perception, memory, and computing application. Notably, the 2D ferroelectric devices have been used to simulate synaptic weights, neuronal model functions, and neural networks for image processing.








Abstract
The quantity of sensor nodes within current computing systems is rapidly increasing in tandem with the sensing data. The presence of a bottleneck in data transmission between the sensors, computing, and memory units obstructs the system's efficiency and speed. To minimize the latency of data transmission between units, novel in&#8208;memory and in&#8208;sensor computing architectures are proposed as alternatives to the conventional von Neumann architecture, aiming for data&#8208;intensive sensing and computing applications. The integration of 2D materials and 2D ferroelectric materials has been expected to build these novel sensing and computing architectures due to the dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surface, ultra&#8208;fast polarization flipping, and ultra&#8208;low power consumption of the 2D ferroelectrics. Here, the recent progress of 2D ferroelectric devices for in&#8208;sensing and in&#8208;memory neuromorphic computing is reviewed. Experimental and theoretical progresses on 2D ferroelectric devices, including passive ferroelectrics&#8208;integrated 2D devices and active ferroelectrics&#8208;integrated 2D devices, are reviewed followed by the integration of perception, memory, and computing application. Notably, 2D ferroelectric devices have been used to simulate synaptic weights, neuronal model functions, and neural networks for image processing. As an emerging device configuration, 2D ferroelectric devices have the potential to expand into the sensor&#8208;memory and computing integration application field, leading to new possibilities for modern electronics.

         <title>Musculoskeletal Organs&#8208;on&#8208;Chips: An Emerging Platform for Studying the Nanotechnology&#8211;Biology Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in musculoskeletal organs&#8208;on&#8208;chips (OoCs) and discusses the integration of nanotechnology in musculoskeletal OoCs for precise control of the nanoscale environment and facilitated functional evaluation. The role of musculoskeletal OoCs&#160;in improving the precision, safety, and efficacy of nanomedicine is then addressed. Finally, the challenges and potential of nanotechnology in OoCs&#160;are envisioned. 








Abstract
Nanotechnology&#8208;based approaches are promising for the treatment of musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders, which present significant clinical burdens and challenges, but their clinical translation requires a deep understanding of the complex interplay between nanotechnology and MSK biology. Organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip (OoC) systems have emerged as an innovative and versatile microphysiological platform to replicate the dynamics of tissue microenvironment for studying nanotechnology&#8211;biology interactions. This review first covers recent advances and applications of MSK OoCs and their ability to mimic the biophysical and biochemical stimuli encountered by MSK tissues. Next, by integrating nanotechnology into MSK OoCs, cellular responses and tissue behaviors may be investigated by precisely controlling and manipulating the nanoscale environment. Analysis of MSK disease mechanisms, particularly bone, joint, and muscle tissue degeneration, and drug screening and development of personalized medicine may be greatly facilitated using MSK OoCs. Finally, future challenges and directions are outlined for the field, including advanced sensing technologies, integration of immune&#8208;active components, and enhancement of biomimetic functionality. By highlighting the emerging applications of MSK OoCs, this review aims to advance the understanding of the intricate nanotechnology&#8211;MSK biology interface and its significance in MSK disease management, and the development of innovative and personalized therapeutic and interventional strategies.

         <title>Photothermal CO2 Catalysis toward the Synthesis of Solar Fuel: From Material and Reactor Engineering to Techno&#8208;Economic Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>

This review explores recent progress in photothermal CO2 conversion, focusing on catalyst design, mechanism analysis, reactor engineering, and techno&#8208;economic aspects. It emphasizes the need to address rising atmospheric CO2 levels by converting CO2 into valuable chemicals using renewable solar energy, offering insights and future research directions in managing the anthropogenic carbon cycle.








Abstract
Carbon dioxide (CO2), a member of greenhouse gases, contributes significantly to maintaining a tolerable environment for all living species. However, with the development of modern society and the utilization of fossil fuels, the concentration of atmospheric CO2 has increased to 400&#160;ppm, resulting in a serious greenhouse effect. Thus, converting CO2 into valuable chemicals is highly desired, especially with renewable solar energy, which shows great potential with the manner of photothermal catalysis. In this review, recent advancements in photothermal CO2 conversion are discussed, including the design of catalysts, analysis of mechanisms, engineering of reactors, and the corresponding techno&#8208;economic analysis. A guideline for future investigation and the anthropogenic carbon cycle are provided.

         <title>Emerging&#8239;Strategies for the Synthesis of Correlated Single Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the research status and synthetic challenges in correlated single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are showcased. Existing strategies, such as the regulation of nucleation kinetics, nanoscale confinement, defect&#8208;assisted metal trapping, precise control via ligand chemistry, and stepwise deposition, are highlighted. A complementary perspective on emerging methods is provided for high throughput screening and upscaling toward the next&#8208;stage catalyst production.








Abstract
People have been looking for an energy&#8208;efficient and sustainable method to produce future chemicals for decades. Heterogeneous single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with atomic dispersion of robust, well&#8208;characterized active centers are highly desirable. In particular, correlated SACs with cooperative interaction between adjacent single atoms allow the switching of the single&#8208;site pathway to the dual or multisite pathway, thus promoting bimolecular or more complex reactions for the synthesis of fine chemicals. Herein, the structural uniqueness of correlated SACs, including the intermetal distance and electronic interaction in homo/heteronuclear metal sites is featured. Recent advances in the production methods of correlated SACs, showcasing the research status and challenges in traditional methods (such as pyrolysis, wet impregnation, and confined synthesis) for building a comprehensive multimetallic SAC library, are summarized. Emerging strategies such as process automation and continuous&#8208;flow synthesis are highlighted, minimizing the inconsistency in laboratory batch production and allowing high throughput screening and upscaling toward the next&#8208;stage chemical production by correlated SACs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conducting CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in acidic electrolytes offers a promising solution to address the &#8220;carbonate issue&#8221;&#8212;the undesired reaction between CO2 and electrolyte OH&#8722;, aiming to provide a high carbon utilization. This review encompasses recent developments of acidic CO2RR, including mechanism elucidation, catalyst design, and device&#8208;level engineering. Challenges and future directions are highlighted to shed light on its further development. 








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) powered by renewable energy provides a promising route to CO2 conversion and utilization. However, the widely used neutral/alkaline electrolyte consumes a large amount of CO2 to produce (bi)carbonate byproducts, leading to significant challenges at the device level, thereby impeding the further deployment of this reaction. Conducting CO2RR in acidic electrolytes offers a promising solution to address the &#8220;carbonate issue&#8221;; however, it presents inherent difficulties due to the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, necessitating concerted efforts toward advanced catalyst and electrode designs to achieve high selectivity and activity. This review encompasses recent developments of acidic CO2RR, from mechanism elucidation to catalyst design and device engineering. This review begins by discussing the mechanistic understanding of the reaction pathway, laying the foundation for catalyst design in acidic CO2RR. Subsequently, an in&#8208;depth analysis of recent advancements in acidic CO2RR catalysts is provided, highlighting heterogeneous catalysts, surface immobilized molecular catalysts, and catalyst surface enhancement. Furthermore, the progress made in device&#8208;level applications is summarized, aiming to develop high&#8208;performance acidic CO2RR systems. Finally, the existing challenges and future directions in the design of acidic CO2RR catalysts are outlined, emphasizing the need for improved selectivity, activity, stability, and scalability.

         <title>Achieving Environmentally&#8208;Adaptive and Multifunctional Hydrodynamic Metamaterials through Active Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 2, January 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An active&#8208;mode hydrodynamic metamaterial is developed with flow&#8208;dipoles, enabling active control of the flow field with various functionalities. By adjusting the flow&#8208;dipole moment, invisibility, flow shielding, and flow enhancing are achieved. Furthermore, it is environmentally adaptive and maintains proper functions in different environments. Thus, this design can significantly enhance tunability and adaptability of hydrodynamic metamaterials in complex and ever&#8208;changing environments. 








Abstract
As hydrodynamic metamaterials continue to develop, the inherent limitations of passive&#8208;mode metamaterials become increasingly apparent. First, passive devices are typically designed for specific environments and lack the adaptability to environmental changes. Second, their unique functions often rely on intricate structures, or challenging material properties, or a combination of both. These limitations considerably hinder the potential applications of hydrodynamic metamaterials. In this study, an active&#8208;mode hydrodynamic metamaterial is theoretically proposed and experimentally demonstrated by incorporating source&#8208;and&#8208;sink flow&#8208;dipoles into the system, enabling active manipulation of the flow field with various functionalities. By adjusting the magnitude and direction of the flow&#8208;dipole moment, this device can easily achieve invisibility, flow shielding, and flow enhancing. Furthermore, it is environmentally adaptive and can maintain proper functions in different environments. It is anticipated that this design will significantly enhance tunability and adaptability of hydrodynamic metamaterials in complex and ever&#8208;changing&#160;environments.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Approaches to Engineer Fluorescent Nanosensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomaterial&#8208;based optical sensors are powerful tools to identify and image (biological) molecules. Optimizing surface chemistry and photophysics of these sensors is essential, but current methods limit throughput. This article discusses bottlenecks and highlights opportunities and requirements for high throughput and the scalability of non&#8208;classical recognition strategies.








Abstract
Optical sensors are powerful tools to identify and image (biological) molecules. Because of their optoelectronic properties, nanomaterials are often used as building blocks. To transduce the chemical interaction with the analyte into an optical signal, the interplay between surface chemistry and nanomaterial photophysics has to be optimized. Understanding these aspects promises major opportunities for tailored sensors with optimal performance. However, this requires methods to create and explore the many chemical permutations. Indeed, many current approaches are limited in throughput. This affects the chemical design space that can be studied, the application of machine learning approaches as well as fundamental mechanistic understanding. Here, an overview of selection&#8208;limited and synthesis&#8208;limited approaches is provided to create and identify molecular nanosensors. Bottlenecks are discussed and opportunities of non&#8208;classical recognition strategies are highlighted such as corona phase molecular recognition as well as the requirements for high throughput and scalability. Fluorescent carbon nanotubes are powerful building blocks for sensors and their huge chemical design space makes them an ideal platform for high throughput approaches. Therefore, they are the focus of this article, but the insights are transferable to any nanosensor system. Overall, this perspective aims to provide a fresh perspective to overcome current challenges in the nanosensor field.

         <title>RAFT Polymerization for Advanced Morphological Control: From Individual Polymer Chains to Bulk Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization is a transformative technique in polymer science, offering unprecedented control over polymer morphology across a vast range of length scales. Recent advances leverage RAFT's precision and versatility to enable advanced materials design by dictating monomer sequences at the molecular level, manipulating self&#8208;assembly to make mesoscale structures, and controlling micro&#8208;phase separation for intricate 3D printed structures.








Abstract
Control of the morphology of polymer systems is achieved through reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization techniques such as Reversible Addition&#8208;Fragmentation chain Transfer (RAFT). Advanced RAFT techniques offer much more than just &#8220;living&#8221; polymerization &#8212; the RAFT toolkit now enables morphological control of polymer systems across many decades of length&#8208;scale. Morphological control is explored at the molecular&#8208;level in the context of syntheses where individual monomer unit insertion provides sequence&#8208;defined polymers (single unit monomer insertion, SUMI). By being able to define polymer architectures, the synthesis of bespoke shapes and sizes of nanostructures becomes possible by leveraging self&#8208;assembly (polymerization induced self&#8208;assembly, PISA). Finally, it is seen that macroscopic materials can be produced with nanoscale detail, based on phase&#8208;separated nanostructures (polymerization induced microphase separation, PIMS) and microscale detail based on 3D&#8208;printing technologies. RAFT control of morphology is seen to cross from molecular level to additive manufacturing length&#8208;scales, with complete morphological control over all length&#8208;scales.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Pixel Event Photoactive Device for Real&#8208;Time, In&#8208;Sensor Spatiotemporal Optical Information Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research introduces a single&#8208;pixel event photoactive device with selective carrier integration that merges spatiotemporal event sensing and built&#8208;in short&#8208;term memory. It processes multibit parallel data and recognizes patterns ultrafast (0.4&#160;&#181;s) with ultralow energy use (25 femtojoules). Adjusting its speed allows trajectory and position detection of events through optical flow sensing.








Abstract
The increasing demand for energy&#8208;efficient, sophisticated optical sensing technologies in various applications, from machine vision to optical communication, highlights the necessity for innovations in spatiotemporal information sensing and processing at a nearly single&#8208;pixel scale. Traditional methods, including multi&#8208;pixel photodetector arrays and event&#8208;based camera systems, often fail to provide rapid, real&#8208;time detection and processing of dynamic events within the sensor. This shortcoming is particularly notable in handling high&#8208;dimensional spatiotemporal data, where the dependency on sequential data input and external processing tools leads to latency, reduced throughput, and heightened energy consumption, thereby impeding real&#8208;time parallel data processing capabilities. Here, a carrier&#8208;selective, single&#8208;pixel, position&#8208;sensitive planar photoactive device that integrates spatiotemporal event sensing with inherent short&#8208;term memory capabilities is introduced. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept single&#8208;pixel event photoactive device enables in&#8208;sensor spatiotemporal parallel optical information processing, efficiently managing multibit (&gt;4 bit) data simultaneously and facilitating ultrafast (&#8776;0.4&#160;&#181;s) recognition of input patterns with low energy consumption (25 femtojoules). Additionally, by adjusting the operating speed from continuous to pulsed light illumination, the sensor array can detect trajectories and absolute position of events, offering in&#8208;sensor optical flow detection. This single&#8208;pixel event photodetector marks significant advancement toward developing compact, energy&#8208;efficient, ultrafast sensors suitable for a wide range of in sensor&#8208;based photonic applications.

         <title>Enhancing Resistance to Wetting Transition through the Concave Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the pulvilli of the leaf beetle (Gastrophysa atrocyanea), a new design strategy is introduced to enhance the wetting stability of superhydrophobic surfaces through the implementation of concave structures. The air caps forming on the concavity contribute to preventing the Cassie&#8208;Baxter to Wenzel transition under continuous exposure to various impacts and hydrostatic pressures.








Abstract
Water&#8208;repellent superhydrophobic surfaces are ubiquitous in nature. The fundamental understanding of bio/bio&#8208;inspired structures facilitates practical applications surmounting metastable superhydrophobicity. Typically, the hierarchical structure and/or reentrant morphology have been employed hitherto to suppress the Cassie&#8208;Baxter to Wenzel transition (CWT). Herein, a new design concept is reported, an effect of concave structure, which is vital for the stable superhydrophobic surface. The thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities of the concave pillars are evaluated by continuous exposure to various hydrostatic pressures and sudden impacts of water droplets with various Weber numbers (We), comparing them to the standard superhydrophobic normal pillars. Specifically, the concave pillar exhibits reinforced impact resistance preventing CWT below a critical We of &#8776;27.6, which is &#8776;1.6 times higher than that of the normal pillar (&#8776;17.0). Subsequently, the stability of underwater air film (plastron) is investigated at various hydrostatic pressures. The results show that convex air caps formed at the concave cavities generate downward Laplace pressure opposing the exerted hydrostatic pressure between the pillars, thus impeding the hydrostatic pressure&#8208;dependent underwater air diffusion. Hence, the effects of trapped air caps contributing to the stable Cassie&#8208;Baxter state can offer a pioneering strategy for the exploration and utilization of superhydrophobic surfaces.

         <title>Anisotropic Ferroelectricity in Polar Vortices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the existence and anisotropic nature of macroscopic polarization components that emerge within lattices of nanoscale polar vortices are demonstrated. In particular, the component parallel to the vortex axis shows novel switching behavior that can be harnessed for multistate memory, with excellent stability of numerous intermediate states demonstrated.








Abstract
The exotic polarization configurations of topologically protected dipolar textures have opened new avenues for realizing novel phenomena absent in traditional ferroelectric systems. While multiple recent studies have revealed a diverse array of emergent properties in such polar topologies, the details of their atomic and mesoscale structures remain incomplete. Through atomic&#8208; and meso&#8208;scale imaging techniques, the emergence of a macroscopic ferroelectric polarization along both principal axes of the vortex lattice while performing phase&#8208;field modeling to probe the atomic scale origins of these distinct polarization components is demonstrated. Additionally, due to the anisotropic epitaxial strain, the polarization switching behavior perpendicular and parallel to the vortices is highly anisotropic, with switching along the vortex axes occurring over numerous decades in field&#8208;pulse width. This slow switching process allows for the deterministic control of the polarization state, enabling a non&#8208;volatile, multi&#8208;state memory with excellent distinguishability and long retention&#160;times.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Rapid Elimination of Antibiotic Resistance Contaminations Using Graphitic Carbon Nitride Tailored with Carrier Confinement Domains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carrier confinement domains alter the inherent sp2 hybridized plane structure of graphitic carbon nitride, further inducing stronger electron delocalization and long&#8208;range order, which promotes faster separation and migration of photogenerated carrier, accelerates redox reaction decoupling and photodynamic antibiotic resistance removal.








Abstract
Solar water disinfection facilitated by photocatalyst has been considered a viable point&#8208;of&#8208;use (POU) method for mitigating antibiotic resistance contaminations at the household or community levels. Here, density functional theory calculations are used to guide the fabrication of a carrier confinement domains (CCD)&#8208;decorated graphitic carbon nitride (CN) photocatalyst. The CCD integration effectively disrupts the electron distribution symmetry of CN, amplifies its local electron density, and facilitates the formation of a long&#8208;range ordered structure, thereby enhancing charge separation efficiency. Importantly, the CCD directs the migration of photogenerated carriers to specific regions upon light illumination, effectively minimizing their spatial proximity. As a result, the overall reactive oxygen species level of the photocatalytic system is markedly elevated, with a twelvefold increase in H2O2 concentration, alongside a significant rise in &#8226;O2&#8722; and &#8226;OH steady&#8208;state concentrations. Remarkably, a record&#8208;high disinfection efficiency is attained, successfully inactivating 7 log of antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria within 30&#160;min. Additionally, the photocatalyst can be integrated into a continuous&#8208;flow fixed&#8208;bed reactor, facilitating clean water production for up to 60&#160;h at a rate of 121&#160;L&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;day&#8722;1, highlighting its significant potential for POU applications.

The mass transport limit is circumvented by the pulsed charging protocols, achieving (002)&#8208;textured, dendrite&#8208;free, and hydrogen&#8208;evolution&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping at ultrahigh current density up to 160 mA cm&#8722;2. The Zn batteries accordingly achieve high current density (50&#8211;100 mA cm&#8722;2), high areal mass loading (29 mgcathode cm&#8722;2), and high areal capacity (7.9 mAh cm&#8722;2).








Abstract
It is commonly accepted that batteries perform better at low current densities below the mass&#8208;transport limit, which restricts their current rate and capacity. Here, it is demonstrated that the performance of Zn metal electrodes can be dramatically enhanced at current densities and cut&#8208;off capacities exceeding the mass&#8208;transport limit by using pulsed&#8208;current protocols. These protocols achieve cumulative plating/stripping capacities of 11.0 Ah cm&#8722;2 and 3.8 Ah cm&#8722;2 at record&#8208;high current densities of 80 and 160 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. The study identifies and understands the promoted (002)&#8208;textured Zn growth and suppressed hydrogen evolution based on the thermodynamics and kinetics of competing reactions. Furthermore, the over&#8208;limiting pulsed&#8208;current protocol enables long&#8208;life Zn batteries with high mass loading (29 mgcathode cm&#8722;2) and high areal capacity (7.9 mAh cm&#8722;2), outperforming cells using constant&#8208;current protocols at equivalent energy and time costs. The work provides a comprehensive understanding of the current&#8208;capacity&#8208;performance relationship in Zn plating/stripping and offers an effective strategy for dendrite&#8208;free metal batteries that meet practical requirements for high capacity and high current rates.

         <title>Strong Anisotropy and Giant Photothermoelectricity of 1D Alloy Nb3Se12I&#8208;Based Photodetector for Ultrabroadband Light&#8208;Detection and Encryption Imaging Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multifunctional Nb3Se12I photodetector integrated broadband imaging and encrypted communications are realized based on the photothermoelectric effect and polarization sensitivity. The photothermoelectric and photoconductive effect synergistic detection mechanism enable high responsivity and rapid operation across a broad wavelength spectrum from deep&#8208;ultraviolet to terahertz. The encrypted method of polarization state compensation for photothermoelectric current converting image data into polarization states enhances information security. This work provides an effective strategy to advance anisotropic thermoelectric materials for high&#8208;capacity, secure communication applications.








Abstract
Securing high&#8208;capacity and safe communication holds great potential for ushering in the new era of digital society. In this study, a wide&#8208;band photodetector based on the quasi&#8208;1D niobium selenide compounds (Nb3Se12I), showing up photothermoelectric (PTE) dominated multiple synergistic effects with high responsivity across a wide wavelength range from deep&#8208;ultraviolet (254&#160;nm) to terahertz (0.30 THz), providing an efficient strategy for high&#8208;capacity optical processing is introduced. Combined with the polarized&#8208;sensitive property of the Nb3Se12I photodetector, an encrypted imaging technology using polarization&#8208;resolved PTE current is developed. This technology is capable of transforming encrypted messages into polarization states, which can be restored through a specially designed decryption algorithm, greatly enhancing the concealment and security of the information transmission process. Overall, the Nb3Se12I&#8208;based detector manifests in terms of high responsivity (283.2 A W&#8722;1 to 520&#160;nm, 1632.4 A W&#8722;1 to 980&#160;nm, and 1868.1 A W&#8722;1 for short&#8208;wave infrared light of 2200&#160;nm), suitable response speed of 43 &#181;s for 0.30 THz wave and polarization anisotropy ratio of 1.83. The versatile abilities of photodetector in the realm of ultrabroadband polarized detection and encryption imaging may advance the use of anisotropic thermoelectric materials in high&#8208;capacity and secure information communication applications.

         <title>Multifunctional Ultrathin Ti3C2Tx MXene@CuCo2O4 /PE Separator for Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density and Large&#8208;Capacity Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Pouch Cells</title>

This study presents a multifunctional ultrathin Ti3C2Tx MXene/CuCo2O4/PE separator that can suppress LiPSs shuttling, enhance sulfur redox kinetics, and regulate Li+ deposition, and consequently achieve an outstanding energy density of 417&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 in a 10Ah&#8208;level pouch cell.








Abstract
The shuttling of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), sluggish reaction kinetics, and uncontrolled lithium deposition/stripping remain the main challenges in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs), which are aggravated under practical working conditions, i.e., high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte in large&#8208;capacity pouch cells. This study introduces a Ti3C2Tx MXene@CuCo2O4 (MCC) composite on a polyethylene (PE) separator to construct an ultrathin MXene@CuCo2O4/PE (MCCP) film. The MCCP functional separator can deliver superior LiPSs adsorption/catalysis capabilities via the MCC composite and regulate the Li+ deposition through a conductive Ti3C2Tx MXene framework, enhancing redox kinetics and cycling lifetime. When paired with sulfur/carbon (S/C) cathode and lithium metal anode, the resultant 10 Ah&#8208;level pouch cell with the ultrathin MCCP separator achieves an energy density of 417&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 based on the whole cell and a stable running of 100 cycles under practical operation conditions (cathode loading = 10.0&#8201;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, negative/positive areal capacity ratio (N/P ratio) = 2, and electrolyte/sulfur weight ratio (E/S ratio) = 2.6&#8201;&#181;L mg&#8722;1). Furthermore, through a systematic evaluation of the as&#8208;prepared Li&#8208;S pouch cell, the study unveils the operational and failure mechanisms of LSBs under practical conditions. The achievement of ultrahigh energy density in such a large&#8208;capacity lithium&#8208;sulfur pouch cell will accelerate the commercialization of LSBs.

         <title>Dirac&#8208;Like Fermions Anomalous Magneto&#8208;Transport in a Spin&#8208;Polarized Oxide 2D Electron System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomalous magneto&#8208;transport dominated by non&#8208;trivial Berry curvature and Dirac&#8208;like fermions is exhibited by an engineered 2D electron system (2DES) at (111) LaAlO3/EuTiO3/SrTiO3 interface, where structural and electronic properties are tailored to mimic that of magnetic gapped topological insulators.









Abstract
In a 2D electron system (2DES) the breaking of the inversion, time&#8208;reversal and bulk crystal&#8208;field symmetries is interlaced with the effects of spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) triggering exotic quantum phenomena. Here, epitaxial engineering is used to design and realize a 2DES characterized simultaneously by ferromagnetic order, large Rashba SOC and hexagonal band warping at the (111) interfaces between LaAlO3, EuTiO3, and SrTiO3 insulators. The 2DES displays anomalous quantum corrections to the magneto&#8208;conductance driven by the time&#8208;reversal&#8208;symmetry breaking occurring below the magnetic transition temperature. The results are explained by the emergence of a non&#8208;trivial Berry phase and competing weak anti&#8208;localization/weak localization back&#8208;scattering of Dirac&#8208;like fermions, mimicking the phenomenology of gapped topological insulators. These findings open perspectives for the engineering of novel spin&#8208;polarized functional 2DES holding promises in spin&#8208;orbitronics and topological&#160;electronics.

         <title>Bidirectional Photovoltage&#8208;Driven Oxide Transistors for Neuromorphic Visual Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bidirectional photovoltage&#8208;driven neuromorphic visual sensor is constructed by connecting the different electrodes of two perovskite solar cells to the two gates of ion&#8208;regulated In2O3 transistors. The mem&#8208;reservoir chip is also proposed for handing object movement and dynamic color recognition.








Abstract
Biological vision is one of the most important parts of the human perception system. However, emulating biological visuals is challenging because it requires complementary photoexcitation and photoinhibition. Here, the study presents a bidirectional photovoltage&#8208;driven neuromorphic visual sensor (BPNVS) that is constructed by monolithically integrating two perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with dual&#8208;gate ion&#8208;gel&#8208;gated oxide transistors. PSCs act as photoreceptors, converting external visual stimuli into electrical signals, whereas oxide transistors generate neuromorphic signal outputs that can be adjusted to produce positive and negative photoresponses. This device mimics the human vision system's ability to recognize colored and color&#8208;mixed patterns. The device achieves a static color recognition accuracy of 96% by utilizing the reservoir computing system for feature extraction. The BPNVS mem&#8208;reservoir chip is also proposed for handing object movement and dynamic color recognition. This work is a significant step forward in neuromorphic sensing and complex pattern recognition.

         <title>Self&#8208;Trapped Excitons in 3R ZnIn2S4 with Broken Inversion Symmetry for High&#8208;Performance Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D 3R&#8208;phase ZnIn2S4 with broken inversion symmetry is systematically investigated for its intrinsic self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs). Benefiting from the presence of intrinsic STEs, the photoconductive effects induced by STEs can enhance their applicability in photodetection with remarkable broad&#8208;spectrum performance.








Abstract
Exploring novel materials with intrinsic self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) is crucial for advancing optoelectronic technologies. In this study, 2D 3R&#8208;phase ZnIn2S4, featuring broken inversion symmetry, is introduced to investigate intrinsic STEs. This material exhibits a broadband photoluminescence (PL) emission with a full width at half maximum of 164&#160;nm and a large Stokes shift of &#8776;0.6&#160;eV, which arises from the distortion of [ZnS4]6&#8208; tetrahedral unit induced by the symmetry breaking and strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling. The photophysical properties of the STEs exhibit a high Huang&#8208;Rhys factor (15.0), rapid STEs formation time (166&#160;fs), and extended STEs lifetime (1039&#160;ps), as demonstrated by experimental evidence from temperature&#8208;dependent PL, Raman spectroscopy, and ultrafast absorption spectroscopy. Additionally, STE&#8208;induced photoconductive&#160;effect is elucidated, indicating that intrinsic STEs in 3R&#8208;ZnIn2S4 can provide a synergistic effect that enhances absorption capacity, localization, and lifetime by capturing the self&#8208;trapped hole state. Consequently, the 2D 3R&#8208;ZnIn2S4 photodetector exhibits remarkable broad&#8208;spectrum photosensitivity, including a photo&#8208;switching ratio of 11286, response times of less than 0.6&#160;ms, responsivity of 15.2&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, detectivity of 1.02&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#185;&#185; Jones, and external quantum efficiency of 5032% under 375&#160;nm light. These findings provide new ideas for exploring materials with intrinsic STEs to achieve novel high&#8208;performance photodetector applications.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Tunable Enhancement of Piezoelectricity in a Novel Molecular Multiferroic Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This is the first strain engineering in molecular ionic multiferroics. Under a strain of 2.0%, a tenfold increase in piezoelectric performance and a significant reduction of 50% in the ferroelectric coercive field are observed, which unveils a novel strategy to augment the performance of molecular multiferroics.








Abstract
Multiferroics are appealing because of application potentials in data storage devices, sensors, transducers, and energy harvesters. Molecular multiferroics emerge as a promising alternative to inorganic multiferroics due to flexibility, light weight, low toxicity, solution processing, structural diversity, and chemical tunability. While researches have predominantly focused on perovskite structures, studies on molecular ionic multiferroics remain relatively limited. It is urgent to creatively build a novel platform for studying and developing the coupling and interaction between the stress, electricity, and magnetism. Knowing this, the work focuses on a novel organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid multiferroic N&#8208;ethyl&#8208;N&#8208;(fluoromethyl)&#8208;N&#8208;methylethylammonium tetrabromoferrate (III) showing coexisting magnetic and electric orderings. It undergoes antiferromagnetic, ferroelectric, and ferroelastic transitions. Notably, under a strain of 2.0%, the piezoelectric response increases tenfold, and the coercive field of ferroelectric polarization is reduced by half. The strain&#8208;induced enhancement of piezoelectricity is rarely reported in molecular multiferroics. Density functional theory is employed to predict that the mechanism of the large piezoelectric response under strain engineering is related to the cation rotation and phase switching between the stable phase and an energetically competitive metastable phase. This study creates a new paradigm to develop molecular multiferroics and future microelectronic devices for energy conversion.

         <title>Evidence of Quasi&#8208;Na Metallic Clusters in Sodium Ion Batteries through In Situ X&#8208;Ray Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly defective ultrathin carbon nanosheets&#8208;8 (HDCS&#8208;8) anode uniformly adsorbs Na+ in the high&#8208;voltage slope region, resulting in the formation of small particle hexagonal quasi&#8208;Na metallic clusters. Subsequently, the HDCS&#8208;8 anode transforms the small particle hexagonal systems clusters into large particle orthorhombic systems of quasi&#8208;Na metallic clusters in the low&#8208;voltage region.








Abstract
Carbonaceous materials have been considered the most promising anode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their low cost, good electrical conductivity, and structural stability. The main challenge of carbonaceous anodes prior to their commercialization is low initial coulomb efficiencies, derived from a lack of an efficient technique to reveal a fundamental comprehension of sodium storage mechanisms. Here, the direct observation of quasi&#8208;Na metallic clusters in carbonaceous anodes during cycling through in situ XRD is reported. By means of such a technique, a strong self&#8208;adsorption behavior forming quasi&#8208;Na metallic clusters is detected within a rationally designed highly defective ultrathin carbon nanosheets (HDCS) anode. Such a self&#8208;adsorption and crystalline system transformation mechanism in HDCS brings capacity retention about 100% after 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. This work provides a new principle for designing high&#8208;performance carbon anodes for SIBs.

         <title>Disrupting Intracellular Homeostasis by Copper&#8208;Based Nanoinducer with Multiple Enzyme&#8208;Mimicking Activities to Induce Disulfidptosis&#8208;Enhanced Pyroptosis for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;based nanoinducer (CGBH NNs) aimed to disrupt intracellular metabolism and redox homeostasis for inducing tumor cells disulfidptosis&#8208;enhanced immunogenic pyroptosis. The combination of these two cell death modes could promote the release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns and inflammatory cytokines, reprogramming the immunosuppressive TME and enhancing immune cells infiltration. The evoked robust immune responses helped to suppress tumor progression.








Abstract
Given the crucial role of abnormal homeostasis in tumor cells for maintaining their growth, it may be more efficient with less effort to develop anti&#8208;tumor strategies that target multiple combined mechanisms by disrupting intracellular homeostasis. Here, a copper&#8208;based nanoinducer (CGBH NNs) with multiple enzyme&#8208;like activities is designed and constructed to induce disulfidptosis&#8208;enhanced pyroptosis through disrupting multiple intracellular homeostasis for effective tumor immunotherapy. Within the tumor microenvironment (TME), CGBH NNs can disrupt intracellular glucose homeostasis and inhibit NADPH production, leading to accumulation of cystine, which further blocked the substrate and key enzyme for synthesizing glutathione. Subsequently, through cascade catalytic reactions involving enzyme activities (glutathione peroxidase&#8208;like, glucose oxidase and peroxidase&#8208;like activities), CGBH NNs can produce massive reactive oxygen species&#160;(ROS) and further disrupt intracellular redox homeostasis, resulting in the disulfidptosis&#8208;enhanced pyroptosis. The tumor cells undergoing immunogenic pyroptosis can release various cytosolic contents and inflammatory factors, eliciting robust immune responses by facilitating immune cell infiltration, and reprogramming the immunosuppressive TME. After the combination with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, CGBH NNs can effectively suppress the tumor growth and prolong the survival time of tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This work presents a novel paradigm to trigger disulfidptosis&#8208;enhanced pyroptosis by destroying intracellular homeostasis for anti&#8208;tumor immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;A copper-based nanoinducer (CGBH NNs) aimed to disrupt intracellular metabolism and redox homeostasis for inducing tumor cells disulfidptosis-enhanced immunogenic pyroptosis. The combination of these two cell death modes could promote the release of damage-associated molecular patterns and inflammatory cytokines, reprogramming the immunosuppressive TME and enhancing immune cells infiltration. The evoked robust immune responses helped to suppress tumor progression.

         <title>Enhanced Photosensitizer Wettability via Anchoring Competition of Violet Phosphorus Quantum Dots for Breakthroughs in Photodynamic Film Sterilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel strategy to enhance the wettability of photosensitizers in photodynamic films (VP/Hy&#8208;BC films) by anchoring violet phosphorus quantum dots (VPQDs). This approach effectively boosts the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhances antibacterial efficacy. Computational modeling and experimental findings demonstrate the promising potential of VP/Hy&#8208;BC films for applications in antibacterial packaging.








Abstract
Wettability is important for photodynamic film sterilization since higher wettability enhances the capture of bacteria in contact with photosensitizers. Herein, a small number of violet phosphorus quantum dots (VPQDs) are anchored into hypericin bacterial cellulose films (VP/Hy&#8208;BC films) to improve wettability, reducing the water contact angle from 56.8&#176; to 33.0&#176;. This modification facilitated more effective interactions between the bacteria and photosensitizers, rapidly inactivating 7 log10 CFU/mL of Staphylococcus aureus within 60&#160;min. First&#8208;principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that VPQDs, with their low spatial site resistance, reduced the intermolecular Hy self&#8208;aggregation force. This increased the solvent&#8208;accessible surface area of VP/Hy by &#8776;25.7%, thereby decreasing hydrophobic photosensitizer aggregation. Consequently, more active sites are exposed, remarkably improving the photoelectron transfer efficiency. VP/Hy&#8208;BC demonstrated exceptional efficacy in inhibiting bacterial proliferation; for instance, it extended beef shelf life by up to 10 days. The findings of this study will aid the development of health&#8208;conscious, eco&#8208;friendly, and efficient antimicrobial packaging films.

         <title>Boosting Carrier Transport in Quasi&#8208;2D/3D Perovskite Heterojunction for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite/Organic Tandems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quasi&#8208;2D/3D heterojunction&#8208;based WBG perovskite is constructed to repair the surface defects and weaken the quantum&#8208;well confinement effect. These advances reduce interfacial carrier transport loss, contributing to balanced carrier recombination in the interconnecting layer. The resulting perovskite/organic tandems exhibit record power conversion efficiencies of 25.92% (0.0628&#160;cm2) and 24.63% (1.004&#160;cm2), as well as robust operational stability.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites are continuously in the limelight owing to their applicability in tandem solar cells. The main bottlenecks of WBG perovskites are interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination and carrier transport loss caused by interfacial defects and large energy&#8208;level offsets, which induce additional energy losses when WBG perovskites are stacked with organic solar cells in series because of unbalanced carrier recombination in interconnecting layer (ICL). To solve these issues, 1,3&#8208;propanediammonium iodide (PDADI) is incorporated to form Dion&#8211;Jacobson &#8208;phase quasi&#8208;2D perovskites with mixed high&#8208;n&#8208;values in WBG perovskites. PDADI simultaneously repairs the shallow/deep defects and establishes a Type&#8208;II energy&#8208;level alignment between quasi&#8208;2D/3D and 3D perovskites for rapid carrier extraction. More importantly, the short&#8208;chain diammonium cation in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite with high n&#8208;values results in a short Pb&#8211;I inorganic layer spacing, which enhances the interlayer electronic coupling and weakens the quantum&#8208;well confinement effect that restricts carrier transport. The suppressed transport loss increases the electron concentration in the ICL for balanced carrier recombination. The 0.0628 and 1.004 cm2 perovskite/organic tandems achieve remarkable efficiencies of 25.92% and 24.63%, respectively. The quasi&#8208;2D capping layer can inhibit ion migration, allowing perovskite/organic tandems to show excellent operational stability (T85 &gt;&#160;1000&#160;h).

         <title>Substantially Enhanced Spin Polarization in Epitaxial CrTe2 Quantum Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A firm and clear picture of the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin texture indeed gives direct evidence of the intrinsic effective spin polarization of CrTe2. Atomic&#8208;layer&#8208;dependent spin&#8208;resolved measurements show a significantly enhanced spin polarization in a 3 ML CrTe2 film, opens up an exciting opportunity to investigate exotic spin physics in 2D limit.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) magnets, which extend to the monolayer (ML) limit, are rapidly gaining prominence in logic applications for low&#8208;power electronics. To improve the performance of spintronic devices, such as vdW magnetic tunnel junctions, a large effective spin polarization of valence electrons is highly desired. Despite its considerable significance, direct probe of spin polarization in these 2D magnets has not been extensively explored. Here, using 2D vdW ferromagnet of CrTe2 as a prototype, the spin degrees of freedom in the thin films are directly probed using Mott polarimetry. The electronic band of 50 ML CrTe2 thin film, spanning the Brillouin zone, exhibits pronounced spin&#8208;splitting with polarization peaking at 7.9% along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction. Surprisingly, atomic&#8208;layer&#8208;dependent spin&#8208;resolved measurements show a significantly enhanced spin polarization in a 3 ML CrTe2 film, achieving 23.4% polarization even in the absence of an external magnetic field. The demonstrated correlation between spin polarization and film thickness highlights the pivotal influence of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, interlayer interactions, and itinerant behavior on these properties, as corroborated by theoretical analysis. This groundbreaking experimental verification of intrinsic effective spin polarization in CrTe2 ultrathin films marks a significant advance in establishing 2D ferromagnetic atomic layers as a promising platform for innovative vdW&#8208;based spintronic devices.

         <title>Intratumoral Injectable Redox&#8208;Responsive Immune Niche Improves the Abscopal Effect in Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intratumoral injectable nanofiber&#8208;based tumor immune niche (TIN) is engineered with redox&#8208;responsive IL&#8208;2 nanogels (NGs), &#945;&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 NGs, and poly(I:C). The TIN converts X&#8208;ray radiotherapy (XRT)&#8208;treated tumor into in situ cancer vaccine by expanding neoantigen&#8208;specific tumor&#8208;infiltrating lymphocytes at the treated primary tumor site, thereby eliciting robust systemic anticancer activity.








Abstract
Radiotherapy (XRT) is often utilized to improve the immune checkpoint blockade response in cancer management. Such combination treatment can enhance the abscopal effect, facilitating a prolonged and durable systemic response. However, despite intense research efforts, only a minority of patients respond to this approach, and novel strategies to increase the abscopal effect are urgently needed. Here, the development of an intratumoral (i.t.) injectable nanofiber (NF)&#8208;based tumor immune niche (TIN) that converts XRT&#8208;treated tumors into an in situ cancer vaccine, eliciting robust systemic antitumor immunity, is reported.

Additionally, it is functionalized with polyinosinic&#8208;polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) to promote antigen&#8208;presenting cell maturation and prime neoantigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells. In vitro studies demonstrate TIN's ability to prime antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells and increase antigen&#8208;specific cell&#8208;killing efficiency under in vitro immunosuppressive conditions. In vivo studies confirm TIN's ability to elicit robust systemic anticancer activity in mouse melanoma and colorectal cancer models without inducing severe immune&#8208;related adverse events.

&lt;p&gt;An intratumoral injectable nanofiber-based tumor immune niche (TIN) is engineered with redox-responsive IL-2 nanogels (NGs), &#945;-CTLA-4 NGs, and poly(I:C). The TIN converts X-ray radiotherapy (XRT)-treated tumor into in situ cancer vaccine by expanding neoantigen-specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes at the treated primary tumor site, thereby eliciting robust systemic anticancer activity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiotherapy (XRT) is often utilized to improve the immune checkpoint blockade response in cancer management. Such combination treatment can enhance the abscopal effect, facilitating a prolonged and durable systemic response. However, despite intense research efforts, only a minority of patients respond to this approach, and novel strategies to increase the abscopal effect are urgently needed. Here, the development of an intratumoral (i.t.) injectable nanofiber (NF)-based tumor immune niche (TIN) that converts XRT-treated tumors into an in situ cancer vaccine, eliciting robust systemic antitumor immunity, is reported. This NF-based immune niche incorporates redox-degradable anti-CTLA-4 (&#945;-CTLA-4) nanogels (NGs) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) NGs for controlled release in hypoxic irradiated tumors, reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment into a pro-inflammatory microenvironment, and expanding the tumor-infiltrating CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell population. Additionally, it is functionalized with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) to promote antigen-presenting cell maturation and prime neoantigen-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. In vitro studies demonstrate TIN's ability to prime antigen-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and increase antigen-specific cell-killing efficiency under in vitro immunosuppressive conditions.

         <title>Wearable Haptics for Orthotropic Actuation Based on Perpendicularly Nested Auxetic SMA Knotting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wearable haptics for orthotropic actuation (WHOA) can be used for teleoperation of drones and robots with directional sensory perception in 3D space. The perpendicularly nested auxetic pattern with parylene coating provide orthotopically decoupled tactile feedback and wearable multimodal haptics.








Abstract
Smart wearable tactile systems, designed to deliver different types of touch feedback on human skin, can significantly improve engagement through diverse actuation patterns in virtual or augmented reality environments. Here, a perpendicularly nested auxetic wearable haptic interface is reported for orthotropically decoupled multimodal actuation (WHOA), capable of producing diverse tactile feedback modes with 3D sensory perception. WHOA incorporates shape memory alloy wires that are intricately knotted into an auxetic structure oriented along orthotropic dual axes. Its perpendicularly nested auxetic structure enables orthotropic actuation, allowing independent expansion and contraction along both x and y&#8208;axes, as confirmed by force&#8208;strain and displacement&#8208;time performance tests. Additionally, the perylene coating provides orthogonal electrical isolation to WHOA, allowing for stripe&#8208;specific localized actuation and enabling multiple tactile feedback modes. As an orthotropic wearable haptic interface, WHOA distinguishes between x&#8208;axis and y&#8208;axis directions and ultimately delivers multi&#8208;dimensional information regarding movements in 3D space through tactile feedback. As a result, when worn on the foot or arm, WHOA naturally delivers spatiotemporal tactile information to the user, facilitating navigation and teleoperation with 3D sensory perception.

         <title>Biomimetic Structural Hydrogels Reinforced by Gradient Twisted Plywood Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structural design of natural structural hydrogels in crustacean exoskeletons, this work presents a synergistic approach for constructing hierarchical structural hydrogels with gradient twisted plywood structure. The structural hydrogels achieve an unprecedented combination of ultrahigh strength, modulus, and toughness, coupled with recorded high fatigue threshold, superior impact resistance, and programmable shape morphing capability.








Abstract
Naturally structural hydrogels such as crustacean exoskeletons possess a remarkable combination of seemingly contradictory properties: high strength, modulus, and toughness coupled with exceptional fatigue resistance, owing to their hierarchical structures across multiple length scales. However, replicating these unique mechanical properties in synthetic hydrogels remains a significant challenge. This work presents a synergistic approach for constructing hierarchical structural hydrogels by employing cholesteric liquid crystal self&#8208;assembly followed by nanocrystalline engineering. The resulting hydrogels exhibit a long&#8208;range ordered gradient twisted plywood structure with high crystallinity to mimic the design of crustacean exoskeletons. Consequently, the structural hydrogels achieve an unprecedented combination of ultrahigh strength (46&#160;&#177;&#160;3&#160;MPa), modulus (496&#160;&#177;&#160;25&#160;MPa), and toughness (170&#160;&#177;&#160;14&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), together with recorded high fatigue threshold (32.5&#160;kJ m&#8722;2) and superior impact resistance (48&#160;&#177;&#160;2&#160;kJ m&#8722;1). Additionally, through controlling geometry and compositional gradients of the hierarchical structures, a programmable shape morphing process allows for the fabrication of complex 3D hydrogels. This study not only offers valuable insights into advanced design strategies applicable to a broad range of promising hierarchical materials, but also pave the ways for load&#8208;bearing applications in tissue engineering, wearable devices, and soft robotics.

This study introduces a novel single&#8208;step proximity vapor transfer technique to develop large, transparent neuromorphic devices using van der Waals materials.

Abstract
Neuromorphic computing, which involves the creation of artificial synapses capable of mimicking biological brain activity, has intrigued researchers in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). To advance neuromorphic computing, a highly efficient 2D material&#8208;based artificial synapse capable of performing logical and arithmetic operations must be developed. However, fabricating large, uniform films or high&#8208;quality structures of 2D materials remains challenging because of their multistep and complex fabrication processes. In the present study, to produce large (&#216; &#8776; 3 in.), uniform, transparent neuromorphic devices, a novel single&#8208;step approach called proximity vapor transfer (PVT) that utilizes van der Waals (vdW) materials is employed. This single&#8208;step technique, which involves the fabrication of vdW materials on various substrates (glass, ITO, AZO, Mo, and Cu), allows control of the thickness and bandgap tunability. The Schottky device developed via the PVT method using vdW SnS with neurotransmitter (acetylcholine)&#8208;like functionality emulates biological synapses and exhibits photoelectronic synaptic behavior with wide&#8208;field&#8208;of&#8208;view synaptic plasticity. In addition, logic gate operations (NOT, OR, AND), reward&#8208;cascade neurotransmission, and imaging can be performed using 3 &#215; 3 arrays of the device. This study represents a significant step toward the development of transparent and large&#8208;area synaptic devices, which are crucial for advancing AI applications.

         <title>Albumin&#8208;Chaperoned Deep&#8208;NIR Triarylmethane Dyes for High&#8208;Contrast In Vivo Imaging and Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIR&#8208;phototherapy necessitates bright, stable, biocompatible fluorophores absorbing/emitting beyond 800 nm. Molecular engineering guidelines are established that brightness may be improved via rigidification, stability via steric shielding, and biocompatibility via the installation of multiple water&#8208;soluble groups. Nevertheless, the resulting fluorochromic scaffold is expected to be synthetically challenging. BSA&#8208;chaperoning of a structurally flexible deep NIR&#8208;absorbing dye is a feasible solution to the problem.








Abstract
Fluorophores absorbing/emitting in the deep near&#8208;infrared (deep NIR) spectral region, that is, 800 nm and beyond, hold great promise for in vivo bioimaging, diagnosis, and phototherapy due to deeper tissue penetration. The bottleneck is the lack of bright, stable, and readily synthesized deep NIR fluorophores. Here, it is reported that the albumin&#8208;chaperon strategy is a viable one&#8208;for&#8208;all strategy to address these difficulties. A focused library of deep&#8208;NIR absorbing dyes (EA5) is easily synthesized via a two&#8208;step cascade. They are neither very stable nor bright in phosphate buffer&#160;due to a propeller&#8208;type flexible scaffold. Through screening, EA5_c3 is found to exhibit a high affinity toward bovine serum albumin (BSA). Binding&#8208;associated structural rigidification resulted in a gigantic 26&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement. The albumin chaperone also greatly improved the stability of EA5_c3 by shielding the bisbenzannulated triarylmethane core from nucleophilic or oxidative species. The resulting EA5_c3@BSA exhibits high biocompatibility. It offered high&#8208;resolution vasculature, lymph systems, tumors, and other tissue imaging with its bright deep NIR emission. At the same time, it exhibits prominent potential in photoacoustic imaging and photothermal treatment of subcutaneous and orthotopic breast tumors. These findings provide insights into robust and high&#8208;performance fluorophores with deep NIR regions for theranostic against aggressive cancers.

&lt;p&gt;Fluorophores absorbing/emitting in the deep near-infrared (deep NIR) spectral region, that is, 800 nm and beyond, hold great promise for in vivo bioimaging, diagnosis, and phototherapy due to deeper tissue penetration. The bottleneck is the lack of bright, stable, and readily synthesized deep NIR fluorophores. Here, it is reported that the albumin-chaperon strategy is a viable one-for-all strategy to address these difficulties. A focused library of deep-NIR absorbing dyes (&lt;b&gt;EA5&lt;/b&gt;) is easily synthesized via a two-step cascade. They are neither very stable nor bright in phosphate buffer&#160;due to a propeller-type flexible scaffold. Through screening, &lt;b&gt;EA5_c3&lt;/b&gt; is found to exhibit a high affinity toward bovine serum albumin (BSA). Binding-associated structural rigidification resulted in a gigantic 26-fold fluorescence enhancement. The albumin chaperone also greatly improved the stability of &lt;b&gt;EA5_c3&lt;/b&gt; by shielding the bisbenzannulated triarylmethane core from nucleophilic or oxidative species. The resulting &lt;b&gt;EA5_c3@BSA&lt;/b&gt; exhibits high biocompatibility. It offered high-resolution vasculature, lymph systems, tumors, and other tissue imaging with its bright deep NIR emission. At the same time, it exhibits prominent potential in photoacoustic imaging and photothermal treatment of subcutaneous and orthotopic breast tumors. These findings provide insights into robust and high-performance fluorophores with deep NIR regions for theranostic against aggressive cancers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting the Structural and Electrochemical Stability of Chloride&#8208;Ion&#8208;Conducting Perovskite Solid Electrolytes by Alkali Ion Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali ion doping is proposed to endow the CsSnCl3 solid electrolyte with a robust cubic structure against broad temperature variations at 213&#8722;473 K or a high relative humidity of 90%. Mild annealing further modifies the microstructure, resulting in a two fold increase in chloride ion conductivity and impressive electrochemical stability in various solid&#8208;state chloride ion batteries.








Abstract
The use of chloride&#8208;based solid electrolytes derived from Lewis acid&#8210;base reactions enables the construction of various new rechargeable batteries, such as chloride ion batteries (CIBs). However, a critical problem with these electrolytes is their poor stability under low&#8208;temperature, moist, or electrochemical conditions, which can lead to deterioration of the phase structure and a loss of ion conduction. Herein, the robust cubic structure of tin&#8208;based perovskite chloride&#8212;a chloride ion conductor&#8212;is achieved by alkali ion doping at the tin site via direct mechanical milling. The as&#8208;prepared cubic CsSn0.925Na0.075Cl2.925 (CSNC) electrolyte exhibits outstanding structural stability over a broad temperature range of 213&#8722;473 K or under a high relative humidity of up to 90%, at which the typical chloride electrolytes previously reported deteriorate because of moisture. Importantly, mild annealing can modify the microstructure of the CSNC, resulting in a two fold increase in ionic conductivity and an increase in electrochemical stability, which is superior to those of other chloride electrolytes reported in previous studies. The effective chloride&#8208;ion transfer and wide electrochemical window of the CSNC are further demonstrated in different solid&#8208;state CIBs.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Bipolar Covalent Organic Framework Cathode for Advanced Sodium&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neoteric strategy is put forward using a redox&#8208;bipolar covalent organic framework cathode constructed from aniline&#8208;fused quinonoid units to explore the ion co&#8208;storage characteristics in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. With this delicate structure and special storage mode, the resultant cathode shows impressive electrochemical properties at a wide temperature range, and all&#8208;organic sodium ion batteries also showcase the possibility of practical applications.








Abstract
Redox&#8208;active covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising candidates for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the construction of redox&#8208;bipolar COFs with the anions and cations co&#8208;storage feature for SIBs is rarely reported. Herein, redox&#8208;bipolar COF constructed from aniline&#8208;fused quinonoid units (TPAD&#8208;COF)&#160;is developed as the cathode material in SIBs for the first time. The unique integration of conductive aniline skeletons and quinone redox centers endows TPAD&#8208;COF with high ionic/electrical conductivity, abundant redox&#8208;active sites, and fascinating bipolar features. Consequently, the elaborately tailored TPAD&#8208;COF cathode exhibits higher specific capacity (186.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) and superior cycling performance (over 2000 cycles at 1.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 with 0.015% decay rate per cycle). Impressively, TPAD&#8208;COF also displays a high specific capacity of 101&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 even at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. As a proof of concept, all&#8208;organic SIBs (AOSIBs) are assembled using TPAD&#8208;COF cathode and disodium terephthalate anode, which also show impressive electrochemical properties, indicating the potential application of TPAD&#8208;COF cathode in AOSIBs. The work will pave the avenue toward advanced COFs cathode for rechargeable batteries through rational molecular design.

         <title>Regulating the Local Spin States in Spinel Oxides to Promote the Activity of Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study regulates the local spin states by incorporating Ni into Co3O4 and explores their impact on activity in Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. High spin Ni ions facilitate electron transfer from the catalyst to the unoccupied orbitals of CO2, providing sufficient active sites for the nucleation and growth of small Li2CO3 crystals, thereby improving reversibility.








Abstract
Due to the high energy barrier, slow reaction kinetics, and complex reaction environments of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries, the development of durable and efficient catalysts is essential. Transition metal oxides are promising for their availability, stability, and 3d electronic features, with spin states playing an important role in CO2 activation. In this study, the local spin states are regulated by incorporating Ni into Co3O4 and its impact on activity in Li&#8208;CO2 batteries is explored. The results show that Ni atoms with high spin states in Ni0.1Co2.9O4 facilitate electron transfer from the catalyst to the unoccupied orbitals of CO2, providing sufficient active sites for the nucleation and growth of small Li2CO3 crystals. These small crystals have a low decomposition barrier, leading to improved battery efficiency. Therefore, Ni0.1Co2.9O4 shows superior catalytic performance with an overpotential of 0.72&#160;V and an energy efficiency of &#8776;70% after 500&#160;h. This work provides insights into the relationship between spin states and CO2 reactions, highlighting a promising avenue for developing high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Observation of Highly Spin&#8208;Polarized Dangling Bond Surface States in Rare&#8208;Earth Pnictide Tellurides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique type of surface states in a family of ternary rare&#8208;earth pnictide tellurides with robust band structure and sizeable spin splitting is realized. Spin ARPES measurements reveal high spin polarization and distinct spin&#8208;momentum locking texture, arising from local site asymmetry and surface&#8208;purified spin&#8208;orbital texture. This work presents an intriguing spin&#8208;orbital&#8208;momentum&#8208;layer locking phenomenon, shedding lights on potential spintronic applications.








Abstract
To generate and manipulate spin&#8208;polarized electronic states in solids are crucial for modern spintronics. The textbook routes employ quantum well states or Shockley/topological type surface states whose spin degeneracy is lifted by strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking at the surface/interface. The resultant spin polarization is usually truncated because of the intertwining between multiple orbitals. Here a unique type of surface states is realized, namely, dangling bond surface states in a family of ternary rare&#8208;earth pnictide tellurides RePnTe (Re = La, Gd, Ce; Pn = Sb, Bi), with robust band structure and sizeable spin splitting. Spin and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal high spin polarization and distinct spin&#8208;momentum locking texture, which, according to the theoretical analysis, arise from local site asymmetry and surface&#8208;purified spin&#8208;orbital texture. The work extends the so&#8208;called &#8220;hidden spin polarization&#8221; from the bulk to the surface, presenting an intriguing spin&#8208;orbital&#8208;momentum&#8208;layer locking phenomenon, which may shed lights on potential spintronic applications.

The work extends the so-called &#8220;hidden spin polarization&#8221; from the bulk to the surface, presenting an intriguing spin-orbital-momentum-layer locking phenomenon, which may shed lights on potential spintronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vacancies Engineering in Molybdenum Boride MBene Nanosheets to Activate Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The experimental realization of 2D Mo&#8208;vacancy molybdenum boride (Mo4/3B2) MBene nanosheets is demonstrated with intrinsic room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic character by selectively etching bulk MAB phase (Mo2/3Y1/3)2AlB2. The Mo4/3B2 nanosheets show robust intrinsic ferromagnetic properties with a saturation magnetic moment of 0.044&#160;emu&#160;g&#8722;1 at 300&#160;K.








Abstract
The rapid development of low energy dissipation spintronic devices has stimulated the search for air&#8208;stable 2D nanomaterials possessing room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism. Here the experimental realization of 2D Mo4/3B2 nanosheets is reported with intrinsic room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic characteristics by vacancy engineering. These nanosheets are synthesized by etching the bulk MAB phase (Mo2/3Y1/3)2AlB2 into Mo4/3B2 nanosheets in ZnCl2 molten salt. The Mo4/3B2 nanosheets show robust intrinsic ferromagnetic properties, with a saturation magnetic moment of 0.044&#160;emu&#160;g&#8722;1 at 300&#160;K, while vacancy&#8208;free MoB MBene exhibits paramagnetism. It is elucidated that the Mo&#8208;vacancy defect generates large density of states near the Fermi surface and spontaneously spin&#8208;split bands through first&#8208;principles calculations, which contributes to the non&#8208;zero magnetic moment in Mo4/3B2 nanosheets. This work lays the groundwork for activating the magnetic properties of MBene nanosheets by vacancy engineering, offering the possibilities for development of practical spintronic devices.

         <title>Ultrahigh Energy Storage of Twisted Structures in Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using machine learning, a variety of PU&#8208;based polymers are forecasted and successfully synthesized two with a high dielectric constant (K) and thermal stability. Combining these with PI via hydrogen bonds to form twisted HNP, both K and Eb are improved. Impressively, HNP&#8208;20% reaches an Ud of 6.42 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and an efficiency exceeding 90% at 200&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics possess outstanding advantages for high&#8208;power energy storage applications such as high breakdown strength (Eb) and efficiency (&#951;), while both of them decrease rapidly at elevated temperatures. Although several strategies have been evaluated to enhance Eb and heat resistance, the discharged energy density (Ud) is still limited by the planar conjugated structure. In this study, a novel approach to manipulate polymer morphology is introduced, thereby influencing dielectric properties. A range of polyurea (PU)&#8208;based polymers are predicted from different structural unit combinations by machine learning and synthesized two representative polymers with high dielectric constants (K) and thermal stability. These polymers are combined with PI to form a twisted polymer via hydrogen bonding interactions (HNP). Both experimental results and computational simulations demonstrate the twisted structure disrupts the conjugated structure to widen the bandgap and increase dipole moment through the twisting of polar groups, leading to simultaneous improvements in both K and Eb. Consequently, HNP&#8208;20% achieves an ultrahigh Ud of 6.42 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 with an efficiency exceeding 90% at 200 &#176;C. This work opens a new avenue to scalable high Ud all&#8208;polymer dielectric for high&#8208;temperature applications.

         <title>Chiral Nematic Graphene Films with a mesoporous Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel chiral&#8208;template&#8208;directed chemical vapor deposition method is presented for the precise fabrication of chiral nematic graphene film, which exhibits uniform Na plating without dendrite formation and noteworthy thickness&#8208;dependent electromagnetic shielding performance. This work paves the way for creating a large family of chiral nematic materials in various applications of photoelectric conversion, energy storage, electromagnetism, and separation.








Abstract
Ordering a crucial material like pure&#8208;graphene into the chiral nematic structure can potentially revolutionize the fields of photonics, chiral separation, and energy storage. However, the controlled fabrication of highly ordered graphene films with a long&#8208;range chiral nematic mesoporous structure is very challenging and as such, has not been achieved. Here, a chiral&#8208;template&#8208;directed chemical vapor deposition growth strategy is presented for the precise fabrication of mesoporous chiral nematic graphene films by using nanocrystalline cellulose as templates. It is evidenced that such graphene films possess the left&#8208;hand helical ordering, chiral nematic mesoporous structure with adjustable pore sizes (6.4&#8211;13.1&#160;nm), tailored pitch, excellent electrical conductivity (556 S cm&#8722;1), high specific surface area (1508 m2&#160;g&#8722;1) and mechanical flexibility. By coating Na anode with this film, uniform Na plating is achieved with no dendrite formation, resulting from its unique chiral nematic structure and tunable physicochemical properties. The films also achieved impressive thickness&#8208;dependent electromagnetic shielding, i.e., 35&#8211;63&#160;dB, demonstrating their potentially multi&#8208;disciplinary applications.

         <title>Carboxylic Acid&#8208;Functionalized Cellulose Hydrogel Electrolyte for Dual&#8208;Interface Stabilization in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique one&#8208;gel&#8208;for&#8208;two&#8208;electrodes strategy is developed to simultaneously solve the challenges at both anode and cathode interfaces in aqueous zinc batteries. By constructing a carboxylic acid&#8208;functionalized cellulose hydrogel electrolyte, the solvation structure of Zn2+ at Zn anode and the unfavored deposition of byproducts at phenazine cathode can be effectively regulated, thus enabling the dendrite&#8208;free and side reaction&#8208;suppressed aqueous zinc batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) are considered one of the most promising candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, achieving a stable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface remains a challenge for developing high&#8208;performance AZBs. Herein, taking the Zn||phenazine (PNZ) system as a prototype, where the proton uptake/removal mechanism dominates in the cathode, a carboxylic acid&#8208;functionalized cellulose hydrogel electrolyte is designed to simultaneously solve the issues at both the anode and cathode interfaces. Specifically, the hydrogel electrolyte can not only regulate Zn2+ ions at the Zn anode side but also supply H+ ions at the PNZ cathode side to avoid the unfavored deposition of zinc sulfate hydroxides. Benefiting from the unique one&#8208;gel&#8208;for&#8208;two&#8208;electrodes strategy, the dendrite&#8208;free and side reaction&#8208;suppressed aqueous Zn||PNZ cells are developed with a high specific capacity (311 mAh g&#8722;1, 99% utilization of the theoretical capacity) and a long cycle life (over 1500 cycles within 2 months). This study proposes a facile and low&#8208;cost electrolyte strategy for stabilizing AZBs.

         <title>Greatly Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell and Zn&#8208;Air Battery via Hole Inner Edge Reconstruction of 2D Pd Nanomesh</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A widespread hole inner edge reconstruction (HIER) phenomenon as overstretched outermost crystal facets is revealed in Pd nanomeshes prepared through a facile gram&#8208;scale room&#8208;temperature reduction method. Contributed by the HIER phenomenon, a tremendous improvement in the electrocatalytic activity is identified, which significantly improved the anion exchange membrane fuel cells and Zn&#8208;air batteries assembled with Pd NM/C cathode catalyst.








Abstract
Platinum group metals (PGM) have yet to be the most active catalysts in various sustainable energy reactions. Their high cost, however, has made maximizing the activity and minimizing the dosage become an urgent priority for the practical applications of emerging technologies. Herein, a novel 2D&#160;Pd nanomesh structure possessing hole inner reconstructed edges (HIER) with exposed high energy facets and overstretched lattice parameters is fabricated through a facile room&#8208;temperature reduction method at gram&#8208;scale yields. The HIER enhances the catalytic performance of Pd in electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), achieving superior mass activity (MA) of 2.672 A mgPd&#8722;1, which is 27.8 fold and 23.6 fold higher, respectively, than those of the commercial Pt/C (0.096 A mgPt&#8722;1) and Pd/C (0.113 A mgPd&#8722;1) at 0.9 VRHE. Most significantly, in H2&#8208;air anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) and Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB) applications, this unique Pd catalyst delivers a much&#8208;outperformed peak power density of 0.86 and 0.22&#160;W cm&#8722;2, respectively, compared with 0.54 and 0.13&#160;W cm&#8722;2 of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, indicating a novel pathway in electrocatalyst designs through HIER engineering.

         <title>Unlocking the Trade&#8208;off Between Intrinsic and Interfacial Thermal Transport of Boron Nitride Nanosheets by Surface Functionalization for Advanced Thermal Interface Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlocking the trade&#8208;off between the intrinsic and interfacial thermal transport of hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) within thermal interface material. The surface functionalization maintains the intrinsic high thermal conductivity of BNNS while significantly increasing binding energy between micro/nano interfaces in BNNS&#8208;based TIMs, effectively reducing interfacial thermal resistance of BNNS joint interfaces and interfaces between BNNSs and the matrix.








Abstract
The increasing computing power of AI presents a major challenge for high&#8208;power chip solution and heat dissipation. Boron nitride nanosheet&#8208;based thermal interface materials (BNNS&#8208;based TIMs) exhibit excellent electrical insulation property, ensuring the secure and stable operation of chips. However, the efficiency of micro/nano interfacial thermal transport is limited, impeding further enhancements in the thermal conductivity (TC) of BNNS&#8208;based TIMs. Here, a strategy of surface functionalization is reported to unlock the trade&#8208;off between the intrinsic and interfacial thermal transport of BNNS within TIMs. These results suggest that the surface functionalization maintains the intrinsic high TC of BNNS while significantly increasing binding energy between micro/nano interfaces in BNNS&#8208;based TIMs, effectively reducing interfacial thermal resistance of BNNS joint interfaces and interfaces between BNNSs and the matrix by 50% and 26.1%, respectively. The BNNS&#8208;based TIMs exhibit excellent TC (&#8776;21&#8211;25&#160;W/(m&#183;K)) and ultralow Young's modulus, which can promote the development of flexible high&#8208;performance chip cooling technology in the AI industry.

         <title>Synergetic Modulation of Electronic Properties of Cobalt Oxide via &#8220;Tb&#8221; Single Atom for Uphill Urea and Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen (H2) production via water electrolysis benefits from switching the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The topologically doped rare&#8208;earth single atom &#8216;Tb&#8217; on defective Co3O4 (TbSA@d&#8208;Co3O4) achieves superior UOR performance. The catalyst achieves 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 current density at 1.27&#160;V, &#8722;35&#160;mV, and 1.22&#160;V for UOR, H2 evolution reaction, and Bifunctional UOR electrolyzer, respectively with remarkable stability.








Abstract
Exploring single&#8208;atom (SA) catalysts in hybrid urea&#8208;assisted water electrolysis offers a viable alternative to both Hydrogen (H2) generation and polluted water treatment. However, the unfavorable electronic stabilization, low SA content, intrinsically slow kinetics, and imbalanced adsorption&#8208;desorption steps are the bottleneck for its scale&#8208;up implementation. Herein, a rare&#8208;earth Terbium single atom (TbSA) is topologically stabilized on defect&#8208;rich Co3O4 (TbSA@d&#8208;Co3O4) by Tb&#9472;O co&#8208;ordination for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and H2 evolution reaction (HER). Benefitting from the strong TbSA interaction with the d&#8208;Co3O4, the TbSA@d&#8208;Co3O4 achieves a 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 current density at 1.27&#160;V and &#8722;35&#160;mV for UOR and HER, respectively. Remarkably, when TbSA@d&#8208;Co3O4 is applied as a bi&#8208;functional catalyst in a two&#8208;electrode system, it merely requires 1.22&#160;V to acquire 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with excellent operational stability for 100 h. The hybrid electrolyzer can be successfully empowered by the triboelectric nanogenerator, AA battery, and solar panel with a nominal potential of 1.5&#160;V. The mechanistic investigation predicts &#8220;TbSA&#8221; insertion in d&#8208;Co3O4 lowered the potential determining step, attributed to balanced reaction energetics for adsorption&#8208;desorption of intermediates and favorable charge transfer characteristics for UOR. This work offers a new paradigm to explore the catalytic properties of rare&#8208;earth &#8220;f&#8208;block&#8221; elements to create advanced electrocatalysts via structural modulation.

         <title>Reversible Configurations of 3&#8208;Coordinate and 4&#8208;Coordinate Boron Stabilize Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni Cathodes with Superior Cycling Stability for Practical Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>

This work demonstrates a Li2SiO3&#8208;coated Li(Ni0.95Co0.04Mn0.01)0.99B0.01O2 ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathode, delivering a high reversible capacity and superior cycling stability. This is the first time to realize the real B&#8208;doping, which exists in terms of 3&#8208;coordinate and 4&#8208;coordinate configurations with high electrochemical reversibility during de&#8208;/lithiation, greatly stabilizing oxygen anions and impeding Ni&#8208;ion migration with high structure stability and rapid Li&#8208;ion diffusion.








Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni layered oxide cathodes are the leading candidate for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries owing to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and ultrahigh capacity. However, the increased Ni content causes larger volume variations and worse lattice oxygen stability during cycling, resulting in capacity attenuation and kinetics hysteresis. Herein, a Li2SiO3&#8208;coated Li(Ni0.95Co0.04Mn0.01)0.99B0.01O2 ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathode that well&#8208;addresses all the above issues, which is also the first time to realize the real doping of B ions is demonstrated. The as&#8208;obtained cathode delivers a reversible capacity of up to 237.4 mAh g&#8722;1 (924 Wh kg&#8722;1cathode) and a superior capacity retention of 84.2% after 500 cycles at 1C in pouch&#8208;type full&#8208;cells. Advanced characterizations and calculations verify that the boron&#8208;doping is existed in terms of 3&#8208;coordinate and 4&#8208;coordinate configurations and their high electrochemical reversibility during de&#8208;/lithiation, which greatly stabilizes oxygen anions and impedes Ni&#8208;ion migration to Li layer. Furthermore, the B&#8208;doping engineers the primary particle microstructure for better relaxing the lattice strain and accelerating Li&#8208;ion diffusion. This work advances the energy density of cathode materials into the domain of above 900&#8201;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, and the concept will inspire more intensive study on ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes.

&lt;p&gt;This work demonstrates a Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-coated Li(Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.95&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.04&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.01&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;0.99&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;0.01&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ultrahigh-Ni cathode, delivering a high reversible capacity and superior cycling stability. This is the first time to realize the real B-doping, which exists in terms of 3-coordinate and 4-coordinate configurations with high electrochemical reversibility during de-/lithiation, greatly stabilizing oxygen anions and impeding Ni-ion migration with high structure stability and rapid Li-ion diffusion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrahigh-Ni layered oxide cathodes are the leading candidate for next-generation high-energy Li-ion batteries owing to their cost-effectiveness and ultrahigh capacity. However, the increased Ni content causes larger volume variations and worse lattice oxygen stability during cycling, resulting in capacity attenuation and kinetics hysteresis. Herein, a Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-coated Li(Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.95&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.04&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.01&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;0.99&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;0.01&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ultrahigh-Ni cathode that well-addresses all the above issues, which is also the first time to realize the real doping of B ions is demonstrated. The as-obtained cathode delivers a reversible capacity of up to 237.4 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (924 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cathode&lt;/sub&gt;) and a superior capacity retention of 84.2% after 500 cycles at 1C in pouch-type full-cells. Advanced characterizations and calculations verify that the boron-doping is existed in terms of 3-coordinate and 4-coordinate configurations and their high electrochemical reversibility during de-/lithiation, which greatly stabilizes oxygen anions and impedes Ni-ion migration to Li layer. Furthermore, the B-doping engineers the primary particle microstructure for better relaxing the lattice strain and accelerating Li-ion diffusion. This work advances the energy density of cathode materials into the domain of above 900&#8201;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the concept will inspire more intensive study on ultrahigh-Ni cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable and Thermally Superinsulating Polyhexahydrotriazine Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simple one&#8208;step synthesis of closed&#8208;loop recyclable PHT aerogels is presented, which are made from commercially available aromatic amines and PFA. These PHT aerogels display thermal superinsulation, pronounced thermal stability, great mechanical performance, and intrinsic hydrophobicity. Furthermore, PHT aerogels can be depolymerized under acidic aqueous conditions, allowing the monomers to be reused to prepare fresh aerogels.








Abstract
Organic aerogels are an advanced class of materials renowned for their ultralow thermal conductivity and highly porous architecture, making them ideal for applications in thermal insulation, catalysis, and chemical absorption. However, these polymeric networks pose environmental concerns as their permanently crosslinked scaffold makes recycling back to the original monomers virtually impossible. To tackle this issue and develop next&#8208;generation organic aerogel, a set of polyhexahydrotriazine (PHT)&#160;aerogels specifically designed for closed&#8208;loop chemical recycling are prepared. Remarkably, these innovative materials can selectively be synthesized in a one&#8208;step condensation reaction using commercially available aromatic amines. They showcase outstanding thermally insulating performance, along with strong mechanical performance, pronounced thermal stability, and intrinsic hydrophobicity, all achieved without the need for additional modifications. More importantly, these aerogels exhibit quantitative depolymerization under acidic aqueous conditions, achieving high yields and purities of the recovered monomers. The successful preparation of fresh organic aerogels from recycled monomers with nearly identical material properties underscores the efficiency and reliability of this recycling process. The facile one&#8208;step synthesis process, combined with the high&#8208;performance properties and excellent recyclability of these PHT aerogels, accelerates the advancement of sustainable thermally superinsulating materials.

         <title>Anomalously High Apparent Young's Modulus of Ultrathin Freestanding PZT Films Revealed by Machine Learning Empowered Nanoindentation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neural network machine learning model is developed to accurately determine the Young's modulus, pretension, and thickness of freestanding films from nanoindentation force&#8211;displacement curves, with which anomalously high Young's modulus is discovered of ultrathin PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) film as large as 229.4 &#177; 12.1 GPa. The enhancement is attributed to flexoelectric effect, and the corresponding flexoelectric coefficient is estimated to be &#8776; 200 nC&#160;m&#8722;1.








Abstract
The mechanical properties at small length scales are not only significant for understanding the intriguing size&#8208;dependent behaviors but also critical for device applications. Nanoindentation via atomic force microscopy is widely used for small&#8208;scale mechanical testing, yet determining the Young's modulus of quasi&#8208;2D films from freestanding force&#8211;displacement curve of nanoindentation remains challenging, complicated by both bending and stretching that are highly nonlinear. To overcome these difficulties, a machine learning model is developed based on the back propagation (BP) neural network and finite element training to accurately determine the Young's modulus, pretension, and thickness of freestanding films from nanoindentation force&#8211;displacement curves simultaneously, improving the computational efficiency by two orders of magnitude over conventional brute force curve fitting. Using this technique, anomalously high apparent Young's modulus is discovered of 2.8&#160;nm thick PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) film as large as 229.4&#160;&#177;&#160;12.1&#160;GPa, much higher than the bulk value. The enhancement can be attributed to the strain gradient&#8208;induced flexoelectric effect, and the corresponding flexoelectric coefficient is estimated to be &#8776;200&#160;nC&#160;m&#8722;1. The method is developed to enable an artificial intelligence (AI) system to study the mechanical properties of a wide range of low&#8208;dimensional materials.

         <title>Engineered Biomimetic Cancer Cell Membrane Nanosystems Trigger Gas&#8208;Immunometabolic Therapy for Spinal&#8208;Metastasized Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitric oxide (NO) generated by MP@AL&#8208;mediated gas&#8208;immunometabolic therapy inhibited tumor cell respiration, on the one hand, to ensure the continuation of the lactate depletion response and reverse tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment, and on the other hand, NO&#8208;induced tumor immunogenic cell death, synergistically stimulating the immune response and amplifying the efficacy of immunotherapy.








Abstract
Despite great progress in enhancing tumor immunogenicity, conventional gas therapy cannot effectively reverse the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME), limiting immunotherapy. The development of therapeutic gases that are tumor microenvironment responsive and efficiently reverse the TIME for precisely targeted tumor gas&#8208;immunometabolic therapy remains a great challenge. In this study, a novel cancer cell membrane&#8208;encapsulated pH&#8208;responsive nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing biomimetic nanosystem (MP@AL) is prepared. Lactate oxidase (Lox) in MP@AL consumed oxygen to promote the decomposition of lactate, a metabolic by&#8208;product of tumor glycolysis, and the generation of H2O2, while L&#8208;arginine (L&#8208;Arg) in MP@AL is oxidized by H2O2 to generate nitric oxide (NO). For one thing, NO led to mitochondrial dysfunction in tumor cells to reduce oxygen consumption and promote the efficiency of Lox in lactate decomposition, thus reversing lactate&#8208;induced TIME; for another, NO effectively triggered immunogenic cell death, activated anti&#8208;tumor immune response and long&#8208;term immune memory, and ensured a favorable effect in the synergistic interaction with PD&#8208;L1 antibody for inhibiting tumor growth and recurrence. Therefore, a novel gas&#8208;immunometabolic therapy dual closed&#8208;loop nanosystem for enhancing tumor immunogenicity and remodeling lactate&#8208;induced TIME is established. Overall, this work will provide new ideas for gas therapy to effectively remodel the TIME to enhance cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Congruent Glass Composite Scintillator for Efficient High&#8208;Energy Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The congruent glass composite scintillator with good processing capability&#160;and high scintillation light yield is constructed, which solves the problem of poor preparation and processing properties of scintillation single crystal and ceramic. The constructed glass composite scintillator is further verified in applications such as X&#8208;ray imaging and real&#8208;time radiation detection of fibers. These findings not only represent a novel design concept for the development of glass composite but also suggest a great step for expanding the scope of scintillators.








Abstract
The scintillator is the most crucial component in the high&#8208;energy ray detection system. The available scintillators suffer from the insurmountable drawbacks including poor shaping ability for single crystal and ceramic and low efficiency for glass. Here, a glass composite scintillator is proposed from a congruent crystallization system which possesses both excellent processability and high scintillating yield. It can be fabricated into diverse shapes and sizes including the bulk and tiny fiber. Benefitting from the unique compositing combination with a high crystallization ratio, the glass composite exhibits a giant scintillating light yield of &#8776;26,000 photons per MeV. The practical application for X&#8208;ray imaging is demonstrated and a high spatial resolution of 12 l&#160;p&#160;mm&#8722;1 is achieved. Furthermore, the fiber derived detector is built and the remote and micro&#8208;area detection is realized. These findings not only represent a novel design concept for the development of glass composite but also suggest a great step for expanding the scope of scintillators.

The constructed glass composite scintillator is further verified in applications such as X-ray imaging and real-time radiation detection of fibers. These findings not only represent a novel design concept for the development of glass composite but also suggest a great step for expanding the scope of scintillators.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scintillator is the most crucial component in the high-energy ray detection system. The available scintillators suffer from the insurmountable drawbacks including poor shaping ability for single crystal and ceramic and low efficiency for glass. Here, a glass composite scintillator is proposed from a congruent crystallization system which possesses both excellent processability and high scintillating yield. It can be fabricated into diverse shapes and sizes including the bulk and tiny fiber. Benefitting from the unique compositing combination with a high crystallization ratio, the glass composite exhibits a giant scintillating light yield of &#8776;26,000 photons per MeV. The practical application for X-ray imaging is demonstrated and a high spatial resolution of 12 l&#160;p&#160;mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved. Furthermore, the fiber derived detector is built and the remote and micro-area detection is realized. These findings not only represent a novel design concept for the development of glass composite but also suggest a great step for expanding the scope of scintillators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Transition Metal Network via Orbital Population Design Stabilizes Lattice Oxygen Redox in Stoichiometric Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ordered transition metal (TM) network is crucial for the activity and reversibility of lattice oxygen in batteries. A t2g orbital population rule is proposed to guide the design of ordered TM networks, supported by calculated structures and the synthesized ordered TM oxides reported. This work establishes a promising pathway for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes by controlling TM ordering.








Abstract
Li&#8208;ion batteries employing stoichiometric layered Li metal oxides as cathodes are now reaching the energy density limits due to single cationic redox chemistry. Lattice oxygen redox (LOR) has been discovered in these materials, as a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density paradigm observed in Li&#8208;rich materials. Nevertheless, the origin of this process is not understood, preventing the rational design of better cathode materials. Here, employing stoichiometric Ni&#8208;based cathodes, it is demonstrated that LOR originates from a dynamic transition metal (TM) network caused by ion migration during the electrochemical process. This network is confirmed to be ribbon through both ex&#8208; and in&#8208;situ STEM observations, facilitating reversible LOR. Finally, a t2g orbital population rule is proposed to guide the design of ordered TM networks, supported by calculated structures and the synthesized ordered TM oxides reported. This work explains the mechanism of LOR in stoichiometric layered cathode materials, and sets a promising direction for the design of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes through the regulation of TM ordering.

         <title>Superhydrophobicity With Self&#8208;Adaptive Water Pressure Resistance and Adhesion of Pistia Stratiotes Leaf</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pistia stratiotes leaf exhibits superhydrophobicity with high water pressure resistance and low adhesion, attributed to its self&#8208;adaptive deformable microstructure with unique re&#8208;entrant features. Under pressure, these microstructures deform to increase the solid&#8208;liquid contact area, enhancing water pressure resistance. The re&#8208;entrant features elevate the deformation threshold, enabling an effective adaptive response.








Abstract
Superhydrophobic surfaces are promising for optimizing amphibious aircraft by minimizing water drag and adhesion. Achieving this involves ensuring these surfaces can resist high liquid pressure caused by deep water and fluid flow. Maximizing the solid&#8208;liquid contact area is a common strategy to improve liquid pressure resistance. However, this approach inevitably increases solid&#8208;liquid adhesion, making it challenging to guarantee a trade&#8208;off between the two wetting characteristics. Here, it is found that the Pistia stratiotes leaf exhibits superhydrophobicity with high water pressure resistance and low adhesion, attributed to its self&#8208;adaptive deformable microstructure with unique re&#8208;entrant features. Under pressure, these microstructures deform to increase the solid&#8208;liquid contact area, thereby enhancing water pressure resistance. The re&#8208;entrant features elevate the deformation threshold, enabling higher modulus microstructures to achieve adaptive response. This facilitates the recovery of deformed microstructures, restoring the air layer and maintaining low adhesion. Following these concepts, Pistia stratiotes leaf&#8208;inspired surfaces are fabricated, achieving an 183% improvement in water impact resistance and an &#8776;80% reduction in adhesion after overpressure compared to conventional superhydrophobic surfaces. The design principles inspired by Pistia stratiotes promise significant advancements in amphibious aircraft and other trans&#8208;media vehicles.

         <title>In&#8208;Device Ballistic&#8208;Electron&#8208;Emission Spectroscopy for Accurately In Situ Mapping Energy Level Alignment at Metal&#8211;Organic Semiconductors Interface</title>

         <dc:description>
A precise in situ method&#8212;employing in&#8208;device ballistic&#8208;electron&#8208;emission spectroscopy with hot&#8208;electron transistor configuration&#8212;is presented for detecting energy barriers at metal/organic semiconductor interfaces, achieving an accuracy of &#177;0.03&#160;eV. This technique is applicable to n&#8208;type, p&#8208;type and ambipolar semiconductors and can detect subtle barrier changes caused by film treatment processes, providing a reliable tool for organic electronics.








Abstract
Energy level alignment at metal/organic semiconductors (OSCs) interface governs electronic processes in organic electronics devices, making its precise determination essential for understanding carrier transport behaviors and optimizing device performance. However, it is proven that accurately characterizing the energy barrier at metal/OSC interface under operational conditions remains challenging due to the technical limitations of traditional methods. Herein, through integrating highly&#8208;improved device constructions with an ingenious derivative&#8208;assisted data processing method, this study demonstrates an in&#8208;device ballistic&#8208;electron&#8208;emission spectroscopy using hot&#8208;electron transistors to accurately characterize the energy barrier at metal/OSC interface under in&#8208;operando conditions. This technique is found that a remarkable improvement in measurement accuracy, reaching up to &#177;0.03&#160;eV, can be achieved&#8212;surpassing previous techniques (&#177;0.1&#8211;0.2&#160;eV). The high accuracy allows us to monitor subtle changes in energy barriers at metal/OSC interface caused by variations in the aggregation state of OSCs, a phenomenon that is theoretically possible but failed to be directly demonstrated through conventional methods. Moreover, this study makes demonstration that this technology is universally applicable to various metal/OSC interfaces consisting of electron&#8208;transporting, hole&#8208;transporting, and ambipolar OSCs. These findings manifest the great potential of this method to advance both theoretical exploration and technical applications in organic electronics.

         <title>In Situ Encapsulation of Atomically Precise Nanoclusters in Reticular Frameworks via Mechanochemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical synthesis approach to encapsulate atomically precise nanoclusters (APNCs) in reticular frameworks in a controlled manner is proposed. This method significantly broadens the range of APNC@framework composites, facilitating the on&#8208;demand construction and regulation of component&#8208;specific nanocomposites.








Abstract
The combination of atomically precise nanoclusters (APNCs) and reticular frameworks is promising for generating component&#8208;specific nanocomposites with emergent properties. However, traditional liquid&#8208;phase synthesis often hampers this potential by damaging APNCs and limiting combination diversity. Here, mechanochemical synthesis to explore the encapsulation of diverse oil&#8208; and water&#8208;soluble APNCs within various reticular frameworks is employed, establishing a database of 21 unique APNC&#8722;framework combinations, including metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent&#8722;organic frameworks (COFs), hydrogen&#8722;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), and multivariate MOFs. These framework coatings not only spatially immobilize APNCs but also secure their structures, preventing aggregation and degradation while enhancing stability and activity. Encapsulating Au25 in HOFs resulted in a remarkable 315&#8208;fold increase in catalytic activity compared to Au25 homogeneous catalyst, highlighting the framework's crucial role in catalytic enhancement. The mechanochemical synthesis strategy facilitates tailored support screening, catering to specific needs, and shows promise for developing multifunctional systems, including enzyme&#8722;APNC@frameworks material for cascade reactions.

         <title>Three&#8208;Level Chirality Transfer and Amplification in Liquid Crystal Supramolecular Assembly for Achieving Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;level chirality transfer and amplification from point chirality of small molecules to helical chirality of helical polymers and finally to supramolecular chirality of cholesteric liquid crystals consisting of chiral nonfluorescent polymers and nematic liquid crystals is constructed. Full&#8208;color and white CPL are realized via further introducing achiral fluorophores. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting security, information encryption, and chiral logic gate applications are developed.








Abstract
Chiral liquid crystal supramolecular assembly provides an ideal strategy for constructing excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. However, the chirality transfer in chiral liquid crystals normally occurs at two levels from the configurational chirality to the supramolecular phase chirality. The more precise and more levels of chirality transmission are fascinating but remain challenging. The present work reports the first success of three&#8208;level chirality transfer and amplification from configurationally point chirality of small molecules to conformationally helical chirality of helical polymers and finally to supramolecular phase chirality of cholesteric liquid crystals composed of chiral nonfluorescent polymers (P46) and nematic liquid crystals. Noticeably, the helical twisting power of P46 is five&#8208;fold larger than its monomer. Full&#8208;color and white CPL with maximum luminescence dissymmetry factor up to 1.54 and photoluminescence quantum yield up to 63.8% are realized utilizing helical supramolecular assembly combined with selective reflection mechanism. Also significantly, the electrically stimuli&#8208;responsive CPL switching device as well as anti&#8208;counterfeiting security, information encryption, and chiral logic gate applications are developed. This study deepens the understanding of chirality transfer and amplification across different hierarchical levels.

         <title>Augmenting Protein Degradation Capacity of PROTAC through Energy Metabolism Regulation and Targeted Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is presented to augment the protein degradation capability of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) by modulating external nutrient supply and employing nanocarrier&#8208;based targeted delivery. The results demonstrate that a reduction in nutrient supply can enhance protein metabolism and significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of PROTACs when combined with nanocarriers.








Abstract
The ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system (UPS) is responsible for degrading over 70&#8211;80% of cellular proteins. Consequently, proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are developed to induce the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of proteins of interest (POIs) by the UPS. To amplify the therapeutic efficacy of PROTACs, energy metabolism regulation is first harnessed to boost UPS function in tumor cells. Proteomic and ubiquitinome analyzes reveal that total ubiquitinated proteins and proteasome activity are significantly increased in 143B and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 tumor cells following fasting&#8208;mimicking diet (FMD) treatment. As a result, the degradation efficiency of PROTACs targeting focal adhesion kinase (FAK&#8208;P) or bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4&#8208;P) is significantly enhanced in FMD&#8208;treated 143B and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 tumor cells. Then, silica&#8208;coated iron oxide nanoparticles are developed modified with tumor cell membranes for targeted delivery of PROTACs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorescence imaging confirm that nanocarriers significantly improve the delivery efficiency of PROTACs in FMD&#8208;treated 143B or MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 tumors. In vivo studies demonstrate that the antitumor efficacy of FAK&#8208;P and BRD4&#8208;P is greatly augmented when combined with targeted delivery and FMD treatment. Overall, this study presents a strategy to enhance the efficacy of PROTACs in cancer therapy.

         <title>Durable Organic Coating&#8208;Free Superhydrophobic Metal Surface by Paracrystalline State Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic coating&#8208;free durable self&#8208;superhydrophobic metal surface is achieved by a strategy of femtosecond laser element doping microstructuring on Al alloys followed by repetitive low&#8208;temperature annealing in this work. This novel design, which endows the metal surface with properties of unique air storage nanostructures, low free energy, and high chemical stability, can effectively avoid disadvantages of traditional sticking organic modifiers to long&#8208;termly keep the extreme water repellency.








Abstract
The chemical instability of traditional organically&#8208;decorated superhydrophobic metal surfaces is a significant issue, severely limiting practical applications. This is due to the susceptibility of low surface energy coatings to ion permeation, decomposition, and exfoliation, especially in harsh environments. Here, organic coating&#8208;free, durable superhydrophobic surfaces on Al alloys by developing the paracrystalline state of a bionic anthill tribe structure is successfully achieved, using femtosecond laser element&#8208;doping microstructuring followed by repetitive annealing processes. Remarkably, the inherent superhydrophobic properties of the sample are maintained for &#8776;2000 h in a corrosive 3.5 wt.% NaCl aqueous solution, significantly surpassing the performance of traditional organic coatings. Moreover, this inherent superhydrophobicity remains nearly unchanged, even after rigorous electrochemical reaction measurements. Additional tests involving UV irradiation (&gt;100 h), freezing cycles (&gt;100 cycles), and acid/alkali resistance (&gt;65 h) further demonstrate that the environmental adaptability of the surface far exceeds that of silane&#8208;coated surfaces. Ab initio calculations reveal that the formation of the paracrystalline state reduces surface energy and enhances chemical stability, thereby extending the durability of the superhydrophobic metal. These findings offer a powerful strategy for utilizing atomic&#8208;level structural rearrangements to design inherent superhydrophobic surfaces without the need for organic coatings.

         <title>A Synergistically Enhanced Triboelectric&#8208;Electromagnetic Hybrid Generator Enabled by Multifunctional Amorphous Alloy for Highly Efficient Self&#8208;Powered System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating multifunctional Fe72Si8B20 into the hybrid generator not only increases the output current and current retention of TENG by 28.75% and 85.24%, respectively, but also boosts the output power of EMG by 51.05%. Additionally, the variable impedance system effectively utilizes the output characteristics of TENG and EMG, resulting in a 198% improvement in energy utilization efficiency compared to conventional constant impendence systems.








Abstract
Triboelectric&#8208;electromagnetic hybrid generator (TEHG) has emerged as an effective technology for mechanical energy harvesting. However, the independent operation of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and electromagnetic generator (EMG), along with tribo&#8208;materials wear and magnetic field divergence, constrain the device's overall performance. To address these challenges, a synergistically enhanced TEHG (SE&#8208;TEHG) is proposed based on the multifunctional amorphous alloy. Following detailed material analyses, Fe72Si8B20 is selected as the synergistic layer for its low surface roughness, high Vickers&#8208;hardness, amorphous structure, and high magnetization. Compared to Al, this material not only boosts TENG's output current and current retention rate by 28.75% and 85.24%, but also improves EMG's output power by 51.05%. In constructing a self&#8208;powered system with TEHG, a significant impedance discrepancy exists between the energy harvester (with matched impendence of 16 M&#937; for TENG and 110 k&#937; for EMG) and the application end. Without power management circuits, the demonstrated self&#8208;powered variable impedance system achieves an energy utilization efficiency that is 2.98 times greater than the conventional constant impedance system. The integration of multifunctional materials to realize strong&#8208;coupling hybrid generators, combined with the customization of variable impedance systems, set a milestone in efficient mechanical energy harvesting and utilization.

         <title>Mesoporous Acridinium&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework for Long&#8208;lived Charge&#8208;Separated Exciton Mediated Photocatalytic [4+2] Annulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Acridinium&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COFs) featuring systematic trap states is designed to generate charge&#8208;separated excitons with enhanced lifetime. Large 4&#160;nm&#8208;sized mesoporous channels and ultra&#8208;stable excitons resulted in the COF functioning as an efficient heterogeneous photocatalyst toward Diels&#8208;Alder type oxidative [4+2] annulation with a million times enhanced interfacial charge dissipation response.








Abstract
Readily tuneable porosity and redox properties of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) result in highly customizable photocatalysts featuring extended electronic delocalization.

&lt;p&gt;An Acridinium-based covalent organic framework (COFs) featuring systematic trap states is designed to generate charge-separated excitons with enhanced lifetime. Large 4&#160;nm-sized mesoporous channels and ultra-stable excitons resulted in the COF functioning as an efficient heterogeneous photocatalyst toward Diels-Alder type oxidative [4+2] annulation with a million times enhanced interfacial charge dissipation response.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readily tuneable porosity and redox properties of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) result in highly customizable photocatalysts featuring extended electronic delocalization. However, fast charge recombination in COFs severely limits their photocatalytic activities. Herein a new mode of COF photocatalyst design strategy to introduce systematic trap states is programmed, which aids the formation and stabilization of long-lived charge-separated excitons. Installing cationic acridinium functionality in a pristine electron-rich triphenylamine COF via postsynthetic modification resulted in a semiconducting photocatalytic donor&#8211;acceptor dyad network that performed rapid and efficient oxidative Diels-Alder type [4+2] annulation of styrenes and alkynes to fused aromatic compounds under the atmospheric condition in good to excellent yields.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Doped Facet&#8208;Selective Copper Nanowires for Activating CO&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research reports a nickel&#8208;doped copper nanowire catalyst for highly selective ethanol production from CO electroreduction. The theoretical calculations and operando spectroelectrochemical investigations cooperatively demonstrate that nickel&#8208;doping onto copper surface can regulate the interfacial water structure and water dissociation kinetics, which significantly influences the hydrogenation kinetics of a key C2 intermediate (*CHCOH), and thus leading to a high selectivity switch from ethylene to ethanol.








Abstract
Ethanol isa promising energy vector for closing the anthropogenic carbon cycle through reversible electrochemical redox. Currently, ethanol electrosynthesissuffers from low product selectivity due to the competitive advantage of ethylene in CO2/CO electroreduction. Here, a facet&#8208;selective metal&#8208;doping strategy is reported, tuning the reaction kinetics of CO reduction paths and thus enhancing the ethanol selectivity. The theoretical calculations reveal that nickel (Ni)doped Cu(100) surface facilitates water dissociation to form adsorbed hydrogen, which promotesselective electrochemical hydrogenation of a key C2 intermediate (*CHCOH) toward ethanol path over ethylene path. Experimentally, a solution&#8208;phase synthesis of a Ni&#8208;doped {100}&#8208;dominated Copper nanowires (Cu NWs) catalyst is reported, enabling an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 56% and a selectivity ratio of ethanol to ethylene of 2.7, which are &#8776;4 and 15 times larger than those of undoped Cu NWs, respectively. The operando spectroscopic characterizations&#160;confirm that Ni&#8208;doping in Cu NWs can alter the interfacial water activity and thus regulate the C2 product selectivity. With further electrode engineering, a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer using Ni&#8208;doped Cu NWs catalysts demonstrates an ethanol Faradaic efficiency over 50% at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a full cell voltage of &#8776;2.7&#160;V and operates stably for over 300 h.

         <title>Piezoelectric Heterojunctions as Bacteria&#8208;Killing Bone&#8208;Regenerative Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiO2/Bi2WO6 piezoelectric heterojunctions with engineered oxygen vacancies, interfacial built&#8208;in electric fields and piezoelectric properties are constructed as bone implants. The heterojunctions achieve highly efficient and dynamic antimicrobial functions through near infrared (NIR)&#8208;triggered photothermal and photodynamic therapies. Meanwhile, the mechanical forces of the stem cells grown on the implants trigger the heterojunctions to produce electric fields in situ, significantly promoting osteogenesis.








Abstract
Heterojunctions are widely used in energy conversion, environmental remediation, and photodetection, but have not been fully explored in regenerative medicine. In particular, piezoelectric heterojunctions have never been examined in tissue regeneration. Here the development of piezoelectric heterojunctions is shown to promote bone regeneration while eradicating pathogenic bacteria through light&#8208;cellular force&#8208;electric coupling. Specifically, an array of heterojunctions (TiO2/Bi2WO6), made of piezoelectric nanocrystals (Bi2WO6) decorating TiO2 nanowires, is fabricated as a biocompatible implant. Upon exposure to near&#8208;infrared light, the piezoelectric heterojunctions generate reactive oxygen species and heat to kill bacteria through photodynamic and photothermal therapy, respectively. Meanwhile, the mechanical forces of the stem cells grown on the implant trigger the heterojunctions to produce electric fields that further promote osteogenesis to achieve osteointegration. The heterojunctions effectively suppress postoperative recurrent infections while promoting osseointegration through the local electric fields induced by cells. Therefore, the piezoelectric heterojunctions represent a promising antibacterial tissue&#8208;regenerative implant.

         <title>Opto&#8208;Electrical Decoupled Phototransistor for Starlight Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study develops a heterojunction&#8208;gated field&#8208;effect transistor (HGFET) based on an opto&#8208;electric decoupling mechanism, designed to suppress noise and enhance sensitivity, enabling starlight detection. The infrared HGFET detector demonstrates a detectivity exceeding 1014 Jones at 1300 nm, with a detectable radiation intensity as low as 0.46 nW&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a maximum speed in tens of microseconds, showing great potential for high&#8208;resolution, cost&#8208;effective passive night vision imaging sensors.








Abstract
Highly sensitive shortwave infrared (SWIR) detectors are essential for detecting weak radiation (typically below 10&#8722;8 W&#183;Sr&#8722;1&#183;cm&#8722;2&#183;&#181;m&#8722;1) with high&#8208;end passive image sensors. However, mainstream SWIR detection based on epitaxial photodiodes cannot effectively detect ultraweak infrared radiation due to the lack of inherent gain. Here, we develop a heterojunction&#8208;gated field&#8208;effect transistor (HGFET) consisting of a colloidal quantum dot (CQD)&#8208;based p&#8208;i&#8208;n heterojunction and a carbon nanotube (CNT) field&#8208;effect transistor, which achieves a high inherent gain based on an opto&#8208;electric decoupling mechanism for suppressing noise. The stacked heterojunction absorbs infrared radiation and separates electron&#8211;hole pairs. Then, the generated photovoltage tunes the drain current of the CNT FET through an Y2O3 gate insulator. As a result, the HGFET significantly detects and amplifies SWIR signals with a high inherent gain while minimally amplifying noise, leading to a recorded specific detectivity above 1014&#8201;Jones at 1300&#160;nm and a recorded maximum gain&#8208;bandwidth product of 69.2 THz. Direct comparative testing indicates that the HGFET can detect weak infrared radiation at 0.46 nW&#160;cm&#8722;2 levels; thus, compared to commercial and reported SWIR detectors, this detector is much more sensitive and enables starlight detection or vision. As the fabrication process is very compatible with CMOS readout integrated circuits, the HGFET is a promising SWIR detector for realizing passive night vision imaging sensors with high resolutions that are high&#8208;end, highly sensitive, and inexpensive.

         <title>Balanced Miscibility and Crystallinity by 2D Acceptors Enabled Halogen&#8208;Free Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells to Achieve 19.28% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linear and branch side chains on chemical structures lead to the unique crystal structures of the elliptical and rectangular frameworks, respectively. The difference in intermolecular interaction significantly impacts the self&#8208;aggregation tendency and compatibility with a guest acceptor. It found that excessive crystallinity with great self&#8208;aggregation negatively affected molecular packing, while a moderate crystalline collaborated well with the guest acceptor and achieved a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency of 19.28% based on scalable and stable halogen&#8208;free solvent&#8208;processed organic solar cells.








Abstract
Two highly crystalline 2D acceptors, ATIC&#8208;C11 and ATIC&#8208;BO, with acenaphthene&#8208;expanded quinoxaline central cores, have been demonstrated with very different characteristics in ternary organic solar cells (OSCs). The difference in side chains induces their distinctive molecular packing mode and unique crystal structure, in which ATIC&#8208;C11 displays a 3D structure with an elliptical framework, and ATIC&#8208;BO gives a rectangular framework. Their high crystallinity contributes to organized molecular packing in ternary devices, thus low energetic disorder and suppressed energy loss. Through the analysis of morphology and carrier kinetics, it is found that ATIC&#8208;BO's strong self&#8208;aggregation and immiscibility induce large aggregates and severely impede charge transfer (CT) and dissociation. Conversely, ATIC&#8208;C11's suitable crystallinity and compatibility positively regulate the crystalline kinetics during film formation, thus forming much&#8208;ordered molecular packing and favorable phase separation size in blend films. As a result, ATIC&#8208;C11&#8208;based ternary devices achieve a high efficiency of 19.28% with potential in scalability and stability, which is the top&#8208;ranking efficiency among nonhalogenated solvent&#8208;processed OSCs. This work not only displays highly efficient and stable halogen&#8208;free solvent&#8208;processed organic photovoltaics (OPVs), but also offers a new thought for material design and selection rule on the third component in highly efficient ternary OSCs.

&lt;p&gt;Linear and branch side chains on chemical structures lead to the unique crystal structures of the elliptical and rectangular frameworks, respectively. The difference in intermolecular interaction significantly impacts the self-aggregation tendency and compatibility with a guest acceptor. It found that excessive crystallinity with great self-aggregation negatively affected molecular packing, while a moderate crystalline collaborated well with the guest acceptor and achieved a state-of-the-art efficiency of 19.28% based on scalable and stable halogen-free solvent-processed organic solar cells.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fabrication of Ultrathin Ferroelectric Al0.7Sc0.3N Films under Complementary&#8208;Metal&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Semiconductor Compatible Conditions by using HfN0.4 Electrode</title>

         <dc:description>
Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN), an innovative material for ferroelectric memory applications, is scaled down to an ultra&#8208;thin thickness of 3 nm while maintaining compatibility with complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor fabrication standards, marking a notable breakthrough in the field. Moreover, reducing the operating voltage to 4.35 V represents a significant milestone in advancing low&#8208;voltage AlScN&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) has emerged as a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation ferroelectric memories, offering a much higher remanent charge density than other materials with a stable ferroelectric phase. However, the inherently high coercive field requires a substantial decrease in film thickness to lower the operating voltage. Significant leakage currents present a severe challenge during the thickness scaling, especially when maintaining compatibility with complementary&#8208;metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication standards. This study adopts a HfN0.4 bottom electrode, which minimizes lattice mismatch with Al0.7Sc0.3N (ASN), forming a coherent bottom interface that effectively reduces leakage currents even at thickness &lt;&#160;5&#160;nm. CMOS&#8208;compatible HfN0.4/ASN/TiN stack, deposited without vacuum break between each layer, demonstrates exceptional scalability, confirming the ferroelectricity of ASN films at thicknesses down to 3&#160;nm. The coercive voltage is decreased to 4.35&#160;V, significantly advancing low&#8208;voltage AlScN devices that align with CMOS standards.

         <title>Synergistic Modulation of Orientation and Steric Hindrance Induced by Alkyl Chain Length in Ammonium Salt Passivator Toward High&#8208;performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic ammonium salts with varying alkyl chain lengths are used to passivate perovskite surface defects and optimize energy band alignment. Nonylammonium acetate (NAAc) achieves superior passivation through optimal molecular orientation and minimized steric hindrance, leading to 25.79% PCE in inverted PSCs utilizing vacuum flash technology in ambient conditions.









Abstract
Organic ammonium salts are extensively utilized for passivating surface defects in perovskite films to mitigate trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination. However, the influence of alkyl chain length on the molecular orientation and spatial steric hindrance of ammonium salt remains underexplored, hindering advancements in more effective passivators. Here, a series of organic ammonium salts is reported with varying alkyl chain lengths to passivate surface defects and optimize band alignment. It is revealed that long alkyl chains promote parallel molecular orientation on the perovskite surface, thereby reinforcing interaction with surface defects, whereas excessive chain length introduces steric hindrance, weakening anion&#8208;perovskite interactions. Nonylammonium acetate (NAAc) with optimal chain length achieves the ideal balance between chemical interactions, resulting in superior passivation. Through NAAc passivation, high&#8208;performance inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and modules are achieved, with power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 25.79% (certified 25.12%) and 19.62%, respectively. This marks a record PCE for inverted PSCs utilizing vacuum flash technology in ambient conditions. Additionally, the NAAc&#8208;passivated devices retain 91% of their initial PCE after 1200&#160;h of continuous maximum power point operation. This work offers new insights into the interplay between molecular orientation and steric hindrance, advancing the design of high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>Constructing 3D Crosslinked Macromolecular Networks as a Highly Efficient Interface Layer for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 3D macromolecular network consisting of zinc ion&#8208;bonded potato starch (StZ) is constructed as an interface layer for Zn metal anode. The StZ network provides abundant Zn2+ transport channels and facilitates Zn2+ desolvation, enabling dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition while minimizing parasitic reactions. This approach offers an efficient strategy for achieving excellent electrochemical performance in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) are experiencing rapid development due to their high theoretical capacity, abundant zinc resources, and intrinsic safety. However, the progress of AZIBs is hindered by uncontrollable parasitic reactions and excessive dendrite growth, which compromise the durability and effective utilization of zinc metal anodes. To address these challenges, the study has constructed a 3D crosslinked macromolecular network composed of zinc ion&#8208;bonded potato starch (StZ) as an interface layer on Zn foil (StZ&#8208;Zn) to inhibit hydrogen evolution, regulate Zn2+ flux, and ensure uniform Zn deposition. Density functional theory calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, COMSOL Multiphysics simulations, and in situ Raman spectra demonstrate that the 3D StZ interface layer facilitates Zn2+ desolvation by restructuring the solvation shells. This process reduces the concentration of H2O at the anode, thereby inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction. Consequently, Zn2+ transport is more efficient, promoting a homogeneous Zn2+ flux and enabling dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition. As a result, StZ&#8208;Zn||StZ&#8208;Zn symmetric cell delivers a superb lifespan of 4800 h at the current density of 5 mA cm&#8722;2, and the corresponding cumulative capacity is as high as 12000 mAh cm&#8722;2. Notably, StZ&#8208;Zn||NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O full cell can stably operate for 2500 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1 with an outstanding capacity retention of 92%.

         <title>Adaptable Hydrogel with Strong Adhesion of Wet Tissue for Long&#8208;Term Protection of Periodontitis Wound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prime challenge in hydrogel treatment of periodontitis is short retention. An in situ light&#8208;curing hydrogel is designed to achieve long&#8208;term protection of periodontal wounds. A paste precursor is configured to achieve stayability before curing, and rapid light&#8208;curing achieves strong adhesion between hydrogel and tissue. This design concept provides a promising solution for novel long&#8208;lasting oral medical hydrogel dressings.









Abstract
Periodontitis is a severe gum infection characterized by inflammation of the tissues surrounding the teeth. The disease is challenging to manage due to its exposure to a wet and dynamic oral environment, where conventional hydrogels often suffer from weak adhesion, short residence time, and vulnerability to bacterial invasion. In this study, an innovative hydrogel system based on in situ light curing is proposed. The hydrogel precursor, comprising sodium alginate and a calcium ion network, is designed and adhere to the irregular and smooth surfaces of periodontal tissue before curing. Upon light irradiation, a second network polymerizes rapidly, establishing multiple interactions with the tissue, which enhances adhesion strength. Benefited from this engineering strategy, the hydrogel&#160;exhibits a low swelling rate, effectively mitigating adhesion loss in the moist oral environment. Additionally, the hydrogel demonstrates excellent long&#8208;lasting wet adhesion, maintaining its presence in periodontal tissue over 120 hours. It also serves as an effective physical barrier against bacterial invasion, achieving a blocking efficiency of 99.9%.

     alt="Adaptable Hydrogel with Strong Adhesion of Wet Tissue for Long-Term Protection of Periodontitis Wound"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prime challenge in hydrogel treatment of periodontitis is short retention. An in situ light-curing hydrogel is designed to achieve long-term protection of periodontal wounds. A paste precursor is configured to achieve stayability before curing, and rapid light-curing achieves strong adhesion between hydrogel and tissue. This design concept provides a promising solution for novel long-lasting oral medical hydrogel dressings.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Periodontitis is a severe gum infection characterized by inflammation of the tissues surrounding the teeth. The disease is challenging to manage due to its exposure to a wet and dynamic oral environment, where conventional hydrogels often suffer from weak adhesion, short residence time, and vulnerability to bacterial invasion. In this study, an innovative hydrogel system based on in situ light curing is proposed. The hydrogel precursor, comprising sodium alginate and a calcium ion network, is designed and adhere to the irregular and smooth surfaces of periodontal tissue before curing. Upon light irradiation, a second network polymerizes rapidly, establishing multiple interactions with the tissue, which enhances adhesion strength. Benefited from this engineering strategy, the hydrogel&#160;exhibits a low swelling rate, effectively mitigating adhesion loss in the moist oral environment. Additionally, the hydrogel demonstrates excellent long-lasting wet adhesion, maintaining its presence in periodontal tissue over 120 hours. It also serves as an effective physical barrier against bacterial invasion, achieving a blocking efficiency of 99.9%. This novel design concept offers a promising approach for developing advanced medical dressings for periodontitis, providing sustained therapeutic benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multifunctional Biocomposite Materials from Chlorella vulgaris Microalgae</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fabrication and post&#8208;processing technique is introduced to achieve uniform, lightweight, biocomposites based on C. vulgaris through extrusion 3Dprinting. The bioink formulation and dehydration process yield materials with mechanical properties and thermal conductivity comparable to traditional polymer and wood&#8208;based composites. This approach can be adapted to using other microalgae for large&#8208;scale production, in response to increasing global material demand.








Abstract
Extrusion 3D&#8208;printing of biopolymers and natural fiber&#8208;based biocomposites enables the fabrication of complex structures, ranging from implants' scaffolds to eco&#8208;friendly structural materials. However, conventional polymer extrusion requires high energy consumption to reduce viscosity, and natural fiber reinforcement often requires harsh chemical treatments to improve adhesion. We address these challenges by introducing a sustainable framework to fabricate natural biocomposites using Chlorella vulgaris microalgae as the matrix. Through bioink optimization and process refinement, we produced lightweight, multifunctional materials with hierarchical architectures. Infrared spectroscopy analysis reveals that hydrogen bonding plays a critical role in the binding and reinforcement of Chlorella cells by hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC). As water content decreases, the hydrogen bonding network evolves from water&#8208;mediated interactions to direct hydrogen bonds between HEC and Chlorella, enhancing the mechanical properties. A controlled dehydration process maintains continuous microalgae morphology, preventing cracking. The resulting biocomposites exhibit a bending stiffness of 1.6 GPa and isotropic heat transfer and thermal conductivity of 0.10 W/mK at room temperature, demonstrating effective thermal insulation. These characteristics make Chlorella biocomposites promising candidates for applications requiring both structural performance and thermal insulation, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional materials in response to growing environmental demands.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wafer&#8208;scale graphene&#8208;readout silicon&#8208;based microtube photodetectors are designed for Mbps&#8208;level visible light communication reception. The device enable effective photodetection and rapid readout, resulting in a 75&#160;ns response time and 6803&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 responsivity. The photodetector achieves a 140&#176; field of view and dichroic ratio up to 16.09, offering the potential in internet of things and information security.








Abstract
The implementation of an advanced light receiver is imperative for the widespread application of visible light communication. However, the integration of multifunctional and high&#8208;performance visible light receivers is still limited by device structure and system complexity. Herein, a graphene&#8208;readout silicon&#8208;based microtube photodetector is proposed as the receiver for omnidirectional Mbps&#8208;level visible light communication. The integration of graphene&#8208;semiconductor material systems simultaneously ensures the effective absorption of incident light and rapid readout of photogenerated carriers, and the device exhibits an ultrafast response speed of 75&#160;ns and high responsivity of 6803&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1. In addition, the microtube photodetector realizes the omnidirectional light&#8208;trapping and enhanced polarization photodetection. As the receiving end of the visible light communication system, the microtube photodetector achieves a data rate of up to 778&#160;Mbps, a field of view of 140&#176;, and the encrypted visible light communication of polarized light, providing a new possibility for the future development of the internet of things and information security.

         <title>A Pressure&#8208;Sensitive, Repositionable Bioadhesive for Instant, Atraumatic Surgical Application on Internal Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
While ubiquitous in everyday life, pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives (e.g., scotch tape) are limited to dry surfaces. By integrating hydrogels and pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives, a pressure&#8208;sensitive bioadhesive that adheres to internal organs is fabricated. The unique adhesive properties of pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives enable the atraumatic interfacing between surgical equipment and internal tissues for tissue stabilization and fault&#8208;tolerant integration of bioelectronics.








Abstract
Pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives are widely utilized due to their instant and reversible adhesion to various dry substrates. Though offering intuitive and robust attachment of medical devices on skin, currently available clinical pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives do not attach to internal organs, mainly due to the presence of interfacial water on the tissue surface that acts as a barrier to adhesion. In this work, a pressure&#8208;sensitive, repositionable bioadhesive (PSB) that adheres to internal organs by synergistically combining the characteristic viscoelastic properties of pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives and the interfacial behavior of hydrogel bioadhesives, is introduced. Composed of a viscoelastic copolymer, the PSB absorbs interfacial water to enable instant adhesion on wet internal organs, such as the heart and lungs, and removal after use without causing any tissue damage. The PSB's capabilities in diverse on&#8208;demand surgical and analytical scenarios including tissue stabilization of soft organs and the integration of bioelectronic devices in rat and porcine models, are demonstrated.

         <title>Photocatalytic Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Acetylene to Polymer&#8208;Grade Ethylene with Molecular and Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Cobaloximes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel photocatalytic systems based on homogeneous and heterogeneous cobaloximes are reported. By leveraging their hydrogen atom transfer catalytic activity, exquisitely efficient and selective acetylene photocatalytic semi&#8208;hydrogenation is reported. Integrating the cobaloximes in a metal&#8211;organic framework results in more stable and durable catalysis.








Abstract
The semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene&#8208;rich gas streams is a high&#8208;priority industrial chemical reaction for producing polymer&#8208;grade ethylene. Traditional thermocatalytic routes for acetylene reduction to ethylene, despite progress, still require high temperatures and high H2 consumption, possess relatively low selectivity, and use a noble metal catalyst. Light&#8208;powered strategies are starting to emerge, given that they have the potential to use directly the abundant and sustainable solar irradiation, but are ineffective. Here an efficient, &gt;99.9% selective, visible&#8208;light powered, catalytic conversion of acetylene to ethylene is reported. The catalyst is a homogeneous molecular cobaloxime that operates in tandem with a photosensitizer at room temperature and bypasses the use of non&#8208;environmentally friendly and flammable H2 gas feed. The reaction proceeds through a cobalt&#8208;hydride intermediate with &#8776;100% conversion of acetylene under competitive (ethylene co&#8208;feed) conditions after only 50 min, and with no evolution of H2 or over&#8208;hydrogenation to ethane. The cobaloxime is further incorporated as a linker in a metal&#8211;organic framework; the result is a heterogeneous catalyst for the conversion of acetylene under competitive (ethylene co&#8208;feed) conditions that can be recycled up to six times and remains catalytically active for 48 h, before significant loss of performance is observed.

         <title>Unlocking Topological Effects in Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three fully conjugated 2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COFs with distinct topologies are designed and synthesized for efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production. The topological effects play a crucial role in regulating the charge carrier dynamics in COFs. The hxl topology significantly enhances charge separation and transport, achieving an unprecedented 1.41% efficiency for solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic H2O2 production in COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer a compelling platform for the efficient photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Constructed with diverse topologies from various molecular building units, COFs can exhibit unique photocatalytic properties. In this study, three &#960;&#8208;conjugated 2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COFs with distinctly different topologies (hcb, sql, and hxl) are designed to investigate the topological effect on the overall photosynthesis of H2O2 from water and oxygen. Despite their similar chemical and band structures, the QP&#8208;HPTP&#8208;COF with hxl topology outperformed other COFs in the photosynthesis of H2O2, demonstrating a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 1.41%. Comprehensive characterizations confirmed that the hxl topology can substantially improve charge separation and transfer, thereby significantly enhancing photocatalytic performance. This study not only unravels the topology&#8208;directed charge carrier dynamics in COFs but also establishes a molecular engineering framework for developing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for sustainable H2O2 production.

         <title>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)&#8208;Inspired Fully Printed Soft Pressure Sensor Array with Self&#8208;Adaptive Pressurization for Highly Reliable Individualized Long&#8208;Term Pulse Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by pulse diagnosis methods in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), this work reports a self&#8208;adaptive pressure sensing platform (PSP) that combines the fully printed flexible pressure sensor array with an adaptive wristband&#8208;style pressure system to enable 3D reconstruction of the pulse.








Abstract
Reliable, non&#8208;invasive, continuous monitoring of pulse and blood pressure is essential for the prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. However, the pulse wave varies drastically among individuals or even over time in the same individual, presenting significant challenges for the existing pulse sensing systems. Inspired by pulse diagnosis methods in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), this work reports a self&#8208;adaptive pressure sensing platform (PSP) that combines the fully printed flexible pressure sensor array with an adaptive wristband&#8208;style pressure system can identify the optimal pulse signal. Besides the detected pulse rate/width/length, &#8220;Cun, Guan, Chi&#8221; position, and &#8220;floating, moderate, sinking&#8221; pulse features, the PSP combined with a machine learning&#8208;based linear regression model can also accurately predict blood pressure such as systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure values. The developed diagnostic platform is demonstrated for highly reliable long&#8208;term monitoring and analysis of pulse and blood pressure across multiple human subjects over time. The design concept and proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept demonstrations also pave the way for the future developments of flexible sensing devices/systems for adaptive individualized monitoring in the complex practical environments for personalized medicine, along with the support for the development of digital TCM.

         <title>Standing 1D Chains Enable Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Selenium Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substrate&#8208;heating strategy is adopted to facilitate the interfacial bonding between Se and substrate, enabling the growth of Se films with a vertical orientation. The resulting Se films exhibit a 4&#8208;times increase in carrier mobility compared to horizontally&#8208;oriented Se films. Solar cells fabricated using these Se films achieve a record efficiency of 8.1%.








Abstract
The recent surge in tandem solar cells and indoor photovoltaics has renewed interest in selenium (Se), the world's first photovoltaic material, due to its intrinsic wide bandgap of &#8776;1.9&#160;eV, high stability, and non&#8208;toxicity in small quantities when applied in photovoltaics. However, with a 1D chained crystal structure, Se tends to grow crystalline films with a lying orientation&#8212;chains parallel to substrates arising from the low surface energy; this results in poor carrier transport across chains held together by weak van der Waals forces. Here a substrate&#8208;heating strategy that facilitates the interfacial bonding between Se and substrate is introduced, enabling the growth of Se films with a standing orientation&#8212;chains perpendicular to substrates. This achieves efficient carrier transport along covalently bonded chains. The resulting Se films thereby exhibit a fourfold increase in carrier mobility compared to lying&#8208;oriented Se films. Consequently, Se solar cells are achieved with the highest power conversion efficiency of 8.1% under AM1.5G 1&#8208;sun illumination. The unencapsulated devices exhibit negligible efficiency loss after 1&#160;000 h of storage under ambient conditions.

         <title>Transcytosable and Ultrasound&#8208;Activated Liposome Enables Deep Penetration of Biofilm for Surgical Site Infection Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vascular&#8208;cell&#8208;adhesion&#8208;molecule&#8208;1 (VCAM1)&#8208;targeted and ultrasound&#8208;activated liposome (ligand&#8208;modified, perfluoropentane&#8208;encapsulated, and dual Ce6 and OTM&#8208;integrated liposome) is capable of overcoming the biological barriers of vascular endothelial cells and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in biofilm&#8208;associated surgical site infection. VCAM1&#8208;receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis and ultrasonic&#8208;cavitation&#8208;induced EPS collapse consecutively achieve efficient drug accumulation and deep penetration, then lead to potent biofilm eradication.








Abstract
Biofilm&#8208;associated surgical site infection (BSSI) is a common and grievous postoperative complication lacking effective remedies, mainly due to the poor drug accumulation and penetration in the biofilms featured by dense extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs). Here, it is found that the vascular cell adhesion molecule&#8208;1 (VCAM1) is highly overexpressed in the vascular cells of BSSI. It is proposed that the combination of VCAM1&#8208;mediated transcytosis and ultrasonic cavitation can consecutively overcome the biological barriers of vascular endothelial cells and EPS for biofilm eradication. To demonstrate the feasibility, a VCAM1&#8208;targeted and ultrasound (US)&#8208;activated liposome (LPCOTML) loaded with a reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species (ROS)&#8208;responsive lipoid prodrug of oleoyl meropenem, sonosensitizer of lipoid Ce6, and perfluoropentane is developed. LPCOTML can recognize the receptors on vascular cells, and initiate receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis for transendothelial transport into the BSSI periphery. LPCOTML subsequently transforms from nanoparticle into microbubble via liquid&#8211;gas phase transition under US irradiation, triggering strong ultrasonic cavitation to blow up the EPS and deeply penetrate the biofilms. The sonosensitizer Ce6 induces ROS production under US irradiation and triggers the release of meropenem to induce potent antibacterial effect in a BSSI model. This study presents an effective strategy to tackle the biological barriers in BSSI via combining receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis and ultrasonic cavitation.

As a 2D metamaterial, metasurfaces offer an unprecedented avenue to facilitate light&#8208;matter interactions. The current &#8220;one&#8208;by&#8208;one design&#8221; method is hindered by time&#8208;consuming, repeated testing within a confined space. However, intelligent design strategies for metasurfaces, limited by data&#8208;driven properties, have rarely been explored. To address this gap, a data iterative strategy based on deep learning, coupled with a global optimization network is proposed, to achieve the customized design of chiral metasurfaces. This methodology is applied to precisely identify different chiral molecules in a label&#8208;free manner. Fundamentally different from the traditional approach of collecting data purely through simulation, the proposed data generation strategy encompasses the entire design space, which is inaccessible by conventional methods. The dataset quality is significantly improved, with a 21&#8208;fold increase in the number of chiral structures exhibiting the desired circular dichroism (CD) response (&gt;0.6). The method's efficacy is validated by a monolayer structure that is easily prepared, demonstrating advanced sensing abilities for enantiomer&#8208;specific analysis of bio&#8208;samples. These results demonstrate the superior capability of data&#8208;driven schemes in photonic design and the potential of chiral metasurface&#8208;based platforms for calibration&#8208;free biosensing applications. The proposed approach will accelerate the development of complex systems for rapid molecular detection, spectroscopic imaging, and other applications.

         <title>Air&#8208;Processed Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells With Full Lifecycle Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;step air&#8208;processed efficient PSCs with full lifecycle management are effectively realized by the polymer&#8208;stabilized precursor ink. The modified PSCs deliver an impressive efficiency of 25.18% with superior environmental and mechanical stability. The end&#8208;of&#8208;life PSCs with lead leakage suppression and device regeneration will not pose a threat to the environmental and biological safety.








Abstract
Despite the outstanding power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) realized over the years, the entire lifecycle from preparation and operation to discarding of PSCs still needs to be carefully considered when it faces the upcoming large&#8208;scale production and deployment. In this study, bio&#8208;derived chitin&#8208;based polymers are employed to realize the full lifecycle regulation of air&#8208;processed PSCs by forming multiple coordinated and hydrogen bonds to stabilize the lead iodide and organic salt precursor inks, accelerating the solid&#8211;liquid reaction and crystallization of two&#8208;step deposition process, then achieving the high crystalline and oriented perovskites with less notorious charge defects in the open air. The air&#8208;prepared PSCs exhibit a decent efficiency of 25.18% with high preparation reproducibility and improved operational stability toward the harsh environment and mechanical stress stimuli. The modified PSCs display negligible fatigue behavior with keeping 92% of its initial efficiency after operating for 32 diurnal cycles (ISOS&#8208;LC&#8208;1 protocol). Meanwhile, closed&#8208;loop lead management of end&#8208;of&#8208;life PSCs including suppression of lead leakage, toxicity evaluation of broken devices, and recycling of lead iodide components are comprehensively investigated. This work sheds light on a promising avenue to realize the entire lifecycle regulation of air&#8208;processed efficient and stable PSCs.

         <title>Constructing an Active Sulfur&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Rich Surface for Selective *CH3&#8208;CH3 Coupling in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H6 Conversion With 92% Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmonic MoO3&#8208;x significantly lowers the formation energy of sulfur vacancies in ZnIn2S4, resulting in a sulfur&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich surface within the ZnIn2S4/MoO3&#8208;x photocatalyst. This enhances CO2 adsorption and activation, reduces the energy barrier for HCOO* formation, and promotes efficient *CH3&#8208;CH3 coupling. Consequently, the system achieves a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H6 conversion rate of 467.3 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 92.0%.








Abstract
To achieve high selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ products, increasing the number of CO2 adsorption sites and lowering the energy barriers for key intermediates are critical. A ZnIn2S4 (ZIS)/MoO3&#8208;x (Z&#8208;M) photocatalyst is presented, in which plasmonic MoO3&#8208;x generates hot electrons, creating a multielectron environment in ZIS that facilitates efficient C&#9472;C coupling reactions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that MoO3&#8208;x reduces the formation energy of sulfur vacancies (SV) in ZIS, thereby enhancing CO2 adsorption and activation. The SV&#8208;rich surface lowers the energy barrier for forming HCOO* to &#8722;0.33 eV whereas the energy barrier for forming *COOH is 0.77 eV. Successive hydrogenation of HCOO* leads to *CH2, which converts to *CH3 with an energy barrier of &#8722;0.63 eV. The energy barrier for *CH3&#8208;CH3 coupling is 0.54 eV, which is lower than the 0.73 eV for *CH2&#8208;CH2 coupling to form *C2H4. Thus, Z&#8208;M preferentially produces C2H6 over C2H4. Under visible light, Z&#8208;M achieves a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H6 conversion rate of 467.3 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 92.0% selectivity. This work highlights the dual role of plasmonic photocatalysts in enhancing CO2 adsorption and improving C2+ production in CO2 reduction.

Tissue Adhesives
Pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives, such as scotch tape, demonstrate adhesion limited to dry substrates. By integrating the interfacial behavior of hydrogels, Yuhan Lee, Hyunwoo Yuk, Seongjun Park, and co&#8208;workers have synthesized a pressure&#8208;sensitive bioadhesive capable of instant and repositionable adhesion on wet internal organs, such as the lungs. This class of adhesives exhibits potential utility in on&#8208;demand surgical and analytical scenarios, including fault&#8208;tolerant integration of surgical tools and sensors. More details can be found in article number 2407116.

Superhydrophobic Concave Pillar
In article number 2409389, Dong Woog Lee and co&#8208;workers report a stable superhydrophobic surface achieved through a novel concave morphology design. The concave pillar structures enhance resistance to wetting transitions under both impact and hydrostatic pressure. The air trapped in the concavities during water contact plays a crucial role in maintaining stable superhydrophobicity by forming a convex air cap.

Polyhexahydrotriazine Aerogels
In article number 2412502 by &#381;eljko Tomovi&#263; and co&#8208;workers, a simple one&#8208;step synthesis of closed&#8208;loop recyclable polyhexahydrotriazine (PHT) aerogels is presented, which are made from commercially available aromatic amines and paraformaldehyde. These PHT aerogels display thermal superinsulation, pronounced thermal stability, great mechanical performance, and intrinsic hydrophobicity. Furthermore, PHT aerogels can be depolymerized under acidic aqueous conditions, allowing the monomers to be reused to prepare fresh aerogels.

Piezoelectric Heterojunctions
Heterojunctions, made of piezoelectric nanocrystals and nanowires, can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and heat to kill bacteria under the irradiation of near&#8208;infrared light. These heterojunctions produce electric signals under the forces applied by the stem cells grown on them and such electric signals further promote bone formation. Hence, they can not only achieve osteointegration but also eradicate implant&#8208;associated infections. More details can be found in article number 2413171 by Chengyun Ning, Peng Yu, Chuanbin Mao, and co&#8208;workers.

Single&#8208;Pixel Event Photoactive Device
In article number 2406607, Mohit Kumar, Hayoung Park, and Hyungtak Seo introduce a single&#8208;pixel event photoactive device with selective carrier integration that merges spatiotemporal event sensing and built&#8208;in short&#8208;term memory. It processes multibit parallel data and recognizes patterns ultrafast (0.4 &#956;s) with ultralow energy use (25 femtojoules). Adjusting its speed allows trajectory and position detection of events through optical flow sensing.

         <dc:description>
This paper summarizes the development of six milestones of nitrogen reduction to ammonia, and concludes its commonalities and characteristics. Accordingly, the essence of ammonia synthesis is extracted, that is the reaction pathways are influenced by the energy barrier of reaction intrmediates, which can be altered by proton sources, auxiliaries and catalysts, providing design guidance for efficient ammonia synthesis.








Abstract
Ammonia plays a pivotal role in agriculture and meanwhile holds promising potential as an energy vector for the hydrogen economy, where the nitrogen reduction to ammonia is a critical pathway for achieving sustainable development. Over the past hundred years, ammonia synthesis has undergone several breakthrough developments from Haber&#8208;Bosch process to photo/electro&#8208;catalysis and Li&#8208;mediated strategy, but still faces the challenges of low yield rate, selectivity and efficiency. Therefore, there is a pressing demand to develop efficient and green ammonia synthesis from nitrogen. This review summarizes the development of the nitrogen reduction to ammonia, highlighting six milestones during the whole journey. From the development direction, this work finds and extracts the essence of ammonia synthesis, that is the reaction pathways are affected by the energy barrier of reaction intermediates, which can be altered by proton sources, auxiliaries and catalysts. Then this work discusses the detailed overview of the significant development of proton source, auxiliaries and catalysts. Finally, based on the essence, the possible opportunities of ammonia synthesis from nitrogen reduction are presented, including the design of new ammonia synthesis pathways and efficient catalysts. The deep insight of nitrogen reduction to ammonia will provide a design guidance for efficient ammonia synthesis.

         <title>Catalytic Biomaterials&#8208;Activated In Situ Chemical Reactions: Strategic Modulation and Enhanced Disease Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into the modulation of fundamental catalytic reactions, a cornerstone in addressing disease treatment through an interdisciplinary lens. Central to this review's discussion is the regulation of chemical reactions while concurrently accounting for the complex microenvironments of diseases to achieve specificity, efficiency, and control of in situ chemical reactions. It seeks to clarify the mechanisms underpinning catalytic biomaterials activated in situ chemical reactions and evaluate their potential to revolutionize treatment strategies across various pathological conditions.








Abstract
Chemical reactions underpin biological processes, and imbalances in critical biochemical pathways within organisms can lead to the onset of severe diseases. Within this context, the emerging field of &#8220;Nanocatalytic Medicine&#8221; leverages nanomaterials as catalysts to modulate fundamental chemical reactions specific to the microenvironments of diseases. This approach is designed to facilitate the targeted synthesis and localized accumulation of therapeutic agents, thus enhancing treatment efficacy and precision while simultaneously reducing systemic side effects. The effectiveness of these nanocatalytic strategies critically hinges on a profound understanding of chemical kinetics and the intricate interplay of reactions within particular pathological microenvironments to ensure targeted and effective catalytic actions. This review methodically explores in situ catalytic reactions and their associated biomaterials, emphasizing regulatory strategies that control therapeutic responses. Furthermore, the discussion encapsulates the crucial elements&#8208;reactants, catalysts, and reaction conditions/environments&#8208;necessary for optimizing the thermodynamics and kinetics of these reactions, while rigorously addressing both the biochemical and biophysical dimensions of the disease microenvironments to enhance therapeutic outcomes. It seeks to clarify the mechanisms underpinning catalytic biomaterials and evaluate their potential to revolutionize treatment strategies across various pathological conditions.

         <title>Synthesis Strategies for High Entropy Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review critically assesses the various synthesis strategies developed for high entropy materials nanoparticles preparation, highlighting key illustrative examples and offering insights into the underlying formation mechanisms.








Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs) of high entropy materials (HEMs) have attracted significant attention due to their versatility and wide range of applications. HEM NPs can be synthesized by fragmenting bulk HEMs or disintegrating and recrystallizing them. Alternatively, directly producing HEMs in NP form from atomic/ionic/molecular precursors presents a significant challenge. A widely adopted strategy involves thermodynamically driving HEM NP formation by leveraging the entropic contribution but incorporating strategies to limit NP growth at the elevated temperatures used for maximizing entropy. A second approach is to kinetically drive HEM NP formation by promoting rapid reactions of homogeneous reactant mixtures or using highly diluted precursor dissolutions. Additionally, experimental evidence suggests that enthalpy plays a significant role in driving HEM NP formation processes at moderate temperatures, with the high energy cost of generating additional surfaces and interfaces at the nanoscale stabilizing the HEM phase. This review critically assesses the various synthesis strategies developed for HEM NP preparation, highlighting key illustrative examples and offering insights into the underlying formation mechanisms. Such insights are critical for fine&#8208;tuning experimental conditions to achieve specific outcomes, ultimately enabling the effective synthesis of optimized generations of these advanced materials for both current and emerging applications across various scientific and technological fields.

         <dc:description>
Functionalized quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes with electronegative atoms (O/N/F)&#8208;containing functional groups facilitate the optimization of the electron distribution around them, which endows the facile optimization of the interaction strength between the positively charged and negatively charged species, leading to desired thermal and kinetical optimal states, and thus benefiting the stabilization of the Zn anode for potential flexible devices.








Abstract
The rapid development of wearable and intelligent flexible devices has posed strict requirements for power sources, including excellent mechanical strength, inherent safety, high energy density, and eco&#8208;friendliness. Zn&#8208;ion batteries with aqueous quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (AQSSEs) with various functional groups that contain electronegative atoms (O/N/F) with tunable electron accumulation states are considered as a promising candidate to power the flexible devices and tremendous progress has been achieved in this prospering area. Herein, this review proposes a comprehensive summary of the recent achievements using the AQSSE in flexible devices by focusing on the significance of different functional groups. The fundamentals and challenges of the ZIBs are introduced from a chemical view in the first place. Then, the mechanism behind the stabilization of the flexible ZIBs with the functionalized AQSSE is summarized and explained in detail. Then the recent progress regarding the enhanced electrochemical stability of the ZIBs with the AQSSE is summarized and classified based on the functional groups on the polymer chain. The advanced characterization methods for the AQSSE are briefly introduced in the following sections. Last but not least, current challenges and future perspectives for this promising area are provided from the authors' point of view.

         <title>Solution Processable Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Synthesis Strategy and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in design strategies for synthesizing solution&#8208;processable metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and MOF&#8208;based systems, including methods such as direct dispersion in ionic liquids, direct synthesis, etc. It emphasizes their applications in fabricating structured objects, membranes, and/or films for molecular storage, separation, and chemical sensing. The review also discusses future challenges and perspectives. 








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), constructed by inorganic secondary building units with organic linkers via reticular chemistry, inherently suffer from poor solution processability due to their insoluble nature, resulting from their extensive crystalline networks and structural rigidity. The ubiquitous occurrence of precipitation and agglomeration of MOFs upon formation poses a significant obstacle to the scale&#8208;up production of MOF&#8208;based monolith, aerogels, membranes, and electronic devices, thus restricting their practical applications in various scenarios. To address the previously mentioned challenge, significant strides have been achieved over the past decade in the development of various strategies aimed at preparing solution&#8208;processable MOF systems. In this review, the latest advance in the synthetic strategies for the construction of solution&#8208;processable MOFs, including direct dispersion in ionic liquids, surface modification, controllable calcination, and bottom&#8208;up synthesis, is comprehensively summarized. The respective advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. Additionally, the intriguing applications of solution&#8208;processable MOF systems in the fields of liquid adsorbent, molecular capture, sensing, and separation are systematically discussed. Finally, the challenges and opportunities about the continued advancement of solution&#8208;processable MOFs and their potential applications are outlooked.

This review demonstrates the properties of HEMs both qualitatively and quantitatively, and the mechanisms of their enhancement on battery properties. It also illustrates the progress in high&#8208;entropy layered oxide cathode materials (HELOs) for lithium/sodium/potassium ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs/PIBs) in the perspectives of synthesis, characterization and application, and elucidating the synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationship.








Abstract
Increasing demand for rechargeable batteries necessitates improvements in electrochemical performance. Traditional optimal approaches such as elemental doping and surface modification are insufficient for practical applications of the batteries. High&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) possess stable solid&#8208;state phases and unparalleled flexibility in composition and electronic structure, which facilitate rapid advancements in battery materials. This review demonstrates the properties of HEMs both qualitatively and quantitatively, and the mechanisms of their enhancement on battery properties. It also illustrates the progress in high&#8208;entropy layered oxide cathode materials (HELOs) for lithium/sodium/potassium ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs/PIBs) in the perspectives of synthesis, characterization and application, and elucidating the synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationship. Furthermore, it outlines future directions for high&#8208;entropy strategies in battery study: precise synthesis control, understanding of reaction mechanisms through structural characterization, elucidation of structure&#8208;performance correlations, and the computational and experimental methods integration for rapid screening and analysis of HEMs. The perspective aims to inspire researchers in the development of high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries.

         <dc:description>
Polarization techniques are revolutionizing material functionalities across energy, environmental, and electronic sectors. This review comprehensively examines polarization mechanisms such as piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and pyroelectric effects, alongside strategies like doping and heterostructures. It highlights its pivotal role in enhancing charge dynamics, modifying surface chemistries, and facilitating energy&#8208;efficient designs in various applications.








Abstract
The sustainable future relies on the synergistic development of energy, environmental, and electronic systems, founded on the development of functional materials by exploring their quantum mechanisms. Effective control over the distribution and behavior of charges within these materials, a basic quantum attribute, is crucial in dictating their physical, chemical, and electronic properties. At the core of charge manipulation lies &#8220;polarization&#8221;&#8212;a ubiquitous phenomenon marked by separating positive and negative charges. This review thoroughly examines polarization techniques, spotlighting their transformative role in catalysis, energy storage, solar cells, and electronics. Starting with the foundational mechanisms underlying various forms of polarization, including piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and pyroelectric effects, the perspective is expanded to cover any asymmetric phenomena that generate internal fields, such as heterostructures and doping. Afterward, the critical role of polarization across various applications, including charge separation, surface chemistry modification, and energy band alignment, is highlighted. Special emphasis is placed on the synergy between polarization and material properties, demonstrating how this interplay is pivotal in overcoming existing technological limitations and unlocking new functionalities. Through a comprehensive analysis, a holistic roadmap is offered for harnessing polarization across the broad spectrum of applications, thus finding sustainable solutions for future energy, environment, and electronics.

         <title>Recent Advances in High&#8208;Entropy Layered Oxide Cathode Materials for Alkali Metal&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 1, January 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The basic concepts, design principles, synthetic methods, advanced characterization, and theoretical calculations of high&#8208;entropy layered oxides are summarized here for alkali metal&#8208;ion battery (AMIB) cathodes. It highlights the recent advances in high&#8208;entropy strategies for improving the electrochemical performance of layered oxide cathodes, and existing problems and possible solutions, providing guidance for the development of layered oxides for highly efficient AMIB cathodes.








Abstract
Since the electrochemical de/intercalation behavior is first detected in 1980, layered oxides have become the most promising cathode material for alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries (Li+/Na+/K+; AMIBs) owing to their facile synthesis and excellent theoretical capacities. However, the inherent drawbacks of unstable structural evolution and sluggish diffusion kinetics deteriorate their electrochemical performance, limiting further large&#8208;scale applications. To solve these issues, the novel and promising strategy of high entropy has been widely applied to layered oxide cathodes for AMIBs in recent years. Through multielement synergy and entropy stabilization effects, high&#8208;entropy layered oxides (HELOs) can achieve adjustable activity and enhanced stability. Herein, the basic concepts, design principles, and synthesis methods of HELO cathodes are introduced systematically. Notably, it explores in detail the improvements of the high&#8208;entropy strategy on the limitations of layered oxides, highlighting the latest advances in high&#8208;entropy layered cathode materials in the field of AMIBs. In addition, it introduces advanced characterization and theoretical calculations for HELOs and proposes potential future research directions and optimization strategies, providing inspiration for researchers to develop advanced HELO cathode materials in the areas of energy storage and conversion.
