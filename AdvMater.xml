         <title>Environmental Sustainability of Natural Biopolymer&#8208;Based Electrolytes for Lithium Ion Battery Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twenty&#8208;one biopolymer electrolytes including membrane&#8208;liquid electrolytes, gel electrolytes, and solid electrolytes are synthesized to analyze their electrochemical properties and environmental impacts through life cycle assessment. This consistent and comparable study demonstrates the significant functional and environmental benefits of biopolymer electrolytes for batteries, guiding academia and industry in fundamental studies and applied implementation of sustainable bio&#8208;based polymers and biopolymer electrolytes.








Abstract
Biopolymer based electrolytes can overcome current performance limitations of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Biopolymers enable electrolytes with high ionic conductivities and wide electrochemical stability windows. While the biobased character of natural materials is claimed as an inherent advantage in meeting current environmental sustainability challenges, further research is required to quantify and compare their environmental impacts as electrolytes. The challenge is addressed by identifying the most promising biopolymer electrolytes for LIBs, measuring ionic conductivities and electrochemical stability windows, and quantifying environmental impacts using life cycle assessment. The environmental impacts of the cost to isolate cellulose derivatives, nanocelluloses, chitin/nanochitin, chitosan, lignin, agar, and silk are reported for climate change, acidification, freshwater ecotoxicity, marine eutrophication, human toxicity, and water use. Material criticality, circularity index, and material circularity indicator, emerging impact categories are prioritized to help integrate biopolymers into circular and sustainable materials. The electrochemical properties and environmental impacts of natural biopolymer membrane&#8208;liquid electrolyte pairs, gel electrolytes, and solid electrolytes are quantified and benchmarked against conventional fossil&#8208;based electrolytes, providing consistent and comparable electrochemical properties of the most relevant biopolymer electrolytes fabricated so far. This study highlights the significant functional and environmental benefits of biopolymer electrolytes and identifies the most electrochemically competitive biopolymer electrolytes in LIBs.

         <title>Passive Isothermal Flexible Sensor Enabled by Smart Thermal&#8208;Regulating Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A passive isothermal flexible sensor enabled by radiative cooling and heat insulation for adapting dynamic thermal conditions is demonstrated. In summer, when solar radiation is high, PDRC prevails and achieves radiative cooling. Conversely, ambient temperature is low in winter, and the thermal insulation reduces heat loss. The prepared sensor can maintain the working temperature over a temperature range of 0&#8722;100&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Environmentally induced sensor temperature fluctuations can distort the outputs of a sensor, reducing their stability during long&#8208;term health monitoring. Here, a passive isothermal flexible sensor is proposed by using hierarchical cellulose aerogel (HCA) as the top tribonegative layer, which allows the sensor to adapt dynamic thermal environments through both radiative cooling and heat insulation. The radiative cooling effect can cool down the temperatures of a sensor in summer, while the hollow microfibers in HCA provide ultralow thermal conductivity to reduce internal heat loss in winter. The prepared passive isothermal sensor is capable of maintaining the rated working temperature over an extensive temperature range of 0&#8722;100&#160;&#176;C, demonstrating for gripping hot and cold objects. While monitoring human movements under direct sunlight, the temperature of a conventional sensor rose by 12.3&#160;&#176;C, whereas the sensor experienced an increase of only 0.3&#160;&#176;C. Therefore, this work presents a promising strategy for adapting to environments, enabling wearable electronics to function effectively in dynamic thermal conditions.

         <title>The sp Hybridization of Tin Single Atoms for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of dendrite&#8208;free Na anodes via the universal synthesis of the fourth main group single&#8208;atom materials (Sn, Ge, Pb SAs/G) with sp hybridization is demonstrated. The in situ observation and theoretical calculations essentially disclose that the 5s25p2
 electron configuration of Sn SAs/G surface enables the planar deposition mechanism of Na clusters, thereby suppressing the growth of dendrites.









Abstract
Restricting the growth of sodium (Na) dendrites at the atomic level is the premise to enable both the stability and safety of sodium metal batteries (SMBs). Here, the universal synthesis of the fourth main group element (Sn, Ge, Pb) as single metal atoms anchored on graphene (Sn, Ge, Pb SAs/G) with sp hybridization for dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anode is reported. The in situ real&#8208;time observation of Na growth on Sn SAs/G uncoils a kinetically uniform planar deposition at the atomic level for substantially suppressing the dendrite growth. The symmetrical Sn SAs/G&#8208;Na battery exhibits high Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% for 200 cycles, long&#8208;term cyclability with 600&#160;h at 4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and ultralow overpotential of 40&#160;mV at 8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Further, the full batteries Na3V2(PO4)3||Sn SAs/G&#8208;Na show unprecedented rate capability of 67 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 C and a capacity retention as high as 91% after 500 cycles. The theoretical calculations of Na deposition on different M SAs/G (M&#9552;Sn, Ni, Zn, Fe, Co) reveal that the 5s
25p
2 electron configuration of Sn SAs/G realizes the planar deposition mechanism of Na clusters along the graphene plane. Therefore, this work provides an atom&#8208;level accurate miniaturization strategy for constructing dendrite&#8208;free SMBs.

         <title>Bioinspired Liquid Pockets with Externally Induced Internal Microscale Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired liquid pockets material with an externally activated unit induces internal microscale to flow through the reversible transfer of interflowing fluid within interconnected pockets, enabling controlled internal flow and adaptive barrier functionality. This material exhibits a new pathway for regulating flow at responsive material interfaces, supporting applications such as sequential drug release, self&#8208;cleaning, antifouling, and anti&#8208;swelling.








Abstract
The gastric mucosal barrier, through its gastric pits, serves as a pathway for secretions, ensuring that mucus produced by the gastric glands is transferred to the gastric lumen, providing stable protection. Here a bioinspired liquid pockets material is shown, composed of a thermo&#8208;driven hydrogel that acts as an external activation unit to release interflowing liquid responsively, and porous matrices that serve as interconnected pockets to transfer it, enabling controlled internal flow and adaptive barrier functionality. Experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate the stability and regulatory mechanisms of these liquid pockets, based on the interconnected pockets between the external activation unit and internal fluid flow. It exhibits a new pathway for regulating microscale flow at responsive material interfaces, enabling applications from sequential drug release, self&#8208;cleaning, and antifouling to anti&#8208;swelling. These unique capabilities address long&#8208;standing challenges in microscale flow control, with potential impacts in diverse fields including microfluidics, drug delivery, medical devices, 3D printing, and beyond.

     alt="Bioinspired Liquid Pockets with Externally Induced Internal Microscale Flow"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bioinspired liquid pockets material with an externally activated unit induces internal microscale to flow through the reversible transfer of interflowing fluid within interconnected pockets, enabling controlled internal flow and adaptive barrier functionality. This material exhibits a new pathway for regulating flow at responsive material interfaces, supporting applications such as sequential drug release, self-cleaning, antifouling, and anti-swelling.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gastric mucosal barrier, through its gastric pits, serves as a pathway for secretions, ensuring that mucus produced by the gastric glands is transferred to the gastric lumen, providing stable protection. Here a bioinspired liquid pockets material is shown, composed of a thermo-driven hydrogel that acts as an external activation unit to release interflowing liquid responsively, and porous matrices that serve as interconnected pockets to transfer it, enabling controlled internal flow and adaptive barrier functionality. Experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate the stability and regulatory mechanisms of these liquid pockets, based on the interconnected pockets between the external activation unit and internal fluid flow. It exhibits a new pathway for regulating microscale flow at responsive material interfaces, enabling applications from sequential drug release, self-cleaning, and antifouling to anti-swelling. These unique capabilities address long-standing challenges in microscale flow control, with potential impacts in diverse fields including microfluidics, drug delivery, medical devices, 3D printing, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Bio&#8208;Inspired Perspective on Materials Sustainability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective discusses natural materials as inspiration for sustainable engineering designs and the processing of materials. First, circularity, longevity, parsimony, and activity are presented as essential material paradigms. The perspective then uses many examples of natural and technical materials to introduce principles such as oligo&#8208;materiality, multifunctionality, modularity, defect tolerance, remodeling, healing, adaptivity, as well as controlled disintegration.








Abstract
The article explores materials sustainability through a bio&#8208;inspired lens and discusses paradigms that can reshape the understanding of material synthesis, processing, and usage. It addresses various technological fields, from structural engineering to healthcare, and emphasizes natural material cycles as a blueprint for efficient recycling and reuse. The study shows that material functionality depends on both chemical composition and structural modifications, which emphasizes the role of material processing. The article identifies strategies such as mono&#8208;materiality and multifunctionality, and explores how responsivity, adaptivity, modularity, and cellularity can simplify material assembly and disassembly. Bioinspired strategies for reusing materials, defect tolerance, maintenance, remodeling, and healing may extend product lifespans. The principles of circularity, longevity, and parsimony are reconsidered in the context of &#8220;active materiality&#8221;, a dynamic bio&#8208;inspired paradigm. This concept expands the traditional focus of material science from structure&#8208;function relationships to include the development of materials capable of responding or adapting to external stimuli. Concrete examples demonstrate how bio&#8208;inspired strategies are being applied in engineering and technology to enhance the sustainability of materials. The article concludes by emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration as a key factor for developing a sustainable and resilient materials economy in harmony with nature's material cycles.

         <title>Rational Design of NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence/Photoacoustic Nanosensor Tailored for Mechanisms of Diabetes&#8208;Related Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanosensor with NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging capability is developed to explore the mechanism by which diabetes promoting breast cancer progression. Animal experiments demonstrate that diabetes causes elevated nitric oxide levels in the tumor microenvironment. RNA&#8208;seq results reveal that diabetes may promote tumor growth by weaking immune response, inhibiting apoptosis, and promoting the expression of carcinogens related to Nos2.








Abstract
Breast cancer (BC) is the second most common cause of cancer induced death worldwide. Current statistics has disclosed that the diabetic BC patients have significantly worse survival rate compared with nondiabetic BC patients. However, the specific mechanism is still being explored. Herein, a novel NIR&#8208;II nanosensor DNPS&#160;for nitric oxide (NO) with fluorescence/photoacoustic (FL/PA)&#160;imaging capability is developed to explore the mechanism by which diabetes promoting breast cancer progression. In diabetic BC model, DNPS exhibits great advantages of low intrinsic background, high sensitivity, and deep tissue penetration and successfully confirmed the expression level of NO is higher than BC model, indicating that diabetes causes elevated nitric oxide levels in the tumor microenvironment. RNA&#8208;seq analysis results show&#160;that hyperglycemia caused by diabetes leads to weakened immune response and initiates the transcription and translation of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene to produce NO. Besides, the increased expression of carcinogens related to Nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2), such as Spp1, Mmp11, and Kitl, causes breast cancer to develop more rapidly. Here, NIR&#8208;II imaging probe is applied first&#160;to study diabetes&#8208;related breast cancer and certain reference value is provided for subsequent research on the mechanism of diabetes promoting the progression of breast cancer.

         <title>Transforming Plastics to Single Atom Catalysts for Peroxymonosulfate Activation: Axial Chloride Coordination Intensified Electron Transfer Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graphene&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalyst with atomically dispersed FeN4Cl sites (Fe&#9472;N/Cl&#9472;C) is produced from high&#8208;density polyethylene and applied in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation and water purification. Both experiments and density functional theory computations demonstrate that the axial incorporation of chloride fine&#8208;tunes the coordination environment of FeN4 sites and enhances PMS activation because of improved carbon substrate conductivity and modulated spin state.








Abstract
Transforming plastics into single&#8208;atom catalysts is a promising strategy for upcycling waste plastics into value&#8208;added functional materials. Herein, a graphene&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalyst with atomically dispersed FeN4Cl sites (Fe&#9472;N/Cl&#9472;C) is produced from high&#8208;density polyethylene wastes via one&#8208;pot catalytic pyrolysis. The Fe&#9472;N/Cl&#9472;C catalyst exhibited much higher turnover frequency and surface area normalized activity (Kac) compared with the Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C catalyst without axial Cl modulation. Both experiments and density functional theory (DFT) computations demonstrated that the axial incorporation of chloride fine&#8208;tuned the coordination environment of FeN4 sites and enhanced peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation because of improved conductivity and modulated spin state. In situ, Raman, and infrared spectroscopic techniques revealed that PMS is activated by the Fe&#9472;N/Cl&#9472;C catalyst through an electron transfer process. The formation of a key PMS* intermediate at the Fe site effectively elevated the redox capacity of the catalyst surface to realize a fast degradation of diverse pollutants. The non&#8208;radical oxidation manner secures high selectivity toward target pollutants and high chemical utilization efficiency. A continuous operation in a column reactor also demonstrated the high efficiency and stability of the (Fe&#9472;N/Cl&#9472;C + PMS) system for practical water treatment.

         <title>Designing Current Collectors to Stabilize Li Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the design principles and modification strategies of current collectors to improve the reversibility of Li metal anode including lithiophilic site modification is summarized, 3D architecture construction, protective layer modification, and crystalline plane engineering. How these approaches contribute is highlighted and the prospects are prospected.








Abstract
Rechargeable batteries employing Li metal anodes have gained increasing attention due to their high energy density. Nevertheless, low stability and reversibility of Li metal anodes severely impeded their practical applications. Designing current collectors (CCs) with reasonable structure and composition is an efficient approach to stabilizing the Li metal anodes. However, an in&#8208;depth comprehensive understanding about the design principles and modification strategies of CCs for realizing stable Li metal anodes is still lacking. Herein, a critical review focusing on the rational design of CCs for Li metal anodes is summarized. First, the requirements for CCs in Li metal anodes are elucidated to clarify the design objectives of CCs. Then, the modification strategies of CCs including lithiophilic site modification, 3D architecture construction, protective layer modification, and crystalline plane engineering, as well as the corresponding principles are highlighted. On this basis, the recent progress in the development of CCs for Li metal anodes is discussed. Finally, future directions are suggested to focus on developing operando monitoring technology, and designing the CCs and cells under practical conditions close to the requirements of commercial applications. This review will spur more insightful researches toward advanced CCs, and promote their commercialization.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Screening and General Synthesis Strategy of Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes for Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work realizes the active drug screening of metal&#8208;SAzymes (AOC&#8208;M SAzymes) in anti&#8208;Oral squamous cell carcinoma application by a combination of high&#8208;throughput DFT calculation and experimental validation. AOC&#8208;Co SAzyme is found to effectively inhibit tumor growth by generating ROS at the tumor site. This work greatly facilitates the rational design of SAzymes for various tumor treatment applications.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes), with their superior enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activity, have emerged as promising candidates for oncology therapeutics. The well&#8208;defined structures of SAzymes make them well predictable by experiences and theoretical calculation. However, the effects of metal center species and coordination environments on enzyme&#8208;like activity are variable, and screening catalytic activity by artificial experiments is challenging. High&#8208;throughput screening can rapidly select the activity center structures of SAzymes with optimal enzyme&#8208;like activity, thus their better application in tumor therapy is highly desirable. Herein, a &#8220;high&#8208;throughput screening&#8208;SAzymes structures&#8221; system is established for efficient oncology drug preparation by density functional theory for oxidase&#8208;like processes and screened the differences brought about by different metals and coordination environments.

&lt;p&gt;This work realizes the active drug screening of metal-SAzymes (AOC-M SAzymes) in anti-Oral squamous cell carcinoma application by a combination of high-throughput DFT calculation and experimental validation. AOC-Co SAzyme is found to effectively inhibit tumor growth by generating ROS at the tumor site. This work greatly facilitates the rational design of SAzymes for various tumor treatment applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-atom nanozymes (SAzymes), with their superior enzyme-like catalytic activity, have emerged as promising candidates for oncology therapeutics. The well-defined structures of SAzymes make them well predictable by experiences and theoretical calculation. However, the effects of metal center species and coordination environments on enzyme-like activity are variable, and screening catalytic activity by artificial experiments is challenging. High-throughput screening can rapidly select the activity center structures of SAzymes with optimal enzyme-like activity, thus their better application in tumor therapy is highly desirable. Herein, a &#8220;high-throughput screening-SAzymes structures&#8221; system is established for efficient oncology drug preparation by density functional theory for oxidase-like processes and screened the differences brought about by different metals and coordination environments. Through this screening process, SAzymes with transition metals (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) as active centers are synthesized and then tested the multi-enzyme activities. It is found that the SAzyme with Co as the active metal center exhibited the best oxidase-like activity, and the system further showed good anti-oral squamous cell carcinoma properties both in vitro and in vivo. This study opens up a new avenue for the rational design of SAzymes in oral cancer therapy by combining computational screening and experimental validation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Phase Ligand Engineering Enables 18.21% FAPbI3 Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, by incorporating dual&#8208;site ligands, first a dual&#8208;phase ligand exchange strategy is reported by integrating both solution&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;state ligand exchange to synergistically regulate the surface chemistry and passivate defects of Formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) quantum dots, ultimately, a record&#8208;high efficiency of 18.21% is obtained for FAPbI3 quantum dot solar cells.








Abstract
Formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite quantum dot (PQD) are promising candidate for high&#8208;performing quantum dot photovoltaic due to its narrow bandgap, high ambient stability, and long carrier lifetime. However, the carrier transport blockage and nonradiative recombination loss, originating from the high&#8208;dielectric ligands and defects/trap states on the FAPbI3 PQD surface, significantly limit the efficiency and stability of its photovoltaic performance. In this work, through exploring dual&#8208;site molecular ligands, namely 2&#8208;thiophenemethylammonium iodide (2&#8208;TM) and 2&#8208;thiopheneethylammonium iodide (2&#8208;TE), a dual&#8208;phase synergistic ligand exchange (DSLE) protocol consisting of both solution&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;state ligand engineering is demonstrated. The DSLE strategy effectively replaces the native long insulating ligands and simultaneously passivate surface defects in hybrid FAPbI3 PQDs, leading to enhanced electronic coupling for efficient charge transport. Consequently, the FAPbI3 PQD solar cell based on DSLE strategy achieves a notable enhanced efficiency from 15.43% to 17.79% (2&#8208;TM) and 18.21% (2&#8208;TE), respectively. Besides, both 2&#8208;TM and 2&#8208;TE engineered devices exhibit enhanced stability, maintaining over 80% of its initial efficiency after aging in ambient environment (20&#8211;30% humidity, 25 &#176;C) for over 1400 h. It believes these findings will provide a new protocol to precisely regulate the surface chemistry of hybrid PQDs toward high&#8208;performance optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Pseudotunnel Magnetoresistance in Twisted van der Waals Fe3GeTe2 Homojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Largely&#8208;twisted van der Waals (vdW) homojunction of two thin Fe3GeTe2 flakes exhibits pseudotunnel&#8208;magnet resistance behaviors even without intentional introduction of tunnel barrier layers, due to lattice&#8208;mismatch driven vdW gaps.








Abstract
Twistronics, a novel engineering approach involving the alignment of van der Waals (vdW) integrated two&#8208;dimensional materials at specific angles, has recently attracted significant attention. Novel nontrivial phenomena have been demonstrated in twisted vdW junctions (the so&#8208;called magic angle), such as unconventional superconductivity, topological phases, and magnetism. However, there have been only few reports on integrated vdW layers with large twist angles &#952;t, such as twisted interfacial Josephson junctions using high&#8208;temperature superconductors. Herein, vdW homojunctions of the thin&#8208;magnetic flakes, Fe3GeTe2 (FGT), with large &#952;t ranging from 0&#176; to 90&#176;, without inserting any tunnel barriers are assembled. Nevertheless, these vdW homojunctions exhibit tunnel&#8208;magnetoresistance (TMR) like behavior (pseudo&#8208;TMR (PTMR) effect) with the ratios highly sensitive to the &#952;t values, revealing that the vdW gap at the junction interface between the twisted FGT layers behaves like a tunnel barrier and the &#952;t serves a control parameter for PTMR by drastically varying magnitudes of the lattice&#8208;mismatch and the subsequent appearance of antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin alignment. First&#8208;principles calculations considering vacuum gaps indicate strong dependence of TMR on the &#952;t driven by the sixfold screw rotational symmetry of bulk FGT. The present homojunctions hold promise as a platform for novel AFM spin&#8208;dependent phenomena and spintronic applications.

         <title>Plasma&#8211;Liquid&#8208;Induced Synthesis of Scandium&#8211;Metalloporphyrin Frameworks for Boosted Sensing and Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution anode glow discharge (SAGD) plasma is used to synthesize scandium&#8208;metalloporphyrin frameworks (SAGD&#8208;ScMPFs) in one step. SAGD&#8208;ScMPFs exhibit boosted fluorescence sensing ability and good electron&#8211;hole separation efficiency. It has been used for the sensitive detection of fluoride ions and effective bacteriostasis.








Abstract
Inserting metal ions into the porphyrin ring is one of the primary strategies to enhance the properties of porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). However, the straightforward, rapid, and energy&#8208;efficient synthesis of porphyrin&#8208;based MOFs with high metallization for the porphyrin ring remains challenging. Herein, a solution anode glow discharge (SAGD) microplasma is presented for the one&#8208;step synthesis of scandium&#8208;metalloporphyrin frameworks (ScMPFs). The substantial number of electrons provided by the plasma&#8211;liquid interface not only accelerated the rapid nucleation and growth of MOFs but also promoted the incorporation of scandium (Sc3+), which has a small ionic radius and strong coordination ability, into the N atoms in the porphyrin ring, and enhanced the metallization of MOFs. The sufficient Sc3+ in frameworks inhibited the recombination of electron&#8211;hole pairs, resulting in boosted reactive oxygen species yield and a low fluorescence background of MOFs. Consequently, the ScMPFs are employed for the sensitive and rapid detection of F&#8722; in water with a detection limit of 0.24 &#181;m and for efficient bacteriostasis at low doses (10 &#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1, 12&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 light irradiation for 10&#160;min).

         <title>Water Spillover to Expedite Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water spillover&#8208;type catalyst is synthesized by bridging copper&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework nanosheets with pentafluorothiophenol linker, which can circumvent the intrinsic activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off relationship in two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction, expediting the reaction rates from 0.1 to 2.0&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 with both high Faradaic efficiencies and H2O2 yield rates.








Abstract
Limited by the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off relationship, the electrochemical activation of small molecules (like O2, N2, and CO2) rapidly diminishes Faradaic efficiencies with elevated current densities (particularly at ampere levels). Nevertheless, some catalysts can circumvent this restriction in a two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR), a sustainable pathway for activating O2 to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Here we report 2e&#8722; ORR expedited in a fluorine&#8208;bridged copper metal&#8211;organic framework catalyst, arising from the water spillover effect. Through operando spectroscopies, kinetic and theoretical characterizations, it demonstrates that under neutral conditions, water spillover plays a dual role in accelerating water dissociation and stabilizing the key *OOH intermediate. Benefiting from water spillover, the catalyst can expedite 2e&#8722; ORR in the current density range of 0.1&#8211;2.0&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 with both high Faradaic efficiencies (99&#8211;84.9%) and H2O2 yield rates (63.17&#8211;1082.26&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2). Further, the feasibility of the present system has been demonstrated by scaling up to a unit module cell of 25&#160;cm2, in combination with techno&#8208;economics simulations showing H2O2 production cost strongly dependent on current densities, giving the lowest H2O2 price of $0.50&#160;kg&#8722;1 at 2.0 A cm&#8722;2. This work is expected to provide an additional dimension to leverage systems independent oftraditional rules.

&lt;p&gt;Limited by the activity-selectivity trade-off relationship, the electrochemical activation of small molecules (like O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2,&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) rapidly diminishes Faradaic efficiencies with elevated current densities (particularly at ampere levels). Nevertheless, some catalysts can circumvent this restriction in a two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR), a sustainable pathway for activating O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Here we report 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR expedited in a fluorine-bridged copper metal&#8211;organic framework catalyst, arising from the water spillover effect. Through &lt;i&gt;operando&lt;/i&gt; spectroscopies, kinetic and theoretical characterizations, it demonstrates that under neutral conditions, water spillover plays a dual role in accelerating water dissociation and stabilizing the key &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;OOH intermediate. Benefiting from water spillover, the catalyst can expedite 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR in the current density range of 0.1&#8211;2.0&#160;A&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with both high Faradaic efficiencies (99&#8211;84.9%) and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yield rates (63.17&#8211;1082.26&#160;mg&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Further, the feasibility of the present system has been demonstrated by scaling up to a unit module cell of 25&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, in combination with techno-economics simulations showing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production cost strongly dependent on current densities, giving the lowest H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; price of $0.50&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 2.0 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work is expected to provide an additional dimension to leverage systems independent oftraditional rules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reactive Oxygen Species Resistive Redox Mediator in Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic redox mediators (ORMs) reactive nature with 1O2 causes the functional degradation but the reactivity of ORMs is often neglected. The ORM is systematically designed, which has superior 1O2 stability than ORMs with similar molecular structures and promises enhanced cyclability sustaining its catalytic function. This work emphasizes the necessity of suitable design of ORMs and the importance of controlling 1O2.








Abstract
The utilization of redox mediators (RMs) in lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries (LOBs) has underscored their utility in high overpotential during the charging process. Among the currently known RMs, it is exceptionally challenging to identify those with a redox potential capable of attenuating singlet oxygen (1O2) generation while resisting degradation by reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as 1O2 and superoxide (O2&#8226;&#8722;). In this context, computational and experimental approaches for rational molecular design have led to the development of 7,7&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;7&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (BAC), a newly suggested RM incorporating N&#8211;N interconnected aza&#8208;bicycles. BAC harnesses the advantages of falling within the potential range that suppresses 1O2 generation, as previously reported N&#8211;N embedded non&#8208;bicyclic RMs, and effectively defends against ROS&#8208;induced degradation due to the incorporation of a novel bicyclic moiety. Unlike the non&#8208;bicyclic RMs, which exhibit reduced O2 evolution after exposure to 1O2, BAC maintains consistent O2 profiles during charging, indicating its superior 1O2 resistance and steady redox&#8208;catalyst performance in LOBs. This study introduces a precise and rational design strategy for low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight RMs, marking a significant step forward in advancing LOB development by improving efficiency, stability, and practical applicability.

         <title>Understanding the Dynamic Evolution of Active Sites among Single Atoms, Clusters, and Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the dynamic evolution of active sites among single atoms, clusters, and nanoparticles under reaction conditions and the subsequent the influence on catalytic property. This review is instrumental in providing enlightening insights into the dynamic evolution of active sites among single atoms, clusters, and nanoparticles and contributes to in&#8208;depth understanding of changes in catalytic activity under reaction conditions.








Abstract
Catalysis remains a cornerstone of chemical research, with the active sites of catalysts being crucial for their functionality. Identifying active sites, particularly during the reaction process, is crucial for elucidating the relationship between a catalyst's structure and its catalytic property. However, the dynamic evolution of active sites within heterogeneous metal catalysts presents a substantial challenge for accurately pinpointing the real active sites. The advent of in situ and operando characterization techniques has illuminated the path toward understanding the dynamic changes of active sites, offering robust scientific evidence to support the rational design of catalysts. There is a pressing need for a comprehensive review that systematically explores the dynamic evolution among single atoms, clusters, and nanoparticles as active sites during the reaction process, utilizing in situ and operando characterization techniques. This review aims to delineate the effects of various reaction factors on dynamic evolution of active sites among single atoms, clusters, and nanoparticles. Moreover, several in situ and operando techniques are elaborated with emphases on tracking the dynamic evolution of active sites, linking them to catalytic properties. Finally, it discusses challenges and future perspectives in identifying active sites during the reaction process and advancing in situ and operando characterization techniques.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Flexible High&#8208;Linearity Silicon Nanomembrane Synaptic Transistor Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper explores ultra&#8208;flexible silicon nanomembrane synaptic transistors on polyethylene terephthalate substrates, which maintain stable electrical performance after 10&#160;000 bending cycles at a 2.2 mm curvature radius. These devices effectively emulate synaptic functions with high linearity, achieving 93.2% accuracy in handwritten digit recognition, underscoring their suitability for flexible neuromorphic computing applications.








Abstract
The increasing demand for mobile artificial intelligence applications has elevated edge computing to a prominent research area. Silicon materials, renowned for their excellent electrical properties, are extensively utilized in traditional electronic devices. However, the development of silicon materials for flexible neuromorphic computing devices encounters great challenges. To address these limitations, ultrasoft silicon nanomembranes have emerged as a focal point due to their capability to preserve the superior electrical properties of silicon while providing substantial mechanical flexibility and interfacial tunability. Despite these advantages, difficulties remain in the transfer process of silicon nanomembranes and their integration for flexible synaptic transistors. In this work, an organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid polyimide&#8208;Al2O3 dielectric layer has been designed for synaptic behavior grown by an atomic layer deposition process, and integrated with a silicon nanomembrane to realize highly flexible synaptic transistors. These transistors demonstrate stable electrical performance even after undergoing 10&#160;000 bending cycles at an extreme curvature radius of 2.2&#160;mm. Furthermore, the silicon nanomembrane transistors effectively emulate synaptic functions, exhibiting exceptional linearity in their long&#8208;term characteristics, making them suitable for the application scenarios of detecting subtle signals. When applied to handwritten digit recognition simulations, these synaptic transistors have achieved a high accuracy rate of 93.2%.

         <title>Toward Fast&#8208;Charging and Dendritic&#8208;Free Li Growth on Natural Graphite Through Intercalation/Conversion on MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) coating on natural graphite (NG) anodes improves fast&#8208;charging capability and cycling performance in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The MoS2&#8208;NG anode reduces charging time and interfacial resistance by modifying the SEI layer, achieving an 80% state of charge in 14.7 minutes, making it ideal for electric vehicles.








Abstract
During fast&#8208;charging, uneven lithium plating on the surface of commercial graphite anode impedes the electrochemical performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, causing a safety issue. The formation of a passivation layer, the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI), due to side reactions with the organic electrolyte, correlates with long&#8208;term cycling performance under fast&#8208;charging conditions, necessitating comprehensive analysis. Herein, it is demonstrated that a molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) coating on natural graphite (NG) modulates the properties of the SEI layer, enabling reduction of the charging time and the enhancement of long&#8208;term cycling performance. MoS2 spontaneously transforms into Li2S and Mo nanoclusters through intercalation and conversion with Li+, altering the chemical composition and stability of the SEI layer on the NG, promoting faster Li+ transport, and reducing interfacial resistance. The MoS2&#8208;NG anode shows improved fast&#8208;charging capability and cycling performance under 3.0 C&#8208;charging and 1.0 C&#8208;discharging over 300 cycles without compromising energy density. In the full&#8208;cell configuration, a charging time of 14.7 min at 80% state of charge is achieved, making it suitable for electric vehicle applications.

This review summarizes recent advanced catalysts applied in thermal catalysis, microwave&#8208;assisted catalysis, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and enzymatic catalysis reaction systems for the chemical recycling of plastic waste into valuable feedstocks.








Abstract
Plastic products bring convenience to various aspects of the daily lives due to their lightweight, durability and versatility, but the massive accumulation of post&#8208;consumer plastic waste is posing significant environmental challenges. Catalytic methods can effectively convert plastic waste into value&#8208;added feedstocks, with catalysts playing an important role in regulating the yield and selectivity of products. This review explores the latest advancements in advanced catalysts applied in thermal catalysis, microwave&#8208;assisted catalysis, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and enzymatic catalysis reaction systems for the chemical recycling of plastic waste into valuable feedstocks. Specifically, the pathways and mechanisms involved in the plastics recycling process are analyzed and presented, and the strengths and weaknesses of various catalysts employed across different reaction systems are described. In addition, the structure&#8208;function relationship of these catalysts is discussed. Herein, it is provided insights into the design of novel catalysts applied for the chemical recycling of plastic waste and outline challenges and future opportunities in terms of developing advanced catalysts to tackle the &#8220;white pollution&#8221; crisis.

         <title>Selective Recycling of Mixed Polyesters via Heterogeneous Photothermal Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advent of heterogenous photothermal catalysis technology for the selective upcycling of mixed plastics represents a revolutionary breakthrough amidst the resolving global crisis of plastic pollution. This transformative technology not only addresses the inefficiencies and exorbitant costs associated with conventional plastic recycling methods but also heralds a profound impact on the realms of energy and environmental science.








Abstract
The selective recycling of mixed plastic wastes with similar structural units is challenging. While heterogeneous catalysis shows potential for selective recycling, challenges such as complex mass transfer at multiphase interfaces and unclear catalytic mechanisms have slowed progress. In this study, a breakthrough in recycling mixed polyester wastes is introduced using heterogeneous photothermal catalysis. By adding co&#8208;solvents, the difficulties associated with multiphase interfacial mass transfer are overcome. Grain boundary (GB)&#8208;rich CeO2 photothermal catalysts are used to selectively glycolyze mixed poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and poly(bisphenol A carbonate) (PC) plastics into bisphenol A (BPA) and bis(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), achieving yields of 97.8% and 93.4%, respectively. The high concentration of oxygen vacancies in GB&#8208;rich CeO2 catalysts adjusts the adsorption energy of intermediates, leading to more selective and efficient depolymerization compared to GB&#8208;poor CeO2 catalysts. The economic and environmental analysis demonstrates that this process, which utilizes heterogeneous photothermal catalysis, provides significant energy savings and carbon reduction, representing a major advancement in mixed plastic waste recycling.

         <title>Efficient Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide Enabled by a Hierarchical Hollow RE&#8211;P&#8211;O (RE = Sm, La, Gd) Architecture with Open Channels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare earth phosphates with hexagonal crystal structure have been demonstrated to exhibit impressive 2e&#8722; ORR performance over a wide potential and pH range, which can be attributed to their enriched open channels, large specific surface feature, optimal metal spatial distance, unwavering compositional stability as well as favorable electronic structure.








Abstract
The electrochemical two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) offers a sustainable pathway for the production of H2O2; however, the development of electrocatalysts with exceptional activity, selectivity, and long&#8208;term stability remains a challenging task. Herein, a novel approach is presented to addressing this challenge by synthesizing hierarchical hollow SmPO4 nanospheres with open channels via a two&#8208;step hydrothermal treatment. The produced compound demonstrates remarkable 2e&#8722; selectivity, exceeding 93% across a wide potential range of 0.0&#8211;0.6&#160;V in 0.1&#160;m KOH, with a peak of 96% at 0.45&#160;V. When employed as the cathode in a flow cell, the synthesized SmPO4 exhibits impressive stability at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 12&#160;h, consistently achieving a Faradaic efficiency above 90%. Using X&#8208;ray absorption, in situ Raman and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopies, theoretical calculations, and post&#8208;ORR assessments, it is found that this hollow compound possesses intrinsic open channels and is characterized by the optimal metal atomic spacing, and exceptional structural and compositional stabilities. These factors significantly enhance the thermodynamics, kinetics, and stability of the 2e&#8722; ORR process. Notably, the produced compound also exhibits outstanding 2e&#8722; ORR performance in neutral environments. Furthermore, this strategy can be extended to other hollow rare&#8208;earth&#8211;P&#8211;O compounds, demonstrating excellent 2e&#8722; ORR performance under both neutral and alkaline conditions.

         <title>1.6&#8208;Inch Transparent Micro&#8208;Display with Pixel Circuit Integrated microLED Chip Array by Misalignment&#8208;Free Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, this work demonstrates a radical technology that will transforms the current display industry beyond the backplane limits. The pixel circuit integrated micro&#8208;LED (PIMLED) does not need an active&#8208;matrix backplane but has an active&#8208;pixel circuit into it. The proposed PIMLED is compatible with intrinsic randomness of fluidic&#8208;based transfer technology and free from angular misalignment during vertical integration.








Abstract
Recent advances in mass transfer technology are expected to bring next&#8208;generation micro light&#8208;emitting diodes (&#181;LED) displays into reality, although reliable integration of the active&#8208;matrix backplane with the transferred &#181;LEDs remains as a challenge. Here, the &#181;LED display technology is innovated by demonstrating pixel circuit&#8208;integrated micro&#8208;LEDs (PIMLEDs) and integrating them onto a transparent glass substrate. The PIMLED comprises of low&#8208;temperature poly&#8208;silicon transistors and GaN &#181;LED. The square&#8208;shaped PIMLED is designed to secure a larger process margin but to reduce misalignment in the subsequent bonding process. Its unique four&#8208;fold rotational symmetric design together with concentric circular pixel electrodes of the substrate makes their massive transfer compatible with intrinsic randomness of fluidic&#8208;based transfer and free from angular misalignment during wafer bonding. The vertically integrated pixels show similar optical and electrical properties regardless of four possible arrangements. It is demonstrated that a 96 &#215; 96 PIMLED display on a transparent glass substrate, which is expected to open a door to novel form&#8208;factor free and transparent &#181;LED displays.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Cost, Open&#8208;Source 3D Printer for Multimaterial and High&#8208;Throughput Direct Ink Writing of Soft and Living Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Printess is a low&#8208;cost, open&#8208;source, multimaterial 3D printer for direct ink writing. Built for under $250, it is highly customizable and supports various advanced direct ink writing modalities, including multimaterial mixing, multimaterial multinozzle, and embedded 3D printing. The bioprinter's easy assembly, low cost, and high precision make it suitable for both research and educational settings.









Abstract
Direct ink writing is a 3D printing method that is compatible with a wide range of structural, elastomeric, electronic, and living materials, and it continues to expand its uses into physics, engineering, and biology laboratories. However, the large footprint, closed hardware and software ecosystems, and expense of commercial systems often hamper widespread adoption. This work introduces a compact, low&#8208;cost, multimaterial, and high&#8208;throughput direct ink writing 3D printer platform with detailed assembly files and instructions provided freely online. In contrast to existing low&#8208;cost 3D printers and bioprinters, which typically modify off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf plastic 3D printers, this system is built from scratch, offering a lower cost and full customizability. Active mixing of cell&#8208;laden bioinks, high&#8208;throughput production of auxetic lattices using multimaterial multinozzle 3D (MM3D) printing methods, and a high&#8208;toughness, photocurable hydrogel for fabrication of heart valves are introduced. Finally, hardware for embedded multinozzle and 3D gradient nozzle printing is developed for producing high&#8208;throughput and graded 3D parts. This powerful, simple&#8208;to&#8208;build, and customizable printing platform can help stimulate a vibrant biomaker community of engineers, biologists, and educators.

         <title>Highly Efficient Monolithic Perovskite/TOPCon Silicon Tandem Solar Cells Enabled by &#8220;Halide Locking&#8221;</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reported a &#8220;Halide Locking&#8221; strategy to balance the crystalline rate of iodide and bromide anions on the rough silicon substrates, inducing the formation of homogenous and oriented perovskite crystal structure. The single&#8208;junction devices yield the highest VOC of 1.277 V, and monolithic perovskite/TOPCon silicon tandem devices enable the record efficiency of 31.32% with improved light stability.








Abstract
Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs) are promising candidates for commercialization due to their outstanding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). However, controlling the crystallization process and alleviating the phases/composition inhomogeneity represent a considerable challenge for perovskite layers grown on rough silicon substrates, ultimately limiting the efficiency and stability of TSC. Here, this study reports a &#8220;halide locking&#8221; strategy that simultaneously modulates the nucleation and crystal growth process of wide bandgap perovskites by introducing a multifunctional ammonium salt, thioacetylacetamide hydrochloride (TAACl), to bind with all types of cations and anions in the mixed halide perovskite precursor. The approach not only enables excellent compositional uniformity in the wet&#8208;film stage but also induces preferred orientation along the (001) plane following nucleation, leading to enhanced homogeneity of the perovskite film in both vertical and horizontal directions over long&#8208;length scales. The resulting wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells yield exceptional open&#8208;circuit voltage&#8208;fill factor products (VOC &#215; FF) of 1.074 and 1.040 in small&#8208; (0.0414 cm2) and large&#8208;area (1.0208 cm2) devices, respectively. Corresponding large&#8208;area tandem solar cells based on the Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) silicon subcells achieve a record PCE of 31.32% with a remarkable VOC of 1.931&#160;V and FF of 81.54%.

         <title>Tunable Bicontinuous Macroporous Cell Culture Scaffolds via Kinetically Controlled Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic control of photopolymerization tunes pore size during the formation of macroporous hydrogel scaffolds via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation. The fabrication process is cytocompatible for direct 3D cell culture within tunable macroporous biomaterials.








Abstract
3D scaffolds enable biological investigations with a more natural cell conformation. However, the porosity of synthetic hydrogels is often limited to the nanometer scale, which confines the movement of 3D encapsulated cells and restricts dynamic cell processes. Precise control of hydrogel porosity across length scales remains a challenge and the development of porous materials that allow cell infiltration, spreading, and migration in a manner more similar to natural ECM environments is desirable. Here, a straightforward and reliable method is presented for generating kinetically&#8208;controlled macroporous biomaterials using liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation between poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and dextran. Photopolymerization&#8208;induced phase separation resulted in macroporous hydrogels with tunable pore size. Varying light intensity and hydrogel composition controlled polymerization kinetics, time to percolation, and complete gelation, which defined the average pore diameter (&#216; = 1&#8211;200 &#181;m) and final gel stiffness of the formed hydrogels. Critically, for biological applications, macroporous hydrogels are prepared from aqueous polymer solutions at physiological pH and temperature using visible light, allowing for direct cell encapsulation. Human dermal fibroblasts in a range of macroporous gels are encapsulated with different pore sizes. Porosity improved cell spreading with respect to bulk gels and allowed migration in the porous biomaterials.

         <title>Realizing C&#8211;C Coupling via Accumulation of C1 Intermediates within Dual&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Induced Dipole&#8208;Limited Domain Field to Propel Photoreduction of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 Fuel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study addresses the challenges of photocatalytic CO2 reduction by introducing C, N dual&#8208;vacancy sites into ultrathin g&#8208;C3N4, forming a localized dipole&#8208;limited domain electric field (DLDF). This design enhances CO2 activation and promotes efficient C&#8211;C coupling, leading to high&#8208;yield photocatalytic production of C2H6. The DLDF effect significantly improves electron transferability and stabilizes intermediates, facilitating the multi&#8208;electron reduction processes.








Abstract
Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 and H2O into high&#8208;value&#8208;added C2 fuels remains a tough challenge, mainly due to the insufficient concentration of photogenerated electrons for the instability of C1 intermediates, which often tend to desorb easily and disable to form C&#9472;C bonds. In this work, photoreduction of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H6 is successfully achieved by introducing adjacent C, N dual&#8208;vacancy sites within the heptazine rings of ultrathin g&#8208;C3N4, which results in the opening of two neighboring heptazine rings and forms a distinctive dipole&#8208;limited domain field (DLDF) structure. In situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra and in situ fourier transform infrared spectra provide direct evidence of the rapid accumulation and transformation of C1 intermediates, especially CO* and CHO*, within the DLDF. Ab initio molecular dynamics further substantiates the role of DLDF in promoting C&#8211;C coupling between CO* and CHO*, through the analysis of interaction trajectories and energy changes of their central atoms, ultimately achieving a high yield of C2H6 up to 57.86&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. It is for the first time to propose the concept of DLDF for significant advancement in photoreduction of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 fuel with the evident breakthrough to address the challenge of coupling carbon&#8208;containing intermediates between active sites, offering new insights for the design of C&#8211;C coupling sites in single&#8208;component photocatalysts.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Force Constants as Meaningful Indicator for Interatomic Bonding Characteristics and the Specific Case of Elemental Antimony</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study investigates experimental and theoretical force constants of antimony. Comparison with other materials indicates a continuous transition from multicenter bonding to covalent bonding characteristics. This makes the force constants a clear indicator for the degree of multicenter bonding in electron&#8208;rich materials and a fingerprint in material screening for future phase change material or thermoelectric applications. 








Abstract
Stable Sb exhibits a rhombohedral structure, often referred to as distorted primitive cubic, with each Sb atom having three short and three longer first neighbor bonds. However, this crystal structure can also be interpreted as being layered, putting emphasis on only three short first neighbor bonds. Therefore, temperature&#8208;dependent extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy is carried out at the Sb K&#8208;edge in order to obtain more detailed information on local structural and vibrational properties. Evaluation of the temperature&#8208;dependent bond lengths provides the temperature&#8208;dependent Peierls distortion while the temperature dependence of the variance of the interatomic distance distribution yields the EXAFS force constants. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used for determining projected force constants. Both EXAFS and DFT force constants are compared to those of other materials with different bonding characteristics, including two&#8208;center covalently bonded semiconductors, multicenter bonded IV&#8211;VI and V2VI3 compounds, and metallic Cu. Clearly, Sb exhibits characteristics of both localized covalent bonding and delocalized multicenter bonding. This suggests a continuous transition between these two bonding scenarios and adds to the understanding of bonding in elemental Sb in particular and in IV&#8211;VI and V2VI3 materials in general.

         <title>Engineering CAR&#8208;T Therapeutics for Enhanced Solid Tumor Targeting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CART cell therapy has proven effective for blood cancers but struggles with solid tumors due to diverse antigens and complex environments. Recent efforts focus on improving CAR design and validation platforms. Advances in protein engineering, machine learning, and organoid systems aim to enhance CAR&#8208;T therapy against solid tumors. Some solid tumors, like neuroblastoma, have responded well in trials.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy, specifically Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)&#8208;T cell therapy, represents a significant breakthrough in treating cancers. Despite its success in hematological cancers, CAR&#8208;T exhibits limited efficacy in solid tumors, which account for more than 90% of all cancers. Solid tumors commonly present unique challenges, including antigen heterogeneity and complex tumor microenvironment (TME). To address these, efforts are being made through improvements in CAR design and the development of advanced validation platforms. While efficacy is limited, some solid tumor types, such as neuroblastoma and gastrointestinal cancers, have shown responsiveness to CAR&#8208;T therapy in recent clinical trials. In this review, it is first examined both experimental and computational strategies, such as protein engineering coupled with machine learning, developed to enhance T cell specificity. The challenges and methods associated with T cell delivery and in vivo reprogramming in solid tumors is discussed. It is also explored the advancements in engineered organoid systems, which are emerging as high&#8208;fidelity in vitro models that closely mimic the complex human TME and serve as a validation platform for CAR discovery. Collectively, these innovative engineering strategies offer the potential to revolutionize the next generation of CAR&#8208;T therapy, ultimately paving the way for more effective treatments in solid tumors.

         <title>Unveiling the Oxidation Mechanisms of High&#8208;entropy Carbides Through Atomic&#8208;scale Dynamic Observation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural evolution of (Ta, Ti, Cr, Nb)C high&#8208;entropy carbide nanoparticles during oxidation is tracked in situ by using an environmental aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscope. Three key oxidation stages are discerned at the atomic level: i) increased amorphization (300&#8211;500 &#176;C); ii) nucleation and subsequent growth of locally ordered oxide nanoclusters (500&#8211;800 &#176;C); and iii) final one&#8208;step crystallization of high&#8208;entropy oxides.








Abstract
Understanding the behavior of high&#8208;entropy carbides (HECs) under oxygen&#8208;containing environments is of particular importance for their promising applications in structural components, catalysis, and energy&#8208;related fields. Herein, the structural evolution of (Ta, Ti, Cr, Nb)C (HEC&#8208;1) nanoparticles (NPs) is tracked in situ during the oxidation at the atomic scale by using an open&#8208;cell environmental aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscope. Three key stages are clearly discerned during the oxidation of HEC&#8208;1 NPs at the atomic level below 900 &#176;C: i) increased amorphization of HEC&#8208;1 NPs from 300 to 500 &#176;C due to the energetically favorable formation of carbon vacancies and substitution of carbon with oxygen atoms; ii) nucleation and subsequent growth of locally ordered nanocluster intermediates within the generated amorphous oxides from 500 to 800 &#176;C; and iii) final one&#8208;step crystallization of non&#8208;equimolar MeO2 and Me2O5 (Me = metallic elements, Ta, Ti, Cr, and Nb) high&#8208;entropy oxides above 800 &#176;C, accompanied with the reduction in atomic defects. This result is further confirmed by theoretical calculations that these observed high&#8208;entropy oxide phases are thermodynamically preferable to generate above 830 &#176;C. The study provides direct evidence of the ordered&#8211;disordered&#8211;ordered structural transition of HECs during oxidation.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Explosive Anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 Factory Built in Tumor for Advanced Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a platform that combines tumor&#8208;targeted antibody production with laser&#8208;sensitive release system for enhanced immunotherapy. Utilizing pH&#8208;responsive properties of platform for tumor targeting and laser irradiation to trigger the release of anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibodies and immunogenic cell death. This stimulates dendritic cell maturation and T cell infiltration, significantly enhancing anti&#8208;tumor activity, and offering a potent approach to cancer treatment.








Abstract
Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies, has revolutionized oncology. However, it encounters challenges such as inadequate drug accumulation and limited efficacy against &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors characterized by lack of T cell infiltration and immunosuppressive microenvironments. Here, a controlled antibody production and releasing nanoparticle (CAPRN) is introduced, designed to augment ICB efficacy by facilitating tumor&#8208;targeted antibody production and inducing photodynamic cell death. CAPRN achieves tumor&#8208;specific accumulation via pH&#8208;responsive PEG detachment, enabling efficient intracellular gene delivery encoding anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody. Laser&#8208;induced photodynamic therapy (PDT) not only triggers cancer cell death but also facilitates targeted antibody release from dying tumor cells. CAPRN demonstrates significant anti&#8208;tumor efficacy, attributed to multiple effects including enhanced antibody release, dendritic cell (DC) maturation, and T cell activation. Moreover, CAPRN exhibits substantial tumor suppression in both primary and bilateral tumor models, accompanied by activated T cell infiltration and enhanced immune responses. This study presents a novel strategy for priming robust immunotherapy, offering targeted antibody release through laser&#8208;assisted photodynamic nanoparticles.

         <title>Soft, Modular Power for Composing Robots with Embodied Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A worm&#8208;like robot composed of modular, self&#8208;contained actuators is developed. The modules with embodied zinc&#8208;iodide redox flow batteries are fabricated using a novel bonding method, allowing for reliable power supply over extended periods more than 35 h. Each module operates independently to create various gait patterns, demonstrating efficient locomotion.








Abstract
The adaptable, modular structure of muscles, combined with their confluent energy storage allows for numerous architectures found in nature: trunks, tongues, and tentacles to name some more complex ones. To provide an artificial analog to this biological soft muscle, a self&#8208;powered, soft hydrostat actuator is presented. As an example of how to use these modules, a worm robot is assembled where the near totality of the body stores electrochemical potential. The robot exhibits an extremely high system energy density (51.3 J g&#8722;1), using a redox flow battery motif, with a long theoretical operational range of more than 100 m on a single charge. The innovation lies in the battery pouch, fabricated with a dry&#8208;adhesion method, automatically bonding Nafion separators to a silicone&#8208;urethane copolymer body. These pouches contain anolyte within a hydrostat pod filled with catholyte, increasing current density per pod. Each pod has a motor and tendon actuator for radial compression and expansion. By linking these self&#8208;contained pods in series, the robot worm is created that automatically navigates an enclosed, curved path. This high&#8208;capacity soft worm also climbs up and down a vertical pipe, using a two&#8208;anchor crawling gait, with an extra payload equivalent to 1.5 times its body weight.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Metal Interstitials Activate TiO2 for Robust Catalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel category of high&#8208;entropy metal oxides, functionalized by multiple metal interstitials, exhibits significant lattice distortion that inhibits metal leaching and enhances electron contribution for efficient catalytic oxidation.








Abstract
Substitution metal doping strategies are crucial for developing catalysts capable of activating O2, but the leaching of metal dopants has greatly hindered their potential for extensive oxidation reactions under mild conditions. Here, the study develops an entropy&#8208;increase strategy to synthesize high&#8208;entropy metal (Mg, Ca, Mn, Fe, and Co) interstitial functionalized anatase TiO2 (HE&#8208;TiO2) nanosheets, demonstrating remarkable degradation efficiency across a wide pH range and exceptional stability in a flow&#8208;by electro&#8208;catalytic reactor. Relative to that of pristine TiO2, the intense lattice distortion on the (001) plane, an average lattice expansion of 2% on the (100) plane, and decrease of second shell peak of X&#8208;ray absorption spectra serve as compelling evidence for the formation of metal interstitials in HE&#8208;TiO2. Theoretical analysis and in situ synchrotron radiation Fourier transform infrared studies reveal that the electron of metal interstitials can populate the subgap states within the host TiO2, enabling a moderate adsorption band for robust and efficient O2 activation. This study introduces a universal strategy for synthesizing a novel class of high&#8208;entropy materials with integrated metal interstitials in metal oxides, promising to enhance the stability and efficiency of O2 activation catalysts and broaden their potential applications.

         <title>Permanent Electride Magnets Induced by Quasi&#8208;Atomic Non&#8208;Nucleus&#8208;Bound Electrons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interstitial quasi&#8208;atomic electrons (IQE) located in cationic cavities have driven diverse magnetic phases by inherited magnetic properties. This reports, the IQEs first carry the permanent magnet via spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) with rare&#8208;earth cations in the ferrite&#8208;like magnetic structure 2D electride [Re2C]2+2e&#8722;. This finding suggests a platform for exploring the relationship between SOC and coercivity using the smallest magnetic particles.








Abstract
Interstitial quasi&#8208;atomic electrons (IQEs) in the quantized energy levels of positively charged cavities possess a substantial own magnetic moment and control the magnetism of crystalline electrides depending on the interaction with surrounding cations. However, weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling and gentle exchange interaction restricted by the IQEs preclude a large magnetic anisotropic, remaining a challenge for a hard magnetism. It is reported that 2D [Re2C]2+&#183;2e&#8722; electrides (Re = Er, Ho, Dy, and Tb) show the permanent magnetism in a ferrimagnetic ground state, mimicking the ferrites composed of magnetic sublattices with different spin polarizations. Magnetic interaction between Re&#8208;spin lattice and IQE&#8208;spin lattice in the [Re2C]2+&#183;2e&#8722; electrides results in a large magnetocrystalline anisotropy and high coercivity, giving a maximum energy product of 15 MGOe. It is demonstrated that the spontaneous breaking of magnetic IQE&#8208;sublattice through substitution with paramagnetic elements produces a crossover into an antiferromagnetic spin ordering of Re&#8208;sublattice, implying that the magnetic sublattice of IQEs drives the permanent magnetism.

         <dc:description>
This study advances electrohydrodynamic (EHD) pumps by introducing a 3D&#8208;printable anti&#8208;swelling organohydrogel for soft robotics. Using digital light processing (DLP) technology, precise components are fabricated, resulting in a pump with 90.2&#160;kPa pressure and 800&#160;mL&#160;min&#8722;1 flow rate.

Abstract
This study introduces advancements in electrohydrodynamic (EHD) pumps and the development of a 3D&#8208;printable anti&#8208;swelling organohydrogel for soft robotics. Using digital light processing (DLP)technology, precise components with less than 1% size variation are fabricated, enabling a unique manifold pump array. This design achieves an output pressure of 90.2&#160;kPa&#8212;18 times higher than traditional configurations&#8212;and a flow rate of 800&#160;mL&#160;min&#8722;1, surpassing previous EHD pumps. To address swelling issues in dielectric liquids, a novel organohydrogel is developed with Young's modulus of 0.33&#160;MPa, 300% stretchability, and a swelling ratio under 10%. Its low swelling is attributed to the shield effect and edge length confinement effect. This durable material ensures consistent pump performance under mechanical stresses like bending and twisting, crucial for dynamic soft robotic environments. These innovations significantly improve EHD pump efficiency and reliability, expanding their potential applications in soft robotics, bioengineering, and vertical farming.

         <title>Emerging 0D Hybrid Metal Halide Luminescent Glasses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review performs the thermodynamic analysis to elaborate the solid&#8208;liquid phase transition in 0D hybrid metal halide (HMH) glasses and further summarizes the chemical design and structural characterization, luminescence properties, and glass crystallization behaviors. The perspective can provide guidance for the future research direction of 0D HMH glasses and promote their development in optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
0D hybrid metal halide (HMH) luminescent glasses have garnered significant attentions for its chemical diversity in optoelectronic applications and it also retains the skeleton connectivity and coordination mode of the crystalline counterparts while exhibiting various physics/chemistry characteristics distinct from the crystalline states. However, understanding of the glass&#8208;forming ability and the specific structural origins underpinning the luminescent properties of 0D HMH glasses remains elusive. In this review, it is started from the solid&#8208;liquid phase transition and thermodynamic analysis of 0D HMHs formed through melt&#8208;quenching, and summarize the current compounds capable of stably forming glassy phases via chemical structural design. The structural characterization methods are further discussed and highlight the exceptional transparency, specific luminescent properties, and glass crystallization behaviors. Moreover, the application prospects demonstrated by these 0D HMH glasses have been presented accordingly in X&#8208;ray detection and imaging, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and information encryption. Finally, perspective is offered into the future development of this emerging family of 0D HMH glasses and their applications.

         <title>Dynamic Redox Induced Localized Charge Accumulation Accelerating Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing capacitive Mn into IrO2 modulates the local electronic structure and adsorption behavior. Under applied bias, dynamic redox reactions induce localized charge accumulation, leading to significant pseudocapacitance and improved OER kinetics at the Ir sites. Furthermore, the higher energy for oxygen vacancy formation inhibits lattice oxygen activation, thereby improving stability.








Abstract
The sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis necessitates applied bias to facilitate electron transfer as well as bond cleavage and formation. Traditional electrocatalysis focuses on analyzing the effects of electron transfer, while the role of charge accumulation induced by the applied overpotential has not been thoroughly investigated. To explore the influence mechanism of bias&#8208;driven&#160;charge accumulation, capacitive Mn is incorporated into IrO2 to regulate the local electronic structure and the adsorption behavior. The applied bias triggers dynamic redox reactions at the active sites, which introduce local charge accumulation on the surface of electrocatalyst. Under bias, Mn oxidation induced a noticeable pseudocapacitance in the pre&#8208;OER region, promoting the OER kinetics of iridium sites. Meanwhile, the increased oxygen vacancy formation energy further prevents the lattice oxygen activation. The PEM electrolyzer, equipped with optimal materials as an anode, operates at a low driving voltage of 1.637&#160;V under 2.0 A cm&#8722;2, maintaining stable performance for over 800&#160;h with a low degradation rate (19.4 &#181;V h&#8722;1). This work provides insights into the performance of metal oxide catalysts in acidic environments and offers forward&#8208;looking strategies for enhancing the catalytic performance through dynamic redox induced capacitive behavior.

         <title>Slide&#8208;Ring Structured Stress&#8208;Electric Coupling Hydrogel Microspheres for Low&#8208;Loss Transduction Between Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stress&#8208;electric coupling hydrogel microsphere is developed to restore low&#8208;loss transduction between tissues. The synergistic effects of the molecular slippage mechanism of slide&#8208;ring structure, the conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron movement of polypyrrole, and the piezoelectric properties of barium titanate minimize the energy loss during electromechanical conversion between tissues, enhance chondrogenic differentiation of stem cells and remodel inflammatory microenvironment, thereby promoting osteoarthritis treatment.








Abstract
High transductive loss at tissue injury sites impedes repair. The high dissipation characteristics in the electromechanical conversion of piezoelectric biomaterials pose a challenge. Therefore, supramolecular engineering and microfluidic technology is utilized to introduce slide&#8208;ring polyrotaxane and conductive polypyrrole to construct stress&#8208;electric coupling hydrogel microspheres. The molecular slippage mechanism of slide&#8208;ring structure stores and releases mechanical energy, reducing mechanical loss, the piezoelectric barium titanate enables stress&#8208;electricity conversion, and conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron movement in conductive network improves the internal electron transfer efficiency of microspheres, thereby reducing the loss in stress&#8208;electricity conversion for the first time. Compared to traditional piezoelectric hydrogel microspheres, the stress&#8208;electric coupling efficiency of low&#8208;dissipation microspheres increased by 2.3 times, and the energy dissipation decreased to 43%. At cellular level, electrical signals generated by the microspheres triggered Ca2+ influx into stem cells and upregulated the cAMP signaling pathways, promoting chondrogenic differentiation. Enhanced electrical signals induced macrophage polarization to the M2 phenotype, reshaping inflammation and promoting tissue repair. In vivo, the low&#8208;dissipation microspheres restored low&#8208;loss transduction between tissues, alleviated cartilage damage, improved behavioral outcomes, and promoted the treatment of osteoarthritis in rats. Therefore, this study proposes a new strategy for restoring low&#8208;loss transduction between tissues, particularly in mechanically sensitive tissues.

In vivo, the low-dissipation microspheres restored low-loss transduction between tissues, alleviated cartilage damage, improved behavioral outcomes, and promoted the treatment of osteoarthritis in rats. Therefore, this study proposes a new strategy for restoring low-loss transduction between tissues, particularly in mechanically sensitive tissues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>ASb3Mn9O19 (A = K or Rb): New Mn&#8208;Based 2D Magnetoplumbites with Geometric and Magnetic Frustration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Mn&#8208;based magnetoplumbites, ASb3Mn9O19 (A = K or Rb), are discovered, synthesized, and characterized. According to magnetic properties measurements, neutron diffraction, and reverse Monte Carlo refinement, short&#8208;range magnetic correlations are observed in the new materials. These observations reveal 2D magnetic correlations and magnetic frustration in ASb3Mn9O19, making it a promising platform for inducing exotic quantum states.








Abstract
Magnetoplumbites are one of the most broadly studied families of hexagonal ferrites, typically with high magnetic ordering temperatures, making them excellent candidates for permanent magnets. However, magnetic frustration is rarely observed in magnetoplumbites. Herein, the discovery, synthesis, and characterization of the first Mn&#8208;based magnetoplumbite, as well as the first magnetoplumbite involving pnictogens (Sb), ASb3Mn9O19 (A = K or Rb) are reported. The Mn3+ (S = 2) cations, further confirmed by DC magnetic susceptibility and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, construct three geometrically frustrated sublattices, including Kagome, triangular, and puckered honeycomb lattices. Magnetic properties measurements revealed strong antiferromagnetic spin&#8211;spin coupling as well as multiple low&#8208;temperature magnetic features. Heat capacity data does not show any prominent &#955;&#8208;anomaly, suggesting minimal associated magnetic entropy. Moreover, neutron powder diffraction (NPD) implied the absence of long&#8208;range magnetic ordering in KSb3Mn9O19 down to 3 K. However, several magnetic peaks are observed in RbSb3Mn9O19 at 3 K, corresponding to an incommensurate magnetic structure. Interestingly, strong diffuse scattering is seen in the NPD patterns of both compounds at low angles and is analyzed by reverse Monte Carlo refinements, indicating short&#8208;range spin ordering related to frustrated magnetism as well as 2D magnetic correlations in ASb3Mn9O19 (A = K or Rb).

         <title>Robust Immobilization and Activity Preservation of Enzymes in Porous Frameworks by Silica&#8208;Based &#8220;Inorganic Glue&#8221;</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept, &#8220;silica&#8208;based inorganic glue,&#8221; is introduced, where enzyme&#8208;induced silicification is employed to enhance enzyme stability, improve interactions with supports, and prevent pore blocking. Due to its simplicity, reliability, and scalability, this approach offers a transformative advancement in enzyme immobilization for industrial applications.








Abstract
The development of novel methods to enhance enzyme&#8208;carrier interactions in situ, at a feasible cost, and on a large scale is crucial for improving the stability and durability of current immobilized enzyme systems used in industrial settings. Here, a pioneering approach termed &#8220;silica&#8208;based inorganic glue&#8221; is proposed, which utilizes protein&#8208;catalyzed silicification to fix enzyme within porous matrix while preserving enzyme activity. This innovative strategy offers several key benefits, including conformational stabilization of enzymes, improved interactions between enzymes and the matrix, prevention of enzyme leakage, and mitigation of pore blocking. Moreover, the controllable and scalable nature of this method renders it a cost&#8208;effective solution for enhancing enzyme immobilization in industrial contexts. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the &#8220;silica&#8208;based inorganic glue&#8221; technology, it has applied to three different enzymes exhibiting varying surface characteristics, sizes, and functions and in diverse porous supports, including a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) and a commercial macroporous resin, which resulted in a significant improvement of the stability and longevity of the immobilized enzymes. Overall, this findings represent a significant advancement in enzyme immobilization techniques, signaling a paradigm shift in current industrial catalysis.

         <title>Critical Role of Nanomaterial Mechanical Properties in Drug Delivery, Nanovaccines and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Numerous nanomedicines are developed to revolutionize disease management. Due to the diverse materials and methods used in fabricating nanomedicines, their mechanical properties can vary significantly, which have increasingly been recognized as a critical factor influencing therapeutic efficacy. This review systematically addresses the impact of nanomedicines&#8217; mechanical properties on their biomedical performance, offering valuable insights for future developments in the field.








Abstract
Nanomaterials have become essential in the daily lives, finding applications in food, skincare, drugs, and vaccines. Traditionally, the surface chemistry of nanoparticles (NPs) is considered the key factor in determining their interactions with biological systems. However, recent studies have shown that the mechanical properties of nanomaterials are equally important in regulating nano&#8208;bio interactions, though they have often been overlooked. Tuning the mechanical properties of nanomaterials and designing&#160;them for biomedical applications is thus crucial. This review begins by discussing the various mechanical cues in biological processes, including how viruses and cells adjust their mechanical properties throughout their life cycles. Basic concepts and terminology related to NP mechanical properties are introduced. Next, five different groups of nanomaterials with tunable mechanical properties are explored. The review then examines the impact of NP mechanical properties on their interactions in vitro and in vivo, covering tumor&#8208;targeted drug delivery, nanovaccines, and emerging applications such as oral and intranasal drug delivery. Current challenges in the field and perspectives on future developments are also provided.

         <title>Hyperspectral Metachip&#8208;Based 3D Spatial Map for Cancer Cell Screening and Quantification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D spatial map for human cancer cells is developed using the designed multiplexed THz metachip with superior Q factors and sensitivity. This method for screening and quantifying cancer cells based on such a 3D spatial map has been experimentally validated to achieve high accuracies (93.33%) under several selected cancer cells from different parts of the human body.








Abstract
In this paper, compact terahertz (THz) metachips for hyperspectral screening and quantitative evaluation of human cancer cells is reported. This pixelated resonant metachips feature the resonance channel from 1 and 3&#160;THz frequency with a record&#8208;high quality factor (up to 230). Through the interactions of various cancer cells of different concentrations, high&#8208;dimensional spectral signatures are obtained, which are further transformed into a spatial map for labelling and quantification purposes. The screening of up to 15 cancer cells is experimentally reported, with very high detecting accuracy of 93.33% and with attractive quantitative concentration sensitivity up to 1320&#160;kHz&#160;cell&#160;mL&#8722;1. This hyperspectral metachips are low&#8208;cost, highly compact, and label&#8208;free for fast, high&#8208;throughput and high&#8208;sensitivity detections and evaluation of human cancer cells. This technology does not require clinical experience, representing an accessible technology for early diagnosis of cancer.

         <title>Tailoring Acid&#8208;Salt Hybrid Electrolyte Structure for Stable Proton Storage at Ultralow Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anti&#8208;freezing acid&#8208;salt hybrid electrolyte with the stable anion&#8722;cation&#8722;H2O (Cl&#8722;&#8722;Zn2+&#8722;H2O) solvation structure is developed, which achieves unconventional proton transport through strong interactions between hydrophilic ions and H2O and improves cycling stability by avoiding severe structure destruction of &#945;&#8208;MoO3 anodes, resulting in providing a steady power supply for the VHCF//&#945;&#8208;MoO3 proton storage device at &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C.









Abstract
The critical challenges in developing ultralow&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;based energy storage systems are enhancing the diffusion kinetics of charge carriers and inhibiting water&#8208;triggered interfacial side reactions between electrolytes and electrodes. Here an acid&#8208;salt hybrid electrolyte with a stable anion&#8722;cation&#8722;H2O solvation structure that realizes unconventional proton transport at ultralow temperature is shown, which is crucial for electrodes and devices to achieve high rate&#8208;capacity and stable interface compatibility with electrodes. Through multiscale simulations and experimental investigations in the electrolyte employing ZnCl2 introduced into 0.2 M H2SO4 solution, it is discovered that unique anion&#8722;cation&#8722;H2O solvation structure endows the electrolyte with low&#8208;temperature&#8208;adaptive feature and favorable water network channels for rapid proton transport. In situ XRD and multiple spectroscopic techniques further reveal that the stable 3D network structure inhibits free water&#8208;triggered deleterious electrode structure distortion by immobilizing free water molecules to achieve outstanding cycling stability. Hence, VHCF//&#945;&#8208;MoO3 hybrid proton capacitors deliver an unexpected capacity of 39.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at a high current density of 1 A g&#8722;1 (&#8722;80&#160;&#176;C) and steady power supply under ultralow temperatures (96% capacity retention after 1500 cycles at &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C).

&lt;p&gt;An anti-freezing acid-salt hybrid electrolyte with the stable anion&#8722;cation&#8722;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) solvation structure is developed, which achieves unconventional proton transport through strong interactions between hydrophilic ions and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and improves cycling stability by avoiding severe structure destruction of &#945;-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; anodes, resulting in providing a steady power supply for the VHCF//&#945;-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; proton storage device at &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The critical challenges in developing ultralow-temperature proton-based energy storage systems are enhancing the diffusion kinetics of charge carriers and inhibiting water-triggered interfacial side reactions between electrolytes and electrodes. Here an acid-salt hybrid electrolyte with a stable anion&#8722;cation&#8722;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O solvation structure that realizes unconventional proton transport at ultralow temperature is shown, which is crucial for electrodes and devices to achieve high rate-capacity and stable interface compatibility with electrodes. Through multiscale simulations and experimental investigations in the electrolyte employing ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; introduced into 0.2 M H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; solution, it is discovered that unique anion&#8722;cation&#8722;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O solvation structure endows the electrolyte with low-temperature-adaptive feature and favorable water network channels for rapid proton transport. In situ XRD and multiple spectroscopic techniques further reveal that the stable 3D network structure inhibits free water-triggered deleterious electrode structure distortion by immobilizing free water molecules to achieve outstanding cycling stability. Hence, VHCF//&#945;-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; hybrid proton capacitors deliver an unexpected capacity of 39.8 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a high current density of 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (&#8722;80&#160;&#176;C) and steady power supply under ultralow temperatures (96% capacity retention after 1500 cycles at &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C). The anti-freezing hybrid electrolyte design provides an effective strategy to improve the application of energy storage devices in ultralow temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilizing the Fe Species of Nickel&#8208;Iron Double Hydroxide via Chelating Asymmetric Aldehyde&#8208;Containing THB Ligand for Long&#8208;Lasting Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stabilization of Fe species is achieved through the chelation of asymmetric aldehyde&#8208;containing ligand THB, which enhances OER performance of NiFeOOH/THB in long&#8208;lasting overall water splitting by suppressing the dissolution of Fe and facilitating the rapid formation of highly valent active Fe (III) species.








Abstract
Nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDHs) are considered as promising substitutes for precious metals in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, most of the reported NiFe LDHs suffer from poor long&#8208;term stability because of the Fe loss during OER resulting in severe inactivation. Herein, a dynamically stable chelating interface through in situ transformation of asymmetric aldehyde&#8208;ligand (THB, 1,3,5&#8208;Tris(3&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;formylphenyl)&#8208;benzene) modified NiFe LDHs to anchor Fe and significantly enhance the OER stability is reported. The fabricated asymmetric aldehyde&#8208;containing ligand THB is capable of stimulating much more interfacial charge transfer from NiFe LDHs to the oxygen group of THB and accelerating the formation of highly valent active Fe species leading to the strong combination between Fe and ligand and the reduced activation energy barrier of the intermediate, respectively. The optimized aldehyde&#8208;ligand&#8208;chelated NiFe LDHs (NiFe LDH/THB) shows enhanced OER performance featuring an overpotential of 224&#160;mV at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and robust stability for over 3860&#160;h at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a water splitting device maintaining a cell voltage of only 1.68&#160;V, which paves a new avenue to improve the water electrolysis performance of non&#8208;noble metal catalysts.

         <dc:description>
This review discusses the spatiotemporal dynamics of excitons in halide perovskite materials, with a particular emphasis on low&#8208;dimensional perovskites and the effects of nanoscale morphology on excitonic behavior. Novel phenomena unique to halide perovskites are emphasized while introducing the basic theory needed to understand the importance of those observations.








Abstract
Halide perovskites have emerged as promising materials for a wide variety of optoelectronic applications, including solar cells, light&#8208;emitting devices, photodetectors, and quantum information applications. In addition to their desirable optical and electronic properties, halide perovskites provide tremendous synthetic flexibility through variation of not only their chemical composition but also their structure and morphology. At the heart of their use in optoelectronic technologies is the interaction of light with electronic excitations in the form of excitons. This review discusses the properties and behavior of excitons in halide perovskite materials, with a particular emphasis on low&#8208;dimensional perovskites and the effects of nanoscale morphology on excitonic behavior. The basic theory of excitonic energy migration in semiconductor nanomaterials is introduced, and novel observations in halide perovskite nanomaterials that have evolved our current understanding are explored. Finally, many important questions that remain unanswered are presented and exciting emerging directions in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite exciton physics are discussed.

         <title>Concurrent Pressure&#8208;Induced Superconductivity and Photoconductivity Transitions in PbSe0.5Te0.5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concurrent superconductivity and negative photoconductivity (NPC) are discovered in PbSe0.5Te0.5 accompanying pressure&#8208;induced phase transitions. Both have a strong structure dependence and are jointly mediated by electron&#8208;phonon interplay, which is switchable via illumination or cooling at high&#8208;pressure. New findings offer more new insights into understanding the essence of photoelectric&#8208;lattice coupling and developing versatile materials of lead chalcogenides.








Abstract
Concurrent superconductivity and negative photoconductivity (NPC) are rarely observed. Here, the discovery in PbSe0.5Te0.5 of superconductivity and photoconductivity transitions between positive photoconductivity (PPC) and NPC during compression is reported to &#8776;40&#160;GPa and subsequent decompression, which are also accompanied by reversible structure transitions (3D Fm3&#175;${{\bar{3}}}$m &#8652; 2D Pnma &#8652; 3D Pm3&#175;${{\bar{3}}}$m). Superconductivity with a maximum Tc of &#8776;6.7 K coincides with NPC and structure transition of Pnma to Pm3&#175;${{\bar{3}}}$m at &#8776;18&#160;GPa and the latter phase is preserved down to &#8776;5&#160;GPa with enhanced Tc of &#8776;6.9 K during decompression. The observations imply the simultaneous superconducting and photoconductive transitions are closely related to the metallic Pm3&#175;${{\bar{3}}}$m phase. First&#8208;principles calculations suggest the enhanced p&#8208;p hybridization and charge transfer between Pb&#8208;5p and ligand&#8208;p orbitals near the Fermi surface play key roles in electron&#8208;phonon interaction of mediating the Cooper pairs in PbSe0.5Te0.5. Hall coefficient measurements reveal that photothermal effect enhances electron&#8208;phonon interplay, which decreases carrier concentration and mobility and results in the reversal of PPC&#8208;NPC. Structure&#8208;dependent superconductivity and NPC are jointly mediated by electron&#8208;phonon interplay, which is tunable through illumination or cooling at high&#8208;pressure. The findings shed light on the origin of superconductive and photoconductive transitions in versatile materials of lead chalcogenides.

         <title>Bioinspired Heterogeneous Surface for Radiative Cooling Enhanced Power&#8208;Free Moisture Harvesting in Unsaturated Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the Namib Pachydactylus Rangei, a Power&#8208;Free Cooling moisture harvester with Luneburg Lens Array is fabricated using Self&#8208;Developed &#956;&#8208;ECM process. The synergy between the surface and interface functions endows the PFCMH with Exceptional Passive sub&#8208;Dewpoint Cooling and Efficient Harvesting Performance. Installing every 1 m2 of PFCMH can Yield &#8776;294.5&#8211;490.6&#160;kg per year of water and Save &#8776;198.7&#8211;331.0&#160;kWh per year of electricity.








Abstract
The development of zero&#8208;power moisture&#8208;harvesting technology in an unsaturated atmosphere is of great significance for coping with global freshwater scarcity. Here, inspired by Pachydactylus rangei's&#160;(Namib sand gecko) ability to evade thermal radiation and harvest moisture, a power&#8208;free cooling moisture harvester (PFCMH) is fabricated using the continuous, industrialized micro&#8208;extrusion compression molding. A Luneburg lens is introduced in the PFCMH for the first time, endowing it with a high reflectivity of &#8776;92.9% in 0.3 to the 2.5&#160;&#181;m waveband and emissivity of &#8776;98.1% in 8&#8211;13&#160;&#181;m waveband, which are &#8776;19.2% and &#8776;15.4% higher than those of the unstructured radiative cooler, respectively. Consequently, a temperature reduction of &#8776;6.9 &#176;C is achieved. In addition, the wettability of PFCMH is well regulated, at a contact angle of &#8776;153&#176; and a rolling angle of &#8776;42&#176;, enabling its surface to efficiently nucleate and transport water droplets. The synergy between the surface and interface functions endows the PFCMH with exceptional passive sub&#8208;dewpoint cooling and efficient harvesting performance. Importantly, every 1 m2 of PFCMH can yield &#8776;294.5&#8211;490.6&#160;kg year&#8722;1 of water and save &#8776;198.7&#8211;331.0&#160;kWh year&#8722;1 of electricity. The PFCMH offers an environmentally, power&#8208;free, and promising solution to freshwater scarcity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of zero-power moisture-harvesting technology in an unsaturated atmosphere is of great significance for coping with global freshwater scarcity. Here, inspired by &lt;i&gt;Pachydactylus rangei's&lt;/i&gt;&#160;(Namib sand gecko) ability to evade thermal radiation and harvest moisture, a power-free cooling moisture harvester (PFCMH) is fabricated using the continuous, industrialized micro-extrusion compression molding. A Luneburg lens is introduced in the PFCMH for the first time, endowing it with a high reflectivity of &#8776;92.9% in 0.3 to the 2.5&#160;&#181;m waveband and emissivity of &#8776;98.1% in 8&#8211;13&#160;&#181;m waveband, which are &#8776;19.2% and &#8776;15.4% higher than those of the unstructured radiative cooler, respectively. Consequently, a temperature reduction of &#8776;6.9 &#176;C is achieved. In addition, the wettability of PFCMH is well regulated, at a contact angle of &#8776;153&#176; and a rolling angle of &#8776;42&#176;, enabling its surface to efficiently nucleate and transport water droplets. The synergy between the surface and interface functions endows the PFCMH with exceptional passive sub-dewpoint cooling and efficient harvesting performance. Importantly, every 1 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of PFCMH can yield &#8776;294.5&#8211;490.6&#160;kg year&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of water and save &#8776;198.7&#8211;331.0&#160;kWh year&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of electricity. The PFCMH offers an environmentally, power-free, and promising solution to freshwater scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bond Confinement&#8208;Dependent Peierls Distortion in Epitaxially Grown Bismuth Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper investigates the influence of thickness on the properties of thin epitaxial Bi films. It discusses results from optical, vibrational, and structural analyses, highlighting notable changes in dielectric function, phonon frequencies, and Peierls distortion. The competition between electron localization and delocalization is emphasized, showing how thickness reduction can tailor material properties without changing stoichiometry.








Abstract
A systematic study of the impact of film thickness on the properties of thin Bi films is presented. To this end, epitaxial films of high quality have been grown on a Si&#160;(111) substrate with thicknesses ranging from 1.9 to 29.9&#160;nm. Broadband optical spectroscopy reveals a notable decline in the optical dielectric constant and the absorption peak height as the film thickness decreases, alongside a shift of the absorption maximum to higher photon energies. Raman and pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy show that the phonon mode frequencies increase upon decreasing film thickness, with the in&#8208;plane mode frequency rising by 10% from the thickest to the thinnest sample. The X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals an increasing Peierls distortion for thinner films, explaining the observed property changes. Quantum chemical bonding analysis and density functional theory calculations show that the properties of thin bismuth are influenced by the interplay between electron localization and delocalization, characteristic of metavalently bonded solids. This study shows that for solids that utilize metavalent bonding, a thickness reduction leads to significant property changes. The effect can even be employed to tailor material properties without the need to change material stoichiometry.

         <title>The Critical Isomerization Effect of Core Bromination on Nonfullerene Acceptors in Achieving High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells with Low Energy Loss</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise bromination of the quinoxaline&#8208;fused core affords two isomeric nonfullerene acceptors, contributing to improved electronic and aggregation structures. AQx&#8208;22&#8208;based devices exhibit a superior PCE of 19.5% with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.97&#160;V and the lowest energy loss of 0.476&#160;eV reported to date for binary OSCs. Such an isomerization strategy shows great promise for developing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance OSCs.








Abstract
Highly efficient nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) for organic solar cells (OSCs) with low energy loss (Eloss) and favorable morphology are critical for breaking the efficiency bottleneck and achieving commercial applications of OSCs. In this work, quinoxaline&#8208;based NFAs are designed and synthesized using a synergistic isomerization and bromination approach. The &#960;&#8208;expanded quinoxaline&#8208;fused core exhibits different bromination sites for isomeric NFAs, namely AQx&#8208;21 and AQx&#8208;22. Theoretical and experimental analyses reveal that the isomerization effect of core bromination significantly influences molecular intrinsic properties, including electrostatic potentials, polarizability, dielectric constant, exciton binding energy, crystallinity, and miscibility with donor materials, thereby improving molecular packing and bulk&#8208;heterojunction morphology. Consequently, the AQx&#8208;22&#8208;based blend exhibits enhanced crystallinity, reduced domain size, and optimized phase distribution, which facilitates charge transport, suppresses charge recombination, and improves charge extraction. The AQx&#8208;22&#8208;treated OSCs obtain an impressive efficiency of 19.5% with a remarkable open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.970&#160;V and a low Eloss of 0.476&#160;eV. This study provides deep insights into NFA design and elucidates the potential working mechanisms for optimizing morphology and device performance through isomerization engineering of core bromination, highlighting its significance in advancing OSC technology.

         <title>Electro&#8208; and Photo&#8208; Dual Responsive Chromatic Devices for High&#8208;Contrast Dimmers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly transparent photochromic hydrogel electrolyte is developed, which not only serves as an electrolyte for zinc anode&#8208;based electrochromic devices but also provides a photochromic effect to reduce tinted transmittance. These dual&#8208;responsive dimmers address concerns about low transmittance contrast in electrochromic devices, representing a significant step forward for high&#8208;contrast dimming in dynamic windows and AR glasses.








Abstract
Electrochromism stands out as a highly promising technology for applications including variable optical attenuators, optical switches, transparent displays, and dynamic windows. The pursuit of high&#8208;contrast tunability in electrochromic devices remains a challenging goal. Here, the first photochromic hydrogel electrolyte is reported for electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;dual responsive chromatic devices that yield a high transmittance contrast at 633&#160;nm (&#916;T = 83.1%), along with a tinted transmittance below 1.5%. Such high&#8208;contrast devices not only hold great promise for dynamic windows but also enable seamless transitions between transparent augmented reality (AR) glass and opaque virtual reality (VR) glass. These findings introduce an innovative strategy for the design of high&#8208;contrast dimmers, opening new avenues for the development of chromatic devices.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the emerging role of CMOFs and CCOFs in heterogeneous asymmetric catalysis. It provides an overview of recent advancements in design strategies, synthetic approaches, and catalytic applications, discussing the structure&#8211;property relationships that connect their unique structural features to enantioselective performance, while also outlining future challenges and opportunities.








Abstract
Asymmetric catalysis is essential for addressing the increasing demand for enantiopure compounds. Recent advances in reticular chemistry have demonstrated that metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possess highly regular porous architectures, exceptional tunability, and the ability to incorporate chiral functionalities through their open channels or cavities. These characteristics make them highly effective and enantioselective catalysts for a wide range of asymmetric transformations. The chiral microenvironments within these frameworks facilitate precise control over reactant orientation and transition states, enhancing both catalytic activity and enantioselectivity, thereby offering significant advantages over traditional systems. This review overviews recent developments in chiral MOFs (CMOFs) and chiral COFs (CCOFs), focusing on their design strategies, and synthetic methods, and highlights the structure&#8211;property relationships that connect key structural features to asymmetric catalytic performance. Additionally, the current challenges and future prospects in this field are addressed, highlighting the pivotal role of reticular chemistry in the creation of chiral porous materials. It is anticipated that this review will inspire further research into the application of crystalline porous materials in asymmetric catalysis and promote the rational design of novel chiral heterogeneous catalysts for industrial use.

         <title>Large Dipole Moment Enhanced CO2 Adsorption on Copper Surface: Achieving 68.9% Catalytic Ethylene Faradaic Efficiency at 1.0 A cm&#8722;2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(2&#8208;aminoazulene), featured with a substantial dipole moment and abundant Lewis base amino groups, enhances the adsorption and boosts the reduction of carbon dioxide on Cu surface, yielding impressive ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 68.9% at 1 A cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into hydrocarbon products emerges as a pivotal sustainable strategy for carbon utilization.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Tuned Plasticity for Various Binder&#8208;Free Applications of a New Lead&#8208;Free Manganese Halide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lead&#8208;free metal halide CPTP2MnBr4 exhibits solvent&#8208;tuned plasticity, enabling the formation of binder&#8208;free thin films without requiring heat treatment. This unique property allows versatile processing into luminescent clay, direct ink writing patterns, and uniform thin layers, overcoming the limitations of conventional binder systems. These characteristics highlight its potential for applications in WLEDs, scintillators, and next&#8208;generation &#956;&#8208;LED displays.








Abstract
The development of efficient color conversion layers for &#956;&#8208;LED technology faces significant challenges owing to the limitations of materials that require binders. Binders are typically used to ensure uniform film formation in color&#8208;conversion layers, but they often cause optical losses, increase layer thickness, and introduce long&#8208;term stability issues. To address the limitations of materials requiring binders, cyclopropyltriphenylphosphonium manganese tetrabromide (CPTP2MnBr4) is synthesized, a novel lead&#8208;free metal halide. CPTP2MnBr4 exhibits unique solvent&#8208;based plasticity, which enables the formation of uniform films thinner than those formed with binders without the need for either heat treatment or binders. This approach eliminates the performance degradation typically associated with conventional binder systems such as optical losses and stability issues. Structural and optical analyses confirm its high luminescence efficiency and stability, supporting its potential applications in luminescent clays, direct ink writing, pattern printing, and ink drawing. Moreover, its successful application in white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs) and scintillators demonstrates that CPTP2MnBr4 can replace traditional binder systems, offering a solution to overcome the technical challenges in next&#8208;generation displays, lighting, and scintillator technologies.

         <title>A Separator with Double Layers Individually Modified by LiAlO2 Solid Electrolyte and Conductive Carbon for High&#8208;performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge transfer resistance of Li&#8211;S using the modified separator is reduced. In addition, there is no corrosion and the lithium anode is dendrite&#8208;free. The &#8216;shuttle effect&#8217; of polysulfides is greatly suppressed.








Abstract
The &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; and the unchecked growth of lithium dendrites during operation in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries seriously impact their practical applications. Besides, the performances of Li&#8211;S batteries at high current densities and sulfur loadings hold the key to bridge the gap between laboratory research and practical applications. To address the above issues and facilitate the practical utilization of Li&#8211;S batteries, the commercial separator is modified with solid electrolyte (nanorod LiAlO2, LAO) and conductive carbon (Super P) to obtain a double coated separator (SPLAOMS). The SPLAOMS can physically barrier polysulfides and accelerate reaction kinetics. In addition, it enhances uniform lithium deposition, boosts ionic conductivity, and increases the utilization of active sulfur substances. The prepared Li&#8211;S batteries exhibit excellent cycling stability under harsh conditions (high sulfur loadings and high current densities) with an initial capacity of 733 mAh g&#8722;1 and a capacity attenuation of 0.03% per cycle at 5C in 500 cycle life. Under ultra&#8208;high sulfur loading (8.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;2), the prepared battery maintains a satisfactory capacity of 800 mAh g&#8722;1 during cycling, demonstrating enormous commercial application potential. This study serves as a pivotal reference for the commercialization of high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>A Universal Strategy to Mitigate Microphase Separation via Cellulose Nanocrystal Hydration in Fabricating Strong, Tough, and Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal phase&#8208;engineering strategy is reported to achieve mechanically robust hydrogels by tuning microphase separation using cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) and common compatible polymer systems. CNC plays a crucial role in contributing to mitigating microphase separation for strengthening and toughening hydrogels. Benefiting from the CNC&#8208;mitigated microphase separation structure, the enabling hydrogel exhibits unprecedented combinations in mechanical properties.








Abstract
As a common natural phenomenon, phase separation is exploited for the development of high&#8208;performance hydrogels. Using supersaturated salt to create microphase&#8208;separated hydrogels with strengthened mechanical properties has gained widespread attention. However, such strengthened hydrogel loses its intrinsic flexibility, making the phase separation strategy unsuitable for the fabrication of stretchable and tough hydrogels. Here, a phase&#8208;engineering design strategy is introduced to produce stretchable yet tough hydrogels using supersaturated NaAc salt, by leveraging the hydration effect of cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) to mitigate microphase separation. The CNC&#8208;mitigated microphase&#8208;separated hydrogel presents unprecedented mechanical properties, for example, tensile strength of 1.8&#160;MPa with a fracture strain of 4730%, toughness of 43.1&#160;MJ m&#8722;3, fracture energy of 75.4&#160;kJ m&#8722;2, and fatigue threshold up to 3884.7 J m&#8722;2. Furthermore, this approach is universal in synthesizing various microphase separation&#8208;enhanced polymer gels, including polyacrylic acid, poly(acrylic acid&#8208;co&#8208;acrylamide), gelatin, and alginate. These advancements provide insights into the incorporation of CNC&#8208;mediated microphase separation structures in hydrogels, which will foster the future development of high&#8208;performance soft materials.

         <title>An Adaptable Structure of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Glass Interlayer Enables Superior Performance in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) glass, i.e., Zn&#8208;ZIF62 glass, is used to overcome the inadequate structural stability and rapid failure of the Zn&#8208;ZIF62 crystal. When prepared as an artificial interlayer on the Zn metal anode, the heightened configuration freedom of MOF glass endows the stress&#8208;resisted ion transport and the extended Zn2+ ion diffusion pathway, thus achieving high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The practical application of safe and cost&#8208;effective aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries is enhanced by the metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), which possess tunable porous structures and chemical compositions that can facilitate the desolvation and transport of Zn2+ ions at the anode interface. However, ensuring the structural stability and operational life of crystalline MOFs in batteries remains a challenge. Here, a breakthrough is presented in tackling this dilemma. A MOF glass interlayer, specifically the ZIF&#8208;62 glass interlayer, is designed and fabricated for the Zn anode. The integration of this interlayer endows the Zn anode with a remarkable cyclic lifespan. It also achieves outstanding cyclability in Zn||MnO2 full&#8208;cell with limited Zn excess, showing no capacity decay after 600 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1, and in a Zn||iodine pouch battery with a mass loading of 12.85&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. This superior cyclicity is attributed to the ease of distortion of Zn[ligand]4 tetrahedra and the reduced likelihood of disconnection between adjacent tetrahedra within the glass interlayer, as compared to its crystalline counterpart. The unique structure of ZIF&#8208;62 glass provides an increased degree of configurational freedom, allowing it to withstand mechanical stress and extend the Zn2+ ion diffusion pathway. This ensures high cycling stability and rapid interfacial diffusion kinetics.

The unique structure of ZIF-62 glass provides an increased degree of configurational freedom, allowing it to withstand mechanical stress and extend the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion diffusion pathway. This ensures high cycling stability and rapid interfacial diffusion kinetics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Dependent Nonlinear Optical Effects in Spiral WS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nonlinear response of spiral 2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides can be tailored on&#8208;demand through novel structural designs (such as aligned&#8208; and twisted&#8208;triangular spiral nanosheets) with scalable and reproducible method, which is beneficial to the integrated photonics and lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip quantum devices.








Abstract
Spiral transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides with broken crystal inversion symmetry and significant second&#8208;order nonlinear responses have shown great promise for further nonlinear optical applications. However, various spiral structures will be formed during their synthesis process, their second harmonic generation (SHG) varying with the layer thickness and which of them manifesting the most promising SHG response are still unresolved. Here, the layer&#8208;dependent SHG response is investigated for four representative spiral WS2 with different screw and twist angles, including aligned&#8208; and twisted&#8208;triangular spiral structures, aligned&#8208; and twisted&#8208;hexagonal spiral structures, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that both aligned&#8208; and twisted&#8208;hexagonal spiral WS2 present weak SHG response. In contrast, the SHG signal of the aligned&#8208;triangular spiral WS2 almost quadratically increases with the lift of their thickness, which is two orders of magnitude stronger than hexagonal structures. Moreover, an oscillating layer&#8208;dependence SHG response for twisted&#8208;triangular spiral WS2 has been attributed to the restored inversion symmetry. The underlying mechanism has been explored by the evolution of their crystal symmetry. The results not only disclose that the nonlinear response of the spiral WS2 can be tailored on&#8208;demand through the novel structural designs, but also pave the way to scalable integrated photonics and lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip quantum devices based on spiral layered materials.

         <title>In Operando Locally&#8208;Resolved Photophysics in Perovskite Solar Cells by Correlation Clustering Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Correlation clustering imaging (CLIM) exploits local intensity fluctuations observed by fluorescence microscopy in metal&#8208;halide perovskite films and their solar cells to generate novel contrasts uncovering the spatial dynamics of charge carrier transport, recombination losses, and material restructuring.








Abstract
The instability of metal halide perovskites limits the commercialization of solar cells despite their impressive efficiencies. This instability, driven by photo&#8208;induced ion migration, leads to material restructuring, defect formation, degradation, and defect healing. However, these same &#8220;unwanted&#8221; properties enable to propose Correlation Clustering Imaging (CLIM), a technique that detects local photoluminescence (PL) fluctuations through wide&#8208;field fluorescence microscopy. It is shown that such fluctuations are present in high&#8208;quality perovskites and their corresponding solar cells. CLIM successfully visualizes the polycrystalline grain structure in perovskite films, closely matching electron microscopy images. The analysis of fluctuations reveals a dominant metastable defect responsible for the fluctuations. In solar cells in short&#8208;circuit conditions, these fluctuations are significantly larger, and corresponding correlated regions extend up to 10 micrometers, compared to 2 micrometers in films. It is proposed that the regions resolved by CLIM in solar cells possess a common pool of charge extraction channels, which fluctuate and cause PL to vary. Since PL fluctuations reflect non&#8208;radiative recombination processes, CLIM provides valuable insights into the structural and functional dynamics of carrier transport, ion migration, defect behavior, and recombination losses. CLIM offers a non&#8208;invasive approach to understanding luminescent materials and devices in operando, utilizing contrasts based on previously untapped properties.

         <title>Multifunctional Quasi&#8208;Homogeneous Catalysts as a New Catalytic Strategy to Boost the Performance of Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional quasi&#8208;homogeneous catalyst strategy with Ru&#8208;loaded amino&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;based carbonized polymer dots (RuApCPDs) well&#8208;dispersed in the electrolyte is developed. Together with the ability to facilitate Li2O2 formation and decomposition, modify electrolytes, and protect Li metal anode, RuApCPDs render Li&#8208;O2 batteries with comprehensively improved performance, offering brand&#8208;new catalyst design strategies for Li&#8208;O2 batteries.








Abstract
Li&#8208;O2 batteries have been considered as a kind of prospective next&#8208;generation batteries due to their ultrahigh energy densities. However, limited capacities, high charge overpotentials, and short lifetime are troubling obstacles for realizing their real&#8208;world implementation. Common strategies, including introducing solid&#8208;state catalysts (SSCs) and redox mediators (RMs), are insufficient to solve these issues. Herein, Ru&#8208;loaded amino&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;based carbonized polymer dots (RuApCPDs) integrating the catalytic activity of SSCs with the mobility of RMs have been designed to behave as quasi&#8208;homogeneous catalysts in the electrolyte. Their mobile nature can ensure the avoidance of complete coverage of active sites, and the catalytic ability decreases the charge overpotential through co&#8208;deposition with the discharge products. Additionally, the RuApCPDs can also adjust the Li+ solvation structure and well protect the Li metal anodes with high stability. As a result, the introduction of RuApCPDs leads to a fivefold increase in discharge capacity, a low charge voltage of 3.75 V, and a running life of 168 cycles (79 cycles without RuApCPDs). The multifunctional quasi&#8208;homogeneous catalyst developed here demonstrates its advantageous potential as a new catalytic strategy for bringing Li&#8208;O2 batteries to become a viable technology.

         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom cocatalysts (SACs) in photocatalysis are comprehensively discussed, with a focus on often&#8208;overlooked aspects of general concepts and understanding. Key principles, challenges, and recent advancements are covered, highlighting the self&#8208;homing effect as a promising avenue for designing SACs with maximized efficiency and unexpected features.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom (SA) cocatalysts (SACs) have garnered significant attention in photocatalysis due to their unique electronic properties and high atom utilization efficiency. This review provides an overview of the concept and principles of SA cocatalyst in photocatalysis, emphasizing the intrinsic differences to SAs used in classic chemical catalysis. Key factors that influence the efficiency of SAs in photocatalytic reactions, particularly in photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production, are highlighted. This review further covers synthesis methods, stabilization strategies, and characterization techniques for common SAs used in photocatalysis. Notably, &#8220;reactive deposition&#8221; method, which often shows a self&#8208;homing effect and thus achieves a maximum utilization efficiency of SA cocatalysts, is emphasized. Furthermore, the applications of SA cocatalysts in various photocatalytic processes, including H2 evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, nitrogen fixation, and organic synthesis, are comprehensively reviewed, along with insights into common artifacts in these applications. This review concludes by addressing the challenges faced by SACs in photocatalysis and offering perspectives on future developments, with the aim of informing and advancing research on SAs for photocatalytic energy conversion.

         <title>Rejuvenation Modulation of Nucleus Pulposus Progenitor Cells Reverses Senescence&#8208;Associated Intervertebral Disc Degeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The declined regeneration potential of aging NPPCs fails to antagonize IVDD. The in&#8208;house&#8208;customized lipid nanoparticles efficiently introduce Klotho circRNA into NPPCs to engender a renascent phenotypic and attune the balance of ECM synthesis/catabolism. Moreover, chemokine&#8208;scavenging hydrogel reservoir in tandem with NPPCs rejuvenated NT&#8208;LNPs enlists the regenerative capacity of resident NPPCs and restoration of youthful structure and functional features to the IVD.








Abstract
The decreased regeneration potential of aging nucleus pulposus resident progenitor cells (NPPCs) fails to resist intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD), and strategies to remodel the regeneration capacity of senescent NPPC are urgently needed. A decrease in Klotho gene expression in NPPCs of both old mice and humans exacerbates the impaired regenerative functionality of NPPC. Here, an NPPC&#8208;targeted lipid thymine nanoparticle (NT&#8208;LNP) is reported for the in situ manipulation of the regenerative repair potential of NPPCs, restoration of degenerated nucleus pulposus tissue, and mitigation of IVDD. Specifically, the results showed that the in&#8208;house customized lipid nanoparticles efficiently introduced Klotho circular ribonucleic acid (circRNA) into NPPCs to engender a renascent phenotype and tuned the balance of extracellular matrix synthesis/catabolism in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, an intradiscal injectable hydrogel system that scavenges chemokines (MCP1 and IL8) in tandem with NPPCs rejuvenated NT&#8208;LNPs in the IVD, modulating the inflammatory environment and synergistically promoting the regeneration of degenerated intervertebral discs. In summary, the findings establish that NPPCs can be re&#8208;engineered to be youthful and pluripotent to maintain homeostasis and rejuvenation, thereby providing a reversible treatment strategy for IVDD with broad application in other senescence&#8208;related diseases.

&lt;p&gt;The declined regeneration potential of aging NPPCs fails to antagonize IVDD. The in-house-customized lipid nanoparticles efficiently introduce Klotho circRNA into NPPCs to engender a renascent phenotypic and attune the balance of ECM synthesis/catabolism. Moreover, chemokine-scavenging hydrogel reservoir in tandem with NPPCs rejuvenated NT-LNPs enlists the regenerative capacity of resident NPPCs and restoration of youthful structure and functional features to the IVD.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decreased regeneration potential of aging nucleus pulposus resident progenitor cells (NPPCs) fails to resist intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD), and strategies to remodel the regeneration capacity of senescent NPPC are urgently needed. A decrease in Klotho gene expression in NPPCs of both old mice and humans exacerbates the impaired regenerative functionality of NPPC. Here, an NPPC-targeted lipid thymine nanoparticle (NT-LNP) is reported for the in situ manipulation of the regenerative repair potential of NPPCs, restoration of degenerated nucleus pulposus tissue, and mitigation of IVDD. Specifically, the results showed that the in-house customized lipid nanoparticles efficiently introduced Klotho circular ribonucleic acid (circRNA) into NPPCs to engender a renascent phenotype and tuned the balance of extracellular matrix synthesis/catabolism in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, an intradiscal injectable hydrogel system that scavenges chemokines (MCP1 and IL8) in tandem with NPPCs rejuvenated NT-LNPs in the IVD, modulating the inflammatory environment and synergistically promoting the regeneration of degenerated intervertebral discs. In summary, the findings establish that NPPCs can be re-engineered to be youthful and pluripotent to maintain homeostasis and rejuvenation, thereby providing a reversible treatment strategy for IVDD with broad application in other senescence-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Alternative Concepts for Extruded Power Cable Insulation: from Thermosets to Thermoplastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crosslinked polyethylene is the most widely used insulation material for extruded high&#8208;voltage power cables. This perspective explores alternative concepts such as click chemistry type curing, polyolefin blends and adaptable networks, which avoid hazardous crosslinking agents and the release of harmful byproducts. Moreover, insulation materials that remain thermoplastic may ease reprocessing once the cable has reached the end of its lifetime.








Abstract
The most common type of insulation of extruded high&#8208;voltage power cables is composed of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE), which must be crosslinked to adjust its thermomechanical properties. A major drawback is the need for hazardous curing agents and the release of harmful curing byproducts during cable production, while the thermoset nature complicates reprocessing of the insulation material. This perspective explores recent progress in the development of alternative concepts that allow to avoid byproducts through either click chemistry type curing of polyethylene&#8208;based copolymers or the use of polyolefin blends or copolymers, which entirely removes the need for crosslinking. Moreover, polypropylene&#8208;based thermoplastic formulations enable the design of insulation materials that can withstand higher cable operating temperatures and facilitate reprocessing by remelting once the cable reaches the end of its lifetime. Finally, polyethylene&#8208;based covalent and non&#8208;covalent adaptable networks are explored, which may allow to combine the advantages of thermoset and thermoplastic insulation materials in terms of thermomechanical properties and reprocessability.

         <title>Probing Electronic Band Structures of Dielectric Polymers via Pre&#8208;Breakdown Conduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer dielectrics with higher operational electric fields are essential elements to fulfill the future needs of pulse power, power conditioning, and electrification applications. A novel methodology is demonstrated to detect the field&#8208;and&#8208;temperature dependent conduction under extremely high prebreakdown electric field (&gt;700&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1).








Abstract
The electronic band structure, especially the defect states at the conduction band tail, dominates electron transport and electrical degradation of a dielectric material under an extremely high electric field. However, the electronic band structure in a dielectric is barely well studied due to experimental challenges in detecting the electrical conduction to an extremely high electric field, i.e., prebreakdown. In this work, the electronic band structure of polymer dielectric films is probed through an in situ prebreakdown conduction measurement method in conjunction with a space&#8208;charge&#8208;limited&#8208;current spectroscopic analysis. An exponential distribution of defect states at the conduction band tail with varying trap levels is observed in accordance with the specific morphological disorder in the polymer dielectric, and the experimental defect states show also a favorable agreement with the calculated density of states from the density functional theory. The methodology demonstrated in this work bridges the molecule&#8208;structure&#8208;determined electronic band structure and the macro electrical conduction behavior with a highly improved understanding of material properties that control the electrical breakdown, and paves a way for guiding the modification of existing material and the exploration of novel materials for high electric field applications.

         <title>Pendant Group Functionalization of Cyclic Olefin for High Temperature and High&#8208;Density Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic pendant group functionalization of all&#8208;organic polyolefin dielectric for use in capacitive energy storage under harsh operating conditions. This work establishes the relationship between polymer structure and material, thermal, electrical properties with energy density as high as 7.1 J cc&#8722;1 at 200&#160;&#176;C. This work provides a framework for designing high temperature and high energy density polymer dielectric.









Abstract
High&#8208;temperature flexible polymer dielectrics are critical for high density energy storage and conversion. The need to simultaneously possess a high bandgap, dielectric constant and glass transition temperature forms a substantial design challenge for novel dielectric polymers. Here, by varying halogen substituents of an aromatic pendant hanging off a bicyclic mainchain polymer, a class of high&#8208;temperature olefins with adjustable thermal stability are obtained, all with uncompromised large bandgaps. Halogens substitution of the pendant groups at para or ortho position of polyoxanorborneneimides (PONB) imparts it with tunable high glass transition from 220 to 245&#160;&#176;C, while with high breakdown strength of 625&#8211;800&#160;MV/m. A high energy density of 7.1 J/cc at 200&#160;&#176;C is achieved with p&#8208;POClNB, representing the highest energy density reported among homo&#8208;polymers. Molecular dynamic simulations and ultrafast infrared spectroscopy are used to probe the free volume element distribution and chain relaxations pertinent to dielectric thermal properties. An increase in free volume element is observed with the change in the pendant group from fluorine to bromine at the para position; however, smaller free volume element is observed for the same pendant when at the ortho position due to steric hindrance. With the dielectric constant and bandgap remaining stable, properly designing the pendant groups of PONB boosts its thermal stability for high density electrification.

Nature has evolved to repair small fractures by leveraging the cellular and molecular components of regenerative hematoma (RH). This study introduces a biocooperative material approach that enables the use of key endogenous molecules and processes to engineer living regenerative biomaterials with tuneable structural and biological properties. in vitro and in vivo validation is demonstrated.








Abstract
The immune system has evolved to heal small ruptures and fractures with remarkable efficacy through regulation of the regenerative hematoma (RH); a rich and dynamic environment that coordinates numerous molecular and cellular processes to achieve complete repair. Here, a biocooperative approach that harnesses endogenous molecules and natural healing to engineer personalized regenerative materials is presented. Peptide amphiphiles (PAs) are co&#8208;assembled with blood components during coagulation to engineer a living material that exhibits key compositional and structural properties of the RH. By exploiting non&#8208;selective and selective PA&#8208;blood interactions, the material can be immediately manipulated, mechanically&#8208;tuned, and 3D printed. The material preserves normal platelet behavior, generates and provides a continuous source of growth factors, and promotes in vitro growth of mesenchymal stromal cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. Furthermore, using a personalized autologous approach to convert whole blood into PA&#8208;blood gel implants, bone regeneration is shown in a critical&#8208;sized rat calvarial defect. This study provides proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for a biocooperative approach that goes beyond biomimicry by using mechanisms that Nature has evolved to heal as tools to engineer accessible, personalized, and regenerative biomaterials that can be readily formed at point of use.

         <title>Jamming Giant Molecules at Interface in Organic Photovoltaics to Improve Performance and Stability</title>

A giant molecule designated DQx&#8208;Ph is synthesized, characterized by a reduced Huang&#8208;Rhys parameter and suppressed non&#8208;radiative energy loss. Through the implementation of an interface&#8208;enhanced layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer fabrication strategy, DQx&#8208;Ph giant molecules are successfully jammed at the interface of donor and acceptor crystalline fibrils. This configuration preserves the superior transport properties of PM6 and L8&#8208;BO while integrating the high open&#8208;circuit voltage and thermodynamically stable characteristics of DQx&#8208;Ph. Consequently, the organic photovoltaic device exhibits a high efficiency of 19.9%, along with improved operational stability.








Abstract
A novel approach for depositing the giant molecule acceptor (GMA) at the donor&#8211;acceptor interface to enhance the efficiency and stability of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices through a designed interface&#8208;enhanced layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer device fabrication protocol is proposed. The giant molecule acceptor DQx&#8208;Ph is mixed with the polymer donor in the bottom layer to form a polymer donor fibril phase and a mixed phase, followed by subsequent deposition of the main acceptor L8&#8208;BO. The L8&#8208;BO solution swells the bottom layer and alters the localized morphology of the mixing phase, introducing L8&#8208;BO fibrillar crystallization and pushing DQx&#8208;Ph giant molecules outwards to the fibril interfaces. Through this approach, the localized morphology and optoelectronic property of the bulk heterojunction are optimized. This configuration maintains the superior transport properties of L8&#8208;BO while integrating the high open&#8208;circuit voltage characteristics of DQx&#8208;Ph. Additionally, exciton dissociation and charge generation are simultaneously enhanced, with suppressed energy losses. A power conversion efficiency of 19.9% with improved operational stability is achieved, underscoring the importance of GMA interface jamming in advancing OPV technology. This study provides new insights into the development of ancillary OPV materials to overcome the critical limitations in OPV, revealing innovative approaches for photovoltaic technologies.

&lt;p&gt;A giant molecule designated DQx-Ph is synthesized, characterized by a reduced Huang-Rhys parameter and suppressed non-radiative energy loss. Through the implementation of an interface-enhanced layer-by-layer fabrication strategy, DQx-Ph giant molecules are successfully jammed at the interface of donor and acceptor crystalline fibrils. This configuration preserves the superior transport properties of PM6 and L8-BO while integrating the high open-circuit voltage and thermodynamically stable characteristics of DQx-Ph. Consequently, the organic photovoltaic device exhibits a high efficiency of 19.9%, along with improved operational stability.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Detection of Chemokines in Clinical Samples with Graphene&#8208;Based Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>

Field&#8208;effect transistors based on the van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure of single&#8208;layer graphene and 1&#160;nm thick molecular carbon nanomembrane (CNM) are employed for detection of biomarkers in clinical samples. Functionalization of CNMs with biostable aptamers in their non&#8208;natural l&#8208;configuration enables highly specific and rapid detection of inflammatory mediator CXCL8/IL&#8208;8 within the concentration range of 0.5 &#8211; 500 pM.








Abstract
Due to their ultra&#8208;high sensitivity, solution&#8208;gated graphene&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistors (SG&#8208;GFET) have been proposed for applications in bio&#8208;sensing. However, challenges regarding the functionalization of GFETs have prevented their applications in clinical diagnostics so far. Here GFET sensors based on van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures of single&#8208;layer graphene layered with a molecular &#8776;1&#160;nm thick carbon nanomembrane (CNM) are presented. The CNM acts as an ultrathin molecular interposer between the graphene channel and the analyte and allows bio&#8208;functionalization without impairing the graphene properties including its charge carrier mobility. To achieve specificity and reliability in the detection of biomarkers in real patient samples, the functionalization incorporates biostable aptamers in the non&#8208;natural l&#8208;configuration and hydrophilic polyethylene glycol for avoiding non&#8208;specific adsorption. A rapid (&#8776;5&#160;min) detection of the clinically relevant inflammatory mediator CXCL8/IL&#8208;8 within the concentration range of 0.5 &#8211; 500 pM (5 &#8211; 5000 pg&#160;ml&#8722;1) is demonstrated in nasal swab samples collected from patients with respiratory tract infections. This detection range may aid in diagnostics of early&#8208;stage infectious diseases making the reported approach promising for the development of future medical tools.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Phase Singularity at a Single Incident Angle with Spectral Tunability in Tamm Cavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Realizing multiple&#8208;phase singularities is important for phase engineering in flat optics, and to improve the detection limit of refractive index sensors. The existence of a dual&#8208;phase singularity at a single incident angle with spectral tunability and its application for ultra&#8208;sensitive hydrogen sensing is presented using phase change material&#8208;based tunable Tamm plasmon polariton cavities.








Abstract
The phase singularity, a sudden phase change occurring at the reflection zero is widely explored using various nanophotonic systems such as metamaterials and thin film cavities. Typically, these systems exhibit a single reflection zero with a phase singularity at a specific incident angle, particularly at larger angles of incidence (&gt;50 degrees). However, achieving multiple phase singularities at a single incident angle remains a formidable challenge. Here, the existence of a dual&#8208;phase singularity is experimentally demonstrated at a lower incident angle using a tunable Tamm plasmon polariton (TPP) cavity that consists of gold&#8208;coated ultralow&#8208;loss phase change material Sb2S3&#8208;based distributed Bragg reflector. It can excite narrowband TPP resonances from normal incidence to a wide angle of incidence for both s&#8208; and p&#8208;polarizations of light. Notably, this TPP cavity shows dual&#8208;phase singularity at lower angles of incidence since the excited TPP for s&#8208; and p&#8208;polarizations exhibits zero reflection at slightly different wavelengths for the same incident angle. A TPP cavity&#8208;based scalable hydrogen sensor is proposed and shows that the dual&#8208;phase singularity can further improve the sensitivity of singular phase&#8208;based sensing approaches. Moreover, spectrally tunable dual&#8208;phase singularity is experimentally demonstrated at a lower incident angle using a metal&#8208;free Tamm cavity.

         <title>Synergistic Catalytic Sites in High&#8208;Entropy Metal Hydroxide Organic Framework for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy metal hydroxide organic framework (HE&#8208;MHOF) is synthesized, combining five transition metals in a single&#8208;phase crystalline structure. The material exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction, rivaling precious metal&#8208;based catalysts. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and ab initio calculations reveal synergistic catalytic sites and the underlying reaction mechanism, demonstrating the potential of high&#8208;entropy materials for sustainable energy technologies.









Abstract
The integration of multiple elements in a high&#8208;entropy state is crucial in the design of high&#8208;performance, durable electrocatalysts. High&#8208;entropy metal hydroxide organic frameworks (HE&#8208;MHOFs) are synthesized under mild solvothermal conditions. This novel crystalline metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) features a random, homogeneous distribution of cations within high&#8208;entropy hydroxide layers. HE&#8208;MHOF exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), reaching a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8776;1.64 VRHE, and demonstrates remarkable durability, maintaining a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 100 h. Notably, HE&#8208;MHOF outperforms precious metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts despite containing only &#8776;60% OER active metals. Ab initio calculations and operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) demonstrate that the high&#8208;entropy catalyst contains active sites that facilitate a multifaceted OER mechanism. This study highlights the benefits of high&#8208;entropy MOFs in developing noble metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts, reducing reliance on precious metals, lowering metal loading (especially for Ni, Co, and Mn), and ultimately reducing costs for sustainable water electrolysis technologies.

Bottom&#8208;up assembly of lipid&#8208;based nanoparticles from mixed micelles containing di&#8208;anionic lipids yield charge&#8208;stabilized nanodiscs (CNDs). CNDs exhibit enhanced tumor accumulation compared to spherical liposomes. Surface chemistry modification via the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) technique improves tumor&#8208;targeting properties compared to LbL&#8208;liposomes. The insights presented can improve the assembly of delivery vehicles and expand the use of lipid&#8208;based discoidal assemblies.








Abstract
Nanoparticles have the potential to improve disease treatment and diagnosis due to their ability to incorporate drugs, alter pharmacokinetics, and enable tissue targeting. While considerable effort is placed on developing spherical lipid&#8208;based nanocarriers, recent evidence suggests that high aspect ratio lipid nanocarriers can exhibit enhanced disease site targeting and altered cellular interactions. However, the assembly of lipid&#8208;based nanoparticles into non&#8208;spherical morphologies has typically required incorporating additional agents such as synthetic polymers, proteins, lipid&#8208;polymer conjugates, or detergents. Here, charged lipid headgroups are used to generate stable discoidal lipid nanoparticles from mixed micelles, which are termed charge&#8208;stabilized nanodiscs (CNDs). The ability to generate CNDs in buffers with physiological ionic strength is restricted to lipids with more than one anionic group, whereas monovalent lipids only generate small nanoliposomal assemblies. In mice, the smaller size and anisotropic shape of CNDs promote higher accumulation in subcutaneous tumors than spherical liposomes. Further, the surface chemistry of CNDs can be modified via layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) assembly to improve their tumor&#8208;targeting properties over state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art LbL&#8208;liposomes when tested using a metastatic model of ovarian cancer. The application of charge&#8208;mediated anisotropy in lipid&#8208;based assemblies can aid in the future design of biomaterials and cell&#8208;membrane mimetic structures.

         <title>The Role of Hydrogen in ReRAM</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantitative measurements reveal high concentrations of hydrogen across many Redox&#8208;based resistive random access memory (ReRAM) devices, exceeding critical thresholds. Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry confirms that this hydrogen diffuses across the reactive interface under electrical biasing, indicating a significant impact on resistive switching. These findings highlight the necessity of incorporating hydrogen dynamics into ReRAM models and the importance of precise impurity control during fabrication to optimize device performance.








Abstract
Previous research on transistor gate oxides reveals a clear link between hydrogen content and oxide breakdown. This has implications for redox&#8208;based resistive random access memory (ReRAM) devices, which exploit soft, reversible, dielectric breakdown, as hydrogen is often not considered in modeling or measured experimentally. Here quantitative measurements, corroborated across multiple techniques are reported, that reveal ReRAM devices, whether manufactured in a university setting or research foundry, contain concentrations of hydrogen at levels likely to impact resistance switching behavior. To the knowledge this is the first empirical measurement depth profiling hydrogen concentration through a ReRAM device. Applying a recently&#8208;developed Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry analysis technique enables to measure hydrogen diffusion across the interfaces of SiOx ReRAM devices as a result of operation. These techniques can be applied to a broad range of devices to further understand ReRAM operation. Careful control of temperatures, precursors, and exposure to ambient during fabrication should limit hydrogen concentration. Additionally, using thin oxynitride or TiO2 capping layers should prevent diffusion of hydrogen and other contaminants into devices during operation. Applying these principles to ReRAM devices will enable considerable, informed, improvements in performance.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence by Confining Isolated Chromophores with Chiral Counterions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of confining isolated chromophores is used to achieve circularly polarized phosphorescence with glum up to 0.13 and &#934;P up to 43.2%. The isolated chromophore is confined by chiral counterions with asymmetric stacking through multiple ionic bonds, which not only suppress the non&#8208;radiative transitions of the triplet excitons for phosphorescence enhancement, but also construct a rigid chiral molecular environment for efficient chirality transfer and amplification. Moreover, chiral light transformation and multiple information encryption are demonstrated in photoelectric devices.








Abstract
Organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) featuring circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is highly valuable in chiroptoelectronics, but the trade&#8208;off issue between luminescence efficiency (&#934;) and dissymmetry factor (glum) is still challenging to be solved. Here, chiroptical ionic crystals (R/S&#8208;DNP) are constructed through ionization&#8208;induced assembly, in which isolated chromophore of carboxylic anion is tightly confined by the surrounding chiral counterions. The long&#8208;range ordered and chiral counterions with asymmetric stacking are closely connected with isolated chromophores for molecular assembly via high&#8208;density electrostatic interactions, thus enabling the simultaneous realization of excellent single&#8208;molecule RTP emission and efficient chirality transfer. The synchronous enhancement of &#934;P and glum is further achieved as 43.2% and 0.13, respectively. In view of the excellent CPL performances, the ionic materials hold the promising chiroptical encryption via programmable control in an electric&#8208;driven circularly polarized phosphorescent device. This result not only makes deeper insights into the relationship between the structure and chiral RTP property but also provides a guide to developing highly efficient chiroptical materials for potential applications.

         <title>Biomass&#8208;Derived Carbon With Large Interlayer Spacing for Anode of Potassium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput carbon with a large interlayer spacing of 0.44&#160;nm is obtained via a zinc&#8208;assisted pyrolysis of lignin, whose unique structure endows it with excellent rate capability and cycle durability for anodes of potassium ion batteries.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are emerging as powerful candidate for grid&#8208;oriented energy storage owing to their potentially low cost. Carbon is considered the promising anode for PIBs on the basis of its high conductivity and abundant sources. The biggest challenge confronted by carbon anodes lies in insufficient cycle life as well as rate capability, resulting from the limited interlayer spacing of the sp2&#8208;hybrid carbon incompatible with the large&#8208;radius potassium. Herein, a biomass&#8208;derived carbon with a large interlayer spacing of 0.44&#160;nm is fabricated via a zinc&#8208;assisted pyrolysis synthesis. The unique structure endows the carbon with superior capacity, rate capability, and cycle durability. The large interlayer spacing of carbons can promote fast potassium diffusion and alleviate the volume expansion during potassiation, conferring those rate capabilities and cycleability. The interconnected network structure is also able to shorten both the transport distances of electrons and ions. The demonstration exemplifies an advanced carbon for anodes of PIBs for energy storage applications.

         <title>Flexible Meta&#8208;Tape with Wide Gamut, Low Lightness and Low Infrared Emissivity for Visible&#8208;Infrared Camouflage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tape&#8208;like metamaterial (meta&#8208;tape) formed by self&#8208;assembled gold nanoparticles in an ultrathin nanoporous alumina (UNA) template. The ultrathin meta&#8208;tapes can exhibit different colors with wide gamut and low lightness from 20 to 40, enabling low color difference under various backgrounds down to 1.2 L*a*b*. The infrared emissivity is simultaneously suppressed down to 3.8% across 3 &#8211; 14 &#181;m. The outstanding optical performances are well preserved under various mechanical and thermal stability tests.








Abstract
Full&#8208;spectral optical camouflage is of broad interest and in urgent demand because of everlasting safety pursuit in modern society. However, the widely existing dim scenarios call for not only broadband low thermal detectivity but also wide&#8208;gamut camouflaging colors with both low lightness and minimal chromatism. Here, a tape&#8208;like metamaterial (meta&#8208;tape) with broad spectral manipulation bandwidth from visible to mid&#8208;infrared is demonstrated. The ultrathin meta&#8208;tapes can exhibit different colors with wide gamut and low lightness from 20 to 40, enabling low color difference under various backgrounds down to 1.2 L*a*b*. The infrared emissivity is simultaneously suppressed down to 3.8% across 3 &#8211; 14&#160;&#181;m. The outstanding optical performances are well preserved under various mechanical and thermal stability tests. The pronounced multispectral camouflage, combined with flexible and robust tape&#8208;like nature, makes the meta&#8208;tape a promising solution for VIS&#8208;IR compatible camouflage in diverse scenarios.

The ultrathin meta-tapes can exhibit different colors with wide gamut and low lightness from 20 to 40, enabling low color difference under various backgrounds down to 1.2 &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;*&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;*&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;*. The infrared emissivity is simultaneously suppressed down to 3.8% across 3 &#8211; 14&#160;&#181;m. The outstanding optical performances are well preserved under various mechanical and thermal stability tests. The pronounced multispectral camouflage, combined with flexible and robust tape-like nature, makes the meta-tape a promising solution for VIS-IR compatible camouflage in diverse scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanomaterial&#8208;Mediated Reprogramming of Macrophages to Inhibit Refractory Muscle Fibrosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Local injection of the cationic nanomaterial prevents refractory muscle fibrosis and restores muscle function after acute injury. This anti&#8208;fibrotic effect results from the cell&#8208;free nucleic acids (cfNA)&#8208;TLR7/9&#8208;dependent&#160;orchestration of the macrophages and fibro&#8208;adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), leading to an optimized inflammation&#8208;fibrogenesis balance. The reciprocal cross&#8208;talk between macrophages and FAPs serves as a promising therapeutic target for treating refractory muscle fibrosis.








Abstract
Orofacial muscles are particularly prone to refractory fibrosis after injury, leading to a negative effect on the patient's quality of life and limited therapeutic options. Gaining insights into innate inflammatory response&#8208;fibrogenesis homeostasis can aid in the development of new therapeutic strategies for muscle fibrosis. In this study, the crucial role of macrophages is identified in the regulation of orofacial muscle fibrogenesis after injury. Hypothesizing that orchestrating macrophage polarization and functions will be beneficial for fibrosis treatment, nanomaterials are engineered with polyethylenimine functionalization to regulate the macrophage phenotype by capturing negatively charged cell&#8208;free nucleic acids (cfNAs). This cationic nanomaterial reduces macrophage&#8208;related inflammation in vitr and demonstrates excellent efficacy in preventing orofacial muscle fibrosis in vivo. Single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing reveals that the cationic nanomaterial reduces the proportion of profibrotic Gal3+ macrophages through the cfNA&#8208;mediated TLR7/9&#8208;NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling pathway, resulting in a shift in profibrotic fibro&#8208;adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) from the matrix&#8208;producing Fabp4+ subcluster to the matrix&#8208;degrading Igf1+ subcluster. The study highlights a strategy to target innate inflammatory response&#8208;fibrogenesis homeostasis and suggests that cationic nanomaterials can be exploited for treating refractory fibrosis.

&lt;p&gt;Local injection of the cationic nanomaterial prevents refractory muscle fibrosis and restores muscle function after acute injury. This anti-fibrotic effect results from the cell-free nucleic acids (cfNA)-TLR7/9-dependent&#160;orchestration of the macrophages and fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), leading to an optimized inflammation-fibrogenesis balance. The reciprocal cross-talk between macrophages and FAPs serves as a promising therapeutic target for treating refractory muscle fibrosis.

         <title>Alicyclic Polyimide With Multiple Breakdown Self&#8208;Healing Based on Gas&#8208;Condensation Phase Validation for High Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alicyclic polyimide completely degrades during the electric breakdown process under a high electric field, a large number of gaseous products and resulting in a low residual carbon rate, thus achieving self&#8208;healing capability for multiple electrical breakdowns, making it a potential dielectric material for new&#8208;generation high&#8208;temperature film capacitors.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics with combined thermal stability and self&#8208;healing properties are specifically desired for high&#8208;temperature film capacitors. The high thermal stability of conventional polymers benefits from the abundance of aromatic rings in the molecule backbone, but the high carbon content sacrifices their self&#8208;healing properties. Here, analicyclic polyimide with a high glass transition temperature (256&#160;&#176;C) and wide energy bandgap (4.58&#160;eV) is designed, which exhibits electric conductivity more than an order of magnitude lower than that of classical polyimide at high electric fields and high temperatures. As a result, alicyclic polyimide achieves a discharged energy density of 4.54 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and a charge&#8208;discharge efficiency of above 90% at 200&#160;&#176;C, which is superior to existing dielectric polymers and composites. The alicyclic polyimide benefits from a low pyrolytic residual carbon rate, retaining 93% of the dielectric breakdown strength after four electrical breakdown cycles. Distinguishing from the current condensed&#8208;phase self&#8208;healing concept, for the first time, exploring the self&#8208;healing capability of high&#8208;temperature polyimide dielectric is presented based on dual self&#8208;healing mechanisms of gas&#8208;phase and condensed&#8208;phase. The high energy density at high temperatures and the superior self&#8208;healing capability of alicyclic polyimide further indicate the promise of polyimide dielectric film capacitors for extreme conditions.

         <title>In&#8208;Plane Chirality Control of a Charge Density Wave by Means of Shear Stress</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8208;plane chirality of a Charge Density Wave compound can be controlled by applying shear stress during thermal cycling through an achiral phase. This finding opens the view to optomechanical devices with tunable Raman activity. 








Abstract
The transition metal dichalcogenide 1T&#8208;TaS2 exhibits a Charge Density Wave&#160;(CDW) with in&#8208;plane chirality. Due to the rich phase diagram, the Ferro&#8208;Rotational Order (FRO) can be tuned by external stimuli. The FRO is studied by Angle&#8208;Resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy (ARPES), Raman spectroscopy, and Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED). The in&#8208;plane chirality of the CDW is lost at the transition from Nearly&#8208;Commensurate (NC) to In&#8208;Commensurate (IC) phase and can be controlled by applying shear stress to the sample while cooling it through the transition from IC&#8208;CDW to NC&#8208;CDW. Based on these observations, a protocol is proposed to achieve reliable, non&#8208;volatile state switching of the FRO configuration in 1T&#8208;TaS2 bulk crystals. These results pave the way for new functional devices in which in&#8208;plane chirality can be set on&#160;demand.

         <title>Ultrabroadband and &gt;93% Microwave Absorption Enabled by &#8220;Doped&#8221; Water Meta&#8208;Atom Lattice with Subwavelength Thickness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by atomic doping techniques used in conventional optical materials to broaden spectral bandwidths, a single&#8208;layer microfluidic metasurface microwave absorber composed of two distinct types of &#8220;water meta&#8208;atoms&#8221; is proposed. Experimental measurements reveal over 93% absorption across both K and Ka bands (17.5&#8722;40.0&#160;GHz), featuring a relative bandwidth of up to 78.3% centered around the resonant frequency.








Abstract
Perfect microwave absorbers, which absorb electromagnetic waves completely, play pivotal roles in electromagnetic shielding, and stealth technologies. Existing microwave absorber technologies rely on either electromagnetic properties of absorptive materials, the resonance behavior of meta&#8208;atoms, or a combination of both. So far, achieving simultaneous broadband absorption, high efficiency, and compact sizes remains a great challenge. Inspired by atomic doping techniques employed in conventional optical materials to broaden spectral bandwidths, a single&#8208;layer microfluidic metasurface microwave absorber is proposed with the assembly of two distinct types of water meta&#8208;atoms. By manipulating electromagnetic resonances of these water meta&#8208;atoms, the metasurface maintains impedance matching over a broad working range. A microwave absorber design with a thickness equivalent to 0.2 times the central wavelength is showcased, measuring over 93% absorption across both K and Ka bands (17.5&#8722;40.0&#160;GHz). The results highlight unprecedented superiorities of microwave absorbers based on a 2D doped water meta&#8208;atom lattice when compared to previously reported metasurface absorbers utilizing identical meta&#8208;atoms. This absorber has advantages including small thickness, broad bandwidth, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, making it promising for applications in electromagnetic shielding, camouflage, and multi&#8208;spectral stealth.

         <title>Magnetic Field&#8208;Induced Polar Order in Monolayer Molybdenum Disulfide Transistors</title>

Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetic field (B)&#8208;induced giant electric hysteretic responses to back&#8208;gate voltages in monolayer (ML) MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) below 20 Kelvin are observed and attributed to asymmetric lattice expansion with increasing |B| in ML&#8208;MoS2 FETs on rigid SiO2/Si substrates, leading to mirror symmetry breaking in ML&#8208;MoS2 and the emergence of a tunable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric&#8208;like polar order.








Abstract
In semiconducting monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (ML&#8208;TMDs), broken inversion symmetry and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling result in spin&#8208;valley lock&#8208;in effects so that the valley degeneracy may be lifted by external magnetic fields, potentially leading to real&#8208;space structural transformation. Here, magnetic field (B)&#8208;induced giant electric hysteretic responses to back&#8208;gate voltages are reported in ML&#8208;MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) on SiO2/Si at temperatures &lt;&#160;20 K. The observed hysteresis increases with |B| up to 12 T and is tunable by varying the temperature. Raman spectroscopic and scanning tunneling microscopic studies reveal significant lattice expansion with increasing |B| at 4.2 K, and this lattice expansion becomes asymmetric in ML&#8208;MoS2 FETs on rigid SiO2/Si substrates, leading to out&#8208;of&#8208;plane mirror symmetry breaking and the emergence of a tunable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric&#8208;like polar order. This broken symmetry&#8208;induced polarization in ML&#8208;MoS2 shows typical ferroelectric butterfly hysteresis in piezo&#8208;response force microscopy, adding ML&#8208;MoS2 to the single&#8208;layer material family that exhibits out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polar order&#8208;induced ferroelectricity, which is promising for such technological applications as cryo&#8208;temperature ultracompact non&#8208;volatile memories, memtransistors, and ultrasensitive magnetic field sensors. Moreover, the polar effect induced by asymmetric lattice expansion may be further generalized to other ML&#8208;TMDs and achieved by nanoscale strain engineering of the substrate without magnetic fields.

&#8220;Like Dissolves Like&#8221; design principle is established to prepare semiconductor fluid plasticizers for the preparation of intrinsically stretchable F&#960;CPs films in flexible electronics. Model matched nonpolar M1 plasticizer is achieved to obtain stretchable PFO blended films. Plasticized PFO film presents an efficient, narrowband and stable deep&#8208;blue emission, uniform morphology, and excellent intrinsic stretchability for the fabrication of deep&#8208;blue FPLEDs.








Abstract
Physical blending of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (F&#960;CPs) is an effective strategy to achieve intrinsically stretchable films for the fabrication of flexible optoelectronic devices, but easily causes phase separation, nonuniform morphology and uncontrollable photo&#8208;electronic processing. This may cause low efficiency, unstable and nonuniform emission, and poor color purity, which are undesirable for deep&#8208;blue flexible polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (FPLEDs). Herein, a &#8220;Like Dissolves Like&#8221; design principle to prepare semiconductor fluid plasticizers (SFPs) is established and intrinsically stretchable F&#960;CPs films via external plasticization for high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue FPLEDs are developed. Three fundamental requirements are proposed, &#8220;similar conjugated skeleton, similar molecular polarity, and similar electronic structures,&#8221; to prepare model&#8208;matched nonpolar M1 and polar M2 plasticizers for poly(9,9&#8208;dioctylfluorene) (PFO). Large&#8208;area plasticized PFO films exhibit an efficient, narrowband, and stable ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence (FWHM &lt; 40&#160;nm, CIE: 0.12, 0.04), uniform morphology, and excellent intrinsic stretchability (fracture strain &gt;20% and crack&#8208;onset strain &gt;120%). Efficient and uniform deep&#8208;blue FPLEDs based on stretchable PFO films are fabricated with a high brightness of &#8776;3000&#160;cd cm&#8722;2. Finally, blended PFO films exhibit outstanding stretch&#8208;deformation cycling stability of their deep&#8208;blue electroluminescent behavior, confirming the effectiveness of the &#8220;Like Dissolves Like&#8221; principle to design matched SFPs for stretchable F&#960;CP films in flexible electronics.

         <title>All&#8208;In&#8208;One Additive Enabled Efficient and Stable Narrow&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites for Monolithic All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein, an all&#8208;in&#8208;one additive AMPH is proposed, which can not only function as a reducing agent to suppress Sn4+ formation, but also can slow down the crystallization and enhance oxidation resistance of Sn&#8208;Pb films. This advancement enables 23.07% efficient Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cells and 28.73% efficient all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells with improved operational stability.








Abstract
Hybrid tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskites have garnered increasing attention due to their crucial role in all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells for surpassing the efficiency limit of single&#8208;junction solar cells. However, the easy oxidation of Sn2+ and fast crystallization of Sn&#8208;based perovskite present significant challenges for achieving high&#8208;quality hybrid Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films, thereby limiting the device's performance and stability. Herein, an all&#8208;in&#8208;one additive, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;mercaptopropanoic acid hydrochloride (AMPH) is proposed, which can function as a reducing agent to suppress the formation of Sn4+ throughout the film preparation. Furthermore, the strong binding between AMPH and Sn&#8208;based precursor significantly slows down the crystallization process, resulting in a high&#8208;quality film with enhanced crystallinity. The remaining AMPH and its oxidation products within the film contribute to improves oxidation resistance and a substantial reduction in defect density, specifically Sn vacancies. Benefiting from the multifunctionalities of AMPH, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.07% is achieved for single&#8208;junction narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells. The best&#8208;performing monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem cell also exhibits a PCE of 28.73% (certified 27.83%), which is among the highest efficiency reported yet. The tandem devices can also retain over 85% of their initial efficiencies after 500 hours of continuous operation at the maximum power point under one&#8208;sun illumination.

         <title>A Polymeric Hole Transporter with Dual&#8208;Interfacial Interactions Enables 25%&#8208;Efficiency Blade&#8208;Coated Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>

A novel polymeric hole transporter named Poly&#8208;DBPP with centrosymmetric biphosphonic acid groups is developed that can anchor to the underlying conductive substrate and interact with the perovskite layer simultaneously. Poly&#8208;DBPP improves the efficiencies of blade&#8208;coated perovskite solar cells and large&#8208;area modules to 25.1% and 22.0%, respectively.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly monolayer (SAM) hole transporters, consisting of anchoring, spacer, and terminal groups, have played a significant role in the development of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the weak interaction between perovskite and hydrophobic terminal group of SAMs limits surface wettability and interface stability. To address this issue, two novel hole transporters (named DBPP and Poly&#8208;DBPP) with centrosymmetric biphosphonic acid groups are developed. Unlike conventional SAM hole transporters, the biphosphonic acid groups in DBPP and Poly&#8208;DBPP can anchor to the underlying conductive substrate and interact with the perovskite layer simultaneously, improving surface wettability and suppressing interface recombination. Furthermore, compared to the small&#8208;molecular DBPP, Poly&#8208;DBPP exhibits higher conductance and excellent uniformity. This translates to a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 25.1% for blade&#8208;coated PSCs and 22.0% for large&#8208;area modules, respectively. Additionally, the PSCs based on Poly&#8208;DBPP demonstrate impressive operational stability, retaining 92% of their initial PCE after 1,600 h of light soaking. This work presents a promising strategy for designing multifunctional hole transporters, paving the way for highly efficient and stable PSCs.

This work presents a promising strategy for designing multifunctional hole transporters, paving the way for highly efficient and stable PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>LysSYL&#8208;Loaded pH&#8208;Switchable Self&#8208;Assembling Peptide Hydrogels Promote Methicillin&#8208;Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Elimination and Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The LysSYL&#8208;loaded L5 can assemble pH&#8208;sensitive L5@LysSYL hydrogels at neutral pH and exhibit the slow&#8208;release effect of LysSYL at acidic pH. L5@LysSYL hydrogels effectively eliminate MRSA through multiple synergistic modes, including bacterial membrane disruption, cross&#8208;wall disturbing, and cell separation inhibition. Moreover, L5@LysSYL hydrogels promote wound healing and show promise as a wound dressing for the management of wound infections.








Abstract
Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), especially methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA), causes wound infections, whose treatment remains a clinical challenge. Bacterium&#8208;infected wounds often create acidic niches with a pH 4.5&#8211;6.5. Endolysin LysSYL, which is derived from phage SYL, shows promise as an antistaphylococcal agent. However, endolysins generally exhibit instability and possess low bioavailability in acidic microenvironments. Here, an array of self&#8208;assembling peptides is designed, and peptide L5 is screened out based on its gel formation property and bioavailability. L5 exerted a pH&#8208;switchable antimicrobial effect (pH 5.5) and formed biocompatible hydrogels at neutral pH (pH 7.4). The LysSYL&#8208;loaded L5 can assemble L5@LysSYL hydrogels, increase thermal stability, and exhibit the slow&#8208;release effect of LysSYL. Effective elimination of S. aureus is achieved by L5@LysSYL through bacterial membrane disruption and cell separation inhibition. Moreover, L5@LysSYL hydrogels exhibit great potential in promoting wound healing in a mouse wound model infected by MRSA. Furthermore, L5@LysSYL hydrogels are safe and can decrease the cytokine levels and increase the number of key factors for vessel formation, which contribute to wound healing. Overall, the self&#8208;assembling L5@LysSYL can effectively clean MRSA and promote wound healing, which suggests its potential as a pH&#8208;sensitive wound dressing for the management of wound infections.

         <title>Organic Nonvolatile 2T Memory Cell Employing a NOT&#8208;Gate&#8208;Like Architecture Toward Binary Output Level With Enhanced Noise Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a brand&#8208;new voltage&#8208;readable 2T memory cell employing a NOT&#8208;gate&#8208;like architecture. It combines ferroelectric and nano&#8208;floating&#8208;gate transistors in a voltage divider, achieving high noise tolerance for voltage output memory. Moreover, the conceptual design of the 1T2T FeRAM cell is also developed as a prospect for low&#8208;cost voltage&#8208;readable memory technology in wearable electronic applications.








Abstract
Organic nonvolatile memory has been considered a low&#8208;cost memory technology for flexible electronics and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;things (IoT). However, a major concern is the nonuniformity of memory units, which is primarily caused by random grain boundaries, interface defects, and charge traps, making it difficult to develop high&#8208;density reliable memory arrays. This nonuniformity problem would induce read error, which is directly caused by the narrow distribution margin of memory states and low noise tolerance in conventional organic memory cells. To break this limitation, a novel 2T memory cell employing a NOT&#8208;gate&#8208;like architecture achieving self&#8208;enhancing noise tolerance is presented. This unique cell consists of a pair of commonly&#8208;gated memory transistors with contradictory &#8220;write&#8208;and&#8208;erase&#8221; features. It functions as a voltage divider, producing a well&#8208;distinguished binary voltage output capability. The concept and design model of this brand&#8208;new 2T memory cell is thoroughly discussed. It is originally characterized by noise&#8208;tolerant memory cells irrespective of device nonuniformity. The noise tolerance range of this 2T memory cell is also investigated. The binary voltage&#8208;readable memory state with a large noise tolerance range is obtained. Moreover, the conceptual design of the 1T2T FeRAM cell is further developed for low&#8208;cost voltage&#8208;readable memory technology in wearable electronic applications.

         <title>Macroscale Superlubrication Achieved with Shear&#8208;Thinning Semisolid Lubricants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a semisolid subnanometer nanowire (SNW) superlubricant, which, when combined with various base oils, forms an advanced class of lubricating materials. Based on shear&#8208;thinning properties, these materials achieve ultralow friction (0.008&#8211;0.009) and long&#8208;term stability (&gt;120&#160;000 cycles, 12 h), addressing current limitations and offering significant potential for diverse engineering applications.








Abstract
Macrosuperlubric materials are pivotal for reducing friction and wear in engineering applications. However, current solid superlubricants require intricate fabrication and specific conditions (e.g., vacuum or inert atmospheres), while liquid superlubricants are prone to creep, leakage, and corrosion. Here, a novel semisolid subnanometer nanowire (SNW) superlubrication material based on the shear&#8208;thinning effect is introduced to overcome these challenges. The SNWs achieve an exceptionally low friction coefficient (0.008&#8211;0.009) with silicon nitride (Si3N4) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tribo&#8208;pairs, demonstrating a brief running&#8208;in period (&#8776;39 s) and stable superlubrication over extended friction (12 h, &gt;120&#160;000 cycles). The combination of the shear&#8208;thinning network structure mechanism, the adsorption membrane mechanism, and hydrodynamic effects provides a synergistic effect, playing a crucial role in achieving superlubricity. Additionally, SNWs can be combined with various base oils to create semisolid gel lubricants with superlubricating properties. This innovative approach addresses the limitations of current superlubrication systems and introduces a new category of semisolid gel lubricants, significantly expanding the applications of superlubrication materials.

         <title>Stabilizing Metal Coating on Flexible Devices by Ultrathin Protein Nanofilms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a concept to use an ultrathin protein nanofilm (UPN) as an adhesive layer to enhance the adhesion between polymer substrates and metal coatings. This method enables various functionalities, including transparency control, encryption devices, optical detection, and wearable sensors, highlighting UPN's potential in flexible hybrid devices.








Abstract
The significant modulus difference between a metal coating and a polymer substrate leads to interface mismatches, seriously affecting the stability of flexible devices. Therefore, enhancing the adhesion stability of a metal layer on an inert polymer substrate to prevent delamination becomes a key challenge. Herein, an ultrathin protein nanofilm (UPN), synthesized by disulfide&#8208;bond&#8208;reducing protein aggregation, is proposed as a strong adhesive layer to enhance adhesion between polymer substrate and metal coating. Unlike traditional biopolymer adhesives with micrometer&#8208;scale thicknesses, the UPN layer is minimized to nanometer/single&#8208;molecular scale. Such UPN thereby effectively enhances the interfacial adhesive strength and reduces the cohesion contribution in the entire adhesion system by directly connecting two interfaces with a nearly single&#8208;molecular thickness. Using UPN as the adhesive layer, a multifunctional metal coating could be reliably adhered on flexible polymer substrates by ion sputtering, delivering unprecedented adhesion stability even under repetitive mechanical deformation. Applications of this design include reversible transparency control, tension&#8208;responsive encryption, reusable optical sensing, and wearable capacitive touch sensors. This work highlights UPN's potential to create strong bonding strength between flexible polymers and metal coatings, offering a biocompatible solution with high surface activity and low cohesion, facilitating the development of hybrid devices with stable metal nano&#8208;coating.

         <title>Nanobodies Outperform Antibodies &#8211; Rapid Functionalization with Equal In Vivo Targeting Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanocarrier system functionalized with nanobodies for the targeting of dendritic cells is presented. The system possesses a highly specific targeting in vivo and can be synthesized at low cost over the course of a few hours. The combination of these properties suggests a better performance compared to antibody&#8208;based systems in current literature.








Abstract
Highly specific targeting of dendritic cells in vivo is crucial for the development of effective tumor nanovaccines. This group recently presented an antibody&#8208;functionalized nanocarrier system able to maintain its targeting properties when transferred from in vitro to in vivo studies. However, producing this system requires long synthesis times and involves high expenses due to the involved site&#8208;specific enzymatic multi&#8208;step modification procedure of the antibody. Consequently, improving the previously proposed system is necessary in order to accelerate the development. Here, a novel system utilizing nanobodies for the targeting of dendritic cells is presented. A C&#8208;terminal cysteine tag facilitates an easy attachment of the nanobody to the nanocarrier via a thiol&#8208;maleimide conjugation technique. This reduces the functionalization time from several days to mere hours. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, it is shown that the optimized system possesses equal targeting properties as the antibody&#8208;based system. As a result, nanobodies and the coupling chemistry are found to be a superior strategy for the in vivo targeting of dendritic cells when compared to antibodies, due to their rapid attachment to nanocarriers and equal targeting specificity. This would replace antibodies as the current &#8220;gold standard&#8221; of targeting moieties.

         <title>Low&#8208;Spin Fe3+ Evoked by Multiple Defects with Optimal Intermediate Adsorption Attaining Unparalleled Performance in Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing multiple vacancy defects combined with V doping into NiFe&#8208;LDH can boost the formation of low&#8208;spin Fe3+, thereby modifying the interactions between 3d orbitals of Fe3+ and O 2p orbitals, which reduces the excessive adsorption of O* intermediates on Fe3+ sites, consequently altering the rate&#8208;determining step of OER and lowering the reaction energy barrier, resulting in accelerating OER kinetics.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic water splitting is long constrained by the sluggish kinetics of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and rational spin&#8208;state manipulation holds great promise to break through this bottleneck. Low&#8208;spin Fe3+ (LS, t2g5eg0) species are identified as highly active sites for OER in theory, whereas it is still a formidable challenge to construct experimentally. Herein, a new strategy is demonstrated for the effective construction of LS Fe3+ in NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH) by introducing multiple defects, which induce coordination unsaturation over Fe sites and thus enlarge their d orbital splitting energy. The as&#8208;obtained catalyst exhibits extraordinary OER performance with an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 244 mV at the industrially required current density of 500 mA cm&#8722;2, which is 110 mV lower than that of the conventional NiFe&#8208;LDH with high&#8208;spin Fe3+ (HS, t2g3eg2) and superior to most previously reported NiFe&#8208;based catalysts. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical studies reveal that LS Fe3+ configuration effectively reduces the adsorption strength of the O* intermediate compared with that of the HS case, thereby altering the rate&#8208;determining step from (O* &#8594; OOH*) to (OH* &#8594; O*) of OER and lowering its reaction energy barrier. This work paves a new avenue for developing efficient spin&#8208;dependent electrocatalysts for OER and beyond.

         <title>Crystallographic Reorientation Induced by Gradient Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Highly Stable Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study tracks the reaction pathways of Zn2+ from de&#8208;solvation to Zn nucleation and subsequent growth. Advanced operando spectroscopy and crystallography tests reveal that gradient solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase induces crystallographic reorientation from Zn (101) to (002) planes of Zn anode during Zn2+ stripping/plating. The in&#8208;depth depicted crystal regulation method opens new opportunities for the development of long&#8208;lifespan metal batteries.








Abstract
Oriented zinc (Zn) electrodeposition is critical for the long&#8208;term performance of aqueous Zn metal batteries. However, the intricate interfacial reactions between the Zn anode and electrolytes hinder a comprehensive understanding of Zn metal deposition. Here, the reaction pathways of Zn deposition and report the preferential formation of Zn single&#8208;crystalline nuclei followed by dense Zn(002) deposition is elucidated, which is induced by a gradient solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). The gradient SEI composed of abundant B&#8208;O and C species facilitates faster Zn2+ nucleation rate and smaller nucleus size, promoting the formation of Zn single&#8208;crystalline nuclei. Additionally, the homogeneity and mechanical stability of SEI ensure the crystallographic reorientation of Zn anodes from Zn(101) to (002) planes, efficiently inhibiting dendrite growth and metal corrosion during the Zn2+ stripping/plating process. These advantages significantly enhance the stability of the Zn anode, as demonstrated by the prolonged cycling lifespan of symmetric Zn batteries and exceptional reversibility (&gt;99.5%) over 5000 cycles in Zn//Cu asymmetric batteries. Notably, this strategy also enables the stable operation of anode&#8208;free Zn//I2 batteries with a long lifespan of 3000 cycles. This work advances the understanding of Zn electrochemical behaviors, encompassing Zn nucleation, growth, and Zn2+ stripping/plating.

         <title>Adaptive Opto&#8208;Thermal&#8208;Hydrodynamic Manipulation and Polymerization (AOTHMAP) for 4D Colloidal Patterning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research introduces a novel 4D patterning method called AOTHMAP, which utilizes adaptive opto&#8208;thermal&#8208;hydrodynamic manipulation for precise colloidal patterning. This technique facilitates the automatic transport, positioning, and immobilization of colloidal particles with a single laser beam. AOTHMAP improves customization and efficiency in creating dynamic microstructures and biological patterns, showcasing significant potential in intelligent manufacturing, optoelectronics, and biofabrication.








Abstract
Precision colloidal patterning holds great promise in constructing customizable micro/nanostructures and functional frameworks, which showcases significant application values across various fields, from intelligent manufacturing to optoelectronic integration and biofabrication. Here, a direct 4D patterning method via adaptive opto&#8208;thermal&#8208;hydrodynamic manipulation and polymerization (AOTHMAP) with single&#8208;particle resolution is reported. This approach utilizes a single laser beam to automatically transport, position, and immobilize colloidal particles through the adaptive utilization of light&#8208;induced hydrodynamic force, optical force, and photothermal polymerization. The AOTHMAP enables precise 1D, 2D, and 3D patterning of colloidal particles of varying sizes and materials, facilitating the construction of customizable microstructures with complex shapes. Furthermore, by harnessing the pH&#8208;responsive properties of hydrogel adhesives, the AOTHMAP further enables 4D patterning by dynamic alteration of patterned structures through shrinkage, restructuring, and cloaking. Notably, the AOTHMAP also enables biological patterning of functional bio&#8208;structures such as bio&#8208;micromotors. The AOTHMAP offers a simple and efficient strategy for colloidal patterning with high versatility and flexibility, which holds great promises for the construction of functional colloidal microstructures in intelligent manufacturing, as well as optoelectronic integration and biofabrication.

         <title>Electrochemically&#8208;Switched Microwave Response of MXene in Organic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible electrochemically adjustable electromagnetic interference shielding devices are developed based on the tunable charging states and surface chemistry of Ti3C2Tx MXene. By integrating the electromagnetic switching device with Salisbury screen and double&#8208;layer resonant cavity structure, dynamic camouflage and wave&#8208;absorbing switch are achieved, respectively. This versatile device holds promise for future advanced electromagnetic protection, stealth, camouflage, and other applications.








Abstract
The increasingly complex electromagnetic (EM) environment necessitates advanced electrically controllable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials that can adapt to varying EM conditions. This study develops a flexible electrochemically tunable EMI shielding device based on ultrathin Ti3C2Tx MXene films, exhibiting reversible shielding effectiveness (SE) modulation from 18.9 to 26.2&#160;dB in X band at 0.1 and &#8722;1.5&#160;V. Unlike the previously reported mechanism relying on interlayer spacing adjustments, the work leverages transformations of charging state and surface chemistry for tunability during the electrochemical process. The Ti3C2Tx flake size is also evidenced to play a crucial role, with smaller flakes offering higher absorption modulation despite lower SE modulation, enabling the device with high designability. When integrated with Salisbury screen structure, the device achieves adjustable absorption from 93.560% at 0.1&#160;V to 99.996% at &#8722;1&#160;V, showing a tunable reflection suppression ratio up to 32&#160;dB with an effective bandwidth of 4.2&#160;GHz. Additionally, incorporating resonant cavity structure enables absorption&#8208;dominated (over 90%) microwave&#8208;responsive switching at 0.1 and &#8722;1.5&#160;V. This work highlights significant potential of adaptive EMI shielding materials for applications in smart electronic protection, EM switch, and radar camouflage.

         <title>Suppressing Static and Dynamic Disorder for High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Thick&#8208;Film Organic Solar Cells via Synergistic Dilution Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a synergistic dilution strategy to suppress traps of transport and active layers, restrain static, and dynamic disorder, to fabricate efficient and stable thick&#8208;film OSCs. It mitigates dynamic disorder through electron&#8208;phonon coupling suppression and static disorder via molecular stacking enhancement, ensuring practicality and cost&#8208;effectiveness for large&#8208;scale use.








Abstract
Developing stable and highly efficient thick&#8208;film organic solar cells (OSCs) is crucial for the large&#8208;scale commercial application of organic photovoltaics. A novel synergistic dilution strategy to address this issue, using Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) &#8208;modified zinc oxide (ZnO) as the interfacial layer, is introduced. This strategy effectively mitigates oxygen defects in ZnO while also regulating the self&#8208;assembly process of the active layer to achieve an ordered distribution of donors and acceptors. In synergistic diluted devices, the dynamic disorder is reduced owing to the suppression of electron&#8208;phonon coupling, while the static disorder is suppressed by improved molecular stacking and enhanced intermolecular interactions. Consequently, the 300&#160;nm PM6:L8&#8208;BO device post&#8208;synergistic dilution manifests a marked enhancement in device performance, achieving a photovoltaic power conversion efficiency (PCE) &gt;17% with excellent thermal stability. A typical ternary system is selected to explore the general applicability of synergistic dilution strategy, the PCE has been enhanced significantly from 17.89% to 18.72%, which falls within the range of the highest values among inverted single junction OSCs. As a practical application that depends on the pivotal synergy between high efficiency and stability, this approach paves the way for large&#8208;scale implementation of OSCs and ensures cost&#8208;effectiveness.

         <title>Engineering Triple&#8208;Phase Interfaces with Hierarchical Carbon Nanocages for High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
In all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, the composite cathode requires multi&#8208;dimensional structural engineering. By integrating sulfur with a hierarchical carbon nanocage (hCNC), the uniform dispersion of sulfur and carbon in the composite cathode and the efficient construction of triple&#8208;phase interfaces are achieved. These enhancements improve the utilization of sulfur, enabling ultra&#8208;high&#8208;capacity battery performance.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) have garnered widespread attention due to their advantages of high energy density and enhanced safety. However, the typical composite structure composed of solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SE), discrete conducting carbon black, and microsized sulfur (&#956;&#8208;S) with long&#8208;range Li+/e&#8722; conducting path and huge volume changes, suffers from sluggish charge transport and severe electrochemical&#8208;mechanical failure. In this work, a unique hierarchical carbon nanocage (hCNC) is applied as a continuous conducting network where nanosized sulfur are confined. Due to the synergistic effects of multi&#8208;dimensional (particle, interface, and electrode) structural engineering, this new sulfur&#8208;carbon composite cathode (S@hCNC39) can achieve uniform distribution of sulfur and carbon, and efficiently constructs triple&#8208;phase interfaces, showing enhanced charge&#8208;carrier transport and improved electrochemical&#8208;mechanical stability. Remarkable cycling performance of 89% after 300 cycles at 0.2&#160;C at 30&#160;&#176;C is realized in ASSLSBs assembled with S@hCNC39. Notably, ASSLSBs achieve an ultrahigh areal capacity of 9.95 mAh cm&#8722;2 with stable cycling at 60&#160;&#176;C with high sulfur contents of 40% and high sulfur loadings of 6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. These results provide critical insights into the design of rational sulfur&#8208;carbon composites and offer a viable approach to enhance the overall performance of ASSLSBs.

         <title>Photoconductance Induced by Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule electrical measurement of excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) photocycle reveals the dynamic process of photoconductance under different irradiation wavelengths. The electronic structure induced by ESIPT leads to the occurrence of Fano resonance, therefore enhancing the charge&#8208;transport properties of ground&#8208;state molecules.








Abstract
Excited&#8208;state intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) molecules have been drawing considerable attention due to their unique photophysical properties and potential applications in optoelectronic devices. Although ground and excited&#8208;state tautomerism in various proton transfer systems associated with ESIPT has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically, the charge&#8208;transport characteristics of ESIPT molecules at the single&#8208;molecule level has been little investigated. In this work, scanning tunneling microscope&#8208;based fixed junction technique (STM&#8208;FJ) is employed with theoretical calculations to explore the electronic properties of SMe&#8208;PhOH (with ESIPT properties), together with its photoconductance induced by ESIPT photocycle processes under continuous light illumination (254/275/295/310&#160;nm). The conductance variation of SMe&#8208;PhOH with different UV wavelengths exhibits a continuous photoconductance distribution, which is highly consistent with the results of its UV&#8211;vis absorption spectrum. Theoretical calculations indicate that the interaction between localized HOMO and delocalized LUMO of SMe&#8208;PhOH K*&#8208;state gives rise to Fano resonance, thereby leading to enhanced conductance compared with its E&#8208;state. It reveals the microscopic mechanism of ESIPT process at the nanoscale and provides a constructive perspective for optimizing the photoresponsive properties of ESIPT&#8208;type molecules, as well as designing high&#8208;performance single&#8208;molecule devices.

         <title>Unlocking Electrostrain in Plastically Deformed Barium Titanate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dislocation engineering strategy is introduced to unlock electrostrains and piezoelectric properties in lead&#8208;free BaTiO3 single crystals, achieving a record&#8208;high strain energy density and large piezoelectric coefficient through domain structure design and controlled switching, with broad implications for advanced actuator applications.








Abstract
Achieving substantial electrostrain alongside a large effective piezoelectric strain coefficient (d33*) in piezoelectric materials remains a formidable challenge for advanced actuator applications. Here, a straightforward approach to enhance these properties by strategically designing the domain structure and controlling the domain switching through the introduction of arrays of ordered {100}&lt;100&gt; dislocations is proposed. This dislocation engineering yields an intrinsic lock&#8208;in steady&#8211;state electrostrain of 0.69% at a low field of 10&#160;kV&#160;cm&#8722;1 without external stress and an output strain energy density of 5.24&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 in single&#8208;crystal BaTiO3, outperforming the benchmark piezoceramics and relaxor ferroelectric single&#8208;crystals. Additionally, applying a compression stress of 6&#160;MPa fully unlocks electrostrains exceeding 1%, yielding a remarkable d33* value over 10&#160;000&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1 and achieving a record&#8208;high strain energy density of 11.67&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3. Optical and transmission electron microscopy, paired with laboratory and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, is employed to rationalize the observed electrostrain. Phase&#8208;field simulations further elucidate the impact of charged dislocations on domain nucleation and domain switching. These findings present an effective and sustainable strategy for developing high&#8208;performance, lead&#8208;free piezoelectric materials without the need for additional chemical elements, offering immense potential for actuator technologies.

         <title>Entropic Design of Anionic Site to Improve Anionic Redox Stability in Lithium&#8208;Rich Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to solve the failure problem caused by irreversible anion process, the entropy design strategy of the anion site is proposed. By constructing a highly disordered oxygen skeleton, the structural diversity and remote disorder of the material are improved. The Jahn&#8208;Teller of Mn3+ and irreversible dimerization of O&#9472;O are also effectively suppressed.









Abstract
Cobalt&#8208;free manganese&#8208;rich layered oxide is considered one of the most promising cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to its high capacity and low cost. However, irreversible anionic redox (OAR) leads to serious failure problems and hinders its wide application. To solve the above problems, the entropy design strategy of anionic sites is proposed, which is more direct and relevant to the regulation of the OAR process compared to the traditional entropy design of TM sites. The entropic design improves the structural diversity and long&#8208;range disorder of the material, which effectively inhibits oxygen release and drastic structural strain, and alleviates structural degradation. After 400 cycles at 1C, the capacity and voltage decay per cycle are only 0.092 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and 1.36&#160;mV, respectively. The long cycle test (10C and 1000 cycles) at high current shows that the voltage and capacity decay are only 0.04 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and 0.66&#160;mV per cycle, respectively. Meanwhile, the rate performance at 10C reaches 175 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. The charge compensation regulation and performance enhancement mechanism are investigated by systematic in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ characterization and theoretical calculation. This research provides new ideas for the design of lithium&#8208;rich cathodes with stable OAR and high structural adaptability.

         <title>Neuro&#8208;Actuating Photonic Skin Enabled by Ion&#8208;Gel Transistor with Thermo&#8208;Adaptive Block Copolymer</title>

         <dc:description>
The thermo&#8208;adaptive neuro&#8208;actuating photonic skin is designed to demonstrate thermo&#8208;responsive synaptic signal transmission, color variation, and actuation. Temperature&#8208;dependent synaptic actuation is accomplished using a bilayer soft actuator controlled by a temperature&#8208;responsive ion&#8208;gel based MXene/poly (3,4&#8208;ethylene dioxythiophene):poly (styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) transistor with block copolymer photonic crystal.








Abstract
Despite significant progress in developing artificial synapses to emulate the human nervous system for bio&#8208;signal transmission, synapses with thermo&#8208;adaptive coloration and soft actuators driven by temperature change have seldom been reported. Herein, a photonic neuro&#8208;actuating synaptic skin is presented enabling thermoresponsive synaptic signal transmission, color variation, and actuation. First, a thermoresponsive display synapse is developed based on a 3&#8208;terminal ion&#8208;gel transistor with a poly (3,4&#8208;ethylene dioxythiophene):poly (styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) semiconducting channel mixed with 2D titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) MXene and a thermo&#8208;adaptive 1D block copolymer (BCP) photonic crystal (PC) gate insulator. Temperature&#8208;dependent synaptic behavior is successfully observed in the ion&#8208;gel transistor with the corresponding structural colors, leading to a thermo&#8208;adaptive display synapse. The 3 &#215; 3 arrays of thermo&#8208;adaptive display synapses with Joule heaters show that each pixel is controlled by the thermoresponsive structural color and synaptic output. The synaptic output current from the MXene ion&#8208;gel transistor can be converted and amplified to a voltage signal, which powers a soft actuator connected to the ion&#8208;gel display synapse and triggers temperature&#8208;dependent actuation related to the thermoresponsive synaptic performance. This study showcases a thermo&#8208;adaptive photonic neuro&#8208;actuating artificial skin that emulates muscle&#8208;combined neuronal human skin with visualization capability.

         <title>Predicting Fatigue Damage in Hydrogels Through Force&#8208;Induced Luminescence Enhancement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tough hydrogels with force&#8208;induced confined luminescence enhancement of carbonated polymer quantum dot (CPD) clusters were prepared to realize the visualization of fracture process and the monitoring of fatigue damage. The enhanced interactions between the clusters and the polymer in the confined space inhibit the non&#8208;radiative leaps and promote the radiative leaps to quantify the fatigue damage into optical signals. 








Abstract
Fatigue damage of polymers occurs under long&#8208;term load cycling, resulting in irreversible fracture failure, which is difficult to predict. The real&#8208;time monitoring of material fatigue damage is of great significance. Here, tough hydrogels are prepared with force&#8208;induced confined luminescence enhancement of carbonated polymer quantum dot&#160;(CPD) clusters to realize the visualization of fracture process and the monitoring of fatigue damage.

&lt;p&gt;Tough hydrogels with force-induced confined luminescence enhancement of carbonated polymer quantum dot (CPD) clusters were prepared to realize the visualization of fracture process and the monitoring of fatigue damage. The enhanced interactions between the clusters and the polymer in the confined space inhibit the non-radiative leaps and promote the radiative leaps to quantify the fatigue damage into optical signals. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fatigue damage of polymers occurs under long-term load cycling, resulting in irreversible fracture failure, which is difficult to predict. The real-time monitoring of material fatigue damage is of great significance. Here, tough hydrogels are prepared with force-induced confined luminescence enhancement of carbonated polymer quantum dot&#160;(CPD) clusters to realize the visualization of fracture process and the monitoring of fatigue damage. The enhanced interactions induced by force between the clusters and the polymer in the confined space inhibit the non-radiative leaps and promote the radiative leaps to quantify the fatigue damage into optical signals. Rigid CPDs with abundant active sites on the surface can form dynamic reversible bonds with polymer and dissipate stress concentration, which significantly enhances the crack propagation strain (8000%) and fracture energy (26.4&#160;kJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of hydrogels. CPD&#160;hydrogels&#160;have a wide range of applications in novel information encryption and luminescent robotics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inducing Efficient and Multiwavelength Circularly Polarized Emission From Perovskite Nanocrystals Using Chiral Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized emission of high dissymmetry (glum &#8776; 0.56) is achieved from perovskite halide nanocrystals by depositing them on arrays of prefabricated resonant 2D gammadions. By using different materials, a hybrid photonic structure is managed to design with TiO2 and Au materials, in order to obtain resonances in the whole visible spectrum demonstrating the generation of multi&#8208;wavelength circularly polarised light.








Abstract
Chiral nano&#8208;emitters have recently received great research attention due to their technological applications and the need for a fundamental scientific understanding of the structure&#8208;property nexus of these nanoscale materials. Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (LHP NCs) with many interesting optical properties have anticipated great promise for generating chiral emission. However, inducing high anisotropy chiral emission from achiral perovskite NCs remains challenging. Although chiral ligands have been used to induce chirality, their anisotropy factors (glum) are low [10&#8722;3 to 10&#8722;2]. Herein, the generation of high anisotropy circularly polarized photoluminescence (CPL) from LHP NCs is demonstrated using chiral metasurfaces by depositing nanocrystals on top of prefabricated resonant photonic structures (2D gammadion arrays). This scalable approach results in CPL with glum to a record high of 0.56 for perovskite NCs. Furthermore, the differences between high&#8208;index dielectric chiral metasurfaces and metallic ones are explored for inducing chiral emission. More importantly, the generation of simultaneous multi&#8208;wavelength circularly polarized light is demonstrated by combining dielectric and metallic chiral metasurfaces.

         <title>Making Interfacial Solar Evaporation of Seawater Faster than Fresh Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and general strategy is developed to make real seawater evaporation faster than pure water. By simply introducing specific mineral materials into the floating photothermal evaporator, Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions in seawater are accumulated at the photothermal interfaces by spontaneous ion exchange, which disturb the hydrogen bonds of water molecules, and reduce the evaporation enthalpy of seawater.









Abstract
Interfacial solar evaporation&#8208;based seawater desalination is regarded as one of the most promising strategies to alleviate freshwater scarcity. However, the solar evaporation rate of real seawater is significantly constricted by the ubiquitous salts present in seawater. In addition to the common issue of salt accumulation on the evaporation surface during solar evaporation, strong hydration between salt ions and water molecules leads to a lower evaporation rate for real seawater compared to pure water. Here a facile and general strategy is developed to reverse this occurrence, that is, making real seawater evaporation faster than pure water. By simply introducing specific mineral materials into the floating photothermal evaporator, ion exchange at air&#8211;water interfaces directly results in a decrease in seawater evaporation enthalpy, and consequently achieves much higher seawater evaporation rates compared to pure water. This process is spontaneously realized during seawater solar evaporation. Considering the current enormous clean water production from evaporation&#8208;based desalination plants, such an evaporation performance improvement can remarkably increase annual clean water production, benefiting millions of people worldwide.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Proximity&#8208;Enhanced Biocatalytic Cascades Within Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Wearable and Theranostic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a novel strategy is reported for producing a spatiotemporal proximity&#8208;enhanced biocatalytic cascade system by encasing enzymes within MOFs that are modulated with sulfonic acid&#8208;functionalized signal substrates. Incorporating the synthesized MOFs into wearable paperfluidic patches and in vivo settings, noninvasive sweat glucose colorimetric detection and photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal tumor therapy are enabled, respectively.








Abstract
Enzymatic catalysis, particularly multi&#8208;enzyme cascade catalytic, is often limited by the spatial and temporal separation of enzymes and their signal substrates. Herein, a facile method for producing a spatiotemporal proximity&#8208;enhanced biocatalytic cascade system is introduced by encasing enzymes within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) that are modulated with sulfonic acid&#8208;functionalized signal substrates. The modulated behavior relies on the sulfonic acid groups coordinated with Zn2+. As a proof of concept, by utilizing 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Azinobis (3&#8208;ethylbenzothiazoline&#8208;6&#8208;sulfonic acid ammonium salt) (ABTS), a widely&#8208;used signal substrate for horseradish peroxidase, two&#8208;enzyme/substrate, and three&#8208;enzyme/substrate MOFs, which demonstrated a 7.4&#8208; and 10.2&#8208;fold increase in biocatalytic efficiency over free systems are successfully synthesized. Incorporating the synthesized MOFs into homemade wearable patches and in vivo settings, noninvasive sweat glucose colorimetric detection and photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal tumor therapy are enabled, respectively. This advancement stems from the newly established coordinative bonds between Zn2+ centers and substrates' sulfonic acid groups, which negates the need for additional signal substrates, thereby not only enhancing but also streamlining bioapplication processes.

         <title>Digital Light Process 3D Printing of Magnetically Aligned Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Free&#8211;forms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces the use of a Halbach array to magnetically align a novel liquid crystalline elastomer (LCE) ink which can be used for vat&#8208;based digital light process (DLP) 3D printing. This approach enables 3D printing of geometrically complex LCE free&#8211;forms with tailorable alignment, enabling exciting possibilities for designing advanced biomedical devices, soft robotics, or energy&#8208;damping structures.








Abstract
Liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) are anisotropic soft materials capable of large dimensional changes when subjected to a stimulus. The magnitude and directionality of the stimuli&#8208;induced thermomechanical response is associated with the alignment of the LCE. Recent reports detail the preparation of LCEs by additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, predominately using direct ink write printing. Another AM technique, digital light process (DLP) 3D printing, has generated significant interest as it affords LCE free&#8208;forms with high fidelity and resolution. However, one challenge of printing LCEs using vat polymerization methods such as DLP is enforcing alignment. Here, we document the preparation of aligned, main&#8208;chain LCEs via DLP 3D printing using a 100 mT magnetic field. Systematic examination isolates the contribution of magnetic field strength, alignment time, and build layer thickness on the degree of orientation in 3D printed LCEs. Informed by this fundamental understanding, DLP is used to print complex LCE free&#8208;forms with through&#8208;thickness variation in both spatial orientations. The hierarchical variation in spatial orientation within LCE free&#8208;forms is used to produce objects that exhibit mechanical instabilities upon heating. DLP printing of aligned LCEs opens new opportunities to fabricate stimuli&#8208;responsive materials in form factors optimized for functional use in soft robotics and energy absorption.

         <title>Super Moisture&#8208;Sorbent Sponge for Sustainable Atmospheric Water Harvesting and Power Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable salt&#8208;based super moisture&#8208;sorbent sponge is developed by an integrated strategy using LiCl&#8208;dopamine chelation and dopamine polymerization on melamine sponge (PMS) to achieve rapid and high water uptake without leakage. A dual&#8208;function system is constructed by integrating the LiCl/PMS/CNTs with a thermoelectric module to realize simultaneous fresh water and electricity production, fully utilizing the low&#8208;grade heat from the absorption/desorption processes.








Abstract
Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) shows great promise to mitigate the worldwide water scarcity, especially in the arid regions. Salt&#8208;based composite materials are the extensively used sorbents for SAWH, however, they suffer from complex preparation to avoid salt leakage. Furthermore, the significant amount of heat produced during water harvesting process is often neglected and wasted. Herein, an integrated strategy is developed to synthesis salt&#8208;based stable super moisture&#8208;sorbent sponge by using the chelation of LiCl and dopamine (DA), and the simultaneous polymerization of DA on melamine sponge (PMS). The as&#8208;prepared LiCl/PMS/CNTs showed high water uptake, reaching 1.26 and 1.81&#160;g g&#8722;1 at 15% and 30% RH, respectively, and no salt leakage is observed during the water absorption process. Remarkable daily water production of 3.47&#160;kg kg&#8722;1 day&#8722;1 in an arid environment (30% RH) is achieved. Moreover, a dual&#8208;function system is successfully constructed by combining the LiCl/PMS/CNTs with a thermoelectric module to fully utilize the heat generated from the SAWH process, which can realize the simultaneous production of fresh water and electricity. The maximum output power density is up to 35.4 and 454.4&#160;mW m&#8722;2 during the water absorption and desorption process, respectively.

         <title>Enhancing Radiofrequency Ablation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Nano&#8208;Epidrug Effects on Immune Modulation and Antigenicity Restoration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nano&#8208;epidrug (MFMP) is developed to enhance radiofrequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma. This is achieved through the demethylation of cGAS DNA, demethylation of EGFR mRNA, and phosphorylation of TBK1 protein, which collectively influence immune modulation and antigenicity restoration, ultimately suppressing the recurrence and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma.








Abstract
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA), a critical therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), carries a significant risk of recurrence and metastasis, particularly owing to mechanisms involving immune evasion and antigen downregulation via epigenetic modifications. This study introduces a &#8220;nano&#8208;epidrug&#8221; named MFMP. MFMP, which is composed of hollow mesoporous manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoparticles, FIDAS&#8208;5 as an MAT2A inhibitor, macrophage membrane, and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 (aPD&#8208;L1), targets HCC cells. By selectively binding to these cells, MFMP initially reverses immune suppression via PD&#8208;L1 inhibition. After endocytosis, MFMP disassembles in the tumor microenvironment, releasing FIDAS&#8208;5 and Mn2+. FIDAS&#8208;5 prevents cGAS methylation, whereas Mn2+ aids STING pathway restoration. In addition, FIDAS&#8208;5 reduces m6A RNA modification, suppressing EGFR expression. These changes enhance HCC antigenicity to promote cytotoxic T cell recognition and cytotoxic killing. Furthermore, MFMP mediates immunogenic cell death in HCC by synergizing with RFA through cGAS DNA demethylation, EGFR mRNA demethylation, and TBK1 protein phosphorylation, thereby inhibiting recurrence and metastasis and enhancing immune memory. Thus, MFMP is a potential adjunctive therapy requiring clinical validation.

         <title>Eco&#8208;Friendly High&#8208;Performance Symmetric All&#8208;COF/Graphene Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent organic framework (COF) integrating dual redox active sites is designed as an electrode material. The introduction of strong electron&#8208;withdrawing C&#63742;O ensures extended electron delocalization and synergistically enhances the proton storage with graphene loading strategy. Additionally, a concept of symmetric all&#8208;COF/graphene aqueous zinc&#8208;ion battery with high application value is realized based on the well&#8208;designed composite electrode.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance aqueous symmetric all&#8208;organic batteries (SAOBs) by replacing metal&#8208;based batteries or batteries with organic electrolytes is highly attractive to achieve a greener rechargeable world. However, such a new energy storage system still exhibits unsatisfactory rate capability and cycling stability due to the limitations in electrode materials screening. Here, a novel covalent organic framework (COF) containing abundant C&#63742;N and C&#63742;O for the electrode material is designed, which is combined with graphene and assembled into all&#8208;COF/graphene batteries for the first time. Moreover, the co&#8208;storage of Zn2+ and H+ in COF can be achieved in a mild aqueous electrolyte. Impressively, benefiting from the extended porous structure of COF, plentiful active reaction sites, more extensive electron delocalization from C&#63742;O modification at molecular level, as well as enhanced fast H+ storage capacity of graphene and C&#63742;O in COF, this kind of SAOBs show excellent cycle life and high rate performance (over 15000 cycles with a capacity of 80 mAh g&#8722;1 at a high current density of 5 A g&#8722;1 in pouch cell). This work will open a new window for the design of high&#8208;performance aqueous organic batteries, further moving toward a more eco&#8208;friendly electrochemical world.

Designing current collector with gravity&#8208;induced gradient copper nanoparticles (CF&#8208;G&#8208;Cu NPs), which can integrate gradient conductivity and zincophilicity to regulate zinc&#160;deposition and suppress side reactions.








Abstract
Current collectors, as reaction sites, play a crucial role in&#160;influencing various electrochemical performances in emerging cost&#8208;effective zinc&#8208;based flow batteries (Zn&#8208;based FBs). 3D carbon felts (CF) are commonly used but lack effectiveness in improving Zn metal plating/stripping. Here, a current collector with gravity&#8208;induced gradient copper nanoparticles (CF&#8208;G&#8208;Cu NPs) is developed, integrating gradient conductivity and zincophilicity to regulate Zn deposition and suppress side reactions. The CF&#8208;G&#8208;Cu NPs electrode modulates Zn nucleation and growth via the zincophilic Cu/CuZn5 alloy has been confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Finite element simulation demonstrates the gradient internal structure effectively optimizes the local electric/current field distribution to regulate the Zn2+ flux, improving bottom&#8208;up plating behavior for Zn metal and mitigating top&#8208;surface dendrite growth. As a result, Zn&#8208;based asymmetrical FBs with CF&#8208;G&#8208;Cu NPs electrodes achieve an areal capacity of 30 mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 over 640&#160;h with Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% at 40&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The integrated Zn&#8208;Iodide FBs exhibit a competitive long&#8208;term lifespan of 2910&#160;h (5800 cycles) with low energy efficiency decay of 0.062% per cycle and high cumulative capacity of 112800 mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a high current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. This gradient distribution strategy offers a simple mode for developing Zn&#8208;based FB systems.

Polymetallic oxides have extraordinary electrons/geometry structure ensembles, trimmed electron bands. Herein, well&#8208;defined rutile InSnRuO2 oxides with density&#8208;controllable oxygen vacancy (Ov) free electron polarons are firstly fabricated by in situ isomorphic substitution, using trivalent In species as Ov generators and the adjacent metal ions as electron donors to form orderly and concerted In&#8208;Ov&#8208;Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Sn substructures in the tetravalent oxides.








Abstract
Polymetallic oxides with extraordinary electrons/geometry structure ensembles, trimmed electron bands, and way&#8208;out coordination environments, built by an isomorphic substitution strategy, may create unique contributing to concertedly catalyze water oxidation, which is of great significance for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). Herein, well&#8208;defined rutile InSnRuO2 oxides with density&#8208;controllable oxygen vacancy (Ov)&#8208;free electron polarons are firstly fabricated by in situ isomorphic substitution, using trivalent In species as Ov generators and the adjacent metal ions as electron donors to form orderly and concerted In&#8208;Ov&#8208;Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Sn substructures in the tetravalent oxides. For acidic water oxidation, the obtained InSnRuO2 displays an ultralow overpotential of 183 mV (versus RHE) and a mass activity (MA) of 103.02 A mgRu&#8722;1, respectively. For a long&#8208;term stability test of PEMWE, it can run at a low and unchangeable cell potential (1.56 V) for 200 h at 50 mA cm&#8722;2, far exceeding current IrO2||Pt/C assembly in 0.5 m H2SO4. Accelerated degradation testing results of PEMWE with pure water as the electrolyte show no significant increase in voltage even when the voltage is gradually increased from 1 to 5 A cm&#8722;2. The remarkably improved performance is associated with the concerted In&#8208;Ov&#8208;Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Sn substructures stabilized by the dense Ov&#8208;electron polarons, which synergistically activates band structure of oxygen species and adjacent Ru sites and then boosting the oxygen evolution kinetics. More importantly, the self&#8208;trapped Ov&#8208;electron polaron induces a decrease in the entropy and enthalpy, and efficiently hinder Ru atoms leaching by increasing the lattice atom diffusion energy barrier, achieves long&#8208;term stability of the oxide. This work may open a door to design next&#8208;generation Ru&#8208;based catalysts with polarons to create orderly and asymmetric substructures as active sites for efficient electrocatalysis in PEMWE application.

         <title>Industrial Scale Sea&#8208;Island Melt&#8208;Spun Continuous Ultrafine Fibers for Highly Comfortable Insulated Aerogel Felt Clothing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Industrial&#8208;scale sea&#8208;island melt spinning technology is demonstrated to construct 3D porous thermal insulating aerogels with corrugated lamellar structure through freeze&#8208;shaping technology. This aerogel is only 1/3 the thickness of down but performs similarly. It also has excellent mechanical properties to meet fabric elasticity and comfort needs, while also exhibiting versatility, making it suitable for applications in extreme environments.









Abstract
Aerogels are most attractive for thermal clothing. However, mechanical fragility and structural instability restrict their practical applications. These issues are overcome by developing industrial scale sea&#8208;island melt&#8208;spun ultrafine fibers with large and uniform length&#8208;to&#8208;diameter as building blocks, which are assembled into aerogel felts with corrugated lamellar structure through freeze&#8208;shaping technology. These aerogels possess excellent mechanical properties to meet fabric elasticity and comfort needs, including super&#8208;flexibility (25% tensile strain, 95% compression, 180&#176; bending performance) and fatigue resistance of over 10,000 cycles. The aerogels are also self&#8208;cleaning, waterproof, breathable, and flame&#8208;retardant, making them suitable for application requirements in extreme environments. Moreover, the obtained aerogel felt clothing exhibits excellent thermal insulation properties close to that of dry air, and is only one&#8208;third as thick as down clothing with similar insulating properties. Expanding sea&#8208;island melt&#8208;spun fiber to construct aerogel in this strategy provides scalable potential for developing multifunctional insulating aerogel clothing.

         <title>AI&#8208;Driven Discovery of Amorphous Fluorinated Polymer Electret with Improved Charge Stability for Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new descriptor, solid&#8208;state ionization potential, is proposed to quantify the charging performance of amorphous fluorinated polymer electrets. Using the descriptor and a deep&#8208;learning&#8208;based model, 3 promising molecules are identified out of 1.17 million candidates via high&#8208;throughput screening. The 3 new polymers are successfully synthesized and experimentally validated to have excellent charge&#8208;trapping performance as electret materials.








Abstract
Electret materials are promising dielectric materials with trapped charges for various applications such as vibration energy harvesters and acoustic transducers. In the present work, ionization potential is discovered as the descriptor to quantify the charging performance for amorphous fluorinated polymer electrets. Using this descriptor, high&#8208;throughput computations, and graph neural network models, 1&#160;176&#160;591 functional groups are screened on the cyclic transparent optical polymers (CYTOP), and 3 promising electrets are identified. The electrets are synthesized experimentally as 15 &#181;m&#8208;thick films. The films are able to keep their both bipolar surface potentials above &#177;3.1&#160;kV for over 1500 h and are estimated to have longevity of 146 years under 80&#160;&#176;C, achieving significant improvements on charging stability among CYTOP&#8208;based polymer electrets. The excellent bipolar charging performance can greatly enhance power generation capacity of electret&#8208;based vibration energy harvesters. This work also demonstrates the use of deep learning as a new paradigm for accelerating practical materials discovery.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Adaptable Polyimide Hybrid Dielectric Films with Superior Recyclability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic crosslinked polyimide film (DCPI) is designed by introducing a chain extender. This DCPI film has excellent superior recyclability at the monomer level and self&#8208;healable ability. Moreover, the DCPI is a good corona&#8208;resistant film and a matrix of sustainable carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced composites.








Abstract
Polyimides (PIs) used in advanced electrical and electronic devices can be electrically/mechanically damaged, resulting in a significant waste of resources. Closed&#8208;loop chemical recycling may prolong the service life of synthetic polymers. However, the design of dynamic covalent bonds for preparing chemically recyclable crosslinked PIs remains a challenging task. Herein, new crosslinked PI films containing a PI oligomer, chain extender, and crosslinker are reported. They exhibit superior recyclability and excellent self&#8208;healable ability owing to the synergistic effect of the chain extender and crosslinker. The produced films can be completely depolymerized in an acidic solution at ambient temperature, leading to efficient monomer recovery. The recovered monomers may be used to remanufacture crosslinked PIs without deteriorating their original performance. In particular, the designed films can serve as corona&#8208;resistant films with a recovery rate of approximately 100%. Furthermore, carbon fiber reinforced composites (CFRCs) with PI matrices are suitable for harsh environments and can be recycled multiple times at a non&#8208;destructive recycling rate up to 100%. The preparation of high&#8208;strength dynamic covalent adaptable PI hybrid films from simple PI oligomers, chain extenders, and crosslinkers may provide a solid basis for sustainable development in the electrical and electronic fields.

         <title>Fully Printed, High&#8208;Temperature Micro&#8208;Supercapacitor Arrays Enabled by a Hexagonal Boron Nitride Ionogel Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible micro&#8208;supercapacitor device arrays are fabricated via sequential high&#8208;speed screen printing of conductive graphene electrodes and a high&#8208;temperature hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) ionogel electrolyte. Unlike incumbent polymer electrolytes, the hBN ionogel electrolyte enables stable micro&#8208;supercapacitor functionality at temperatures as high as 180 &#176;C, thus broadening the operating conditions and application space for on&#8208;chip energy storage.








Abstract
The proliferation and miniaturization of portable electronics require energy&#8208;storage devices that are simultaneously compact, flexible, and amenable to scalable manufacturing.

&lt;p&gt;Flexible micro-supercapacitor device arrays are fabricated via sequential high-speed screen printing of conductive graphene electrodes and a high-temperature hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) ionogel electrolyte. Unlike incumbent polymer electrolytes, the hBN ionogel electrolyte enables stable micro-supercapacitor functionality at temperatures as high as 180 &#176;C, thus broadening the operating conditions and application space for on-chip energy storage.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proliferation and miniaturization of portable electronics require energy-storage devices that are simultaneously compact, flexible, and amenable to scalable manufacturing. In this work, mechanically flexible micro-supercapacitor arrays are demonstrated via sequential high-speed screen printing of conductive graphene electrodes and a high-temperature hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) ionogel electrolyte. By combining the superlative dielectric properties of 2D hBN with the high ionic conductivity of ionic liquids, the resulting hBN ionogel electrolyte enables micro-supercapacitors with exceptional areal capacitances that approach 1 mF cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Unlike incumbent polymer-based electrolytes, the high-temperature stability of the hBN ionogel electrolyte implies that the printed micro-supercapacitors can be operated at unprecedentedly high temperatures up to 180 &#176;C. These elevated operating temperatures result in increased power densities that make these printed micro-supercapacitors particularly promising for applications in harsh environments such as underground exploration, aviation, and electric vehicles.

         <title>Unifying and Suppressing Conduction Losses of Polymer Dielectrics for Superior High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrode and bulk&#8208;limited conduction losses are unified and the conduction and energy losses of polymer dielectric at elevated temperatures are thoroughly suppressed by separately optimizing the surface and bulk phase structures of polymer dielectric. From this, the resultant polymer film exhibits superior high&#8208;temperature capacitive performance at elevated temperatures and electric fields.








Abstract
Superior high&#8208;temperature capacitive performance of polymer dielectrics is critical for the modern film capacitor demanded in the harsh&#8208;environment electronic and electrical systems. Unfortunately, the capacitive performance degrades rapidly at elevated temperatures owing to the exponential growth of conduction loss. The conduction loss is mainly composed of electrode and bulk&#8208;limited conduction. Herein, the contribution of surface and bulk factors is unified to conduction loss, and the loss is thoroughly suppressed. The experimental results demonstrate that the polar oxygen&#8208;containing groups on the surface of polymer dielectrics can act as the charge trap sites to immobilize the injected charges from electrode, which can in turn establish a built&#8208;in field to weaken the external electric field and augment the injection barrier height. Wide bandgap aluminum oxide (Al2O3) nanoparticle fillers can serve as deep traps to constrain the transport of injected or thermally activated charges in the bulk phase. From this, at 200 &#176;C, the discharged energy density with a discharge&#8211;charge efficiency of 90% increases by 1058.06% from 0.31 J cm&#8722;3 for pristine polyetherimide to 3.59 J cm&#8722;3 for irradiated composite film. The principle of simultaneously inhibiting the electrode and bulk&#8208;limited conduction losses could be easily extended to other polymer dielectrics for high&#8208;temperature capacitive performance.

         <title>Improving Charge Storage of Biaxially&#8208;Oriented Polypropylene under Extreme Electric Fields by Excimer UV Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft, interface&#8208;free, and ready&#8208;to&#8208;use method by excimer UV irradiation, eliminating any chemical agents or toxic byproduct, is engaged to enhancing the withstanding electric&#8208;field extreme and discharged energy density of biaxially&#8208;oriented polypropylene (BOPP). Highly&#8208;resolved space charge profile is first in situ revealed with identical BOPP samples, illustrating the suppress of space charge injection and electric&#8208;field distortion promote the dielectric performance.








Abstract
Biaxially&#8208;oriented polypropylene (BOPP) is one of the most commonly used materials for film&#8208;based capacitors for power electronics and pulsed power systems. To address the pressing issue of performance&#8208;limiting loss under extreme electric&#8208;fields, here a one&#8208;step, high&#8208;throughput, and environment&#8208;friendly process based on very low&#8208;dose ultra&#8208;violet irradiation from KrCl (222&#160;nm) and Xe2 (172&#160;nm) excimer is demonstrated. The performance of commercial BOPP is boosted in terms of withstanding electric&#8208;field extremes (Weibull breakdown strength 694 to 811&#160;V &#181;m&#8722;1 by 17% at 25&#160;&#176;C and 428 to 651&#160;V &#181;m&#8722;1 by 52% at 120&#160;&#176;C), discharged energy density, and conduction losses. Importantly, the depth profile of space charge is precisely measured in situ with a high resolution of 500&#160;nm by laser induced pressure pulse. Consequently, the space charge effect and electric&#8208;field distortion are reduced and related to the improved polymer films. It is demonstrated that energetic UV photons act as scissors for BOPP chains and dissociate oxygen molecules leading to the more thermally stable oxygen&#8208;containing structures, as deep traps to impede charge migration. This work provides a promising approach to produce polymers with customized microscopic characteristics that is compatible with the assembly lines of polymer&#8208;based capacitors.

         <title>Tough Cortical Bone&#8208;Inspired Tubular Architected Cement&#8208;Based Material with Disorder</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disordered tubular architected cement&#8208;based materials inspired by cortical bone exhibit stepwise cracking toughening mechanism, preventing brittle fracture in otherwise brittle material. Competing effects of tube size, shape, and orientation demonstrate a utility for achieving up to 5.6&#8208;fold&#8208;higher fracture toughness. Two order parameters from statistical mechanics provide pathway to quantify disorder in architected arrangements as described by Reza Moini and co&#8208;worker.








Abstract
Cortical bone is a tough biological material composed of tube&#8208;like osteons embedded in the organic matrix surrounded by weak interfaces known as cement lines. The cement lines provide a microstructurally preferable crack path, hence triggering in&#8208;plane crack deflection around osteons due to cement line&#8208;crack interaction. Inspired by this toughening mechanism and facilitated by a hybrid (3D&#8208;printing/casting) process, the study engineers architected tubular cement&#8208;based materials with the stepwise cracking toughening mechanism, that enables a non&#8208;brittle fracture. Using experimental and theoretical approaches, the study demonstrates the competition between tube size and shape on stress intensity factor from which engineering stepwise cracking can emerge. Two competing mechanisms, both positively and negatively affected by the growing tube size, arise to significantly enhance the overall fracture toughness by up to 5.6&#8208;fold compared to the monolithic brittle counterpart without sacrificing the specific strength. This is enabled by crack&#8208;tube interaction and engineering the tube size, shape, and orientation, which promotes rising resistance&#8208;curves (R&#8208;curve). &#8220;Disorder&#8221; curves and statistical mechanics parameters are proposed for the first time to quantitatively characterize the degree of disorder for describing the representation of the architected arrangement of materials in lieu of otherwise inadequate &#8220;periodicity&#8221; classification and misperceived&#160;disorder parameters (perturbation and Voronoi tessellation methods).

         <title>Understanding, Mimicking, and Mitigating Radiolytic Damage to Polymers in Liquid Phase Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work addresses radiolytic damage to polymers in liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (LP&#8208;TEM), which restricts its routine use in soft matter science. It quantifies polymer degradation behaviors across all conceivable (LP&#8208;)TEM environments, mimics beam&#8208;induced damage using UV light and hydrogen peroxide, evaluates hydroxyl radical scavengers and proposes effective strategies for damage mitigation.








Abstract
Advances in liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (LP&#8208;TEM) have enabled the monitoring of polymer dynamics in solution at the nanoscale, but radiolytic damage during LP&#8208;TEM imaging limits&#160;its routine use in polymer science. This study focuses on understanding, mimicking, and mitigating radiolytic damage observed in functional polymers in LP&#8208;TEM. It is quantitatively demonstrated how polymer damage occurs across all conceivable (LP&#8208;)TEM environments,&#160;and the key characteristics and differences between polymer degradation in water vapor and liquid water are elucidated. Importantly, it is shown that the hydroxyl radical&#8208;rich environment in LP&#8208;TEM can be approximated by UV light irradiation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, allowing the use of bulk techniques to probe damage at the polymer chain level. Finally, the protective effects of commonly used hydroxyl radical scavengers are compared, revealing that the effectiveness of graphene's protection is distance&#8208;dependent. The work provides detailed methodological guidance and establishes a baseline for polymer degradation in LP&#8208;TEM, paving the way for future research on nanoscale tracking of shape transitions and drug encapsulation of polymer assemblies in solution.

The work provides detailed methodological guidance and establishes a baseline for polymer degradation in LP-TEM, paving the way for future research on nanoscale tracking of shape transitions and drug encapsulation of polymer assemblies in solution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Colossal Strain Tuning of Ferroelectric Transitions in KNbO3 Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colossal strain tuning of ferroelectricity is demonstrated in biaxially compressive strained epitaxial KNbO3 thin films, demonstrating a dramatic strain enhancement of ferroelectric polarization and the Curie temperature, eliminating all bulk phase transitions and stabilizing a single tetragonal phase from 5 K to 975&#160;K.








Abstract
Strong coupling between polarization (P) and strain (&#603;) in ferroelectric complex oxides offers unique opportunities to dramatically tune their properties. Here colossal strain tuning of ferroelectricity in epitaxial KNbO3 thin films grown by sub&#8208;oxide molecular beam epitaxy is demonstrated. While bulk KNbO3 exhibits three ferroelectric transitions and a Curie temperature (Tc) of &#8776;676&#160;K, phase&#8208;field modeling predicts that a biaxial strain of as little as &#8722;0.6% pushes its Tc &gt;&#160;975&#160;K, its decomposition temperature in air, and for &#8722;1.4% strain, to Tc &gt;&#160;1325&#160;K, its melting point. Furthermore, a strain of &#8722;1.5% can stabilize a single phase throughout the entire temperature range of its stability. A combination of temperature&#8208;dependent second harmonic generation measurements, synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray reciprocal space mapping, ferroelectric measurements, and transmission electron microscopy reveal a single tetragonal phase from 10 K to 975&#160;K, an enhancement of &#8776;46% in the tetragonal phase remanent polarization (Pr),&#160;and a &#8776;200% enhancement&#160;in its optical second harmonic generation coefficients over bulk values. These properties in a lead&#8208;free system, but with properties comparable or superior to lead&#8208;based systems, make it an attractive candidate for applications ranging from high&#8208;temperature ferroelectric memory to cryogenic temperature quantum computing.

         <title>Intense Circular Dichroism and Spin Selectivity in AgBiS2 Nanocrystals by Chiral Ligand Exchange</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral ligand exchange on nontoxic AgBiS2 nanocrystals (NCs) is developed. The bidentate binding attributed to strong ligand&#8208;NC interaction, including lattice distortion and charge transportation, both of which provide intense chiroptical behavior on AgBiS2 NC (one magnitude higher than the reported ligand exchange NCs). Further, a spintronic device is made, and the highest spin&#8208;polarization based on chiral nanocrystals is achieved.








Abstract
Chiral semiconducting nanomaterials offer many potential applications in photodetection, light emission, quantum information, and so on. However, it is difficult to achieve a strong circular dichroism (CD) signal in semiconducting nanocrystals (NCs) due to the complexity of chiral ligand surface engineering and multiple, uncertain mechanisms of chiroptical behavior. Here, a chiral ligand exchange strategy with cysteine on the ternary metal chalcogenide AgBiS2 NCs is developed, and a strong, long&#8208;lasting CD signal in the near&#8208;UV region is achieved. By carefully optimizing the ligand concentration, the CD peaks are observed at 260 and 320&#160;nm, respectively, giving insight into the different ligand binding mechanisms influencing the CD signal of AgBiS2 NCs. Using density&#8208;functional theory, a large degree of crystal distortion by the bidentate mode of ligand chelation, and efficient ligand&#8208;NC electron transfer, synergistically resulting in the strongest CD signal (g&#8208;factor over 10&#8722;2) observed in chiral ligand&#8208;exchanged semiconductor NCs to date, is demonstrated. To demonstrate the effective chiral properties of these AgBiS2 NCs, a spin&#8208;filter device with over 86% efficiency is fabricated. This work represents a considerable leap in the field of chiral semiconductor NCs and points toward their future applications.

         <title>Improving Oxygen&#8208;Redox&#8208;Active Layered Oxide Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Through Crystal Facet Modulation and Fluorinated Interfacial Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal&#8208;facet modulation and fluorinated interfacial engineering via bifunctional electrolyte additive enhances the anionic redox kinetics and structural stability, which endows Na0.67Li0.24Mn0.76O2 with high capacity, superior rate capability, and long cycle stability for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Layered oxides with active oxygen redox are attractive cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to high capacity but suffer from rapid capacity/voltage deterioration and sluggish reaction kinetics stemming from lattice oxygen release, interfacial side reactions, and structural reconstruction. Herein, a synergistic strategy of crystal&#8208;facet modulation and fluorinated interfacial engineering is proposed to achieve high capacity, superior rate capability, and long cycle stability in Na0.67Li0.24Mn0.76O2. The synthesized single&#8208;crystal Na0.67Li0.24Mn0.76O2 (NLMO{010}) featuring increased {010} active facet exposure exhibits faster anionic redox kinetics and delivers a high capacity (272.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;mA g&#8722;1) with superior energy density (713.9&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and rate performance (116.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1). Moreover, by incorporating N&#8208;Fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFBS) as electrolyte additive, the NLMO{010} cathode retains 84.6% capacity after 400 cycles at 500&#160;mA g&#8722;1 with alleviated voltage fade (0.27&#160;mV per cycle). Combined in situ analysis and theoretical calculations unveil dual functionality of NFBS, which results in thin yet durable fluorinated interfaces on the NLMO{010} cathode and hard carbon anode and scavenges highly reactive oxygen species. The results indicate the importance of fast&#8208;ion&#8208;transfer facet engineering and fluorinated electrolyte formulation to enhance oxygen redox&#8208;active cathode materials for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density SIBs.

         <title>Phosphorylated Covalent Organic Framework Membranes Toward Ultrafast Single Lithium&#8208;Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>

Covalent organic framework membranes, as single Li+ conductors, exhibit a record&#8208;breaking Li+ conductivity of 1.7 mS cm&#8722;1 with a near&#8208;unity Li+&#8208;transference number at room temperature, in which anion groups (&#8208;PO32&#8722;, &#8208;SO3&#8722;, &#8208;COO&#8722;) act as Li+ transporter governing Li+ binding capacity and Li+ releasing ability, and oxygen&#8208;containing groups act as co&#8208;transporters creating relay sites for rapid hopping.








Abstract
Developing all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes, the chips for lithium&#8208;metal batteries, with superior electrochemical and mechanical properties awaits&#160;the disruptive materials. Herein, ionic covalent organic framework membranes are explored as solid&#8208;state electrolytes for single Li+ conduction. In the membrane, the anion groups act as Li+ transporter, determining Li+ binding capacity and releasing ability, whereas the oxygen&#8208;containing groups act as Li+ co&#8208;transporter, creating relay sites between adjacent Li+ transporters for rapid hopping. The membrane exhibits an unprecedented Li+ conductivity of 1.7 mS cm&#8722;1 with a Li+&#8208;transference number close to unity at room temperature. Additionally, the membrane possesses high flexibility, low interfacial resistance, and excellent cycling performance at room temperature. This work paves an unprecedented path for the advancement of next&#8208;generation Li+ conductors in solid&#8208;state electrolytes.

&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic framework membranes, as single Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductors, exhibit a record-breaking Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity of 1.7 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a near-unity Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-transference number at room temperature, in which anion groups (-PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing all-solid-state electrolytes, the chips for lithium-metal batteries, with superior electrochemical and mechanical properties awaits&#160;the disruptive materials. Herein, ionic covalent organic framework membranes are explored as solid-state electrolytes for single Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conduction. In the membrane, the anion groups act as Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transporter, determining Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; binding capacity and releasing ability, whereas the oxygen-containing groups act as Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; co-transporter, creating relay sites between adjacent Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transporters for rapid hopping. The membrane exhibits an unprecedented Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity of 1.7 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-transference number close to unity at room temperature. Additionally, the membrane possesses high flexibility, low interfacial resistance, and excellent cycling performance at room temperature. This work paves an unprecedented path for the advancement of next-generation Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductors in solid-state electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Ultrahigh&#8208;Modulus Hydrogel Electrolyte for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;tough hydrogel electrolytes with hydrophobic domains (established through dipole&#8208;dipole interactions) and crystalline domains (formed via hydrogen bonds) are obtained by a strategy combining wet&#8208;annealing, solvent&#8208;exchange, and salting&#8208;out processes. The synergy between nanoscale phase separation and high crystallinity results in the hydrogel electrolytes with excellent mechanical properties while maintaining high water contents.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state aqueous zinc ion batteries suffer from anodic zinc dendrite growth during plating/stripping processes, impeding their commercial application. The inhibition of zinc dendrites by high&#8208;modulus electrolytes has been proven to be effective. However, hydrogel electrolytes are difficult to achieve high modulus owing to their inherent high water contents. This work reports a hydrogel electrolyte with ultrahigh modulus that can overcome the growth stress of zinc dendrites through mechanical suppression effect. By combining wet&#8208;annealing, solvent&#8208;exchange, and salting&#8208;out processes and tuning the hydrophobic and crystalline domains, a hydrogel electrolyte is obtained with substantial water content (&#8776;70%), high modulus (198.5&#160;MPa), high toughness (274.3&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), and high zinc&#8208;ion conductivity (28.9 mS cm&#8722;1), which significantly outperforms the previously reported poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;based hydrogels. As a result, the hydrogel electrolyte exhibits excellent dendrite&#8208;suppression effect and achieves stable performance in Zn||Zn symmetric batteries (1800&#160;h of cycle life at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). Moreover, the Zn||V2O5 pouch batteries display excellent cycling life and operate stably even under extreme conditions, such as large bending angle (180&#176;) and automotive crushing. This work provides a promising approach for designing mechanically reliable hydrogel electrolytes for advanced aqueous zinc ion batteries.

         <title>Assembly of Silicate&#8211;Phenolic Network Coatings with Tunable Properties for Controlled Release of Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is presented to exploit the dynamic covalent coordination of silicate&#8211;phenolic networks (SPNs) for coating diverse substrates, enabling the engineering of SPN coatings with different physiochemical properties. The pH responsiveness and tailorable hydrophobicity of the SPN materials allow the controlled release of small molecules, such as fertilizers and micronutrients, making them of interest in agricultural applications and beyond.








Abstract
Engineered coatings are pivotal for tailoring the surface properties and release profiles of materials for applications across diverse areas. However, developing robust coatings that can both encapsulate and controllably release cargo is challenging. Herein, a dynamic covalent coordination assembly strategy is used to engineer robust silicate&#8208;based coatings, termed silicate&#8211;phenolic networks (SPNs), using sodium metasilicate and phenolic ligands (tannic acid, gallic acid, pyrogallol). The coatings are pH&#8208;responsive (owing to the dynamic covalent bonding), and their hydrophobicity can be tuned upon their post&#8208;functionalization with hydrophobic gallates (propyl, octyl, lauryl gallates). The potential of the SPN coatings for the controlled release of small molecules, such as urea (a widely used fertilizer), is demonstrated&#8212;controlled release of urea in soil is achieved in response to different pHs (up to 7 days) and different hydrophobicity (up to 14 days). Furthermore, leveraging the presence of silicon (within the coating) and post&#8208;functionalization of the SPN coatings with metal ions (Fe3+, Cu2+, Zn2+) generates a multipurpose delivery system for the sustained release of micronutrient fertilizers, and silicon and metal ions, over 28 and 14 days, respectively. These SPN coatings have potential applications beyond agriculture, including nutrient delivery, separations, food packaging, and medical device fabrication.

A &#8220;phosphor&#8208;in&#8208;ceramic&#8221; route from the glass counterparts toward the NIR&#8208;emitting ceramic film for laser&#8208;driven NIR light source is demonstrated. The composite film with high external quantum yield (57.7%) is obtained, and a preeminent NIR output power of beyond 5 W. The electrically driven pc&#8208;LD device based on PiC delivers 1.6 W of NIR light, enabling night vision imaging over distances of up to 200 m.








Abstract
Ultrabright broadband near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphor&#8208;converted laser diode (pc&#8208;LD) as a light source is increasingly essential for improving the sensitivity and spatial resolution of intelligent NIR spectroscopy technologies. However, the performance of NIR pc&#8208;LD is greatly hindered by the low external quantum efficiency (EQE) and poor thermal resistance of phosphor materials. Herein, a highly stable phosphor&#8208;in&#8208;ceramic (PiC) film deposited on high thermal conductivity substrate, in which the NIR&#8208;emitting Ca3MgHfGe3O12:Cr3+ phosphor is incorporated into a glass&#8208;crystallized Ca3Ga2Ge3O12 ceramic matrix, along with the formation of a new type PiC composite material with high efficiency, absorbance, and thermal conductivity, is designed and prepared. The obtained PiC exhibits an impressive EQE of 57.7%, high thermal conductivity of 17.1 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, and the PiC wheel demonstrates a broadband NIR emission exceeding 5 W when excited by a 450 nm laser. Finally, a groundbreaking electrically driven pc&#8208;LD device based on PiC achieves 1.6 W of NIR output, enabling multiple intelligent spectroscopy applications in archaeology and night vision imaging. This work paves the way for advancing broadband NIR light sources in a diverse range of photonic applications.

         <title>Cyclodextrin Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Functionalized Carbon Materials with Optimized Interface Electronics and Selective Supramolecular Channels for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a strategy based on &#947;&#8208;CDMOF for regulating the microenvironment by optimizing interfacial electronic structures and selective supramolecular channels. It elucidates the primary mechanisms of supramolecular microenvironment regulation, providing a comprehensive understanding of electrolyte&#8211;cathode interface interactions and offering a general design approach for constructing stable, fast&#8208;charging supramolecular microenvironments.








Abstract
During the reaction process in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, Lewis acidic lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) affect ion distribution and overall electrolyte stability, degrading battery performance and product distribution (e.g., Li2S). Here, a microenvironment regulation strategy with optimized interface electronics and selective supramolecular channels, is proposed to enhance LiPS reaction kinetics through Lewis basic &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin metal&#8211;organic framework (&#947;&#8208;CDMOF). To validate this concept, &#947;&#8208;CDMOF is rapidly synthesized on 3D graphene foam (GF) via a microwave&#8208;assisted method, resulting in a &#947;&#8208;CDMOF/GF cathode for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries. A range of analytical techniques combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that introducing a Lewis basic supramolecular microenvironment mitigates the LiPSs shuttle effect, enhances polysulfide capture, and improves sulfur redox conversion. Additionally, COMSOL simulations reveal that the &#947;&#8208;CDMOF framework and oxygen sites significantly reduce volumetric expansion stress during the LiPS solid&#8211;liquid phase transition. Impressively, the &#947;&#8208;CDMOF/GF cathode exhibits exceptional performance, including a high specific capacity (1253.01 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at 0.1C), excellent rate performance (589.68 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at 5C), and long cycle life (over 1200 cycles).

&lt;p&gt;This work presents a strategy based on &#947;-CDMOF for regulating the microenvironment by optimizing interfacial electronic structures and selective supramolecular channels. It elucidates the primary mechanisms of supramolecular microenvironment regulation, providing a comprehensive understanding of electrolyte&#8211;cathode interface interactions and offering a general design approach for constructing stable, fast-charging supramolecular microenvironments.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the reaction process in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, Lewis acidic lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) affect ion distribution and overall electrolyte stability, degrading battery performance and product distribution (e.g., Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S). Here, a microenvironment regulation strategy with optimized interface electronics and selective supramolecular channels, is proposed to enhance LiPS reaction kinetics through Lewis basic &#947;-cyclodextrin metal&#8211;organic framework (&#947;-CDMOF). To validate this concept, &#947;-CDMOF is rapidly synthesized on 3D graphene foam (GF) via a microwave-assisted method, resulting in a &#947;-CDMOF/GF cathode for high-performance Li&#8211;S batteries. A range of analytical techniques combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that introducing a Lewis basic supramolecular microenvironment mitigates the LiPSs shuttle effect, enhances polysulfide capture, and improves sulfur redox conversion. Additionally, COMSOL simulations reveal that the &#947;-CDMOF framework and oxygen sites significantly reduce volumetric expansion stress during the LiPS solid&#8211;liquid phase transition. Impressively, the &#947;-CDMOF/GF cathode exhibits exceptional performance, including a high specific capacity (1253.01 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at 0.1C), excellent rate performance (589.68 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at 5C), and long cycle life (over 1200 cycles). This study introduces a new concept of supramolecular microenvironment regulation and interfacial interaction strategy, offering a unique approach for the development of multifunctional electrode materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Ultrabroadband Microwave Absorber
In article number 2411153, Weiming Zhu and colleagues present a nontrivial ultrabroadband microwave absorber with over 93% absorption across K and Ka bands. This achievement is based on manipulating electromagnetic resonances in a 2D doped water meta&#8208;atom lattice, resulting in a thin, broad bandwidth, and cost&#8208;effective solution.

Magnetic Field&#8208;Induced Polar Order
In monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, the interplay of broken inversion symmetry and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling results in spin&#8208;valley locking. When a magnetic field is applied, it lifts the valley degeneracy and triggers lattice displacement in real space. Due to the material's contact with the substrate, the top and bottom atoms experience different degrees of displacement, which induces electric polarization. More details can be found in article number 2411393 by Chun&#8208;Liang Lin, Ting&#8208;Hua Lu, Yann&#8208;Wen Lan, Nai&#8208;Chang Yeh, and co&#8208;workers.

Chiral Nanocrystals
In article number 2410087, Jonathan E. Halpert, Andrey L. Rogach, Guanhua Chen, Liang Guo, and their research team achieved intense chirality in environmentally friendly nanocrystals (AgBiS2) through a solution&#8208;phase chiral ligand exchange. The ligands bond strongly to the nanocrystal surface, creating chiral distortion and charge transfer. The process resulted in chiral AgBiS2 nanocrystals with a strong, long&#8208;lasting circular dichroism signal and enhanced chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity, allowing them to filter a single type of electron spin from the current. The illustration demonstrates the strong selectivity of the chiral AgBiS2 nanocrystals for circularly polarized light and electron spins.

Cement&#8208;Based Material
Disordered tubular architected cement&#8208;based materials inspired by cortical bone exhibit stepwise cracking toughening mechanism, preventing brittle fracture in otherwise brittle material. Competing effects of tube size, shape, and orientation demonstrate a utility for achieving up to 5.6&#8208;fold&#8208;higher fracture toughness. Two order parameters from statistical mechanics provide pathways to quantify disorder in architected arrangements as described in article number 2313904 by Shashank Gupta and Reza Moini.

         <title>Recent Advances in Ferroelectret Fabrication, Performance Optimization, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectrets demonstrate remarkable flexibility and piezoelectricity attributed to the formation of macrodipoles within the internal cavities of porous dielectric films upon polarization. This article provides a comprehensive review of ferroelectret fabrication techniques with different cavity structures, models for predicting piezoelectric coefficients, methods for enhancing performance, diverse applications, and future trends for large&#8208;scale preparation and integration with wearable systems.








Abstract
The growing demand for wearable devices has sparked a significant interest in ferroelectret films. They possess flexibility and exceptional piezoelectric properties due to strong macroscopic dipoles formed by charges trapped at the interface of their internal cavities. This review of ferroelectrets focuses on the latest progress in fabrication techniques for high temperature resistant ferroelectrets with regular and engineered cavities, strategies for optimizing their piezoelectric performance, and novel applications. The charging mechanisms of bipolar and unipolar ferroelectrets with closed and open&#8208;cavity structures are explained first. Next, the preparation and piezoelectric behavior of ferroelectret films with closed, open, and regular cavity structures using various materials are discussed. Three widely used models for predicting the piezoelectric coefficients (d33) are outlined. Methods for enhancing the piezoelectric performance such as optimized cavity design, utilization of fabric electrodes, injection of additional ions, application of DC bias voltage, and synergy of foam structure and ferroelectric effect are illustrated. A variety of applications of ferroelectret films in acoustic devices, wearable monitors, pressure sensors, and energy harvesters are presented. Finally, the future development trends of ferroelectrets toward fabrication and performance optimization are summarized along with its potential for integration with intelligent systems and large&#8208;scale preparation.

         <title>A Review of Polyolefin&#8208;Insulation Materials in High Voltage Transmission; From Electronic Structures to Final Products</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review on polyolefin insulations in high&#8208;voltage DC components. It contains a state of the art of current systems, techniques to measure insulation properties, and a presentation of mechanisms affecting the insulation performance, including effects of molecular structure, morphology, fillers, and impurities. Modeling to predict and understand the insulation properties is also discussed as well as sustainability aspects.









Abstract
This review focuses on the use of polyolefins in high&#8208;voltage direct&#8208;current (HVDC) cables and capacitors. A short description of the latest evolution and current use of HVDC cables and capacitors is first provided, followed by the basics of electric insulation and capacitor functions. Methods to determine dielectric properties are described, including charge transport, space charges, resistivity, dielectric loss, and breakdown strength. The semicrystalline structure of polyethylene and isotactic polypropylene is described, and the way it relates to the dielectric properties is discussed. A significant part of the review is devoted to describing the state of art of the modeling and prediction of electric or dielectric properties of polyolefins with consideration of both atomistic and continuum approaches. Furthermore, the effects of the purity of the materials and the presence of nanoparticles are presented, and the review ends with the sustainability aspects of these materials. In summary, the effective use of modeling in combination with experimental work is described as an important route toward understanding and designing the next generations of materials for electrical insulation in high&#8208;voltage transmission.

         <dc:description>
Enhancing the external quantum efficiency of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes relies on increasing the photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) of perovskite emitters through optimized design and synthesis. This review provides a holistic view of how the interplay between the interaction of additives with perovskites, the perovskite crystallization dynamics, and the PLQY of perovskite films collectively enhance device efficiency and stability.








Abstract
Halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) hold great potential for applications in displays and lighting. To enhance the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of PeLEDs, it is crucial to boost the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the perovskite films. The use of additives has emerged as a powerful chemical strategy to control the crystallization process in solution&#8208;processed perovskite films. The different types of additives that can be used reflect the various types of chemical interactions with the perovskite materials, influencing their crystallization process in various possible ways. Understanding the relationship between these chemical interactions and their impact on the crystallization process is a key step for designing emitters with improved PLQY and devices with superior EQE. Following the logic chain of additive&#8211;perovskite interactions, impacts on crystallization, and subsequent enhancement of PLQY and EQE, this review discusses how additives play a pivotal role in influencing the crystallization process to enhance the PLQY of the perovskite films. Furthermore, this assessment addresses the open challenges and outlines future prospects for the development of PeLEDs.

         <title>Engineering the Dielectric Constants of Polymers: From Molecular to Mesoscopic Scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively outlines strategies that have been adopted to regulate the dielectric constants of polymers from molecular to mesoscopic scales, focusing on application&#8208;driven design and on&#8208;demand synthesis of polymers from a polymer chemistry perspective. Furthermore, it summarizes key application areas and systems that can benefit from the dielectric constant engineering of polymers and discusses the future prospects of this technique.








Abstract
Polymers are essential components of modern&#8208;day materials and are widely used in various fields. The dielectric constant, a key physical parameter, plays a fundamental role in the light&#8208;, electricity&#8208;, and magnetism&#8208;related applications of polymers, such as dielectric and electrical insulation, battery and photovoltaic fabrication, sensing and electrical contact, and signal transmission and communication. Over the past few decades, numerous efforts have been devoted to engineering the intrinsic dielectric constant of polymers, particularly by tailoring the induced and orientational polarization modes and ferroelectric domain engineering. Investigations into these methods have guided the rational design and on&#8208;demand preparation of polymers with desired dielectric constants. This review article exhaustively summarizes the dielectric constant engineering of polymers from molecular to mesoscopic scales, with emphasis on application&#8208;driven design and on&#8208;demand polymer synthesis rooted in polymer chemistry principles. Additionally, it explores the key polymer applications that can benefit from dielectric constant regulation and outlines the future prospects of this field.

         <title>Advances in Polymer Dielectrics with High Energy Storage Performance by Designing Electric Charge Trap Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review meticulously outlines the various characterization techniques for charge trapping parameters, while delving deep into the intricate physical mechanisms that govern charge trapping, thus elucidating their significant impact on enhancing the energy storage capabilities of polymer dielectric films. This review provides an insightful analysis that enriches the understanding of the subject.








Abstract
Dielectric capacitors have been developed for nearly a century, and all&#8208;polymer film capacitors are currently the most popular. Much effort has been devoted to studying polymer dielectric capacitors and improving their capacitive performance, but their high conductivity and capacitance losses under high electric fields or elevated temperatures are still significant challenges. Although many review articles have reported various strategies to address these problems, to the best of current knowledge, no review article has summarized the recent progress in the high&#8208;energy storage performance of polymer&#8208;based dielectric films with electric charge trap structures. Therefore, this paper first reviews the charge trap characterization methods for polymeric dielectrics and discusses their strengths and weaknesses. The research progress on the design of charge trap structures in polymer dielectric films, including molecular chain optimization, organic doping, blending modification, inorganic doping, multilayered structures, and the mechanisms of the charge trap&#8208;induced enhancement of the capacitive performance of polymers are systematically reviewed. Finally, a summary and outlook on the fundamental theory of charge trap regulation, performance characterization, numerical calculations, and engineering applications are presented. This review provides a valuable reference for improving the insulation and energy storage performance of dielectric capacitive films.

         <title>Dilute Nanocomposites: Tuning Polymer Chain Local Nanostructures to Enhance Dielectric Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 52, December 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dielectric nanocomposites are of great interest for electronic devices and systems. Besides traditional nanocomposite with high nanofillers loading, it is discovered that ultralow loading (&lt;0.5 vol%) of nanofillers in different types of polymers leads to marked enhancements in dielectric constant while maintaining desirable loss and breakdown. This unconventional approach is reviewed and the future of polymer&#8208;based dielectrics is highlighted.








Abstract
Dielectric polymers possessing high energy and low losses are of great interest for electronic and electric devices and systems. Nanocomposites in which high dielectric constant (high&#8208;K) nanofillers at high loading (&gt;10 vol%) are admixed with polymer matrix have been investigated for decades, aiming at enhancing the dielectric performance, but with limited success. In 2017, it is discovered that reducing nanofiller loading to less than 0.5 vol% in polymer matrix can lead to marked enhancement in dielectric performance. Here, we reviewed the discoveries and advances of this unconventional approach to enhance dielectric performance of polymers. Experimental studies uncover that nanofillers lead to interfaces&#160;changes over distances larger than 100&#160;nm. Experimental and modeling results show that introducing free volume in polymers reduces the constraints of glass matrix on dipoles in polymers, leading to enhanced K without affecting breakdown. Moreover, low&#8208;K nanofillers at low&#8208;volume loading serve as deep traps for charges, lowering conduction losses and increasing breakdown strength. The dilute nanocomposites provide new avenues for designing dielectric polymers with high K, minimal losses, and robust breakdown fields, thus achieving high energy and power density and low loss for operation over a broad temperature regime.

The contact electrification and charge transport mechanism of dielectric materials for TENGs are introduced, followed by highlighting the modification mechanisms, strategies, and applications of advanced tribo&#8208;dielectrics based power sources and self&#8208;powered sensors, serving as guidelines for developing high&#8208;performance TENGs.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) manifests distinct advantages such as multiple structural selectivity, diverse selection of materials, environmental adaptability, low cost, and remarkable conversion efficiency, which becomes a promising technology for micro&#8208;nano energy harvesting and self&#8208;powered sensing. Tribo&#8208;dielectric materials are the fundamental and core components for high&#8208;performance TENGs. In particular, the charge generation, dissipation, storage, migration of the dielectrics, and dynamic equilibrium behaviors determine the overall performance. Herein, a comprehensive summary is presented to elucidate the dielectric charge transport mechanism and tribo&#8208;dielectric material modification principle toward high&#8208;performance TENGs. The contact electrification and charge transport mechanism of dielectric materials is started first, followed by introducing the basic principle and dielectric materials of TENGs. Subsequently, modification mechanisms and strategies for high&#8208;performance tribo&#8208;dielectric materials are highlighted regarding physical/chemical, surface/bulk, dielectric coupling, and structure optimization. Furthermore, representative applications of dielectric materials based TENGs as power sources, self&#8208;powered sensors are demonstrated. The existing challenges and promising potential opportunities for advanced tribo&#8208;dielectric materials are outlined, guiding the design, fabrication, and applications of tribo&#8208;dielectric materials.

This review comprehensively summarizes the Cu&#8208;based sub&#8208;nanometric catalysts with critical insights for electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) to high&#8208;value products. In addition, the non&#8208;Cu&#8208;based sub&#8208;nanometric catalysts and theoretical calculations of different transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts are reviewed and detailed for CO2RR to high&#8208;value products. Finally, conclusions and future outlooks are provided for further development of the research domain








Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion into valuable chemicals paves the way for the realization of carbon recycling. Downsizing catalysts to single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs), and sub&#8208;nanocluster catalysts (SNCCs) has generated highly active and selective CO2 transformation into highly reduced products. This is&#160;due to the introduction of numerous active sites, highly unsaturated coordination environments, efficient atom utilization, and confinement effect compared to their nanoparticle counterparts. Herein, recent Cu&#8208;based SACs are first reviewed and the newly emerged DACs and SNCCs expanding the catalysis of SACs to electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) to high&#8208;value products are discussed. Tandem Cu&#8208;based SAC&#8211;nanocatalysts (NCs) (SAC&#8211;NCs) are also discussed for the CO2RR to high&#8208;value products. Then, the non&#8208;Cu&#8208;based SACs, DACs, SAC&#8211;NCs, and SNCCs and theoretical calculations of various transition&#8208;metal catalysts for CO2RR to high&#8208;value products are summarized. Compared to previous achievements of less&#8208;reduced products, this review focuses on the double objective of achieving full CO2 reduction and increasing the selectivity and formation rate toward C&#8211;C coupled products with additional emphasis on the stability of the catalysts. Finally, through combined theoretical and experimental research, future outlooks are offered to further develop the CO2RR into high&#8208;value products over isolated atoms and sub&#8208;nanometal clusters.

Single&#8208;particle analysis has seen significant success in structural biology, yet its potential applications in synthetic chemical systems remain underexplored. This perspective briefly introduces SPA and associated electron microscopy techniques and emphasizes that SPA is well&#8208;suited for structural analysis of chemical systems where discrete, identical macromolecules can be readily obtained.








Abstract
Single&#8208;particle analysis (SPA) is a fundamental method of cryo&#8208;electron microscopy developed to resolve the structures of biological macromolecules. This method has seen significant success in structural biology, yet its potential applications in synthetic chemical systems remain underexplored. In this perspective article, SPA and associated electron microscopy techniques are first briefly introduced. It is then proposed that SPA is well&#8208;suited for structural analysis of chemical systems where discrete, identical macromolecules can be readily obtained. Applicable systems include various clusters such as coinage metal clusters, metal&#8208;oxo/sulfur clusters, metal&#8211;organic clusters, and supramolecular compounds like coordination cages and metallo&#8208;supramolecular cages. When high&#8208;quality large single crystals are unattainable, SPA provides an alternative method for determining their structures. Beyond these end products, it is suggested that SPA can be instrumental in studying synthetic intermediates of materials with specific building units, such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks and zeolites. Given that various intermediates coexist in the reaction system, a purification step is necessary before conducting SPA, which can be facilitated by soft&#8208;landing electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.

         <title>Passivation Layers in Mg&#8208;Metal Batteries: Robust Interphases for Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inert passivation layer formed on the Mg&#8208;metal anode that blocks the transport of Mg2+ emerges as a good conductor for Li+ transport and provides sturdy protection on Li&#8208;metal anodes in carbonate ester electrolytes.








Abstract
In advanced batteries, interphases serve as the key component in stabilizing the electrolyte with reactive electrode materials far beyond thermodynamic equilibria. While an active interphase facilitates the transport of working ions, an inactive interphase obstructs ion flow, constituting the primary barrier to the realization of battery chemistries. Here, a successful transformation of a traditionally inactive passivating layer on Mg&#8208;metal anode, characteristic of Mg&#8208;metal batteries with typical carbonate electrolytes, into an active and robust interphase in the Li&#8208;metal scenario is presented. By further strategically designing magnesiated Li+ electrolytes, the in situ development of this resilient interphase on Li&#8208;metal anodes, imparting enduring stability to Li&#8208;metal batteries with nickel&#8208;rich cathodes is induced. It is identified that the strong affinity between Mg2+ and anions in magnesiated Li+ electrolytes assembles ionic clusters with a bias for reducibility, thereby catalyzing the creation of anion&#8208;derived interphases rich in inorganic constituents. The prevalence of ionic clusters induced by magnesiation of electrolytes has brought properties only available in high&#8208;concentration electrolytes, suggesting a fresh paradigm of tailing electrolytes for highly reversible LMBs.

         <title>Lubricated Surface in a Vertical Double&#8208;Sided Architecture for Radiative Cooling and Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lubricated surface (LS) coating on the condenser side in a vertical double&#8208;sided architecture is used. The design not only effectively doubles the local cooling power, but also eliminates contact&#8208;line pinning, enabling passive, gravity&#8208;driven collection of water. This system achieves a condensation rate &#8776;87% of the theoretical limit with up to 90% of the total condensate passively collected.








Abstract
Radiative cooling significantly lowers condenser temperatures below ambient levels, enabling atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) without additional energy. However, traditional sky&#8208;facing condensers have low cooling power density, and water droplets remain pinned on surface, requiring active condensate collection. To overcome these challenges, a lubricated surface (LS) coating&#8212;consisting of highly scalable polydimethylsiloxane elastomer lubricated with silicone oil&#8212;is introduced on the condenser side in a vertical double&#8208;sided architecture. The design not only effectively doubles the local cooling power, but also eliminates contact&#8208;line pinning, enabling passive, gravity&#8208;driven collection of water. Robust AWH is demonstrated from a 30 &#215; 30 cm2 sample in outdoor environments (of varying humidity levels and wind speeds in different months) and with no artificial flow of humidified air. In one outdoor test, the passive water collection rate of LS coating reaches 21 g m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 double that on superhydrophobic surface, 10 g m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1. In indoor testing (20&#160;&#176;C and 80% relative humidity), this system achieves a condensation rate &#8776;87% of the theoretical limit with up to 90% of the total condensate passively collected. this approach achieves effective AWH in a decentralized approach that removes the need for piping infrastructure and external energy input.

         <title>Wafer&#8208;Scale Transfer of MXene Films with Enhanced Device Performance via 2D Liquid Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and straightforward transfer process is developed for 4&#8208;inch wafer&#8208;scale Ti3C2Tx MXene films, in which damage and deformation are minimized. Uniform vdW stacking of several types of large&#8208;area heterojunctions MXene/MoS2/MXene are well demonstrated. By utilizing 2D liquid reductants to modify the MXene/MoS2 interface, a more than 100&#8208;fold increase in carrier transfer efficiency is achieved.








Abstract
Wafer&#8208;scale transfer processes of 2D materials significantly expand their application space in scalable microelectronic devices with excellent and tunable properties through van der Waals (vdW) stacking. Unlike many 2D materials, wafer&#8208;scale transfer of MXene films for vdW contact engineering has not yet been reported. With their rich surface chemistry and tunable properties, the transfer of MXenes can enable enormous possibilities in electronic devices using interface engineering. Taking advantage of the MXene hydrophilic surface, a straightforward, green, and fast process for the transfer of MXene films at the wafer scale (4&#8208;inch) is developed. Uniform vdW stacking of several types of large&#8208;area heterojunctions including MXene/MXene (Ti3C2Tx, Nb2CTx, and V2CTx), MXene/MoS2, and MXene/Au is further demonstrated. Multilayer support is applied to minimize damage or deformation in the transfer process of patterned Ti3C2Tx film. It allows us to fabricate thin film transistors and manipulate the MXene/MoS2 interface through the intercalation of various 2D liquids. Particularly noteworthy is the significant enhancement of the interfacial carrier transfer efficiency by &#8776;2 orders of magnitude using hydrogen iodide (HI) intercalation. This finding indicates a wide range of possibilities for interface engineering by transferring MXene films and employing liquid&#8208;assisted interfacial intercalation.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering of MoxSy via Boron&#8208;Doping for Electrochemical N2&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally designed boron&#8208;doped molybdenum sulfide (B&#8208;Mo&#8208;MoxSy) electrocatalyst demonstrates improved N2 reduction at an onset potential of &#8722;0.15 V versus. RHE, achieving Faradaic efficiencies of 78% and an NH3 yield of 5.83 &#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in 0.05 m H2SO4(aq). The outstanding NRR performance is attributed to the phase transition of MoxSy, Mo sites, and B doping, which promotes N2 reduction to NH3.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic synthesis of ammonia (NH3) through the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient temperature and pressure is emerging as an alternative approach to the conventional Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, it remains a significant challenge due to poor kinetics, low nitrogen (N2) solubility in aqueous electrolytes, and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which can significantly impact NH3 production rates and Faradaic efficiency (FE). Herein, a rationally designed boron&#8208;doped molybdenum sulfide (B&#8208;Mo&#8208;MoxSy) electrocatalyst is reported that effectively enhances N2 reduction to &#160;NH3 with an onset potential of &#8722;0.15&#160;V versus RHE, achieving a FE of 78% and an NH3 yield of 5.83&#160;&#181;g h&#8315;&#185; cm&#8315;2 in a 0.05&#160;m H2SO4(aq). Theoretical studies suggest that the effectiveness of NRR originates from electron density redistribution due to boron (B) doping, which provides an ideal pathway for nitrogenous species to bind with electron&#8208;deficient B sites. This work demonstrates a significant exploration, showing that Mo&#8208;based electrocatalysts are capable of facilitating artificial N2 fixation.

         <title>The Effect of Relative Humidity in Conductive Atomic Force Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the impact&#160;of relative humidity (RH) on conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) measurements is investigated. For insulating and ultra&#8208;thin (less than 5 nm) semiconducting samples, a RH at 4% results in lower and more inhomogeneous currents compared to RH = 54%. In contrast, for thicker&#160;semiconducting (above 5 nm) and metallic samples, RH has no significant effect. These observations are confirmed by over 17,000 tests at different locations of ten samples.








Abstract
Conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) analyzes electronic phenomena in materials and devices with nanoscale lateral resolution, and it is widely used by companies, research institutions, and universities. Most data published in the field of CAFM is collected in air at a relative humidity (RH) of 30&#8211;60%. However, the effect of RH in CAFM remains unclear because&#160;previous studies often made contradictory claims, plus the number of samples and locations tested is scarce. Moreover, previous studies on this topic did&#160;not apply current limitations, which can degrade the CAFM tips and generate false data. This article systematically analyzes the effect of RH in CAFM by applying ramped voltage stresses at over 17,000 locations on ten different samples (insulating, semiconducting, and conducting) under seven different RH. An ultra&#8208;reliable setup with a 110&#8208;pA current limitation during electrical stresses is employed, and&#160;excellent CAFM tip integrity after thousands of tests is demonstrated. It is found that higher RH results in increased currents due to the presence of a conductive&#160;water meniscus at the tip/sample junction, which increases the effective area for&#160;electron flow. This trend is observed in insulators and ultra&#8208;thin semiconductors; however, in thicker semiconductors the electron mean free path is high enough to mask this effect. Metallic samples show no dependence on RH. This study clarifies the effect of relative humidity in CAFM, enhances understanding of the technique, and teaches researchers how to improve the reliability of their studies in this field.

High&#8208;performance OH&#8208;functionalized triptycene&#8208; and Tr&#246;ger's base&#8208;derived&#160;PIMs and a series of dual&#8208;functionalized PIM&#8208;PI blends containing both hydroxyl&#8208; and carboxyl functional groups are demonstrated for membrane&#8208;based gas separations. Physical crosslinking induced by strong hydrogen bonding of functionalized PIMs and PIM&#8208;PI blends forms tight polymer networks, providing an efficient strategy for developing plasticization resistant, robust, and highly&#8208;selective PIM&#8208;based membrane materials.








Abstract
Membrane technology has shown significant growth during the past two decades in the gas separation industry due to its energy&#8208;savings, compact and modular design, continuous operation, and environmentally benign nature. Robust materials with higher permeability and selectivity are key to reduce capital and operational cost, pushing it forward to replace or debottleneck conventional energy&#8208;intensive unit operations such as distillation. Recently designed ladder polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIM) and polyimides of intrinsic microporosity (PIM&#8208;PI) with pores &lt;20 &#197; have demonstrated excellent gas permeation performance. Here, a series of plasticization&#8208;resistant PIM&#8208;based membrane materials is reported, including the first example of a hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized triptycene&#8208; and Tr&#246;ger's base&#8208;derived ladder PIM and two PIM&#8208;PI homopolymers and a series of dual&#8208;functionalized polyimide blends containing hydroxyl&#8208; and carboxyl&#8208;functionalized groups. Specifically, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphthalic anhydride (6FDA)&#8208;based PIM&#8208;PI blends demonstrated extremely high selectivity for a variety of industrially important applications. An optimized polyimide blend containing &#9472;OH and &#9472;COOH groups showed permselectivity values of 136 for CO2/CH4, 11.4 for O2/N2 and 636 for H2/CH4. Such extreme size&#8208;sieving capabilities are attributed to physical crosslinking induced by strong hydrogen bonding forming tightly structured polymer networks. The study provides a new general strategy for developing plasticization resistant, robust, and highly&#8208;selective PIM&#8208;based membrane materials.

Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) glasses composed of zinc and imidazole derivatives are employed to prepare large&#8208;area and continuous MOF films. The MOF glass detector achieves an outstanding X&#8208;ray sensitivity of 112.8 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a detection limit of 0.41 &#181;Gyair s&#8722;1. These findings pave the way for large&#8208;area MOF&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detectors with practical applications in medical and security screening domains.








Abstract
Cutting&#8208;edge techniques utilizing continuous films made from pure, novel semiconductive materials offer promising pathways to achieve high performance and cost&#8208;effectiveness for X&#8208;ray detection. Semiconductive metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) glass films are known for their remarkably smooth surface morphology, straightforward synthesis, and capability for large&#8208;area fabrication, presenting a new direction for high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detectors. Here, a novel material centered on MOF glasses for highly uniform glass film fabrication customized for X&#8208;ray detection is introduced. MOF glasses, composed of zinc and imidazole derivatives, enable the transition from solid to liquid at low temperatures, facilitating the straightforward preparation of large&#8208;area and continuous MOF films with high mobility for X&#8208;ray device fabrication. Remarkably, MOF glass detectors demonstrate an exceptional sensitivity of 112.8 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a detection limit of 0.41 &#181;Gyair s&#8722;1, making them one of the most sensitive and with the best detection limits reported to date for MOF X&#8208;ray detectors. Clear X&#8208;ray images are successfully conducted using these developed MOF glass detectors for the first time. This breakthrough in X&#8208;ray sensitivity, and detection limit along with the spatial imaging resolution establishes a new standard for developing large&#8208;area and efficient MOF&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detectors with practical applications in medical and security screening.

         <title>The Role of Side Chains and Hydration on Mixed Charge Transport in n&#8208;Type Polymer Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most conjugated polymers require polar ethylene glycol (EG) side chains for mixed ion&#8208;electron conduction. Yet, this study finds that longer EG chains reduce transport efficiency in n&#8208;type conductors. Using various in situ techniques, this study highlights swelling's detrimental effect on mixed charge transport. Surprisingly, n&#8208;type films maintain mixed conduction even without a crystalline phase.








Abstract
Introducing ethylene glycol (EG) side chains to a conjugated polymer backbone is a well&#8208;established synthetic strategy for designing organic mixed ion&#8208;electron conductors (OMIECs). However, the impact that film swelling has on mixed conduction properties has yet to be scoped, particularly for electron&#8208;transporting (n&#8208;type) OMIECs. Here, the authors investigate the effect of the length of branched EG chains on mixed charge transport of n&#8208;type OMIECs based on a naphthalene&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;tetracarboxylic&#8208;diimide&#8208;bithiophene backbone. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) are used to establish the similarities between the common&#8208;backbone films in dry conditions. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (EQCM&#8208;D) and in situ GIWAXS measurements reveal stark changes in film swelling properties and microstructure during electrochemical doping, depending on the side chain length. It is found that even in the loss of the crystallite content upon contact with the aqueous electrolyte, the films can effectively transport charges and that it is rather the high water content that harms the electronic interconnectivity within the OMIEC films. These results highlight the importance of controlling water uptake in the films to impede charge transport in n&#8208;type electrochemical devices.

         <title>Balancing Pd&#8211;H Interactions: Thiolate&#8208;Protected Palladium Nanoclusters for Robust and Rapid Hydrogen Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiolate&#8208;protected palladium nanoclusters (Pd8SR16) enhance hydrogen gas (H2) sensing by leveraging metal&#8208; thiolate synergy, balancing palladium&#8211;hydrogen (Pd&#8211;H) interactions, and preventing excessive binding and phase transitions. Pd8SR16 surpass traditional Pd metals in durability and reversibility, enabling rapid H2 detection at parts per million (ppm) levels. A portable, wireless prototype highlights the practicality of ligand&#8208;protected nanoclusters in real&#8208;world scenarios.








Abstract
The transition toward hydrogen gas (H2) as an eco&#8208;friendly and renewable energy source necessitates advanced safety technologies, particularly robust sensors for H2 leak detection and concentration monitoring. Although palladium (Pd)&#8208;based materials are preferred for their strong H2 affinity, intense palladium&#8211;hydrogen (Pd&#8211;H) interactions lead to phase transitions to palladium hydride (PdHx), compromising sensors&#8217; durability and detection speeds after multiple uses. In response, this study introduces a high&#8208;performance H2 sensor designed from thiolate&#8208;protected Pd nanoclusters (Pd8SR16), which leverages the synergistic effect between the metal and protective ligands to form an intermediate palladium&#8211;hydrogen&#8211;sulfur (Pd&#8211;H&#8211;S) state during H2 adsorption. Striking a balance, it preserves Pd&#8211;H binding affinity while preventing excessive interaction, thus lowering the energy required for H2 desorption. The dynamic adsorption&#8208;dissociation&#8208;recombination&#8208;desorption process is efficiently and highly reversible with Pd8SR16, ensuring robust and rapid H2 sensing at parts per million (ppm). The Pd8SR16&#8208;based sensor demonstrates exceptional stability (50 cycles; 0.11% standard deviation in response), prompt response/recovery (t90 = 0.95 s/6 s), low limit of detection (LoD, 1&#160;ppm), and ambient temperature operability, ranking it among the most sensitive Pd&#8208;based H2 sensors. Furthermore, a multifunctional prototype demonstrates the practicality of real&#8208;world gas sensing using ligand&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters.

         <title>Revisiting the Epitaxial Growth Mechanism of 2D TMDC Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>

This study uncovers the pivotal role of sulfur evaporation rates in directing the growth modes of MoS2 on sapphire. Low sulfur levels preserve O/Al&#8208;terminated step edges, fostering atomic&#8208;edge epitaxy, while high sulfur levels favor S&#8208;terminated edges, promoting van der Waals epitaxy. The findings highlight that van der Waals epitaxy achieves superior MoS2 alignment (&#8776;99%) on a 2 in. wafer, offering new insights into precise 2D material fabrication.








Abstract
Epitaxial growth of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) on sapphire substrates has been recognized as a pivotal method for producing wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal films. Both step&#8208;edges and symmetry of substrate surfaces have been proposed as controlling factors. However, the underlying fundamental still remains elusive. In this work, through the molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) growth on C/M sapphire, it is demonstrated that controlling the sulfur evaporation rate is crucial for dictating the switch between atomic&#8208;edge guided epitaxy and van der Waals epitaxy. Low&#8208;concentration sulfur condition preserves O/Al&#8208;terminated step edges, fostering atomic&#8208;edge epitaxy, while high&#8208;concentration sulfur leads to S&#8208;terminated edges, preferring van der Waals epitaxy. These experiments reveal that on a 2 in. wafer, the van der Waals epitaxy mechanism achieves better control in MoS2 alignment (&#8776;99%) compared to the step edge mechanism (&lt;85%). These findings shed light on the nuanced role of atomic&#8208;level thermodynamics in controlling nucleation modes of TMDCs, thereby providing a pathway for the precise fabrication of single&#8208;crystal 2D materials on a wafer scale.

         <title>Manipulation of Oxidation States on Phase Boundary via Surface Layer Modification for Enhanced Alkaline Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterostructure of crystalline Ni4W and amorphous WOx is constructed through a phase engineering strategy. The oxidation state of W in WOx is adjusted to optimize the phase boundary properties with enhanced intrinsic activity for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction process. This advancement is supported by operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical analysis, offering insights for designing more effective catalysts.








Abstract
In alkaline water electrolysis and anion exchange membrane water electrolysis technologies, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode is significantly constrained by a high energy barrier during the water dissociation step. This study employs a phase engineering strategy to construct heterostructures composed of crystalline Ni4W and amorphous WOx aiming to enhance catalytic performance in the HER under alkaline conditions. This work systematically modulates the oxidation states of W within the amorphous WOx of the heterostructure to adjust the electronic states of the phase boundary, the energy barriers associated with the water dissociation step, and the adsorption/desorption properties of intermediates during the alkaline HER process. The optimized catalyst, Ni4W/WOx&#8208;2, with a quasi&#8208;metallic state of W coordinated by a low oxygen content in amorphous WOx, demonstrates exceptional catalytic performance (22 mV@10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), outperforming commercial Pt/C (30 mV@10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, the operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that the optimized W atoms in amorphous WOx serve as active sites for water dissociation and the nearby Ni atoms in crystalline Ni4W facilitated the release of H2. These findings provide valuable insights into designing efficient heterostructured materials for energy conversion.

         <title>Silicon Clathrate&#8208;Supported Catalysts with Low Work Functions for Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diamond&#8208;type Si has a high work function, but here it is shown how this can be drastically lowered in its alkali clathrate form K7.5Si46. These group 14 clathrates are previously examined for thermoelectric and photovoltaic properties, but the low work function enables it to function as an effective catalyst support for ammonia synthesis, thus expanding material applications.








Abstract
Diamond&#8208;type silicon has a work function of &#8776;4.8&#160;eV, and conventional n&#8208; or p&#8208;type doping modifies the value only between 4.6 and 5.05&#160;eV. Here, it is shown that the alkali clathrates AxSi46 have substantially lower work functions approaching 2.6&#160;eV, with clear trends between alkali electropositivity and clathrate cage size. The low work function enables alkali clathrates such as K8Si46 to be effective Haber&#8208;Bosch catalyst supports for NH3 synthesis. The catalytic properties of Si, Ge, and Sn&#8208;based clathrates are investigated while supporting Fe and Ru on the surface. The activity largely scales with the work function, and low activation energies below 60&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 are observed due to strong electron donation effects from the support. Ru metal and Sn clathrates seem to be unsuitable for stability issues. Compared to other similar hydride/electride catalysts, the simple structure and composition combined with stability in air/water make a systematic study of these clathrates possible and open the door to other electron&#8208;rich Zintl phases and related intermetallics as low&#8208;work function materials suitable for catalysis. The observed low work function may also have implications for other existing electronic applications.

         <title>Lubricated Surface in a Vertical Double&#8208;Sided Architecture for Radiative Cooling and Atmospheric Water Harvesting (Adv. Mater. 51/2024)</title>

Atmospheric Water Harvesting
Radiative cooling uses material's innate ability to emit mid&#8208;infrared radiation into outer space, cooling surfaces below the dew point and condensing atmospheric water without external energy. A vertical double&#8208;sided architecture with a lubricated surface (LS) coating on the condenser side not only doubles the local cooling power but also eliminates contact&#8208;line pinning, allowing passive, gravity&#8208;driven water collection. More details can be found in article number 2404037 by Dan Daniel, Qiaoqiang Gan, and co&#8208;workers.

High&#8208;Performance Membrane&#8208;Based Gas Separations
In article number 2406076, Ingo Pinnau and co&#8208;workers report membrane materials for a series of plasticization&#8208;resistant, robust, and highly selective hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized triptycene&#8208;based PIMs and dual&#8208;functionalized polyimide blends. The physical crosslinking induced by strong hydrogen bonding in dual&#8208;functionalized blends forms tight polymer networks, leading to extreme size&#8208;sieving and unprecedented gas&#8208;pair selectivity.

Conductive Atomic Force Microscopy
In article number 2405932, Yue Yuan and Mario Lanza clarify what is the effect of relative humidity in conductive atomic force microscopy. They measure over 17,000 different locations on the surface of ten different samples (insulating, semiconducting and conducting) under seven different relative humidity levels. In insulators and thick (&gt;5 nm) semiconductors, the water meniscus at the tip/sample junction increases the currents registered.

         <title>Catalyst Design and Engineering for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Formic Acid Electrosynthesis for a Low&#8208;Carbon Economy</title>

Electrochemical CO2 reduction to formic acid using low&#8208;carbon electricity presents a promising pathway to produce an H2 energy carrier with minimal fugitive hydrogen emissions. However, for this process to become scalable, the development of highly stable and selective catalysts is essential. This article reviews and examines catalyst engineering approaches aimed at enabling economically viable solutions.








Abstract
Formic acid (FA) has emerged as a promising candidate for hydrogen energy storage due to its favorable properties such as low toxicity, low flammability, and high volumetric hydrogen storage capacity under ambient conditions. Recent analyses have suggested that FA produced by electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (eCO2RR) using low&#8208;carbon electricity exhibits lower fugitive hydrogen (H2) emissions and global warming potential (GWP) during the H2 carrier production, storage and transportation processes compared to those of other alternatives like methanol, methylcyclohexane, and ammonia. eCO2RR to FA can enable industrially relevant current densities without the need for high pressures, high temperatures, or auxiliary hydrogen sources. However, the widespread implementation of eCO2RR to FA is hindered by the requirement for highly stable and selective catalysts. Herein, the aim is to explore and evaluate the potential of catalyst engineering in designing stable and selective nanostructured catalysts that can facilitate economically viable production of FA.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Formation of III&#8208;Nitride Nanowires: Past, Present, and Future for Photonic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article explores the development and application of plasma&#8208;assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PA&#8208;MBE) grown group&#8208;III&#8208;nitride nanowires. It covers growth kinetics, characterization, and traditional device applications for light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), laser diodes (LDs), and photodetectors. The article also delves into emerging areas such as heterogeneous integrations, photoelectrochemical photodetectors for optical communications and logic gates, and single&#8208;photon emitters/detectors for quantum application.








Abstract
The realization of semiconductor heterostructures marks a significant advancement beyond silicon technology, driving progress in high&#8208;performance optoelectronics and photonics, including high&#8208;brightness light emitters, optical communication,&#160;and quantum technologies. In less than a decade since 1997, nanowires research has expanded into new application&#8208;driven areas,&#160;highlighting a significant shift toward more challenging and exploratory research avenues. It is therefore essential to reflect&#160;on the past motivations for nanowires development, and explore&#160;the new opportunities it can enable. The advancement of heterogeneous integration using dissimilar substrates, materials, and nanowires&#8208;semiconductor/electrolyte operating platforms is ushering in new research frontiers, including the development of perovskite&#8208;embedded solar cells, photoelectrochemical (PEC) analog and digital photonic systems, such as PEC&#8208;based&#160;photodetectors and logic circuits, as well as quantum elements, such as&#160;single&#8208;photon emitters and detectors. This review offers&#160;rejuvenating perspectives on the progress of these group&#8208;III nitride nanowires,&#160;aiming to highlight the continuity of research toward high impact, use&#8208;inspired research&#160;directions in photonics and optoelectronics.

         <title>Advances in the Catalytic Conversion of Ethanol into Nonoxygenated Added&#8208;Value Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ethanol is mainly derived from biomass, such as starch&#8208;based crops, cellulosic feedstocks, and CO/CO2. Metal oxide or zeolite catalysts can convert ethanol into valuable chemicals, including light olefins, 1,3&#8208;butadiene, aromatics, and gasoline, which are important commodities serving as crucial raw materials for manufacturing various products essential to the modern society, such as plastics, tires, medicines, and perfumes.








Abstract
Given that ethanol can be obtained from abundant biomass resources (e.g., crops, sugarcane, cellulose, and algae), waste, and CO2, its conversion into value&#8208;added chemicals holds promise for the sustainable production of high&#8208;demand chemical commodities. Nonoxygenated chemicals, including light olefins, 1,3&#8208;butadiene, aromatics, and gasoline, are some of the most important of these commodities, substantially contributing to modern lifestyles. Despite the industrial implementation of some ethanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons processes, several fundamental questions and technological challenges remain unaddressed. In addition, the utilization of ethanol as an intermediate provides new opportunities for the direct valorization of CO and CO2. Herein, the recent advances in the design of ethanol conversion catalysts are summarized, providing mechanistic insights into the corresponding reactions and catalyst deactivation, and discussing the related future research directions, including the exploitation of active site proximity to achieve better synergistic effects for reactions involving ethanol.

         <title>Imaging Locally Inhomogeneous Properties of Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the locally inhomogeneous properties of metal halide perovskites. The available microscopic imaging techniques crucial for mapping these inhomogeneities are discussed. The insights into the impact of various inhomogeneities on performance of perovskite solar cells are provided. The technical aspects and experimental considerations of microscopic techniques are introduced, offering a comprehensive guide for researchers in the field.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are a perfect example of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photovoltaic materials whose compositional and structural diversity,&#160;coupled with utilization of low&#8208;temperature processing, can undesirably result in spatially inhomogeneous properties that locally vary within the material. This complexity of MHPs requires sensitive imaging characterization methods at the microscopic level to gauge the impact of such inhomogeneities on device performance and to formulate mitigation strategies. This review consolidates properties of MHPs that are susceptible to local variations and highlights appropriate imaging techniques that can be employed to map them. Inhomogeneities in morphology, emission, electrical response, and chemical composition of MHP thin films are specifically considered, and possible microscopic techniques for their visualization are reviewed. For each type of microscopy, a short discussion about spatial resolution, sample requirements, advantages, and limitations is provided, thus leaving the reader with a guide of available imaging characterization tools to evaluate inhomogeneities of their MHPs.

         <title>Harnessing Extrinsic Dissipation to Enhance the Toughness of Composites and Composite Joints: A State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;Art Review of Recent Advances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights how toughness of laminated structures can be manipulated by engineering heterogeneity and microstructure of interfaces, bond lines and substrates. These techniques favor dissipation&#8208;enhancing mechanisms such as fragmentation, long&#8208;range bridging and can only be described by innovative modeling&#160;approaches.








Abstract
Interfaces play a critical role in modern structures, where integrating multiple materials and components is essential to achieve specific functions. Enhancing the mechanical performance of these interfaces, particularly their resistance to delamination, is essential to enable extremely lightweight designs and improve energy efficiency. Improving toughness (or increasing energy dissipation during delamination) has traditionally involved modifying materials to navigate the well&#8208;known strength&#8208;toughness trade&#8208;off. However, a more effective strategy involves promoting non&#8208;local or extrinsic energy dissipation. This approach encompasses complex degradation phenomena that extend beyond the crack tip, such as long&#8208;range bridging, crack fragmentation, and ligament&#160;formation. This work explores this innovative strategy within the arena of laminated structures, with a particular focus on fiber&#8208;reinforced polymers. This review highlights the substantial potential for improvement by presenting various strategies, from basic principles to proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept applications. This approach represents a significant design direction for integrating materials and structures, especially relevant in the emerging era of additive manufacturing. However, it also comes with new challenges in predictive modeling of such mechanisms at the structural scale, and here the latest development in this direction is highlighted. Through this perspective, greater durability and performance in advanced structural applications can be&#160;achieved.

         <title>Beyond Flexible: Unveiling the Next Era of Flexible Electronic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible electronics are essential in various fields like wearables, healthcare, and environmental sensing due to their flexibility, lightweight construction, and low profile. These systems conform to diverse surfaces, enhancing or replacing bulky instruments in many applications. This study reviews key components of standalone flexible electronics, integration strategies, and recent advancements, emphasizing flexible hybrid and transformational electronics, and concludes with future research directions and challenges.








Abstract
Flexible electronics are integral in numerous domains such as wearables, healthcare, physiological monitoring, human&#8211;machine interface, and environmental sensing, owing to their inherent flexibility, stretchability, lightweight construction, and low profile. These systems seamlessly conform to curvilinear surfaces, including skin, organs, plants, robots, and marine species, facilitating optimal contact. This capability enables flexible electronic systems to enhance or even supplant the utilization of cumbersome instrumentation across a broad range of monitoring and actuation tasks. Consequently, significant progress has been realized in the development of flexible electronic systems. This study begins by examining the key components of standalone flexible electronic systems&#8211;sensors, front&#8208;end circuitry, data management, power management and actuators. The next section explores different integration strategies for flexible electronic systems as well as their recent advancements. Flexible hybrid electronics, which is currently the most widely used strategy, is first reviewed to assess their characteristics and applications. Subsequently, transformational electronics, which achieves compact and high&#8208;density system integration by leveraging heterogeneous integration of bare&#8208;die components, is highlighted as the next era of flexible electronic systems. Finally, the study concludes by suggesting future research directions and outlining critical considerations and challenges for developing and miniaturizing fully integrated standalone flexible electronic systems.

         <title>Solid Additive Engineering for Next&#8208;generation Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 51, December 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides a comprehensive summary of significant breakthroughs and pivotal contributions of emerging solid additives (SAs), focusing on their roles in governing film&#8208;forming dynamics, stabilizing phase separation, and addressing other crucial aspects. These insights contribute to the development of rationale and design rules for SAs enabling highly efficient and stable organic solar cells (OSCs), thereby enhancing their commercial viability.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have emerged as a promising next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technology. In this emerging field, there is a growing trend of employing solid additives (SAs) to fine&#8208;tune the BHJ morphology and unlock the full potential of OSCs. SA engineering offers several significant benefits for commercialization, including the ability to i) control film&#8208;forming kinetics to expedite high&#8208;throughput fabrication, ii) leverage weak noncovalent interactions between SA and BHJ materials to enhance the efficiency and stability of OSCs, and iii) simplify procedures to facilitate cost&#8208;effective production and scaling&#8208;up. These features make SA engineering a key catalyst for accelerating the development of OSCs. Recent breakthroughs have shown that SA engineering can achieve an efficiency of 19.67% in single&#8208;junction OSCs, demonstrating its effectiveness in promoting the commercialization of organic photovoltaic devices. This review provides a comprehensive overview of significant breakthroughs and pivotal contributions of emerging SAs, focusing on their roles in governing film&#8208;forming dynamics, stabilizing phase separation, and addressing other crucial aspects. The rationale and design rules for SAs in highly efficient and stable OSCs are also discussed. Finally, the remaining challenges are summarized, and perspectives on future advances in SA engineering are offered.

         <title>Surface Defects Control Bulk Carrier Densities in Polycrystalline Pb&#8208;Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping, the controlled addition of imperfections or impurities to a material, is crucial for semiconductors. This study shows that for&#160;Halide Perovskites, which have (very) low (intrinsic) defect densities because of&#160;effective self&#8208;healing and defect tolerance,&#160;the title's statement holds in an unprecedented fashion.








Abstract
The (opto)electronic behavior of semiconductors depends on their (quasi&#8208;)free electronic carrier densities. These are regulated by semiconductor doping, i.e., controlled &#8220;electronic contamination&#8221;. For metal halide perovskites (HaPs), the functional materials in several device types, which already challenge some of the understanding of semiconductor properties, this study shows that doping type, density and properties derived from these, are to a first approximation controlled via their surfaces. This effect, relevant to all semiconductors, and already found for some, is very evident for lead (Pb)&#8208;HaPs because of their intrinsically low electrically active bulk and surface defect densities. Volume carrier densities for most polycrystalline Pb&#8208;HaP films (&lt;1&#160;&#181;m grain diameter) are below those resulting from even &lt; 0.1% of surface sites being electrically active defects. This implies and is consistent with interfacial defects controlling HaP devices in multi&#8208;layered structures with most of the action at the two HaP interfaces. Surface and interface passivation effects on bulk electrical properties are relevant to all semiconductors and are crucial for developing those used today. However, because bulk dopant introduction in HaPs at controlled ppm levels for electronic&#8208;relevant carrier densities is so difficult, passivation effects are vastly more critical and dominate, to first approximation, their optoelectronic characteristics in devices.

         <title>Microenvironment Self&#8208;Adaptive Nanomedicine Promotes Spinal Cord Repair by Suppressing Inflammation Cascade and Neural Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microenvironment self&#8208;adaptive nanomedicine (RHNP&#8208;Cur) is capable of consistently crossing the blood spinal cord barrier and selectively targeting inflammatory cells and neural cells based on different stages of spinal cord injury through changes of surface structure and targeted peptide modification, promoting spinal cord repair by suppressing inflammation cascade and neural apoptosis.








Abstract
Despite various biomaterial&#8208;based strategies are tried in spinal cord injury (SCI), developing safe and effective microinvasive pharmacotherapy strategies is still an unmet clinical need. Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanomedicine has emerged as a promising non&#8208;invasion technology, which enhances drug delivery and promotes functional recovery following SCI. Considering the multiple progressive pathological events and the blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) associating SCI, a microenvironment self&#8208;adaptive nanoparticle (custom&#8208;designed with rabies virus glycoprotein 29&#8208;RVG29 and hyaluronic acid&#8208;HA, RHNP) capable of consistently crossing the BSCB and selectively targeting inflammatory cells and neural cells based on different stages of SCI are developed. The data indicated that RHNP can effectively traverse the BSCB through RVG29, and adaptively modulate cellular internalization by selectively exposing either HA or RVG29 through diselenide bonds, depending on pathological reactive oxygen species (ROS) signals. Furthermore, curcumin is loaded into RHNP (RHNP&#8208;Cur) to improve motor function and coordination of hind&#8208;limbs in a traumatic SCI mouse model. This study finds that RHNP&#8208;Cur exhibited inhibitory effects on the inflammatory cascade originating from M1 microglia/macrophages and neurotoxic astrocytes, and protected neural cells from inflammation&#8208;induced apoptosis during nerve regeneration. Collectively, the work provides a microenvironment self&#8208;adaptive nanomedicine which enables efficient microinvasive treatment of SCI.

A novel ether&#8208;modified nonflammable phosphate, DMEP, is designed to enhance the miscibility of high&#8208;concentration phosphate&#8208;based electrolytes with diluent. The DMEP&#8208;based electrolyte features a cation&#8208;anion aggregate&#8208;dominated solvation structure, which promotes the formation of LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphases, enabling long&#8208;term cycling stability in 4.7&#160;V high&#8208;voltage LiNi0.8Co0.10Mn0.10O2 ||Li pouch cells with a low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.33.








Abstract
Phosphate&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCE) feature high flame retardant and satisfactory cathodic stability for lithium metal batteries. However, stable cycling of those electrolytes at ultra&#8208;high upper cut&#8208;off voltages for long&#8208;term stability remains challenging. Herein, an ether&#8208;modified phosphate, diethyl (2&#8208;methoxy ethoxy) methylphosphonate (DMEP), is designed for high&#8208;voltage applications. The ether modification enhances the stability of the Li+&#8208;DMEP&#8208;FSI&#8722; coordination structure, promoting the formation of cation&#8208;anion aggregates (AGG) dominated solvation structure, which favors the generation of LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase layers compared to triethyl phosphate (TEP)&#8208;based LHCE. Consequently, cathode degradation, including transition&#8208;metal dissolution and electrode cracking, is well&#8208;suppressed. The LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)||Li full cells using DMEP&#8208;based LHCEs show more than 90.7% capacity retention at an ultrahigh upper cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.7 V after 100 cycles. Notably, DMEP&#8208;LHCE exhibits enhanced safety than that of TEP&#8208;LHCE, suggesting its versatility and potential for next&#8208;generation lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Nanoengineering&#8208;Enhanced Capillary Cooling Achieves Sustained Thermal Protection for Ultra&#8208;High Heat Flux and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research explores novel advancements in capillary cooling schemes for ultra&#8208;high heat flux and temperature. Micromodel experiment helps provide visualized evidence for evaporation&#8208;driven mechanisms behind capillary flow phenomenon in porous media. Nanoengineering significantly improves thermal protection capacity of capillary cooling. Results show that nanoengineering&#8208;enhanced capillary cooling holds significant potential as a reliable and sustained thermal protection scheme in the future.








Abstract
Extreme thermal conditions with heat flux densities exceeding 1 MW m&#8722;2 or temperatures reaching up to 1000 &#176;C are prevalent in various situations. However, thermal protection ability depends on specialized materials or is currently limited with existing cooling schemes. Herein, an innovative cooling scheme that relies on evaporation&#8208;driven capillary flow, enhanced by nanoengineering&#8208;designed porous structures with common materials, is proposed. Experimentally&#8208;obtained capillary flow cooling curve identifies critical heat flux corresponding to evaporation&#8208;driven flow stage, where coolants cool the surface and subsequent vapor impedes heat transfer from thermal boundaries. Nanoengineering provides opportunities for enhanced capillary flow, which proves to endow bronze, TC4 (titanium alloy, Ti&#8208;6Al&#8208;4V), and Al2O3 with thermal protection ability 50&#8211;180% higher than that without nanoengineering&#8208;designed. The authors&#8217; scheme achieves critical heat flux up to 2.0&#8211;3.1 MW m&#8722;2 and performs thermal dissipation capacity almost twice higher than inherent latent heat of coolant. Further, in a supersonic wind tunnel with total temperature reaching up to 1792 K, this scheme effectively protects surfaces by cooling them to surface temperatures below 500 K. Nanoengineering&#8208;enhanced capillary cooling gives access to the application of common materials for high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;heat&#8208;flux environments and paves the way for development of lightweight, long&#8208;lasting, and large&#8208;scale solutions for thermal protection.

         <title>Nucleus&#8208;Targeting Photosensitizers Enhance Neutrophil Extracellular Traps for Efficient Eradication of Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleus&#8208;targeting photosensitizer, NCP, with strong ROS generation and DNA&#8208;binding capabilities has been developed for efficient neutrophil&#8208;mediated antibacterial therapy. NCP utilize the intrinsic NET&#8208;associated antibacterial mechanism to achieve precise eradication of bacteria, providing a novel strategy to reinforce host immune defense against multi&#8208;resistant bacterial wound infections.








Abstract
Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are web&#8208;like complexes of DNA and proteins that are extruded by activated neutrophils and play critical roles as major components of the innate immune response against pathogen invasion. However, some microbes have developed strategies to evade NET attacks, leading to impaired immune defenses and persistent infections. In this study, an engineered neutrophil strategy for enhancing the antibacterial activity of NETs is developed. A nucleus&#8208;targeting photosensitizer (NCP) with strong reactive oxygen species production and a strong DNA&#8208;binding capacity is synthesized. NCP&#8208;loaded neutrophils are subsequently constructed via direct incubation of NCP with neutrophils, and the NCP is closely inserted into the nucleus DNA. Upon activation by bacteria&#8208;related toxins, NCP&#8208;coupled NETs can be released rapidly, actively trapping bacteria and providing a high local concentration of NCP around them. Both in vitro and in vivo results revealed that NCP&#8208;coupled NETs can effectively eradicate various multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria and biofilms through photodynamic therapy, overcome bacterial immune evasion, and promote tissue recovery from severe wound infections. This design can significantly strengthen NET function, providing a non&#8208;antibiotic alternative platform for treating bacterial infectious diseases.

This paper proposes an optical synapse based on van der Waals heterojunction. Based on this device, an optical reservoir neural network and a visible light communication system were developed, which successfully imitated the signal preprocessing and data transmission process of the human visual system for color images. This provides new ideas for the development of intelligent imaging systems.








Abstract
The rapid development of visual neuromorphic hardware can be attributed to their ability to capture, store and process optical signals from the environment. The main limitation of existing visual neuromorphic hardware is that the realization of complex functions is premised on the increase of manufacturing cost, hardware volume and energy consumption. In this study, we demonstrated an optical synaptic device based on a three&#8208;terminal van der Waals (vdW) heterojunction that can realize the sensing functions of light wavelength and intensity as well as short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term synaptic plasticity. In the image recognition task, we constructed an optical reservoir neural network (ORNN) and a visible light communication system (VLC) composed of this optical synaptic device. The ORNN has a recognition rate of up to 84.9% for 50 000 color images in 10 categories in the CIFAR&#8208;10 color image dataset, and the VLC system can achieve high&#8208;speed transmission with an ultra&#8208;low power consumption of only 0.4 nW. This work shows that through reasonable design, vdW heterojunction structures have great application potential in low&#8208;power multifunctional fusion application tasks such as visual bionics.

         <title>Sensitive Self&#8208;Driven Single&#8208;Component Organic Photodetector Based on Vapor&#8208;Deposited Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully thermally evaporated single&#8208;component organic photodetector is demonstrated with high photoresponsivity at zero bias, resulting in a specific detectivity of 1 &#183; 1013&#160;Jones based on noise measurements. Ultrafast charge generation within one&#160;picosecond is observed in the neat photoactive material, which is attributed to the strong electronic coupling of the molecular exciton and charge&#8208;transfer states in the small molecule.








Abstract
Typically, organic solar cells (OSCs) and photodetectors (OPDs) comprise an electron donating and accepting material to facilitate efficient charge carrier generation. This approach has proven successful in achieving high&#8208;performance devices but has several drawbacks for upscaling and stability. This study presents a fully vacuum&#8208;deposited single&#8208;component OPD, employing the neat oligothiophene derivative DCV2&#8208;5T in the photoactive layer. Free charge carriers are generated with an internal quantum efficiency of 20 % at zero bias. By optimizing the device structure, a very low dark current of 3.4 &#183; 10&#8722;11&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.1&#160;V is achieved, comparable to the dark current of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art bulk heterojunction OPDs. This optimization results in specific detectivities of 1&#183; 1013&#160;Jones (based on noise measurements), accompanied by a fast photoresponse (f&#8208;3dB = 200&#160;kHz) and a broad linear dynamic range (&gt;&#160;150&#160;dB). Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy unveils that charge carriers are already formed at very short time scales (&lt;&#160;1&#160;ps). The surprisingly efficient bulk charge generation mechanism is attributed to a strong electronic coupling of the molecular exciton and charge transfer states.

&lt;p&gt;A fully thermally evaporated single-component organic photodetector is demonstrated with high photoresponsivity at zero bias, resulting in a specific detectivity of 1 &#183; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;Jones based on noise measurements. Ultrafast charge generation within one&#160;picosecond is observed in the neat photoactive material, which is attributed to the strong electronic coupling of the molecular exciton and charge-transfer states in the small molecule.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, organic solar cells (OSCs) and photodetectors (OPDs) comprise an electron donating and accepting material to facilitate efficient charge carrier generation. This approach has proven successful in achieving high-performance devices but has several drawbacks for upscaling and stability. This study presents a fully vacuum-deposited single-component OPD, employing the neat oligothiophene derivative DCV2-5T in the photoactive layer. Free charge carriers are generated with an internal quantum efficiency of 20 % at zero bias. By optimizing the device structure, a very low dark current of 3.4 &#183; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;11&#160;&lt;/sup&gt;A&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;0.1&#160;V is achieved, comparable to the dark current of state-of-the-art bulk heterojunction OPDs. This optimization results in specific detectivities of 1&#183; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&#160;&lt;/sup&gt;Jones (based on noise measurements), accompanied by a fast photoresponse (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;-3dB&lt;/sub&gt; = 200&#160;kHz) and a broad linear dynamic range (&amp;gt;&#160;150&#160;dB). Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy unveils that charge carriers are already formed at very short time scales (&amp;lt;&#160;1&#160;ps). The surprisingly efficient bulk charge generation mechanism is attributed to a strong electronic coupling of the molecular exciton and charge transfer states. This work demonstrates the very high performance of single-component OPDs and proves that this novel device design is a successful strategy for highly efficient, morphological stable and easily manufacturable devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchical Nanostructures as Acoustically Manipulatable Multifunctional Agents in Dynamic Fluid Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flower&#8208;like hierarchical nanostructure microparticles can be trapped by focused ultrasound and manipulated within high&#8208;velocity dynamic fluid flow. The wide range of design versatility, substantial surface area, and biocompatibility enable such microparticles to function as acoustically manipulatable medical imaging contrast agents and microrobots.








Abstract
Acoustic waves provide a biocompatible and deep&#8208;tissue&#8208;penetrating tool suitable for contactless manipulation in in vivo environments. Despite the prevalence of dynamic fluids within the body, previous studies have primarily focused on static fluids, and manipulatable agents in dynamic fluids are limited to gaseous core&#8208;shell particles. However, these gas&#8208;filled particles face challenges in fast&#8208;flow manipulation, complex setups, design versatility, and practical medical imaging, underscoring the need for effective alternatives. In this study, flower&#8208;like hierarchical nanostructures (HNS) into microparticles (MPs) are incorporated, and demonstrated that various materials fabricated as HNS&#8208;MPs exhibit effective and reproducible acoustic trapping within high&#8208;velocity fluid flows. Through simulations, it is validated that the HNS&#8208;MPs are drawn to the focal point by acoustic streaming and form a trap through secondary acoustic streaming at the tips of the nanosheets comprising the HNS&#8208;MPs. Furthermore, the wide range of materials and modification options for HNS, combined with their high surface area and biocompatibility, enable them to serve as acoustically manipulatable multimodal imaging contrast agents and microrobots. They can perform intravascular multi&#8208;trap maneuvering with real&#8208;time imaging, purification of wastewater flow, and highly&#8208;loaded drug delivery. Given the diverse HNS materials developed to date, this study extends their applications to acoustofluidic and biomedical fields.

         <title>Engineering Radiocatalytic Nanoliposomes with Hydrophobic Gold Nanoclusters for Radiotherapy Enhancement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoliposomes containing hydrophobic gold nanoclusters are engineered, characterized, and evaluated for their radiocatalytic properties for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. These nanoliposomes exhibit promising radiotherapy&#8208;enhancing properties, potential for radiotherapy&#8208;controlled drug delivery, and improved chemoradiotherapy outcomes on 3D pancreatic microtumors. The nanoliposomes exhibit excellent tumor accumulation and also identify further innovations to pave the way toward more effective chemoradiotherapy strategies.








Abstract
Chemoradiation therapy is on the forefront of pancreatic cancer care, and there is a continued effort to improve its safety and efficacy. Liposomes are widely used to improve chemotherapy safety, and may accurately deliver high&#8208;Z element&#8208; radiocatalytic nanomaterials to cancer tissues. In this study, the interaction between X&#8208;rays and long&#8208;circulating nanoliposome formulations loaded with gold nanoclusters is explored in the context of oxaliplatin chemotherapy for desmoplastic pancreatic cancer. Hydrophobic gold nanoclusters stabilized with dodecanethiol (AuDDT) are efficiently incorporated in nanoliposomal bilayers. AuDDT&#8208;nanoliposomes significantly augmented radiation&#8208;induced &#8226;OH production, which is most effective with monochromatic X&#8208;rays at energies that exceed the K&#8208;shell electron binding energy of Au (81.7&#160;keV). Cargo release assays reveal that AuDDT&#8208;nanoliposomes can permeabilize lipid bilayers in an X&#8208;ray dose&#8208; and formulation&#8208;dependent manner. The radiocatalytic effect of AuDDT&#8208;nanoliposomes significantly augments radiotherapy and oxaliplatin&#8208;chemoradiotherapy outcomes in 3D pancreatic microtumors. The PEGylated AuDDT&#8208;nanoliposomes display high tumor accumulation in an orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer, showing promise for nanoliposomes as carriers for radiocatalytic nanomaterials. Altogether, compelling proof for chemo&#8208;radiation dose&#8208;enhancement using AuDDT&#8208;nanoliposomes is presented. Further improving the nanoliposomal loading of high&#8208;Z elements will advance the safety, efficacy, and translatability of such chemoradiation dose&#8208;enhancement approaches.

         <title>Viscoelastic High&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Hyaluronic Acid Hydrogels Support Rapid Glioblastoma Cell Invasion with Leader&#8211;Follower Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glioblastoma spheroids invade faster in stress&#8208;relaxing, high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (HMW) hyaluronic acid hydrogels than in more elastic&#8208;like, low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight counterparts. The long HMW chains create entanglement&#8208;based crosslinks capable of viscous dissipation that cells rearrange to facilitate invasion. While invading, cells leave a trail of hyaluronidase&#8208;2 (HYAL2) in their wake to prime a path for the advancement of follower cells and thus rapid invasion.








Abstract
Hyaluronic acid (HA), the primary component of brain extracellular matrix, is increasingly used to model neuropathological processes, including glioblastoma (GBM) tumor invasion. While elastic hydrogels based on crosslinked low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (LMW) HA are widely exploited for this purpose and have proven valuable for discovery and screening, brain tissue is both viscoelastic and rich in high&#8208;MW (HMW) HA, and it remains unclear how these differences influence invasion. To address this question, hydrogels comprised of either HMW (1.5 MDa) or LMW (60 kDa) HA are introduced, characterized, and applied in GBM invasion studies. Unlike LMW HA hydrogels, HMW HA hydrogels relax stresses quickly, to a similar extent as brain tissue, and to a greater extent than many conventional HA&#8208;based scaffolds. GBM cells implanted within HMW HA hydrogels invade much more rapidly than in their LMW HA counterparts and exhibit distinct leader&#8211;follower dynamics. Leader cells adopt dendritic morphologies similar to invasive GBM cells observed in vivo. Transcriptomic, pharmacologic, and imaging studies suggest that leader cells exploit hyaluronidase, an enzyme strongly enriched in human GBMs, to prime a path for followers. This study offers new insight into how HA viscoelastic properties drive invasion and argues for the use of highly stress&#8208;relaxing materials to model GBM.

         <title>Using a Supramolecular Monomer Formulation Approach to Engineer Modular, Dynamic Microgels, and Composite Macrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microgels with engineerable properties are created using supramolecular monomers. The inherent modularity offers versatility, allowing inclusion of functionalities, e.g. dyes and cell adhesive additives, providing control over microgel composition. Integrated into robust and dynamic macrogels, microgels act as modular micro&#8208;building blocks, introducing multi&#8208;compartmentalization and reinforcing mechanical properties. This modular control spans across the nano, micro, and macro length scale.








Abstract
Microgels show advantages over bulk hydrogels due to convenient control over microgel size and composition, and the ability to use microgels to modularly construct larger hierarchical scaffold hydrogel materials. Here, supramolecular chemistry is used to formulate supramolecular polymer, dynamic microgels solely held together by non&#8208;covalent interactions. Four&#8208;fold hydrogen bonding ureido&#8208;pyrimidinone (UPy) monomers with different functionalities are applied to precisely tune microgel properties in a modular way, via variations in monomer concentration, bifunctional crosslinker ratio, and the incorporation of supramolecular dyes and peptides. Functionalization with a bioactive supramolecular cell&#8208;adhesive peptide induced selectivity of cells toward the bioactive microgels over non&#8208;active, non&#8208;functionalized versions. Importantly, the supramolecular microgels can also be applied as microscale building blocks into supramolecular bulk macrogels with tunable dynamic behavior: a robust and weak macrogel, where the micro&#8208; and macrogels are composed of similar molecular building blocks. In a robust macrogel, microgels act as modular micro&#8208;building blocks, introducing multi&#8208;compartmentalization, while in a weak macrogel, microgels reinforce and enhance mechanical properties. This work demonstrates the potential to modularly engineer higher&#8208;length&#8208;scale structures using small molecule supramolecular monomers, wherein microgels serve as versatile and modular micro&#8208;building units.

&lt;p&gt;Microgels with engineerable properties are created using supramolecular monomers. The inherent modularity offers versatility, allowing inclusion of functionalities, e.g. dyes and cell adhesive additives, providing control over microgel composition. Integrated into robust and dynamic macrogels, microgels act as modular micro-building blocks, introducing multi-compartmentalization and reinforcing mechanical properties. This modular control spans across the nano, micro, and macro length scale.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microgels show advantages over bulk hydrogels due to convenient control over microgel size and composition, and the ability to use microgels to modularly construct larger hierarchical scaffold hydrogel materials. Here, supramolecular chemistry is used to formulate supramolecular polymer, dynamic microgels solely held together by non-covalent interactions. Four-fold hydrogen bonding ureido-pyrimidinone (UPy) monomers with different functionalities are applied to precisely tune microgel properties in a modular way, via variations in monomer concentration, bifunctional crosslinker ratio, and the incorporation of supramolecular dyes and peptides. Functionalization with a bioactive supramolecular cell-adhesive peptide induced selectivity of cells toward the bioactive microgels over non-active, non-functionalized versions. Importantly, the supramolecular microgels can also be applied as microscale building blocks into supramolecular bulk macrogels with tunable dynamic behavior: a robust and weak macrogel, where the micro- and macrogels are composed of similar molecular building blocks. In a robust macrogel, microgels act as modular micro-building blocks, introducing multi-compartmentalization, while in a weak macrogel, microgels reinforce and enhance mechanical properties. This work demonstrates the potential to modularly engineer higher-length-scale structures using small molecule supramolecular monomers, wherein microgels serve as versatile and modular micro-building units.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Higher&#8208;Order Topological Confinement via Acoustic Non&#8208;Hermitian Textures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors develop a non&#8208;Hermitian second&#8208;order topological insulator by incorporating electro&#8208;thermoacoustic gain and loss in a cavity&#8208;based sonic lattice. Controlled via electrically biased carbon nanotube films, they engineer unconventional interface and corner&#8208;confining topologies through precise manipulation of gain and loss textures. This work may open new avenues for studying non&#8208;Hermitian topological physics in classical wave systems and designing versatile functional devices.









Abstract
Higher&#8208;order topological insulators are a newly unveiled category of topological materials, distinguished by their exceptional characteristics absent in conventional topological insulators, e.g., 1D hinge states, or zero&#8208;dimensional corner states, for instance. Adding attenuating or amplifying components manifest even richer and more intricate non&#8208;Hermitian topological properties. While losses, for the most part, come for free, decorating topological systems with the gain counterpart poses significant challenges. Here, a non&#8208;Hermitian second&#8208;order topological insulator (SOTI) is constructed for a sonic demonstration, by bestowing a cavity&#8208;based lattice both with electro&#8208;thermoacoustic gain and loss. The inner cavity walls are decorated with electrically biased carbon nanotube films to be able to manipulate spatially and in strength, a non&#8208;Hermitian response at will. These measurements demonstrate that this flexibility allows us to design highly unconventional interface and corner confining topologies by decisively engineering gain and loss textures within the unit cell. It is foreseen that the advances may enable new avenues for energy harvesting and fundamental understanding in condensed matter and classical topological&#160;physics.

         <title>Programmable Robotic Shape Shifting and Color Morphing Dynamics Through Magneto&#8208;Mechano&#8208;Chromic Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a design strategy for smart soft robots, which borrows the idea of how chameleons transform their body color during locomotion in the wild. The proposed soft magneto&#8208;mechano&#8208;chromic (SoMMeC) robots redefine robotic functionality through fast, dynamic, and durable appearance modulation, making robotic systems more versatile, adaptive, and suitable for unexplored integrative functions.








Abstract
Recreating natural organisms&#8217; dynamic shape&#8208;morphing and adaptive color&#8208;changing capabilities in a compact structure poses significant challenges but unlocks unprecedented hybridized robotic&#8208;visual applications. Overcoming programmability and predictability obstacles is key to achieving real&#8208;time, responsive changes in appearance and functionality, enhancing robot&#8208;environment&#8208;user interactions in ways previously unattainable. Herein, a Soft Magneto&#8208;Mechano&#8208;Chromic (SoMMeC) structure comprising a magnetic actuating and a synthetic photonic film, mirroring the intricate color&#8208;tuning mechanism of chameleons is devised. A model combining numerical simulation and a strain&#8208;dependent color evolution map enables precise predictions and controllable shape&#8208;color alterations across various geometrical and magnetization profiles. The SoMMeC exhibits rapid (0.1s), broad (full&#8208;visible spectrum), tether&#8208;free (remote magnetic manipulation), and programmable (model&#8208;guided control) color transformations, surpassing traditional limitations with its real&#8208;time response, broad and omnidirectional coloration for enhanced visibility, and robustness against external disturbances. The SoMMeC translates into dynamic advertising iridescence, adaptive camouflage, self&#8208;sensing, and multi&#8208;level encryption, and transcends traditional robotics by seamlessly blending dynamic movement with nuanced visual changes. It opens up a spectrum of applications that redefine robotic functionality through dynamic appearance modulation, making robotic systems more versatile, adaptive, and suitable for unexplored integrative functions.

         <title>Synthesis of SrZnOSe Crystals with Low Phonon Energy for Enhancing Near&#8208;Infrared Mechanoluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of lanthanide&#8208;doped SrZnOSe crystals has been developed for the self&#8208;sustained generation of near&#8208;infrared light under mechanical excitation. Due to the low phonon energy of the selenide hosts, the SrZnOSe crystals can generate bright near&#8208;infrared emission by external forces for transmitting encrypted optical signals through tissues (up to 8&#160;mm thick).








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light is promising for bioimaging and information technology due to its high penetration ability and resistance to interference with environmental radiation. Here, a new class of lanthanide&#8208;doped SrZnOSe crystals are developed for the self&#8208;sustainable generation of NIR emissions under mechanical excitation. It is shown that the SrZnOSe crystals render &#8776;5&#8208;fold stronger NIR emissions than the well&#8208;established CaZnOS due to the low phonon energies of the selenide host, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. The potential utility of the crystals is demonstrated by integration with a mouthguard, which can generate bright NIR emissions by bite force to transmit encrypted optical signals through thick tissues (up to 8&#160;mm) in ambient environments. The findings provide a powerful addition to the toolbox of self&#8208;recovery mechanoluminescent materials and open new possibilities for applied research.

         <title>Programmable Artificial Skins Accomplish Antiscar Healing with Multiple Appendage Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel regeneration&#8208;directing artificial skin (RDAS) system is introduced, which is constructed from DNA supramolecular hydrogels. This multi&#8208;layered RDAS effectively mimics natural skin matrices with high fidelity, thereby creating a supportive environment conducive to wound healing. It also precisely modulates the regenerative activities of repair cells throughout the healing process. Ultimately, the RDAS facilitates rapid&#160;scarless healing and promotes the in situ regeneration of multiple functional skin appendages in damaged skin.








Abstract
Functional appendage regeneration is essential for skin rehabilitation, but it has always failed by current existing healing approaches, owing to their inefficacy in preventing disfiguring scars. In this study, a novel regeneration&#8208;directing artificial skin (RDAS) system is presented, which is based on the rational design of multi&#8208;layered hydrogels that closely mimic natural skin matrices. By leveraging the programmability and architectural rigidity of DNA components, without the need for exogenous cell transplantation, such RDAS effectively minimizes tissue fibrosis by accurately guiding the regenerative process in wound fibroblasts, enabling rapid scarless wound repair, restoration of dermal function, and successful in situ regeneration of multiple appendages, such as hair follicles (HFs), sebaceous glands (SGs), and sweat glands (SwGs). Therefore, the RDAS offers a cell&#8208;free antiscarring therapeutic strategy for regenerative wound healing, resulting in improved outcomes. This innovative approach holds great potential for future clinical applications and burn rehabilitation.

This study explores composition&#8208;structure&#8208;performance relationships in high&#8208;entropy La0.8Sr0.2MnxCoyFezO3&#177;&#120749; perovskite oxides for oxygen electrodes in Solid Oxide Cells. Using six high&#8208;throughput experimental techniques and machine learning, Fe&#8208;rich oxides are identified as optimal. The model yields an unambiguous statistical correlation between the distortion of the oxygen sublattice and the highest electrochemical performances and oxygen kinetics.








Abstract
Perovskite oxides form a large family of materials with applications across various fields, owing to their structural and chemical flexibility. Efficient exploration of this extensive compositional space is now achievable through automated high&#8208;throughput experimentation combined with machine learning. In this study, we investigate the composition&#8211;structure&#8211;performance relationships of high&#8208;entropy La0.8Sr0.2MnxCoyFezO3&#177;&#120749; perovskite oxides (0 &lt; x, y, z &lt;1; x+y+z&#8776;1) for application as oxygen electrodes in Solid Oxide Cells. Following the deposition of a continuous compositional map using thin&#8208;film combinatorial pulsed laser deposition, compositional, structural, and performance properties are characterized using six different techniques with mapping capabilities. Random forests effectively model electrochemical performance, consistently identifying Fe&#8208;rich oxides as optimal compounds with the lowest area&#8208;specific resistance values for oxygen electrodes at 700 &#176;C. Additionally, the models identify a statistical correlation between oxygen sublattice distortion&#8212;derived from spectral analysis of Raman&#8208;active modes&#8212;and enhanced performance.

         <title>Voxel Interface Control in Multimaterial Extrusion 3D Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfaces are vital in natural and synthetic systems, enhancing performance and functionality, but are difficult to control in manufacturing. Voxel&#8208;Interface 3D Printing (VI3DP) is introduced, enabling precise control of voxel&#8208;to&#8208;voxel interfaces in extrusion 3D&#8208;printed objects. With interface thicknesses significantly smaller than voxel size, VI3DP unlocks applications in data encoding, mechanisms, bio&#8208;inspired composites, and capacitive touch sensors, among others.








Abstract
Interfaces are crucial in natural and engineered systems, dictating essential biological, ecological, and technological properties that augment performance, functionality, and user experience. Yet, achieving precise interfacial control poses significant challenges in both conventional and additive manufacturing, where scalability constraints impede the controlled deposition of quasi&#8208;2D layers within 3D objects. This paper introduces Voxel&#8208;Interface 3D Printing (VI3DP), which enables comprehensive control over extruded voxel interfaces irrespective of the printhead diameter that conventionally dictates feature size. Various optical, mechanical, and electrical functionalizations, attaining interface thicknesses up to three orders of magnitude smaller than the voxel size are reported. Notable applications include encoding data in soft matter through fluorescent interfaces, creating tight fits and movable mechanisms through non&#8208;adhesive interfaces, fabricating bio&#8208;inspired composites with tailored failure modes, and developing a single filament capacitive touch sensor. VI3DP opens new avenues for enhanced functionality and efficiency across multiple fields, including biomedical technology, electronics, optics, and&#160;nanotechnology.

         <title>Modulating Fibrotic Mechanical Microenvironment for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is exacerbated by injurious mechanical forces that destabilize the pulmonary mechanical microenvironment homeostasis. The ZDFPR NPs effectively regulate this disordered mechanical microenvironment by remodeling alveolar epithelia to alleviate mechanical tension in AEC IIs, and disrupting malignant interactions between myofibroblast contractility and ECM stiffness during mechanotransduction, thereby improving the therapeutic effects for IPF.








Abstract
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is exacerbated by injurious mechanical forces that destabilize the pulmonary mechanical microenvironment homeostasis, leading to alveolar dysfunction and exacerbating disease severity. However, given the inherent mechanosensitivity of fibrotic lungs, where type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC IIs) are subjected to persistent stretching and overactivated myofibroblasts experience malignant interactions during mechanotransduction, it becomes imperative to develop effective strategies to modulate the pulmonary mechanical microenvironment. Herein, cyclo (RGDfC) peptide&#8208;decorated zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 nanoparticles (named ZDFPR NPs) are constructed to target and repair the aberrant mechanical force levels in pathological lungs. Specifically, reduces mechanical tension in AEC IIs by pH&#8208;responsive ZDFPR NPs that release zinc ions and 7, 8&#8208;dihydroxyflavone to promote alveolar repair and differentiation. Meanwhile, malignant interactions between myofibroblast contractility and extracellular matrix stiffness during mechanotransduction are disrupted by the fasudil inhibition ROCK signaling pathway. The results show that ZDFPR NPs successfully restored pulmonary mechanical homeostasis and terminated the fibrosis process in bleomycin&#8208;induced fibrotic mice. This study not only presents a promising strategy for modulating pulmonary mechanical microenvironment but also pioneers a novel avenue for IPF treatment.

         <title>Regulation of Wide Bandgap Perovskite by Rubidium Thiocyanate for Efficient Silicon/Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rubidium thiocyanate as additive is incorporated in 1.66 eV bandgap perovskites to regulate film crystallization, significantly reduced device hysteresis, non&#8208;radiative recombination, ion&#8208;migration, and phase segregation. The perovskite solar cell achieved state&#8208;of&#8208;art 1.3 V VOC and 24.3% efficiency, with T80 lifetime of 944&#160;h under 1&#160;sun/65&#176;C. After integrating with flat silicon subcell, 30% efficiency is obtained for silicon/perovskite tandem device.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;quality wide bandgap (WBG) perovskites with &#8776;1.7&#160;eV bandgap (Eg) is critical to couple with silicon and create efficient silicon/perovskite tandem devices. The sufferings of large open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) loss and unstable power output under operation continuously highlight the criticality to fully develop high&#8208;quality WBG perovskite films. In this study, rubidium and thiocyanate as additive regulators in WBG perovskites are incorporated, significantly reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination, ion&#8208;migration, and phase segregation. The optimized 1.66 eV Eg perovskite solar cells achieved state&#8208;of&#8208;art 1.3&#160;V VOC (0.36&#160;V deficit), and delivered a stabilized power conversion efficiency of 24.3%, along with good device stability (20% degradation (T80) after over 994&#160;h of operation under 1 sun at &#8776;65&#176;C). When integrated with a flat front side silicon cell, silicon/perovskite two&#8208;terminal tandem device (30% efficient) is obtained with a 1.97&#160;V VOC, and T90 operational lifetime of more than 600&#160;h at room temperature.

         <title>High Performance and Colorful Polymer Thermoelectrics with Imprinted Porous Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer films featuring highly ordered periodic porous structures not only demonstrate exceptional thermoelectric figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit, reaching up to 0.52, but also exhibit captivating structural colors and remarkable stretchability.








Abstract
The rapid development of the Internet of Things and wearable electronics has generated growing interest in creating high&#8208;performance and visually striking polymer thermoelectric (TE) devices. However, existing polymer TE materials have yet to fully meet these diverse demands. In this study, imprinted porous polymer films are introduced that exhibit both high TE performance and a spectrum of structural colors. The porous architecture not only preserves excellent charge transport properties but also significantly enhances phonon&#8208;like scattering, resulting in a more than 50% reduction in thermal conductivity for the PDPPSe&#8208;12 film. This leads to a 170% increase in the figure of merit (ZT), achieving a peak value of 0.52 at 363&#160;K. Furthermore, the highly ordered porous structure imparts the PDPPSe&#8208;12 films with both a wide range of structural colors and remarkable stretchability, making them ideal for wearable TE generators.

&lt;p&gt;Polymer films featuring highly ordered periodic porous structures not only demonstrate exceptional thermoelectric figure-of-merit, reaching up to 0.52, but also exhibit captivating structural colors and remarkable stretchability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid development of the Internet of Things and wearable electronics has generated growing interest in creating high-performance and visually striking polymer thermoelectric (TE) devices. However, existing polymer TE materials have yet to fully meet these diverse demands. In this study, imprinted porous polymer films are introduced that exhibit both high TE performance and a spectrum of structural colors. The porous architecture not only preserves excellent charge transport properties but also significantly enhances phonon-like scattering, resulting in a more than 50% reduction in thermal conductivity for the PDPPSe-12 film. This leads to a 170% increase in the figure of merit (ZT), achieving a peak value of 0.52 at 363&#160;K. Furthermore, the highly ordered porous structure imparts the PDPPSe-12 films with both a wide range of structural colors and remarkable stretchability, making them ideal for wearable TE generators. This approach is widely applicable to various polymeric systems, offering a novel strategy for advancing state-of-the-art plastic TE materials through microstructural engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast Charge and Exciton Diffusion in Monolayer Films of 9&#8208;Armchair Graphene Nanoribbons</title>

         <dc:description>Schematic representation of 9&#8208;armchair graphene nanoribbons subjected to a pump pulse, which generates charge carriers. The spatial and temporal dynamics of these carriers are investigated using a probe pulse with variable time delay &#916;t and a controllable spatial offset.








Abstract
Determining the electronic transport properties of graphene nanoribbons is crucial for assessing their suitability for applications. So far, this has been highly challenging both through experimental and theoretical approaches. This is particularly the case for graphene nanoribbons that are prepared by chemical vapor deposition, which is a scalable and industry&#8208;compatible bottom&#8208;up growth method that results in closely packed arrays of ribbons with relatively short lengths of a few tens of nanometers. In this study, the experimental technique of spatiotemporal microscopy is applied to study monolayer films of 9&#8208;armchair graphene nanoribbons prepared using this growth method, and combined with linear&#8208;scaling quantum transport calculations of arrays of thousands of nanoribbons. Both approaches directly resolve electronic spreading in space and time through diffusion and give an initial diffusivity approaching 200 cm2 s&#8722;1 during the first picosecond after photoexcitation. This corresponds to a mobility up to 550 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. The quasi&#8208;free carriers then form excitons, which spread with a diffusivity of tens of cm2 s&#8722;1. The results indicate that this relatively large charge carrier mobility is the result of electronic transport not being hindered by defects nor inter&#8208;ribbon hopping. This confirms their suitability for applications that require efficient electronic&#160;transport.

         <title>4.6&#160;V Moisture&#8208;Tolerant Electrolytes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique salt lithium cyano(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiCTFSI) provides an opportunity to develop advanced electrolytes with distinctive physical and chemical properties, outperforming the conventional LiPF6 and lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) salts under various operating conditions, paving the way for extreme batteries and offering a promising direction for future high&#8208;energy, cost&#8208;effective lithium&#8208;ion batteries.









Abstract
Commercial LiPF6&#8208;based electrolytes face limitations in oxidation stability (4.2 V) and water tolerance (10 ppm). While replacing LiPF6 with lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) improves water tolerance, it induces Al current collector corrosion above 3.7 V vs. Li/Li+. To address this, lithium cyano(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiCTFSI) is proposed here as a non&#8208;corrosive, moisture&#8208;tolerant alternative. The 2.0 M LiCTFSI/propylene carbonate (PC)&#8208;fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) (7:3 by volume) electrolyte enables LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathodes to reach 210 mAh g&#8722;1 (2.8&#8208;4.6 V) with a cycle life of 500. Full cells with NCM811||graphite (2.0 mAh cm&#8722;2) show 77.8% capacity retention after 500 cycles. Even with 2000 ppm moisture in the electrolyte, full cells maintain high cycling stability, reducing the need for costly dry rooms. The electrolyte&#8217;s low freezing point and high thermal stability enable the operation from &#8208;20 &#176;C to 60 &#176;C, delivering 168 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8208;20 &#176;C and retaining 94% capacity after 100 cycles at 60 &#176;C. In contrast, cells with commercial LiPF6 electrolyte deliver 71 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8208;20&#176;C and retain 52.7% after 100 cycles at 60 &#176;C. This novel salt offers a cost&#8208;effective solution for developing robust, high&#8208;performance batteries suitable for extreme conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrahigh Elastic Energy Storage in Nanocrystalline Alloys with Martensite Nanodomains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;level nanostructure featuring martensite nanodomains embedded in a ferroelastic nanocrystalline matrix is utilized for high&#8208;performance elastic energy storage. The synergy of grain boundary strengthening and nucleation&#8208;free reversible transformation enables these alloys to achieve an ultrahigh elastic energy density (&gt;40 MJ m&#8722;3) with ultrahigh efficiency (&gt;93%). Moreover, these properties are maintained at the microscale, demonstrating exceptional durability with over two million cycles.








Abstract
Elastic materials that store and release elastic energy play pivotal roles in both macro and micro mechanical systems. Uniting high elastic energy density and efficiency is crucial for emerging technologies such as artificial muscles, hopping robots, and unmanned aerial vehicle catapults, yet it remains a significant challenge. Here, a nanocrystalline structure embedded with elliptical martensite nanodomains in ferroelastic alloys was&#160;utilized to enable high yield strength, large recoverable strain, and low energy dissipation simultaneously. As a result, the designed Ti&#8211;Ni&#8211;V alloys demonstrate ultrahigh energy density (&gt;40 MJ m&#8722;3) with ultrahigh efficiency (&gt;93%) and exceptional durability. This concept, which combines nano&#8208;sized embryos to minimize energy dissipation of psuedo&#8208;elasticity and employs a fine&#8208;grained structure to enhance yield strength, can be applied to other ferroelastic materials. Furthermore, it holds promise for the development of phase transformation&#8208;involved functionalities such as high&#8208;performance dielectric energy storage, ultralow&#8208;hysteresis magnetostrain, and high&#8208;efficiency solid&#8208;state caloric&#160;cooling.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency, Prevascularization&#8208;Free Macroencapsulation System for Subcutaneous Transplantation of Pancreatic Islets for Enhanced Diabetes Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;efficiency, prevascularization&#8208;free macroencapsulation system for the subcutaneous transplantation of pancreatic islets is developed. This novel system demonstrates excellent long&#8208;term blood glucose control at the subcutaneous site, even with the transplantation of &#8776;250 IEQ of islets. Furthermore, the system enables the local delivery of antifibrotic drugs, indicating its high applicability for islet xenotransplantation.








Abstract
Pancreatic islet macroencapsulation systems for subcutaneous transplantation have garnered significant attention as a therapy for Type I diabetes due to their minimal invasiveness and low complication rates. However, the low vascular density of subcutaneous tissue threatens the long&#8208;term survival of islets. To address this issue, prevascularized systems are introduced but various challenges remain, including system complexity and vascular&#8208;cell immunogenicity. Here, a novel prevasculature&#8208;free macroencapsulation system designed as a multilayer sheet, which ensures sufficient mass transport even in regions with sparse vasculature, is presented. Islets are localized in top/bottom micro&#8208;shell layers (&#8776;300&#160;&#181;m thick) to maximize proximity to the surrounding host vasculature. These sheets, fabricated via bioprinting using rat islets and alginate&#8208;based bio&#8208;ink, double islet viability and optimize islet density, improving insulin secretion function by 240%. The subcutaneous transplantation of small islet masses (&#8776;250 islet equivalent) into diabetic nude mice enable rapid (&lt;1 day) recovery of blood glucose, which remain stable for &gt;120 days. Additionally, antifibrotic drug&#8208;loaded multilayer sheets facilitate blood glucose regulation by rat islets at the subcutaneous sites of diabetic immunocompetent mice for &gt;35 days. Thus, this macroencapsulation system can advance the treatment of Type I diabetes and is also effective for islet xenotransplantation in subcutaneous tissue.

Here, a novel prevasculature-free macroencapsulation system designed as a multilayer sheet, which ensures sufficient mass transport even in regions with sparse vasculature, is presented. Islets are localized in top/bottom micro-shell layers (&#8776;300&#160;&#181;m thick) to maximize proximity to the surrounding host vasculature. These sheets, fabricated via bioprinting using rat islets and alginate-based bio-ink, double islet viability and optimize islet density, improving insulin secretion function by 240%. The subcutaneous transplantation of small islet masses (&#8776;250 islet equivalent) into diabetic nude mice enable rapid (&amp;lt;1 day) recovery of blood glucose, which remain stable for &amp;gt;120 days. Additionally, antifibrotic drug-loaded multilayer sheets facilitate blood glucose regulation by rat islets at the subcutaneous sites of diabetic immunocompetent mice for &amp;gt;35 days. Thus, this macroencapsulation system can advance the treatment of Type I diabetes and is also effective for islet xenotransplantation in subcutaneous tissue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ru&#8208;Incorporation&#8208;Induced Phase Transition in Co Nanoparticles for Low&#8208;Concentration Nitric Oxide Electroreduction to Ammonia at Low Potential</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic low&#8208;concentration NO conversion can effectively alleviate the artificially destroyed N&#8208;cycle balance. RuCo alloy nanoparticles in the hexagonal close&#8208;packed phase are synthesized and demonstrated as an electrocatalyst for efficient NO electroreduction. It exhibits a record&#8208;high Faraday efficiency of 99.2% and an NH3 yield of 77.76&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 at a low potential. With this RuCo electrocatalyst, a Zn&#8208;NO battery is assembled to simultaneously achieve NO removal, NH3 synthesis, and power output.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of nitric oxide (NO) to ammonia (NH3) represents a potential solution for improving the disrupted nitrogen cycle balance. Unfortunately, designing efficient electrocatalysts for NO reduction reaction (NORR) remains a notable challenge, especially at low concentrations. Herein, a displacement&#8208;alloying strategy is reported to successfully induce the phase transition of Co nanoparticles supported on carbon nanosheets from face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) to hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) structure through Ru incorporation. The obtained RuCo alloy with hcp phase structure (hcp&#8208;RuCo) exhibits apparent NORR activity with a record&#8208;high Faraday efficiency of 99.2% and an NH3 yield of 77.76&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.1&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode at a NO concentration of 1&#160;vol %, surpassing Co nanoparticles with fcc phase structure and most reported catalysts. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the excellent NORR activity of hcp&#8208;RuCo can be attributed to the optimized electronic structure of Co site and lowered energy barrier of the potential rate&#8208;determining step through phase transition. Furthermore, the assembled Zn&#8208;NO battery using hcp&#8208;RuCo as the cathode achieves a power density of 2.33&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and an NH3 yield of 45.94&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1. This work provides a promising research perspective for low&#8208;concentration NO conversion.

         <title>All&#8208;In&#8208;One Epoxy/MXene Nanocomposites with Bead&#8208;Type Polymeric Imidazole Latent Curing Agent for Enhancing Storage Stability and Flame Retardancy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The all&#8208;in&#8208;one epoxy/MXene nanocomposite system, comprising epoxy resin, polymeric imidazole latent curing agent beads (PILCAB), and surface&#8208;functionalized Ti3C2Tx MXene, exhibits excellent storage stability, improved flame retardancy, and enhanced mechanical strength, due to the homogeneous dispersibility, synergistic charring capability of MXene and bismaleimide (BMI), and the catalytic effect of the MXene flakes.








Abstract
Developing a single&#8208;component epoxy system is challenging but crucial for advanced thermoset applications. Unfortunately, conventional latent curing agents using chemical or physical passivation do not provide satisfactory storage stability and the necessary property requirements. Here, it is demonstrated that all&#8208;in&#8208;one epoxy/MXene nanocomposite system, comprising epoxy resin, polymeric imidazole latent curing agent beads (PILCAB), and Ti3C2Tx MXene, exhibits excellent storage stability, improved flame retardancy, and enhanced mechanical strength. PILCABs, prepared through a Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) crosslinking reaction between furan groups of poly(imidazolyl methacrylate)&#8208;random poly (furfuryl methacrylate) (PIm&#8208;r&#8208;PFu) copolymer and bismaleimide (BMI), exhibit excellent storage stability, as stable as under 60 &#176;C storage due to the imidazole reactivity being suppressed synergistically by both physical and chemical passivation mechanisms. Ti3C2Tx MXene flakes, surface&#8208;functionalized with alkylated 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine, exhibit excellent compatibility with the epoxy matrix. Consequently, the enhanced storage stability, flame retardancy, and mechanical strength of the all&#8208;in&#8208;one epoxy/MXene nanocomposite are attributed to the strong DA bond formation in latent curing agent, efficient charring capability of MXene and BMI, and the catalytic effect of the MXene. This study opens new avenues for designing and developing single&#8208;component epoxy systems that satisfy demanding requirements, including storage stability, mechanical strength, and flame retardancy, which are essential for practical applications.

N&#8208;doped MXene&#8208;encapsulated vanadium oxide hollow spheres (VOx@N&#8208;MXene HSs) that enable reversible Na+ storage through multidirectional pathways and ample vacancies are developed here. Machine learning simulations indicate increased pore density within the amorphous VOx structure and highlight atomic&#8208;scale transformations during cycling. These findings advance the design of amorphous electrodes, contributing to the development of next&#8208;generation energy storage devices.








Abstract
Sodium ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) address the high power and energy requirements in energy storage devices but face significant challenges arising from the slow kinetics and cycling instability of the anode side. Introducing atomic disorder and employing structural engineering in anode materials proves to be effective strategies for achieving rapid charge storage. Here, it is demonstrated that N&#8208;doped MXene encapsulated amorphous vanadium oxide hollow spheres (VOx@N&#8208;MXene HSs) offer multidirectional open pathways and sufficient vacancies, enabling reversible and fast Na+ insertion/extraction. Machine learning potentials, coupled with molecular simulation techniques, confirm the presence of more abundant pores within the amorphous vanadium oxide (VOx) structure. The simulation of the charging/discharging process elucidates the authentic reaction path and structural evolutions of the VOx@N&#8208;MXene HSs, providing sufficient insight into the atomic&#8208;scale mechanisms associated with these structural superiorities. The full SIHCs devices demonstrate a high energy density of 198.3 Wh kg&#8722;1, along with a long&#8208;term cycling lifespan of 8000 cycles. This study offers valuable strategies into the intricate design and exploration of amorphous electrodes, contributing to the advancement of next&#8208;generation electrochemical energy devices.

         <title>A DNAzyme&#8208;Based Nanohybrid for Ultrasound and Enzyme Dual&#8208;Controlled mRNA Regulation and Combined Tumor Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled DNAzyme nanohybrid is developed for ultrasound&#8208;controlled, enzyme&#8208;activatable mRNA regulation and combined tumor treatment. This system enables ultrasound&#8208;enhanced endosomal escape and specific enzyme activation of DNAzyme function, thereby improving efficacy and cell&#8208;type specificity in target gene silencing and combinational tumor therapy.








Abstract
Despite the significant potential of RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes for gene regulation, their application is limited by low therapeutic efficacy and lack of cell&#8208;specific control. Here, a DNAzyme&#8208;based nanohybrid designed for ultrasound (US)&#8208;controlled, enzyme&#8208;activatable mRNA regulation is presented, enabling tumor cell&#8208;selective combination therapy. The nanohybrid is constructed by coordination&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly of an enzymatically&#8208;triggerable therapeutic DNAzyme (En&#8208;Dz) and natural sonosensitizer hemoglobin (Hb). Controlled US exposure induces reactive oxygen species generation from Hb units, which not only facilitates efficient endosomal escape of En&#8208;Dz, but also promotes the translocation of specific enzyme from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thereby enhancing gene regulation efficacy. Notably, the enzyme&#8208;triggered, spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled activation of En&#8208;Dz's catalytic activity results in enhanced cancer&#8208;cell selectivity in the therapeutic treatment. Furthermore, the combination of enzyme&#8208;activated mRNA regulation and sonodynamic therapy significantly enhances anti&#8208;tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo.

     alt="A DNAzyme-Based Nanohybrid for Ultrasound and Enzyme Dual-Controlled mRNA Regulation and Combined Tumor Treatment"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A self-assembled DNAzyme nanohybrid is developed for ultrasound-controlled, enzyme-activatable mRNA regulation and combined tumor treatment. This system enables ultrasound-enhanced endosomal escape and specific enzyme activation of DNAzyme function, thereby improving efficacy and cell-type specificity in target gene silencing and combinational tumor therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the significant potential of RNA-cleaving DNAzymes for gene regulation, their application is limited by low therapeutic efficacy and lack of cell-specific control. Here, a DNAzyme-based nanohybrid designed for ultrasound (US)-controlled, enzyme-activatable mRNA regulation is presented, enabling tumor cell-selective combination therapy. The nanohybrid is constructed by coordination-directed self-assembly of an enzymatically-triggerable therapeutic DNAzyme (En-Dz) and natural sonosensitizer hemoglobin (Hb). Controlled US exposure induces reactive oxygen species generation from Hb units, which not only facilitates efficient endosomal escape of En-Dz, but also promotes the translocation of specific enzyme from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thereby enhancing gene regulation efficacy. Notably, the enzyme-triggered, spatiotemporally-controlled activation of En-Dz's catalytic activity results in enhanced cancer-cell selectivity in the therapeutic treatment. Furthermore, the combination of enzyme-activated mRNA regulation and sonodynamic therapy significantly enhances anti-tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. This work highlights the potential of integrating a sonodynamic strategy to overcome the current limitations of DNAzyme-based gene regulators, providing a spatiotemporally-controlled approach for precise tumor treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enabling 2D Electron Gas with High Room&#8208;Temperature Electron Mobility Exceeding 100&#160;cm2 Vs&#8722;1 at a Perovskite Oxide Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, using a combination of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art modes in molecular beam epitaxy, the controlled creation of a 2D electron gas at the epitaxial interface between perovskite oxides BaSnO3 and LaInO3 is demonstrated. The enhanced room&#8208;temperature electron mobility values are up to 119 cm2 Vs&#8722;1&#8212;the highest room&#8208;temperature value reported so far for a perovskite oxide 2D electron gas.








Abstract
In perovskite oxide heterostructures, bulk functional properties coexist with emergent physical phenomena at epitaxial interfaces. Notably, charge transfer at the interface between two insulating oxide layers can lead to the formation of a 2D electron gas (2DEG) with possible applications in, e.g., high&#8208;electron&#8208;mobility transistors and ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistors. So far, the realization of oxide 2DEGs is, however, largely limited to the interface between the single&#8208;crystal substrate and epitaxial film, preventing their deliberate placement inside a larger device architecture. Additionally, the substrate&#8208;limited quality of perovskite oxide interfaces hampers room&#8208;temperature (RT) 2DEG performance due to notoriously low electron mobility. In this work, the controlled creation of an interfacial 2DEG at the epitaxial interface between perovskite oxides BaSnO3 and LaInO3 is demonstrated with enhanced RT electron mobility values up to 119 cm2 Vs&#8722;1&#8212;the highest RT value reported so far for a perovskite oxide 2DEG. Using a combination of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art deposition modes during oxide molecular beam epitaxy, this approach opens up another degree of freedom in optimization and in situ control of the interface between two epitaxial oxide layers away from the substrate interface. Thus this approach is expected to apply to the general class of perovskite oxide 2DEG systems and to enable their improved compatibility with novel device concepts and integration across materials&#160;platforms.

         <title>Lateral Phase Heterojunction for Perovskite Microoptoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perovskite lateral phase heterojunction (LPH) polycrystalline film is first demonstrated by a developed contact&#8208;diffusion lithography (CDL) for the fabrication of microscale perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (micro&#8208;PeLEDs). Based on the &#945;/&#948;&#8208;formamidiniumPbI3 (FAPbI3) LPH film with high&#8208;resolution patterns and superior radiative performance, a record&#8208;efficiency near&#8208;infrared micro&#8208;PeLED device is achieved to validate the versatile applications of LPHs in perovskite microoptoelectronics and photonics.









Abstract
Perovskite heterojunction engineering is the prerequisite but still a deficiency in the fabrication of micro&#8208;optoelectronic devices, where the present top&#8208;down or bottom&#8208;up techniques mainly focus on preparing the vertical heterojunction stacks. Perovskite lateral heterojunction structures generally rely on epitaxial growth, which cannot meet the demands of mass production of micro&#8208;devices. Here, a contact diffusion lithography technique is proposed to demonstrate a perovskite lateral phase heterojunction (LPH) polycrystalline film by ion&#8208;driven local phase transition. Under the guidance of thermodynamic simulations, methylamine contact and migration collectively promote in situ formation of &#945;&#8208;phase formamidine&#8208;based perovskite patterns surrounded by &#948;&#8208;phase polymorphs. Spontaneous type&#8208;I heterojunction alignment between &#945;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;phases establishes energy funnels in the LPH film to facilitate carrier utilization and radiative recombination. The wide&#8208;bandgap &#948;&#8208;phase also serves as the coplanar isolator to achieve local anti&#8208;leakage for device integration. Based on the bright and stable LPH pattern layer, the near&#8208;infrared microscale perovskite light&#8208;emitting diode (micro&#8208;PeLED) with impressive device performance is achieved by following conventional device fabrication protocol. The proposed LPH enriches the perovskite heterojunction family, creates a new optoelectronic processing platform, and advances its versatile applications in micro&#8208;optoelectronics and photonics.

         <title>Impact of Dilute DIO Additive on Local Microstructure of Fluorinated, pNDI&#8208;Based Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of PBDBT: N2200&#8208;based all&#8208;polymer solar cells can be enhanced by processing with dilute diiodooctane solvent additive. This study reveals the microstructural mechanisms that drive charge transport enhancements in these solar cells by combining X&#8208;ray techniques with electron microscopy. Ultimately, the study finds that processing with dilute diiodooctane promotes efficient vertical charge transport pathways while preserving donor&#8211;acceptor interfacial connectivity.








Abstract
The performance of all&#8208;polymer solar cells is often enhanced by incorporating solvent additives during solution processing. In particular, blends based on the model all&#8208;polymer system PBDBT:N2200 have been shown to have increased short&#8208;circuit current and fill factor when processed with dilute diiodooctane (DIO). However, the morphological mechanism that drives the increase in performance is often not well understood due to limitations in common characterization techniques. In this study, it is shown that a combination of X&#8208;ray techniques with cryogenic high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis can provide a quantitative and spatially resolved picture of polymer chain orientation and alignment in all&#8208;polymer blends. It is found that DIO induces vertical phase separation in PBDBT&#8208;2F:F&#8208;N2200 and increases donor crystallite thickness in the pi&#8208;stacking direction leading to an acceptor&#8208;rich film surface. However, it is also shown that DIO does not disrupt the formation of face&#8208;on donor&#8211;acceptor interfaces. These findings suggest that dilute DIO primarily affects crystalline domain formation in single component regions as opposed to mixed regions; thus, dilute DIO can impact vertical charge transport pathways without sacrificing donor&#8211;acceptor interfacial connectivity.

         <title>Inhibiting Mitochondrial Damage for Efficient Treatment of Cerebral Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury Through Sequential Targeting Nanomedicine of Neuronal Mitochondria in Affected Brain Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript synthesized a nanomaterial (MHT) with strong antioxidant properties that can sequentially target the mitochondria of CIRI brain tissue neurons (a&#8211;c). After sublingual intravenous injection, MHT uses its high affinity for damaged vascular matrix proteins and mitochondrial membrane protein Tom20 to sequentially target neuronal mitochondria, effectively reducing neuronal death by efficiently clearing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and eliminating the inflammatory storm(d).








Abstract
Oxidative stress, predominantly from neuronal mitochondrial damage and the resultant cytokine storm, is central to cerebral ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (CIRI). However, delivering drugs to neuronal mitochondria remains challenging due to the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB), which impedes drug entry into affected brain tissues. This study introduces an innovative tannic acid (TA) and melanin&#8208;modified heteropolyacid nanomedicine (MHT), which highly specifically eliminates the neuronal mitochondrial reactive oxygen radicals burst to efficiently reduce neuronal mitochondrial damage through a strategically designed sequential targeting strategy from affected brain tissue to neuronal mitochondria. TA endows MHT with sequential targeting ability by binding to matrix proteins exposed to the damaged BBB and mitochondrial outer membrane proteins of neurons, while melanin significantly enhances the antioxidant capacity of MHT. Consequently, MHT effectively inhibits neuronal apoptosis by protecting mitochondria and reversing the inflammatory immune environment through the deactivation of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8211;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway. MHT demonstrated a strong therapeutic effect on CIRI, with an ultralow dose (2 mg&#160;kg&#8722;1) proving effective in reversing the condition. This work not only introduces a new avenue to significantly reduce CIRI through sequential targeting therapy but also offers a new paradigm for treating other ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury diseases.

This study introduces an innovative tannic acid (TA) and melanin-modified heteropolyacid nanomedicine (MHT), which highly specifically eliminates the neuronal mitochondrial reactive oxygen radicals burst to efficiently reduce neuronal mitochondrial damage through a strategically designed sequential targeting strategy from affected brain tissue to neuronal mitochondria. TA endows MHT with sequential targeting ability by binding to matrix proteins exposed to the damaged BBB and mitochondrial outer membrane proteins of neurons, while melanin significantly enhances the antioxidant capacity of MHT. Consequently, MHT effectively inhibits neuronal apoptosis by protecting mitochondria and reversing the inflammatory immune environment through the deactivation of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase&#8211;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway. MHT demonstrated a strong therapeutic effect on CIRI, with an ultralow dose (2 mg&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) proving effective in reversing the condition. This work not only introduces a new avenue to significantly reduce CIRI through sequential targeting therapy but also offers a new paradigm for treating other ischemia-reperfusion injury diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Reversible and Robust Mechano&#8208;Responsive Ultralong Phosphorescence of Polyurethane Elastomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;situ, sensitive, and rapidly reversible mechano&#8208;responsive (MR) phosphorescence from a doped polyurethane (PU) elastomer has been achieved from the reversible MR polymer chain orientation and hydrogen bonding interactions among the system. Based on their MR afterglow, these PU materials have demonstrated various applications without interruption of background, including micro&#8208;crack detection, material damage prediction, limb movement monitoring, and information encryption.








Abstract
Though mechano&#8208;responsive luminescent materials obtained much attention, most of their responses are non&#8208;reversible, let alone in situ reversible. Here, the study presents a new strategy to push through this limitation for their applications, which relies on the reversible mechano&#8208;responsive (MR) hydrogen bonding interactions and polymer chain orientation among a doped polyurethane (PU) elastomer. The radiative and nonradiative transitions inside these phosphorescent triphenylene&#8208;based aromatic secondary amines (TpNP and TpNPO) doped in the PU matrix can be accordingly modulated by these MR variations, including the PU chains orientation and the interactions between emitters and PU, respectively. Surprisingly, the intensities, quantum yields, and even lifetimes of their ultralong phosphorescence correlate well with the stress of PU, showing triple mechano&#8208;enhancement with a small threshold value of 7.9&#160;MPa. Importantly, these in situ and rapidly reversible MR phosphorescences possess excellent repeatability, which is still displayed even after &gt;500 cycles of loading/unloading. Based on such a robust and highly sensitive MR afterglow, these PU materials have been demonstrated applications with no interruption of background in several fields, including micro&#8208;crack detection, material damage prediction, limb movement monitoring, and information encryption. This work provides new insights for developing innovative ultralong phosphorescence materials with improved luminescence and reversible mechano&#8208;responsive behavior.

         <title>A General Approach for Metal Nanoparticle Encapsulation Within Porous Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust nanocasting approach is demonstrated to synthesize encapsulated nanoparticles in metal oxides. First, colloidal nanoparticles are encapsulated in a porous polymer matrix. Then, metal oxide precursor is infiltrated, and materials are calcined to form a porous metal oxide network. Various combinations of nanoparticles encapsulated in metal oxide materials can be synthesized, and their surface area and porosity can be tuned using this method.








Abstract
Encapsulation of metal nanoparticles within oxide materials has been shown as an effective strategy to improve activity, selectivity, and stability in several catalytic applications. Several approaches have been proposed to encapsulate nanoparticles, such as forming core&#8208;shell structures, growing ordered structures (zeolites or metal&#8208;organic frameworks) on nanoparticles, or directly depositing support materials on nanoparticles. Here, a general nanocasting method is demonstrated that can produce diverse encapsulated metal@oxide structures with different compositions (Pt, Pd, Rh) and multiple types of oxides (Al2O3, Al2O3&#8208;CeO2, ZrO2, ZnZrOx, In2O3, Mn2O3, TiO2) while controlling the size and dispersion of nanoparticles and the porous structure of the oxide. Metal@polymer structures are first prepared, and then the oxide precursor is infiltrated into such structures and the resulting material is calcined to form the metal@oxide structures. Most Pt@oxides catalysts show similar catalytic activity, demonstrating the availability of surface Pt sites in the encapsulated structures. However, the Pt@Mn2O3 sample showed much higher CO oxidation activity, while also being stable under aging conditions. This work demonstrated a robust nanocasting method to synthesize metal@oxide structures, which can be utilized in catalysis to finely tune metal&#8208;oxide interfaces.

         <title>Designing Impact Resistance and Robustness into Slippery Lubricant Infused Porous Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slippery lubricant infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) are presented which seek to address the lubricant drainage issue that impairs such surfaces. The strong lubricant retention achieved enables the SLIPS to maintain their slipperiness under high&#8208;speed liquid impact and other dynamic/flow conditions. These findings should widen the practical applications of SLIPS.








Abstract
Slippery lubricant infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) have the potential to address daunting challenges such as undesirable surface fouling/biofouling, icing, etc. However, the depletion of lubricants hampers their practical utility. As a solution, here a rational strategy is introduced that operates synergistically in three parts. First, ultra&#8208;high capillary pressure is exploited from the reticular structure of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with sub&#8208;nanometer pores. Second, the need for geometric compatibility is demonstrated; the lubricant chain diameter must be smaller than the MOF pore to enable lubricant chain intercalation. Lastly, the MOF pore chemistry is tailored to achieve a strong intermolecular interaction for any given MOF/lubricant combination. The strategy is investigated through experiments and quantum/molecular simulations, which show that the approach helps lock the intercalated lubricant chains inside the MOF pores and forms a non&#8208;conventional supramolecular structure. The resulting SLIPS (including those with fluorine&#8208;free chemistry) not only show typical low wetting hysteresis, friction, and ice adhesion but are uniquely resistant to more stringent tests such as continuous dripping and sliding of water droplets (up to 50&#160;hrs), repeated impacts of high&#8208;speed water jets (liquid impact Weber number &gt;&#160;4&#160;&#215;&#160;104) and prevent bacterial biofilm formation even in dynamic flow conditions. The findings may widen the practical applications of SLIPS.

         <title>An Antagonistic Photovoltaic Memristor for Bioinspired Active Contrast Adaptation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired optoelectronic memristor incorporating two antagonistic photovoltaic junctions can autonomously adjust its response to varying light stimuli, enabling the amplification of shadows and inhibition of highlight saturation. The memristor arrays are capable of capturing a high&#8208;contrast scene up to 94 dB with a faster active adaptation speed (less than 1.2 s) than that of biological systems.








Abstract
Machine vision systems that consist of cameras and image&#8208;processing components for visual inspection and identification tasks play a critical role in various intelligent applications, including pilotless vehicles and surveillance systems. However, current systems usually possess a limited dynamic range and fixed photoresponsivity, restricting their capability of gaining high&#8208;fidelity images when encoding a high&#8208;contrast scene. Here, it is shown that a photovoltaic memristor incorporating two antagonistic photovoltaic junctions can autonomously adjust its response to varying light stimuli, enabling the amplification of shadows and inhibition of highlight saturation. Due to the dynamic photodoping effect at the p&#8208;n junction with an asymmetrical profile, the photocurrent polarities of the antagonistic memristor can be changed as the light intensity increases. The light&#8208;intensity&#8208;dependent switchable photovoltaic behaviors match Weber's law where photosensitivity is inversely proportional to the light stimuli. An 11&#160;&#215;&#160;11 memristor array is used to detect a high&#8208;contrast scene with light intensities ranging from 1 to 5&#160;&#215;&#160;104 &#181;W cm&#8722;2, achieving a similar active contrast adaptation performance compared with the human visual systems (less than 1.2 s at 94 dB). This work paves the way for innovative neuromorphic device designs and may lead to the development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art active visual adaptation photosensors.

         <title>Hydronium&#8208;Crosslinked Inorganic Hydrogel Comprised of 1D Lepidocrocite Titanate Nanofilaments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently discovered, 1D lepidocrocite titanate nanofilaments (1DL) represent a highly scalable &#8220;truly 1D&#8221; material, featuring a cross&#8208;section 2&#160;x&#160;2 TiO6 octahedra thick. Given its extreme dimensionality, 1DL can be considered a TiO&#8208;based analog to polymeric strands and possesses unique self&#8208;assembly properties. Ion exchange with hydronium produces a crosslinked network of the first ever 1&#8208;D titanate&#8208;based, robust, biocompatible hydrogel.








Abstract
When a few drops of acid (hydrochloric, acrylic, propionic, acetic, or formic) are added to a colloid comprised of 1D lepidocrocite titanate nanofilaments (1DLs)&#8211;2 &#215; 2 TiO6 octahedra in cross&#8208;section&#8211;a hydrogel forms, in many cases, within seconds. The 1DL synthesis process requires the reaction between titanium diboride with tetramethylammonium (TMA+), hydroxide. Using quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (qNMR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the mass percent of TMA+ after synthesis is determined to be &#8776; 13.1&#160;&#177;&#160;0.1%. The TMA+ is completely removed from the gels after 2 water soak cycles, resulting in the first completely inorganic, TiO2&#8208;based hydrogels. Ion exchanging the TMA+ with hydronium results in gels with relatively strong hydrogen bonds. The hydrogels' compression strengths increased linearly with 1DL colloid concentration. At a 1DL concentration of 45&#160;g&#160;L&#8722;1, the compressive strength, at 80% deformation when acrylic acid is used, is &#8776;325&#160;kPa. The strengths are &#8776; 50% greater after the TMA+ is removed. The removal of all residual organic components in the hydrogels, including TMA+, is confirmed by qNMR, Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and TGA/DSC. The 1DL phase is retained after gelation, TMA+ removal, and 80% compression.

         <title>A Frustrated Antipolar Phase Analogous to Classical Spin Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
EuAl12O19 crystals realize an electric analogue to one of the famous models of frustrated magnetism: the Ising triangular lattice antiferromagnet. Electric dipoles on a triangular lattice preferentially align antiparallel to their neighbors yet fail to form any long&#8208;range order, even at the lowest temperatures. The resulting frustrated antipolar phase is analogous to classical spin liquids.








Abstract
The study of magnetic frustration in classical spin systems is motivated by the prediction and discovery of classical spin liquid states. These uncommon magnetic phases are characterized by a massive degeneracy of their ground state implying a finite magnetic entropy at zero temperature. While the classical spin liquid state is originally predicted in the Ising triangular lattice antiferromagnet in 1950, this state has never been experimentally observed in any triangular magnets. The discovery of an electric analogue of classical spin liquids on a triangular lattice of uniaxial electric dipoles in EuAl12O19 is reported here. This new type of frustrated antipolar phase is characterized by a highly&#8208;degenerate state at low temperature implying an absence of long&#8208;range antiferroelectric order, despite short&#8208;range antipolar correlations. Its dynamics are governed by a thermally activated process, slowing down upon cooling toward a complete freezing at zero&#160;temperature.

         <title>A Universal Ternary Solvent System of Surface Passivator Enables Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Exceeding 26%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A suitable solvent system of passivator can maximize the passivation effect, further improving the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This work proposes a ternary solvent system of 4&#8208;MeO&#8208;PEAI, which can inhibit the solvent&#8208;induced additional defects and achieve a sufficient passivated perovskite surface simultaneously. The resulting PSCs achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.05%, and the devices can maintain 95.23% and 95.68% of their initial PCE after 2000&#160;h storage in ambient air and 800&#160;h light&#8208;soaking in N2&#8208;glovebox.








Abstract
Surface passivation is a vital approach to improve the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), in which the passivator solvent is an inevitable but easy&#8208;ignored factor on passivation effects. Herein, a universal ternary solvent system of surface passivators is proposed through comprehensively considering the solubility and selective perovskite dissolution of the solvent to maximize the passivation effect. Tetrahydrothiophene 1&#8208;oxide (THTO) is selected as the passivation promoter by comparing the binding energy with perovskite and the ability to distort the perovskite lattice among various aprotic polar solvent molecules, which can facilitate the passivator's reaction with perovskite and achieve sufficient passivation on perovskite surface. Besides, chlorobenzene (CB) is used as the diluting agent to minimize the amount of isopropanol (IPA), inhibiting the additional solvent&#8208;induced defects. As a result, the planar PSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.05%, (certificated 25.66%). Besides, the unencapsulated devices exhibit enhanced stability, which can maintain 95.23% and 95.68% of their initial PCE after 2000&#160;h of storage in ambient air and 800&#160;h of light&#8208;soaking in N2&#8208;glovebox. Moreover, this ternary solvent system also exhibits a well applicability and reliability in different passivator such as PEAI, BAI, and so on.

         <title>Thresholding Computing with Heterogeneous Integration of Memristive Kernel with Metal&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Semiconductor Capacitor for Temporal Data Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an integrated thresholding kernel with two Pt/HfO2/TiN (PHT) memristors and Ni/HfO2/n&#8208;Si (NHS) metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor capacitor (2M1MOS) for precise thresholding in time&#8208;series data. This kernel system demonstrates an improved detection scheme in ECG analysis and achieved high accuracy in spoken digit classification, utilizing the capacitive thresholding to enhance memristive event detection ability for bio&#8208;indicator applications.








Abstract
Precise event detection within time&#8208;series data is increasingly critical, particularly in noisy environments. Reservoir computing, a robust computing method widely utilized with memristive devices, is efficient in processing temporal signals. However, it typically lacks intrinsic thresholding mechanisms essential for precise event detection. This study introduces a new approach by integrating two Pt/HfO2/TiN (PHT) memristors and one Ni/HfO2/n&#8208;Si (NHS)&#160;metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor capacitor (2M1MOS) to implement a tunable thresholding function. The current&#8208;voltage nonlinearity of memristors combined with the capacitance&#8208;voltage nonlinearity of the capacitor forms the basis of the 2M1MOS kernel system. The proposed kernel hardware effectively records feature&#8208;specified information of the input signal onto the memristors through capacitive thresholding. In electrocardiogram analysis, the memristive response exhibited a more than ten&#8208;fold difference between arrhythmia and normal beats. In isolated spoken digit classification, the kernel achieved an error rate of only 0.7% by tuning thresholds for various time&#8208;specific conditions. The kernel is also applied to biometric authentication by extracting personal features using various threshold times, presenting more complex and multifaceted uses of heartbeats and voice data as bio&#8208;indicators. These demonstrations highlight the potential of thresholding computing in a memristive framework with heterogeneous integration.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Sensitivity Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Landslide Surface Deformation via Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for monitoring surface deformation of landslides via triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) is proposed. By utilizing an ultra&#8208;low&#8208;speed triboelectric displacement sensor (US&#8208;TDS) to build the monitoring and early warning system, achieving highly sensitive real&#8208;time monitoring of surface deformation displacement and speed under ultra&#8208;low&#8208;speed conditions. This work provides a feasible solution for the scientific monitoring of the latent processes of landslides.








Abstract
Monitoring surface deformation is crucial for the early warning of landslides, facilitating timely preventive measures. Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) demonstrates great potential for self&#8208;powered distributed monitoring in remote and power&#8208;scarce landslide areas. However, landslides deform typically at a rate of a few millimeters per day (mm d&#8722;1), making it challenging for TENG to directly monitor the deformation process. Herein, a method for monitoring surface deformation of landslides by constructing an ultra&#8208;low&#8208;speed triboelectric displacement sensor (US&#8208;TDS) is reported. Utilizing a force storage&#8208;release device and an accelerator, the US&#8208;TDS can produce obvious sensing signals at a linear input speed of 4.32&#160;mm d&#8722;1. The coefficient of determination (R2) for the fitting curve of the pulse signals within the speed range of 21.6 to 129.6&#160;mm d&#8722;1 reaches 0.999. Moreover, US&#8208;TDS can detect deformation displacement as small as 0.0382&#160;mm. The stability of US&#8208;TDS displacement measurements is confirmed at a speed of 108&#160;mm d&#8722;1, with relative errors under 1%. Ultimately, a real&#8208;time monitoring and early warning system for landslide surface deformation is constructed and verified through a combination of indoor simulations and outdoor experiments. This work provides a feasible solution for the scientific monitoring and early warning of the landslide development.

         <title>A Versatile Microporous Design toward Toughened yet Softened Self&#8208;Healing Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A closed microporous design is demonstrated to transform soft and weak into soft yet ultra&#8208;tough self&#8208;healing materials. This approach not only achieves unprecedented improvements in crack propagation resistance and centimeter&#8208;scale fractocohesive lengths, but also enhances mechanical softness while preserving self&#8208;healing kinetics, which is crucial for fully exploiting the potential of soft yet tough self&#8208;healing materials in stretchable electronics.








Abstract
Realizing the full potential of self&#8208;healing materials in stretchable electronics necessitates not only low modulus to enable high adaptivity, but also high toughness to resist crack propagation. However, existing toughening strategies for soft self&#8208;healing materials have only modestly improves mechanical dissipation near the crack tip (&#1043;D), and invariably compromise the material's inherent softness and autonomous healing capabilities. Here, a synthetic microporous architecture is demonstrated that unprecedently toughens and softens self&#8208;healing materials without impacting their intrinsic self&#8208;healing kinetics. This microporous structure spreads energy dissipation across the entire material through a bran&#8208;new dissipative mode of adaptable crack movement (&#1043;A), which substantially increases the fracture toughness by 31.6 times, from 3.19 to 100.86 kJ m&#8722;2, and the fractocohesive length by 20.7 times, from 0.59 mm to 12.24 mm. This combination of unprecedented fracture toughness (100.86 kJ m&#8722;2) and centimeter&#8208;scale fractocohesive length (1.23 cm) surpasses all previous records for synthetic soft self&#8208;healing materials and even exceeds those of light alloys. Coupled with significantly enhanced softness (0.43 MPa) and nearly perfect autonomous self&#8208;healing efficiency (&#8776;100%), this robust material is ideal for constructing durable kirigami electronics for wearable devices.

         <title>Single Atom Engineered Antibiotics Overcome Bacterial Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single atoms of manganese, tightly bonded to nitrogen&#8208;doped carboxylated graphene, exhibit potent antibacterial properties and bypass bacterial resistance development, even after thirty bacterial generations. Antibacterial activity is observed against both Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, as well as in in&#8208;vivo models, while the material is nontoxic to human cells.








Abstract
The outbreak of antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria, or &#8220;superbugs&#8221;, poses a global public health hazard due to their resilience against the most effective last&#8208;line antibiotics. Identifying potent antibacterial agents capable of evading bacterial resistance mechanisms represents the ultimate defense strategy. This study shows that &#8211;the otherwise essential micronutrient&#8211; manganese turns into a broad&#8208;spectrum potent antibiotic when coordinated with a carboxylated nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene. This antibiotic material (termed NGA&#8208;Mn) not only inhibits the growth of a wide spectrum of multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria but also heals wounds infected by bacteria in vivo and, most importantly, effectively evades bacterial resistance development. NGA&#8208;Mn exhibits up to 25&#8208;fold higher cytocompatibility to human cells than its minimum bacterial inhibitory concentration, demonstrating its potential as a next&#8208;generation antibacterial agent. Experimental findings suggest that NGA&#8208;Mn acts on the outer side of the bacterial cell membrane via a multimolecular collective binding, blocking vital functions in both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. The results underscore the potential of single&#8208;atom engineering toward potent antibiotics, offering simultaneously a long&#8208;sought solution for evading drug resistance development while being cytocompatible to human cells.

         <title>Kirigami&#8208;Inspired Three&#8208;Dimensional Metamaterials with Programmable Isotropic and Orthotropic Thermal Expansion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of 3D metamaterials capable of programmable negative/zero/positive thermal expansion (NTE/ZTE/PTE) is developed based on the one&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom kirigami polyhedrons. An ultra&#8208;wide range of CTEs from &#8722;2354.3 to 3006.7 ppm/&#176;C is achieved in isotropic metamaterials. Furthermore, orthotropic metamaterials, where each of three directions can be assigned with an independently programmed NTE, ZTE, or PTE, are realized for the first time.








Abstract
Mechanical metamaterials with specifically designed cells can provide unusual thermal expansion properties for diverse applications. Limited by very few available cell topologies and complicated non&#8208;linear structural deformation, most existing thermal expansion metamaterials can only achieve orthogonally isotropic negative/zero/positive thermal expansion (NTE/ZTE/PTE) within a mild range, especially the 3D ones. Here, based on one&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom kirigami polyhedrons proposed with a kinematic design strategy, a family of 3D isotropic and orthotropic metamaterials capable of programmable NTE, PTE, and even ZTE over ultra&#8208;wide range is developed. Incorporating bi&#8208;material strips as creases for isotropic polyhedrons, NTE and PTE metamaterials with coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) ranging from &#8722;2354.3 to 3006.7&#160;ppm/&#176;C are designed and programmed by the theoretical model. Meanwhile, isotropic ZTE metamaterials are constructed by either homogeneous tessellation of ZTE cells or hybrid tessellation of NTE and PTE cells. Furthermore, by allowing distinct geometric parameters in the three orthogonal directions of the kirigami polyhedrons while preserving the kinematic motion, orthotropic metamaterials, in which each of the three directions can be assigned with an independently programmed NTE, ZTE, or PTE, are also achieved. This study paves a novel pathway for the development of thermal expansion metamaterials with potential applications for space optical systems, MEMS, and so on.

         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a flexible, wearable light&#8208;emitting device for skin anti&#8208;aging. The mask, based on a 3D origami structure, achieves conformal contact with the face, maximizing phototherapeutic effects. Notably, improvements in the elasticity of deep skin were 340% greater compared to a conventional LED mask. The blister&#8208;actuated laser&#8208;induced transfer achieves a 99.61% yield for microLEDs at a rate of 50 chips per second, enabling mass production.








Abstract
Photobiomodulation therapy based on micro light&#8208;emitting diodes (&#181;LEDs) holds remarkable potential for the beauty industry. Here, a cosmetically effective face&#8208;fit surface&#8208;lighting &#181;LED mask for skin anti&#8208;aging is introduced. The face&#8208;conformable mask enables deep tissue treatment through proximal light irradiation, with a 3D origami structure capable of adapting to complex facial contours with closed adherence. A blister&#8208;assisted laser transfer achieves rapid and accurate &#181;LEDs transfer at a high throughput of 50 chips per second, facilitating a mass&#8208;producible and large&#8208;area process. Finally, clinical trials demonstrate significant improvements in elasticity, sagging, and wrinkles across six facial areas, with a maximum enhancement of 340% in deep skin elasticity of the perioral area compared to the conventional LED mask group.

         <title>Force&#8208;Induced Ultraviolet C Luminescence of Pr3+&#8208;Doped Sr2P2O7 for X&#8208;Ray Dosimetry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon stimulation of force, Sr2P2O7:Pr3+ emits trap&#8208;controlled UVC mechanoluminescence with the peak wavelength at 230&#160;nm. The UVC mechanoluminescence can be used for X&#8208;ray dosimetry.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescent materials have broad application prospects in advanced displays, stress imaging, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting owing to their ability to convert mechanical stimuli into light. However, most previous studies have focused on the visible and near&#8208;infrared regions. Although natural ultraviolet C (UVC) light is nearly absent on the Earth's surface, it plays an important role in many fields. Therefore, the development of smart materials capable of emitting UVC mechanoluminescence (ML) and expanding the application scenarios of UVC ML are significant but challenging. Here the ML property of Sr2P2O7:Pr3+ is examined, which stems from the 5d&#8594;4f transition of Pr3+ and is located over the UVC region. The peak wavelength of the UVC ML of Sr2P2O7:Pr3+ is &#8776;230&#160;nm, which is, to the best of this knowledge, the shortest ML wavelength reported to date. It is further demonstrated that the UVC ML of Sr2P2O7:Pr3+ is associated with trapped charge carriers and can be conveniently regulated by adjusting the X&#8208;ray excitation time. Relying on this unique characteristic, the potential of the UVC ML of Sr2P2O7:Pr3+ as an indicator of the X&#8208;ray radiation dose is demonstrated. This study enriches the family of mechanoluminescent materials and expands the available wavelength of ML to the UVC region.

         <title>Neuron&#8208;Inspired Flexible Phase Change Materials for Ambient Energy Harvesting and Respiration Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neuron&#8208;inspired flexible phase change materials (PCMs) are fabricated via a self&#8208;assembly strategy, demonstrating high photothermal conversion efficiency and excellent thermal cycle stability. Due to the ultrasensitive humidity responsiveness, the flexible materials are directly utilized as sensors for human respiratory monitoring, which shows great potential for moisture electric generators (MEGs).








Abstract
The global energy crisis and climate change pose unprecedented challenges. Wearable devices with personal thermoregulation and energy harvesting hold great promise for achieving energy savings and human thermal comfort. Here, inspired by neurons, a novel phase change material (PCM) is reported for efficient energy harvesting and respiratory monitoring via a self&#8208;assembly strategy. The use of gum arabic (GA) enabled the encapsulation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the targeted distribution of carboxylated multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (cMWCNTs) simultaneously in poly (ethylene vinyl acetate) (EVA) matrix. The material exhibits an outstanding toughness value of 14.88&#160;MJ m&#8722;3 and high elongation at a break of 565.67%, exhibiting remarkable flexibility. The material with sufficient melting enthalpy (71.11 J g&#8722;1) demonstrates high photothermal conversion efficiency (95.27%) under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation (105&#160;mW cm&#8722;2). In addition, due to the synergistic effect of GA and PEG, especially the formation of microdome structures on the surface, the material demonstrates ultrasensitive humidity responsiveness for respiratory monitoring with high precision, excellent repeatability, and fast response/recovery time (50.4/50.5&#160;ms). Notably, it shows great potential for moisture&#8208;electric generators (MEGs) with the function of non&#8208;contact sensing. This material opens the path toward next&#8208;generation wearable devices in energy conversion and health monitoring.

         <title>Evolution of Nitrogen&#8208;Coordinated Metal Single Atoms Toward Single&#8208;Atom Alloys on MgH&#8322; as Efficient and Stable Hydrogen Spillover Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transformation of nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal single atoms (M&#8211;N&#8211;C) into single&#8208;atom alloys (SAA) are revealed during the catalysis of hydrogen spillover on MgH&#8322;. High&#8208;valence Ni in the NiN&#8324; sites is reduced, leaves the NiN&#8324; coordination, and diffuses into the surface lattice of Mg, forming a Ni&#8321;&#8210;Mg SAA. This Ni&#8321;&#8210;Mg SAA exhibits superior activity and stability compared to NiN&#8324; and most other known Ni&#8208;based catalysts for hydrogen storage reactions.








Abstract
M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts with nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal single&#8208;atom active sites have demonstrated high activity for hydrogen storage materials, but their stability in this application remains uncertain. This study addresses this issue by using nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc) molecules on MgH&#8322; particles as a model system. It is found that the N&#8208;coordinated high&#8208;valence Ni single atoms in the NiN&#8324; active site are unstable in the reducing environment of hydrogen storage, spontaneously evolving into zero&#8208;valence Ni, forming a Ni&#8321;&#8208;Mg single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA). The Ni&#8321;&#8208;Mg SAA exhibits remarkable stability in catalyzing Mg hydrogen storage reactions. Furthermore, it demonstrates comprehensive catalytic activity for each step of hydrogen absorption and desorption from Mg, surpassing the efficiency of the NiN&#8324; active site, especially in the critical steps of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation. Overall, the catalytic performance of Ni&#8321;&#8208;Mg SAA is superior to most known nickel&#8208;based catalysts. This evolutionary process is also observed in FePc, CoPc, and tetraphenylporphyrin nickel (Ni&#8208;TPP), suggesting that this reducing transformation is a universal phenomenon for MN&#8324;&#8208;type active sites in hydrogen storage catalysis.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unveils an aggregation&#8208;driven mechanism for synthesizing spinel oxides via hot injection that enables single&#8208;nanometer (1.2 nm) spinel. The resulting single&#8208;nanometer CoMn2O4 exhibits precise cation distribution with maximal octahedral Mn occupancy to form highly active catalytic centers, leading to superior electrocatalytic activity. This advancement offers a novel way for specifically engineering spinel structures and elucidating crucial structure&#8211;property relationships.








Abstract
Designing spinel nanocrystals (NCs) with tailored structural composition and cation distribution is crucial for superior catalytic performance but remarkably challenging due to their intricate nature. Here, an aggregation growth restricted hot&#8208;injection method is presented by meticulously investigating the fundamental nucleation and aggregation&#8208;driven growth kinetics governing spinel NC formation to address this challenge. Through controlled collision probability of nuclei during growth, this approach enables the synthesis of spinel NCs with unprecedented, single nanometer (1.2&#160;nm). Single&#8208;nanometer CoMn2O4 spinel via this method exhibits a highly tailored structure with a maximized population of highly active octahedral Mn atoms, thereby optimizing oxygen intermediate adsorption during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Consequently, it exhibits a remarkable half&#8208;wave potential of 0.88&#160;V in ORR and leads to a superior power density (170.9&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) in zinc&#8211;air battery, outperforming commercial Pt/C and most reported spinel oxides, revealing a clear structure&#8211;property relationship. This structure design strategy is readily adaptable for the precise synthesis and engineering of various spinel structures, opening new avenues for developing advanced electrocatalysts and energy storage materials.

         <title>Bifunctional Fluorocarbon Electrode Additive Lowers the Salt Dependence of Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional fluorocarbon electrode additive (BFEA) is proposed to construct solid electrolyte interphase independent of aqueous electrolyte. The LiF from reduction of BFEA suppresses hydrogen evolution, increasing coulombic efficiency while the carbon byproduct lowers battery polarization, improving round&#8208;trip efficiency. The unique advantages of BFEA make it highly compatible with aqueous batteries and promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications.








Abstract
The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a crucial role in extending the life of aqueous batteries. The traditional anion&#8208;derived SEI formation in aqueous electrolytes highly depends on high&#8208;concentrated organic fluorinating salts, resulting in low forming efficiency and long&#8208;term consumption. In response, this study proposes a bifunctional fluorocarbon electrode additive (BFEA) that enables electrochemical pre&#8208;reduction instead of TFSI anion to form the LiF&#8208;rich SEI and in situ produce conductive graphite inside the anode before the lithiation. The BFEA lowers the salt dependence of aqueous electrolytes, enabling the inorganic LiCl electrolyte to work first, but also successfully achieves a high SEI formation efficiency in the relatively low 10&#160;m LiTFSI without mass transfer concerns, suppressing the parasitic hydrogen evolution from 11.24 to 4.35&#160;nmol min&#8722;1. Besides, BFEA strengthens the intrinsic superiority of Li storage reaction by lowering battery polarization resulting from the in situ production of graphite, promoting charge transfer of electrode kinetics. Compared with the control group, the demonstrated Ah&#8208;level pouch cell employing BFEA exhibits better cycle stability above 300 cycles with higher capacity retention of 78.2% and the lower decay of the round&#8208;trip efficiency (&#9651;RTE = 2%), benefiting for maintaining the high efficiency and reducing heat accumulation in large&#8208;scale electric energy storage.

         <title>Strong, Spontaneous, and Self&#8208;Healing Poly(Ionic Liquid) Elastomer Underwater Adhesive with Borate Ester Dynamic Crosslinking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borate ester dynamically crosslinked poly(ionic liquid) elastomer adhesives (PIEA) are prepared. The dissociation of the borate ester in water leads to a spontaneous increase in the adhesion strength of PIEA from almost no adhesion to 314 kPa after 12 h without any external preloading, providing promising applications for the development of novel underwater smart adhesives.








Abstract
Adhesion in aqueous environments is often hindered by the water layer on the surface of the substrate due to the water sensitivity of the adhesive, greatly limiting the application environment. Here, a borate ester dynamically crosslinked poly(ionic liquid) elastomer adhesive (PIEA) with high strength, toughness, self&#8208;healing abilities, and ionic conductivity is synthesized by copolymerizing hydrophobic ionic liquid monomer ([HPVIm][TFSI]) and 2&#8208;methoxyethyl acrylate (MEA). The adhesion strength of PIEA can increase spontaneously from almost no adhesion to 314 kPa after 12 h without any external preloading due to the dissociation of the borate ester in water, leading to noncovalent interactions between the hydroxyl groups of PIEA and the substrate. Additionally, PIEA can be developed for soft sensors or ion electrodes to enable underwater detection and communication. This strategy offers broad application potential for the development of novel underwater smart adhesives.

         <title>Framework Nucleic Acid&#8208;Based Selective Cell Catcher for Endogenous Stem Cell Recruitment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;stem cell catcher&#8221; system, inspired by gold prospectors in the game &#8220;Gold Miner,&#8221; is a tFNA&#8208;based structure embedded in a hyaluronic acid hydrogel for in vivo recruitment of stem cells in bone injuries. It mimics the process of mining for gold, targeting and capturing cellular gold necessary for craniofacial bone regeneration in challenging microenvironments.








Abstract
Cell&#8208;surface engineering holds great promise in boosting endogenous stem cell attraction for tissue regeneration. However, challenges such as cellular internalization of ligand and the dynamic nature of cell membranes often complicate ligand&#8211;receptor interactions. The aim of this study is to harness the innovative potential of programmable tetrahedral framework nucleic acid (tFNA) to enable precise, tunable ligand&#8211;receptor interactions, thereby improving stem cell recruitment efficiency. This approach involves experimental screening and theoretical analysis using dissipative particle dynamics. The results demonstrate that altering the flexibility and topology of ligands on tFNA changes their cellular internalization and membrane binding efficiency. Furthermore, optimizing the distribution of the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)&#8208;binding aptamer 19S (Apt19S) on the tFNA enhances the stem cell capture efficiency. Following successful in vitro MSC capture, Apt19S&#8208;modified tFNA is chemically linked to a hyaluronic acid hydrogel, forming an efficient &#8220;stem cell catcher&#8221; system. Subsequent in vivo experiments demonstrate that this system effectively promotes early stem cell recruitment and accelerates bone regeneration in different bone healing scenarios, including cranial and maxillary defects.

         <title>Intrinsic Out&#8208;Of&#8208;Plane and In&#8208;Plane Ferroelectricity in 2D AgCrS2 with High Curie Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D AgCrS2 with superior ferroelectricity and high Curie temperature are synthesized in large&#8208;scale via chemical vapor deposition growth. The AgCrS2 nanosheet possesses a non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure which endows it with prominent out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane ferroelectric properties, and thus realizing the ferroelectric memory application in AgCrS2 devices. This work opens new prospects for exploring 2D ferroelectrics and accompanying various ferroelectric functional devices.








Abstract
2D ferroelectric materials have attracted extensive research interest due to potential applications in nonvolatile memory, nanoelectronics and optoelectronics. However, the available 2D ferroelectric materials are scarce and most of them are limited by the uncontrollable preparation. Herein, a novel 2D ferroelectric material AgCrS2 is reported that are controllably synthesized in large&#8208;scale via salt&#8208;assist chemical vapor deposition growth. By tuning the growth temperature from 800 to 900&#160;&#176;C, the thickness of AgCrS2 nanosheets can be precisely modulated from 2.1 to 40&#160;nm. Structural and nonlinear optical characterizations demonstrate that AgCrS2 nanosheet crystallizes in a non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure with high crystallinity and remarkable air stability. As a result, AgCrS2 of various thicknesses display robust ferroelectric polarization in both in&#8208;plane (IP) and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (OOP)&#160;directions with strong intercorrelation and high ferroelectric phase transition temperature (682 K). Theoretical calculations suggest that the ferroelectricity in AgCrS2 originates from the displacement of Ag atoms in AgS4 tetrahedrons, which changes the dipole moment alignment. Moreover, ferroelectric switching is demonstrated in both lateral and vertical AgCrS2 devices, which exhibit exotic nonvolatile memory behavior with distinct high and low resistance states. This study expands the scope of 2D ferroelectric materials and facilitates the ferroelectric&#8208;based nonvolatile memory applications.

Theoretical calculations suggest that the ferroelectricity in AgCrS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; originates from the displacement of Ag atoms in AgS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedrons, which changes the dipole moment alignment. Moreover, ferroelectric switching is demonstrated in both lateral and vertical AgCrS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; devices, which exhibit exotic nonvolatile memory behavior with distinct high and low resistance states. This study expands the scope of 2D ferroelectric materials and facilitates the ferroelectric-based nonvolatile memory applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Strain&#8208;Defects to Enhance Enzymatic Therapy and Induce Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain&#8208;defect engineering is used to design a hollow MMSR&#8208;pS&#8208;PEG nanozyme by modifying MnMoOx with poly (ethylene glycol) grafted phosphorylated serine and loading sorafenib. The oxygen defects induce excellent catalase&#8208;like&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;like catalytic activities, ensuring the disruption of the internal redox balance in tumor cells. Sorafenib restrains the system xc&#8722; and synergistically interacts with GSH depletion to induce ferroptosis.








Abstract
The effect of mimetic enzyme catalysis is often limited by insufficient activity and a single therapy is not sufficient to meet the application requirements. In this study, a multifunctional nanozyme, MMSR&#8208;pS&#8208;PEG, is designed and fabricated by modifying poly (ethylene glycol) grafted phosphorylated serine (pS&#8208;PEG) on mesoporous hollow MnMoOx spheres, followed by loading sorafenib (SRF) into the pores. Strain engineering&#8208;induced oxygen defects endow the nanozyme with enhanced dual&#8208;enzymatic activity to mimic catalase and oxidase&#8208;like activities, which catalyze the conversion of endogenous H2O2 into oxygen and subsequently into superoxide ions in the acidic tumor microenvironment. Moreover, as an n&#8208;type semiconductor, MnMoOx generates reactive oxygen species by separating electrons and holes upon ultrasonic irradiation and simultaneously deplete glutathione by holes, thereby further augmenting its catalytic effect. As a ferroptosis inducer, SRF restrains the system xc&#8722; and indirectly inhibits glutathione synthesis, synergistically interacting with the nanozyme to stimulate ferroptosis by promoting lipid peroxidation and accumulation and the downregulation of glutathione peroxidase 4. These results provide valuable insights into the design of enzymatic therapy with high performance and highlight a promising approach for the synergism of ferroptosis and enzymatic tumor therapy.

         <title>Multiple Defect&#8208;Induced High&#8208;Resolution Near&#8208;Infrared Mechanoluminescent Materials for Non&#8208;Destructive Detection of Blood Glucose and Lipids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical co&#8208;substitution method of [Si4++Mg2+] &#8594; [Ga3++Ga3+] is used to achieve continuous defect distribution. Combined with Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the impact of different defect types on electronic structure is discussed in detail, and the potential application of broadband NIR ML in non&#8208;destructive detection technology is explored.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence (ML) materials, known for their ability to convert mechanical energy into light, are increasingly recognized for their potential applications, such as in intelligent stress sensing, in vivo bioimaging, and stress non&#8208;destructive monitoring. However, the low signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) and narrow&#8208;band emission of single&#8208;defect&#8208;induced ML materials usually limit their biological&#8208;related practical applications. Here, these limitations will be addressed by modulating the microstructure evolution in Y3Ga3MgSiO12:Cr3+ through the [Si4++Mg2+] &#8594; [Ga3++Ga3+] chemical substitution strategy. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals the defect types and dynamic charge migration processes. In addition, Y3Ga3MgSiO12: Cr3+ with continuously distributed &#8220;shallow&#8208;deep&#8221; defects (0.68&#8211;1.61&#160;eV) can avoid persistent luminescence (PersL) and bright&#8208;field environment interference. Herein, such high SNR near&#8208;infrared broadband ML emission may provide a reliable way for high&#8208;quality biological non&#8208;destructive sensing and detection. Finally, benefiting from the different absorption of ML signals in glucose/lipid, one may find a novel non&#8208;invasive blood glucose/lipid testing technology in patients.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Proton Channels Constructed via Hierarchical Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors present proton nanochannels prepared by hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of cyclic peptides with transfer rates closely matching those of natural protein channels while maintaining transport over microns. Proton density is controlled by a counter ion doping effect. The span of proton transport allows for their use in energy solutions, biomedicine, and bioelectronics.









Abstract
The quest to understand and mimic proton translocation mechanisms in natural channels has driven the development of peptide&#8208;based artificial channels facilitating efficient proton transport across nanometric membranes. It is demonstrated here that hierarchical peptide self&#8208;assembly can form micrometers&#8208;long proton nanochannels. The fourfold symmetrical peptide design leverages intermolecular aromatic interactions to align self&#8208;assembled cyclic peptide nanotubes, creating hydrophilic nanochannels between them. Titratable amino acid sidechains are positioned adjacent to each other within the channels, enabling the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded chains upon hydration, and facilitating efficient proton transport. Moreover, these chains are enriched with protons and water molecules by interacting with immobile counter ions introduced into the channels, increasing proton flow density and rate. This system maintains proton transfer rates closely resembling those in natural protein channels over micrometer distances. The functional behavior of these inherently recyclable and biocompatible systems opens the door for their exploitation in diverse applications in energy storage and conversion, biomedicine, and bioelectronics.

         <title>Highly Responsive Polar Vortices in All&#8208;Ferroelectric Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polar vortex formation is shown in all&#8208;ferroelectric (PbTiO3)n/(PbxSr1&#8722;xTiO3)n heterostructures wherein the in&#8208;plane polarization of PbxSr1&#8722;xTiO3 provides the required boundary conditions. These superlattices show superior piezoelectric and ferroelectric responses as the polarization in all layers can freely rotate to the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction. In the plane, the layers exhibit strong coupling during switching and show multistate switching when heterostructured with ferroelectric&#8208;dielectric blocks.








Abstract
The discovery of polar vortices and skyrmions in ferroelectric&#8208;dielectric superlattices [such as (PbTiO3)n/(SrTiO3)n] has ushered in an era of novel dipolar topologies and corresponding emergent phenomena. The key to creating such emergent features has generally been considered to be related to counterpoising strongly polar and non&#8208;polar materials thus creating the appropriate boundary conditions. This limits the utility these materials can have, however, by rendering (effectively) half of the structure unresponsive to applied stimuli. Here, using advanced thin&#8208;film deposition and an array of characterization and simulation approaches, polar vortices are realized in all&#8208;ferroelectric trilayers, multilayers, and superlattices built from the fundamental building block of (PbTiO3)n/(PbxSr1&#8722;xTiO3)n wherein in&#8208;plane ferroelectric polarization in the PbxSr1&#8722;xTiO3 provides the appropriate boundary conditions. These superlattices exhibit substantially enhanced electromechanical and ferroelectric responses in the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction that arise from the ability of the polarization in both layers to rotate to the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction under field. In the in&#8208;plane direction, the layers are found to be strongly coupled during switching and when heterostructured with ferroelectric&#8208;dielectric building blocks, it is possible to produce multistate switching. This approach expands the realm of systems supporting emergent dipolar texture formation and does so with entirely ferroelectric materials thus greatly improving their responses.

Here, using advanced thin-film deposition and an array of characterization and simulation approaches, polar vortices are realized in all-ferroelectric trilayers, multilayers, and superlattices built from the fundamental building block of (PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/(Pb&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; wherein in-plane ferroelectric polarization in the Pb&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; provides the appropriate boundary conditions. These superlattices exhibit substantially enhanced electromechanical and ferroelectric responses in the out-of-plane direction that arise from the ability of the polarization in both layers to rotate to the out-of-plane direction under field. In the in-plane direction, the layers are found to be strongly coupled during switching and when heterostructured with ferroelectric-dielectric building blocks, it is possible to produce multistate switching. This approach expands the realm of systems supporting emergent dipolar texture formation and does so with entirely ferroelectric materials thus greatly improving their responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Layered Oxide Cathode Materials with Moderated Interlayer Spacing and Enhanced Kinetics for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy doping strategy is employed to improve structure stability and enhance reaction kinetics of the layered oxide cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The homogeneous stress distribution, moderated interlayer spacing, and suppressed John&#8211;Teller effect of the high&#8208;entropy cathode materials contribute to the improved cycling stability and rate performance.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) with low cost and environmentally friendly features have recently attracted significant attention for renewable energy storage. Sodium layer oxides stand out as a type of promising cathode material for SIBs owing to their high capacity, good rate performance, and high compatibility for manufacturing. However, the poor cycling stability of layer oxide cathodes due to structure distortion greatly impacts their practical applications. Herein, a high entropy doped Cu, Fe, and Mn&#8208;based layered oxide (HE&#8208;CFMO), Na0.95Li0.05Mg0.05Cu0.20Fe0.22Mn0.35Ti0.13O2 for high&#8208;performance SIBs, is designed. The HE&#8208;CFMO cathode possesses high&#8208;entropy transition metal (TM) layers with a homogeneous stress distribution, providing a moderated interlayer spacing to maintain the structure stability and enhance Na+ ion diffusion. In addition, Li doping in TM layers increases the Mn valence state, which effectively suppresses John&#8211;Teller effect, thus stabilizing the layered structure during cycling. Furthermore, the use of nontoxic and low&#8208;cost raw materials benefits future commercialization and reduces the risk of environmental pollution. As a result, the HE&#8208;CFMO cathode exhibits a super cycling performance with a 95% capacity retention after 300 cycles. This work provides a promising strategy to improve the structure stability and reaction kinetics of cathode materials for SIBs.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Cell RNA Sequencing Guided Multienzymatic Hydrogel Design for Self&#8208;Regenerative Repair in Diabetic Mandibular Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing technology, the crucial role of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in suppressing the repolarization of proinflammatory macrophages to anti&#8208;inflammatory macrophages within the diabetic microenvironment is revealed. Consequently, a multienzymatic hydrogel equipped with dual ROS and NO&#8208;scavenging capabilities is meticulously designed, enabling the mandible to regain its self&#8208;regenerative capacity in the diabetic microenvironment.








Abstract
Conventional bone tissue engineering materials struggle to reinstate physiological bone remodeling in a diabetic context, primarily due to the compromised repolarization of proinflammatory macrophages to anti&#8208;inflammatory macrophages. Here, leveraging single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) technology, the pivotal role of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) is unveiled in impeding macrophage repolarization during physiological bone remodeling amidst diabetes. Guided by scRNA&#8208;seq analysis, we engineer a multienzymatic bone tissue engineering hydrogel scaffold (MEBTHS) composed is engineered of methylpropenylated gelatin hydrogel integrated with ruthenium nanozymes, possessing both Ru0 and Ru4+ components. This design facilitates efficient NO elimination via Ru0 while simultaneously exhibiting ROS scavenging properties through Ru4+. Consequently, MEBTHS orchestrates macrophage reprogramming by neutralizing ROS and reversing NO&#8208;mediated mitochondrial metabolism, thereby rejuvenating bone marrow&#8208;derived mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial cells within diabetic mandibular defects, producing newly formed bone with quality comparable to that of normal bone. The scRNA&#8208;seq guided multienzymatic hydrogel design fosters the restoration of self&#8208;regenerative repair, marking a significant advancement in bone tissue engineering.

         <title>The Combination of a Donor&#8211;Acceptor TADF and a MR&#8208;TADF Emitting Core Results in Outstanding Electroluminescence Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>

The ToC illustrates the molecular structure of DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT2 along with a brief overview of the performance of the corresponding OLED. The green and blue&#8208;colored moieties represent the MR&#8208;TADF emitting core and the pendant D&#8211;A TADF shield, respectively.








Abstract
Here the utility and potential of an emitter design are demonstrated, consisting of a narrowband&#8208;emitting multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) core that is decorated with a suitably higher energy donor&#8208;acceptor TADF moiety. Not only does this D&#8211;A TADF group offer additional channels for triplet exciton harvesting and confers faster reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) kinetics but it also acts as a steric shield, insulating the emissive MR&#8208;TADF core from aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. Two emitters, DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT1 and DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT2, demonstrate enhanced photophysical properties leading to outstanding performance of the organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT2, containing a D&#8211;A TADF moiety, has a faster kRISC (1.1&#160;&#215;&#160;105 s&#8722;1) and higher photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;PL: 97%) compared to DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT1 (0.2&#160;&#215;&#160;105 s&#8722;1, &#934;PL: 90%), which contains a D&#8211;A moiety that itself is not TADF. The sensitizer&#8208;free OLEDs with DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT2 achieve a record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 40.2% and showed milder efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE1000 of 20.7%) compared to the DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT1&#8208;based devices (EQEmax of 37.1% and EQE1000 of 11.9%).

         <title>Interstitial Oxygen Acts as Electronic Buffer Stabilizing High&#8208;Entropy Alloys for Trifunctional Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>

The Cr element with strong oxygen affinity can introduce oxygen atoms into the high&#8208;entropy alloy system. Interstitial oxygen acts as an electronic buffer making the binding energy of other metal elements move to a higher level and increasing vacancy formation energies of metal active sites leading to super stability.








Abstract
Understanding the effect of elements&#8217; oxygen affinity is essential for comprehending high&#8208;entropy alloys&#8217; (HEAs) complete properties. However, the origin of HEAs' oxygen&#8208;containing structure and stability remains poorly understood, primarily due to their diverse components, hindering synthesis and analysis. Herein, the O&#8208;doping HEAs (HEA&#8208;O) have demonstrated outstanding performance and stability in electrolyzed water and Zinc&#8211;air batteries which can be reassembled after being stable for more than 1600&#160;h when the zinc consumption is over. The experiment and DFT simulation demonstrate that Cr with strong oxygen affinity can introduce more oxygen into the system of HEAs. Consequently, interstitial oxygens act as electronic buffers making the binding energy of other metal elements move to a higher level. Additionally, O&#8208;doping lowers the d&#8208;band center promoting electrochemical activity and increasing vacancy formation energies of metal active sites leading to super stability. The study provides significant insights into the design and comprehension of interstitial oxygen&#8208;doped HEAs.

Interstitial oxygen acts as an electronic buffer making the binding energy of other metal elements move to a higher level and increasing vacancy formation energies of metal active sites leading to super stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the effect of elements&#8217; oxygen affinity is essential for comprehending high-entropy alloys&#8217; (HEAs) complete properties. However, the origin of HEAs' oxygen-containing structure and stability remains poorly understood, primarily due to their diverse components, hindering synthesis and analysis. Herein, the O-doping HEAs (HEA-O) have demonstrated outstanding performance and stability in electrolyzed water and Zinc&#8211;air batteries which can be reassembled after being stable for more than 1600&#160;h when the zinc consumption is over. The experiment and DFT simulation demonstrate that Cr with strong oxygen affinity can introduce more oxygen into the system of HEAs. Consequently, interstitial oxygens act as electronic buffers making the binding energy of other metal elements move to a higher level. Additionally, O-doping lowers the d-band center promoting electrochemical activity and increasing vacancy formation energies of metal active sites leading to super stability. The study provides significant insights into the design and comprehension of interstitial oxygen-doped HEAs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Azatriangulene&#8208;Based Conductive C&#9552;C Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Near&#8208;Infrared Emission</title>

Knoevenagel condensation of an electron&#8208;rich azatriangulenetricarbaldehyde with arenediacetonitriles produces 2D &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers as crystalline porous Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs). The donor&#8211;acceptor interactions in these polymers lead to a low optical bandgap (1.6&#160;eV) and near&#8208;infrared emission (&gt;750 nm). p&#8208;Doping with magic blue increases the electrical conductivity of the COFs by 8 orders of magnitude, reaching the value of 0.65&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Two near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissive &#960;&#8208;conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) pTANG1 and pTANG2 are synthesized using Knoevenagel condensation of trioxaazatriangulenetricarbaldehyde (TATANG) with benzene&#8208; and biphenyldiacetonitriles, respectively. The morphology of the COFs is affected by the size of TATANG precursor crystals. Donor&#8211;acceptor interactions in these COFs result in small bandgaps (&#8776;1.6&#160;eV) and NIR emission (&#955;max = 789 nm for pTANG1). pTANG1 can absorb up to 9 molecules of water per unit cell, which is accompanied by a marked quenching of the NIR emission, suggesting applications as humidity sensors. p&#8208;Doping with magic blue significantly increases the electrical conductivities of the COFs by up to 8 orders of magnitude, with the room temperature conductivity of pTANG1 reaching 0.65&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, the highest among reported C&#9552;C linked COFs. 1H NMR relaxometry, temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence spectroscopy, and DFT calculations reveal that the higher rigidity of the shorter phenylene linker is responsible for the more extended conjugation (red&#8208;shifted emission, higher electrical conductivity) of pTANG1 compared to pTANG2.

2D Ferroelectric Memory
In article number 2407655, Hua Xu and coworkers present a novel 2D ferroelectric material AgCrS2 synthesized by chemical vapor deposition growth. The 2D AgCrS2 crystal displays robust ferroelectric polarization in both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane directions with strong intercorrelation and high Curie temperature (682 K). Consequently, the 2D AgCrS2 crystal is successfully utilized to construct ferroelectric memory device, demonstrating significant potential for advancing the development of future artificial intelligence (AI).

More details can be found in article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202404514"&gt;2404514&lt;/a&gt; by Daniel Razansky, Metin Sitti, and co-workers.

Endogenous Stem Cell Recruitment
Using the precise programmability of tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNA), Yunfeng Lin, Taoran Tian, and co&#8208;workers introduce a novel strategy for endogenous stem cell enrichment. This strategy employs the MSC&#8208;targeting aptamer Apt19S, optimizing its distribution and topology on tFNA to address challenges like cellular internalization and low affinity, thereby improving MSC binding and capture efficiency. This acellular, regenerative platform holds great potential for various clinical applications in tissue regeneration. More details can be found in article number 2406118.

         <title>All&#8208;Aqueous Embedded 3D Printing for Freeform Fabrication of Biomimetic 3D Constructs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores recent progress in freeform fabrication of 3D biomimetic constructs via all&#8208;aqueous embedded 3D printing. The fundamental properties of all&#8208;aqueous system, the key influences on printing stability and shape fidelity of biomimetic constructs as well as biomimetic applications are thoroughly discussed, offering insights and future research directions in this field.








Abstract
All&#8208;aqueous embedded 3D printing, which involves extruding inks in an aqueous bath, has emerged as a transformative platform for the freeform fabrication of 3D constructs with precise control. The use of a supporting bath not only enables the printing of arbitrarily designed 3D constructs but also broadens ink selection for various soft matters, advancing the wide application of this technology. This review focuses on recent progress in the freeform preparation of 3D constructs using all&#8208;aqueous embedded 3D printing. It begins by discussing the significance of ultralow interfacial tension in all&#8208;liquid embedded printing and highlights the fundamental concepts and properties of all&#8208;aqueous system. The review then introduces recent advances in all&#8208;aqueous embedded 3D printing and clarifies the key factors affecting printing stability and shape fidelity, aiming to guide expansion and assessment of emerging printing systems used for various representative applications. Furthermore, it proposes the potential scope and applications of this technology, including in vitro models, cytomimetic microreactors, and soft ionic electronics. Finally, the review discusses the challenges facing current all&#8208;aqueous embedded 3D printing and offers future perspectives on possible improvements and developments.

         <title>Charge Generation and Enhancement of Key Components of Triboelectric Nanogenerators: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review classifies and summarizes innovative approaches to enhance the charge density of charge generation, charge trapping, and charge collection layers. The milestone of high charge density TENG is reviewed based on material selection and innovative mechanisms.








Abstract
The past decade has witnessed remarkable progress in high&#8208;performance Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) with the design and synthesis of functional dielectric materials, the exploration of novel dynamic charge transport mechanisms, and the innovative design of architecture, making it one of the most crucial technologies for energy harvesting. High output charge density is fundamental for TENG to expand its application scope and accelerate industrialization; it depends on the dynamic equilibrium of charge generation, trapping, de&#8208;trapping, and migration within its core components. Here, this review classifies and summarizes innovative approaches to enhance the charge density of the charge generation, charge trapping, and charge collection layers. The milestone of high charge density TENG is reviewed based on material selection and innovative mechanisms. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art principles and techniques for generating high charge density and suppressing charge decay are discussed and highlighted in detail, and the distinct charge transport mechanisms, the technologies of advanced materials preparation, and the effective charge excitation strategy are emphatically introduced. Lastly, the bottleneck and future research priorities for boosting the output charge density are summarized. A summary of these cutting&#8208;edge developments intends to provide readers with a deep understanding of the future design of high&#8208;output TENG.

         <title>Engineering of Single&#8208;Atomic Sites for Electro&#8208; and Photo&#8208;Catalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically discusses recent advancements in metal and nonmetal single&#8208;atom sites for the electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;synthesis of H2O2 via the 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction and water oxidation reaction pathways. Comprehensive discussions cover the influence of local physicochemical environments on the electronic structures and catalytic behaviors of isolated sites, the atomic catalytic mechanisms underlying these pathways for H2O2 production, and recent applications of H2O2 in advanced chemical transformations.








Abstract
Direct electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;synthesis of H2O2 through the 2e&#8722; O2 reduction reaction (ORR) and H2O oxidation reaction (WOR) offer promising alternatives for on&#8208;demand and on&#8208;site production of this chemical. Exploring robust and selective active sites is crucial for enhancing H2O2 production through these pathways. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), featuring isolated active sites on supports, possess attractive properties for promoting catalysis and unraveling catalytic mechanisms. This review first systematically summarizes significant advancements in atomic engineering of both metal and nonmetal single&#8208;atom sites for electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;catalytic 2e&#8722; ORR to H2O2, as well as the dynamic behaviors of active sites during catalytic processes. Next, the progress of single&#8208;atom sites in H2O2 production through 2e&#8722; WOR is overviewed. The effects of the local physicochemical environments on the electronic structures and catalytic behaviors of isolated sites, along with the atomic catalytic mechanism involved in these H2O2 production pathways, are discussed in detail. This work also discusses the recent applications of H2O2 in advanced chemical transformations. Finally, a perspective on the development of single&#8208;atom catalysis is highlighted, aiming to provide insights into future research on SACs for electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;synthesis of H2O2 and other advanced catalytic applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the integration of omics technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, with nanomedicine for cancer therapy. Leveraging advanced next&#8208;generation sequencing techniques, it explores how these synergistic approaches enhance diagnostic accuracy, optimize therapeutic strategies, and assess nanomedicine&#8208;mediated biological responses, offering insights into future development in personalized cancer therapy.








Abstract
Cancer nanomedicine has emerged as a promising approach to overcome the limitations of conventional cancer therapies, offering enhanced efficacy and safety in cancer management. However, the inherent heterogeneity of tumors presents increasing challenges for the application of cancer nanomedicine in both diagnosis and treatment. This heterogeneity necessitates the integration of advanced and high&#8208;throughput analytical techniques to tailor nanomedicine strategies to individual tumor profiles. Omics technologies, encompassing genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and more, provide unparalleled insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cancer. By dissecting tumor heterogeneity across multiple levels, these technologies offer robust support for the development of personalized and precise cancer nanomedicine strategies. In this review, the principles, techniques, and applications of key omics technologies are summarized. Especially, the synergistic integration of omics and nanomedicine in cancer therapy is explored, focusing on enhanced diagnostic accuracy, optimized therapeutic strategies and the assessment of nanomedicine&#8208;mediated biological responses. Moreover, this review addresses current challenges and outlines future directions in the field of omics&#8208;enhanced nanomedicine. By offering valuable insights and guidance, this review aims to advance the integration of omics with nanomedicine, ultimately driving improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for cancer.

         <title>Atom Probe Tomography: a Local Probe for Chemical Bonds in Solids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metallic, covalent, and metavalent solids can clearly be distinguished based on their bond bond&#8208;breaking behavior, i.e. their probability of multiple events (PME) and probability of molecular ions (PMI) values. These findings open new avenues in understanding and designing advanced materials since they allow quantification of bonds in solids on a nanometer scale.








Abstract
Atom probe tomography is frequently employed to characterize the elemental distribution in solids with atomic resolution. Here the potential of this technique to locally probe chemical bonds is reviewed and discussed. Two processes characterize the bond rupture in laser&#8208;assisted field emission, the probability of molecular ions (PMI), i.e., the probability that molecular ions are evaporated instead of single (atomic) ions, and the probability of multiple events (PME), i.e., the correlated field&#8208;evaporation of more than a single fragment upon laser&#8208; or voltage pulse excitation. Here it is demonstrated that one can clearly distinguish solids with metallic, covalent, and metavalent bonds based on their bond rupture, i.e., their PME and PMI values. These findings open new avenues in understanding and designing advanced materials, since they allow a quantification of bonds in solids on a nanometer scale, as will be shown for several examples. These possibilities would even justify calling the present approach bonding probe tomography (BPT).

         <title>In&#8208;situ Reconstruction of Catalyst in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;situ reconstruction of the catalyst may lead to an uncontrollable catalytic process. This review summarizes the strategies for achieving targeted reconstruction via various methods, such as structural design, composition engineering, electrolyte selection, and control of electrocatalytic conditions for optimal catalytic performance in electrocatalysis. In addition, the challenging issues and perspectives are given for rationally designing pre&#8208;catalysts.








Abstract
Reconstruction of catalysts is now well recognized as a common phenomenon in electrocatalysis. As the reconstructed structure may promote or hamper the electrochemical performance, how to achieve the designed active surface for highly enhanced catalytic activity through the reconstruction needs to be carefully investigated. In this review, the genesis and electrochemical effects of reconstruction in various electrochemical catalytic processes, such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) are first described. Then, the strategies for optimizing the reconstruction, such as valence states control, active phase retention, phase evolution engineering, and surface poisoning prevention are comprehensively discussed. Finally, the general rules of reconstruction optimization are summarized and give perspectives for future study. It is believed that the review shall provide deep insights into electrocatalytic mechanisms and guide the design of pre&#8208;catalysts with highly improved activity.

Then, the strategies for optimizing the reconstruction, such as valence states control, active phase retention, phase evolution engineering, and surface poisoning prevention are comprehensively discussed. Finally, the general rules of reconstruction optimization are summarized and give perspectives for future study. It is believed that the review shall provide deep insights into electrocatalytic mechanisms and guide the design of pre-catalysts with highly improved activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Charge Carrier Density in Organic Semiconductors Modulates the Effective Capacitance: A Unified View of Electrolyte Gated Organic Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A framework for electrolyte gated organic transistors (EGOTs) that unifies electrolyte&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect transistors (EGOFETs) with organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is proposed. The effective capacitance that drives the device response arises from in series capacitances of device interfaces and the chemical capacitance of the organic semiconductor. The model predicts the shape of the transfer curve of EGOTs (p&#8208;/n&#8208;type and ambipolar).








Abstract
A framework for electrolyte&#8208;gated organic transistors (EGOTs) that unifies the view of interfacial capacitive coupling of electrolyte&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect transistors (EGOFETs) with the volumetric capacitive coupling in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is proposed. The EGOT effective capacitance arises from in&#8208;series capacitances of the electrolyte/gate electrode and electrolyte/channel interfaces, and the chemical capacitance of the organic semiconductor channel whose weight with respect to the interfacial capacitance is modulated by the charge carrier density, hence by the gate voltage. The expression for chemical capacitance is derived from the DOS of the organic semiconductor, which it is assumed to exhibit exponential energy disorder in the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. The analytical expression of the EGOT current is assessed on experimental data and shown to accurately predict the shape of the whole transfer curve of an EGOT thus allowing to extract accurate values for the switch&#8208;on voltage and the interfacial transconductance, without assumptions on specific response regime and, in OECT, without invoking the volumetric capacitance. Interestingly, the EGOT model recovers EGOFET and OECT as limit cases and, in the latter case, explicitly represents the volumetric capacitance in terms of the energy disorder and the bandgap of the organic semiconductor.

         <title>Scanning Acousto&#8208;Optoelectric Spectroscopy on a Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Monolayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining time&#8208;resolved optical spectroscopy and surface acoustic waves provide a powerful tool for investigating charge carrier dynamics in 2D materials. When interacting with the 2D semiconductor WSe2, dynamic acoustic Poole&#8211;Frenkel activation of traps enhances the optical emission efficiency. The sub&#8208;nanosecond modulation of the optical signal serves as a sensitive local probe of defects and charge carrier trapping sites.








Abstract
The charge carrier dynamics are investigated by surface acoustic waves (SAWs) inside a WSe2 monolayer on LiNbO3 by scanning acousto&#8208;optoelectric spectroscopy. A strong enhancement of the PL emission intensity is observed almost over the entire area of the flake. This enhancement increases with increasing amplitude of the wave and is especially strong at or in the vicinity to defects. The latter is attributed to the SAW&#8208;driven Poole&#8211;Frenkel activation of trapped charge carriers bound to trapping sites at these defects. In addition, the PL intensity exhibit clear periodic modulations at the SAW's frequency&#160;fSAW and at 2 fSAW. These modulations are clear and unambiguous fingerprints of spatio&#8208;temporal carrier dynamics driven by the SAW. These occur on sub&#8208;nanosecond timescales which are found in good agreement with calculated exciton dissociation times. Mapping and analyzing both effects, this study shows that scanning acousto&#8208;electric spectroscopy provides a highly sensitive and local contact&#8208;free probe which uncovers distinct local features not resolved by conventional quasi&#8208;static photoluminescence techniques. The method is ideally suited to study carrier transport in 2D and other types of nanoscale materials and to reveal dynamic exciton modulation, and carrier localization and activation dynamics in the technologically important megahertz to gigahertz frequency range.

         <title>Selective Control of Electric Charge of Weyl Fermions in Pyrochlore Iridates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Previous studies about Weyl fermions have mostly focused on the magnetic charges, while the electric charges are rarely explored. This work reports an intriguing linear scaling relationship between the anomalous Hall conductivity and Hall carrier density in strained Nd2Ir2O7 thin films, which points to the essential role of correlation between magnetic and electric charges in Weyl fermions.








Abstract
Weyl fermions can exhibit exotic phenomena due to their magnetic charge in momentum space, while Weyl nodes are usually located away from Fermi energy, which forms electron or hole pockets as the electric charges. Previous studies have mostly focused on the magnetic charge, however, the electric charges are rarely explored. Here, the intriguing Hall responses arising from the interplay between magnetic and electric charges of Weyl fermions in pyrochlore iridates are reported. Explicitly, unexpected linear scaling is observed between the anomalous Hall conductivity and Hall carrier density in strained Nd2Ir2O7 thin films, and its slope shows a sign change approaching the N&#233;el temperature of Nd. Theoretical calculations unveil that the cluster magnetic multipoles induce local energy inversion of Weyl nodes, which alters the electric charge of Weyl fermions and accounts for the observed nontrivial Hall responses. Moreover, the correlation between the magnetic and electric charges is further probed by voltage&#8208;controlled hydrogenation, which leads to the suppression of the anomalous Hall effect through electron filling. This work not only reveals the essential role of the both magnetic and electric charges of Weyl fermions, but also demonstrates the hydrogenation as an effective tuning knob in exploring correlated topological properties.

         <title>Measurement of Enhanced Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling Strength for Donor&#8208;Bound Electron Spins in Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significant enhancement in spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) within multi&#8208;donor silicon quantum dots is demonstrated, showing SOC strengths up to 40 &#181;eV, surpassing previous benchmarks by two orders of magnitude. This advancement paves the way for precise all&#8208;electrical control of donor&#8208;bound spins and improved coupling to superconducting resonators, marking a crucial step forward in quantum computing.








Abstract
While traditionally considered a deleterious effect in quantum dot spin qubits, the spin&#8208;orbit interaction is recently being revisited as it allows for rapid coherent control by on&#8208;chip AC electric fields. For electrons in bulk silicon, spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) is intrinsically weak, however, it can be enhanced at surfaces and interfaces, or through atomic placement. Here it is showed that the strength of the spin&#8208;orbit coupling can be locally enhanced by more than two orders of magnitude in the manybody wave functions of multi&#8208;donor quantum dots compared to a single donor, reaching strengths so far only reported for holes or two&#8208;donor system with certain symmetry. These findings may provide a pathway toward all&#8208;electrical control of donor&#8208;bound spins in silicon using electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR).

         <title>Atomic Dispersed Co on NC@Cu Core&#8208;Shells for Solar Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8208;shell photocatalyst comprising atomic&#8208;dispersed Co and plasmonic Cu nanoparticles is developed for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production from seawater. This photocatalyst achieves strong synergy between the reaction environment, broad light absorption, plasmonic electric field, and active atomic sites, thereby enabling optimal seawater hydrogen production through redox reactions.








Abstract
With freshwater resources becoming increasingly scarce, the photocatalytic seawater splitting for hydrogen production has garnered widespread attention. In this study, a novel photocatalyst consisting of a Cu core coated is introduced with N&#8208;doped C and decorated with single Co atoms (Co&#8208;NC@Cu) for solar to hydrogen production from seawater.

&lt;p&gt;A core-shell photocatalyst comprising atomic-dispersed Co and plasmonic Cu nanoparticles is developed for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production from seawater. This photocatalyst achieves strong synergy between the reaction environment, broad light absorption, plasmonic electric field, and active atomic sites, thereby enabling optimal seawater hydrogen production through redox reactions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With freshwater resources becoming increasingly scarce, the photocatalytic seawater splitting for hydrogen production has garnered widespread attention. In this study, a novel photocatalyst consisting of a Cu core coated is introduced with N-doped C and decorated with single Co atoms (Co-NC@Cu) for solar to hydrogen production from seawater. This catalyst, without using noble metals or sacrificial agents, demonstrates superior hydrogen production effficiency of 9080 &#181;molg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e., 4.78% solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency, and exceptional long-term stability, operating over 340&#160;h continuously. The superior performance is attributed to several key factors. First, the focus-light induced photothermal effect enhances redox reaction capabilities, while the salt-ions enabled charge polarization around catalyst surfaces extends charge carrier lifetime. Furthermore, the Co&#9472;NC@Cu exhibits excellent broad light absorption, promoting photoexcited charge production. Theoretical calculations reveal that Co&#9472;NC acts as the active site, showing low energy barriers for reduction reactions. Additionally, the formation of a strong surface electric field from the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Cu nanoparticles further reduces energy barriers for redox reactions, improving seawater splitting activity.

         <title>A Strategy Involving Microporous Microneedles Integrated with CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Macrophages for Scar Management by Regulating Fibrotic Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;macrophages (CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms) capable of targeting DPP4+ fibroblasts and modulating ECs subtype within the scar microenvironment are engineered to effectively prevent scarring. Hydrogel microporous microneedles (mMNs) are employed to deliver CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms, which can effectively alleviate scar. The study demonstrates that mMNs attached to CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms may exert vital influences on skin scarring, providing a promising approach for treating posttraumatic scarring.








Abstract
Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) positive fibroblasts play a pivotal role in scar development following skin injury. Heterogeneous vascular endothelial cells (ECs) within scarred areas retain the capacity to drive tissue regeneration and repair. Simultaneously, TREM2 macrophages play a crucial role in the progression and resolution of fibrosis by engaging in mutual regulation with ECs. However, effective strategies to inhibit scar formation through multi&#8208;factor regulation of the scar microenvironment remain a challenge. Here, CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;macrophages (CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms) capable of targeting DPP4+ fibroblasts and modulating ECs subtype within the scar microenvironment are engineered to effectively prevent scarring. Hydrogel microporous microneedles (mMNs) are employed to deliver CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms, which can effectively alleviate scar. Single&#8208;cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) analysis reveals that CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms can modify ECs fibrotic phenotype and regulate fibrosis by suppressing the profibrotic gene leucine&#8208;rich&#8208;alpha&#8208;2&#8208;glycoprotein 1 (Lrg1). In vitro experiments further demonstrate that CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms improve the scar microenvironment by phagocytosing DPP4+ fibroblasts and suppressing TGF&#946; secretion. This, in turn, inhibits the phenotypic conversion of LRG1 ECs and provides multifactorial way of alleviating scars. This study uncovers the evidence that mMNs attached to CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms may exert vital influences on skin scarring through the regulation of the skin scar microenvironment, providing a promising approach for treating posttraumatic scarring.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Healing, Flowable, Yet Solid Electrolyte Suppresses Li&#8208;Metal Morphological Instabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries encounter challenges including dendrite penetration, electrode&#8211;electrolyte delamination, and void/crack formation. Here, by deploying a novel composite electrolyte system comprising nonconstrained ceramics within dynamic polymers, self&#8208;healing capability, flowability, and solid properties are successfully integrated into one material. Utilizing this electrolyte, the Li0&#8208;NMC811 full cell demonstrates stable operation at high current density (5 mA cm&#8722;2) for 1100 cycles.








Abstract
Lithium metal (Li0) solid&#8208;state batteries encounter implementation challenges due to dendrite formation, side reactions, and movement of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface in cycling. Notably, voids and cracks formed during battery fabrication/operation are hot spots for failure. Here, a self&#8208;healing, flowable yet solid electrolyte composed of mobile ceramic crystals embedded in a reconfigurable polymer network is reported. This electrolyte can auto&#8208;repair voids and cracks through a two&#8208;step self&#8208;healing process that occurs at a fast rate of 5.6&#160;&#181;m h&#8722;1. A dynamical phase diagram is generated, showing the material can switch between liquid and solid forms in response to external strain rates. The flowability of the electrolyte allows it to accommodate the electrode volume change during Li0 stripping. Simultaneously, the electrolyte maintains a solid form with high tensile strength (0.28&#160;MPa), facilitating the regulation of mossy Li0 deposition. The chemistries and kinetics are studied by operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray and in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Solid&#8208;state NMR reveals a dual&#8208;phase ion conduction pathway and rapid Li+ diffusion through the stable polymer&#8208;ceramic interphase. This designed electrolyte exhibits extended cycling life in Li0&#8211;Li0 cells, reaching 12&#160;000 h at 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 5000 h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, owing to its high critical current density of 9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the Li0&#8211;LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) full cell demonstrates stable cycling at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 1100 cycles, retaining 88% of its capacity, even under near&#8208;zero stack pressure conditions.

         <title>Pulling the Rug Out from Under: Biomechanical Microenvironment Remodeling for Induction of Hepatic Stellate Cell Quiescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In HSCs, PPNH&#8208;LQs trigger ascorbic acid oxidation and LOXL2 expression inhibition (Gear I). These effects impair processes of collagen I hydroxylation and enzyme&#8208;mediated crosslinking, leading to the impeded deposition and crosslinking of collagen I (Gear II). Consequently, the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment can be remodeled and subsequently induce HSC quiescence, which facilitates the reversal of hepatic fibrosis (Gear III).








Abstract
Hepatic fibrosis progresses concomitantly with a variety of biomechanical alternations, especially increased liver stiffness. These biomechanical alterations have long been considered as pathological consequences. Recently, growing evidence proposes that these alternations result in the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment, which drives the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Here, an inorganic ascorbic acid&#8208;oxidase (AAO) mimicking nanozyme loaded with liquiritigenin (LQ) is developed to trigger remodeling of the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment. The AAO mimicking nanozyme is able to consume intracellular ascorbic acid, thereby impeding collagen I deposition by reducing its availability. Simultaneously, LQ inhibits the transcription of lysyl oxidase like 2 (LOXL2), thus impeding collagen I crosslinking. Through its synergistic activities, the prepared nanosystem efficiently restores the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment to a near&#8208;normal physiological condition, promoting the quiescence of HSCs and regression of fibrosis. This strategy of remodeling the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment, akin to &#8220;pulling the rug out from under&#8221;, effectively treats hepatic fibrosis in mice, thereby highlighting the importance of tissue biomechanics and providing a potential approach to improve hepatic fibrosis treatment.

3D&#8208;printed soft multifunctional composites enhance thermoelectric energy conversion by 70%. These stretchable thermoelectric generators exhibit exceptional structural robustness and damage tolerance, with 230% stretchability and functionality maintained even after being damaged by sharp objects and strained for thousands of cycles. Their 3D architecture also enables sufficient energy harvesting from body heat to power LEDs and wearable sensors at room temperature.








Abstract
Flexible thermoelectric devices (TEDs) exhibit adaptability to curved surfaces, holding significant potential for small&#8208;scale power generation and thermal management. However, they often compromise stretchability, energy conversion, or robustness, thus limiting their applications. Here, the implementation of 3D soft architectures, multifunctional composites, self&#8208;healing liquid metal conductors, and rigid semiconductors is introduced to overcome these challenges. These TEDs are extremely stretchable, functioning at strain levels as high as 230%. Their unique design, verified through multiphysics simulations, results in a considerably high power density of 115.4&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8315;2 at a low&#8208;temperature gradient of 10&#160;&#176;C. This is achieved through 3D printing multifunctional elastomers and examining the effects of three distinct thermal insulation infill ratios (0%, 12%, and 100%) on thermoelectric energy conversion and structural integrity. The engineered structure is lighter and effectively maintains the temperature gradient across the thermoelectric semiconductors, thereby resulting in higher output voltage and improved heating and cooling performance. Furthermore, these thermoelectric generators show remarkable damage tolerance, remaining fully functional even after multiple punctures and 2000 stretching cycles at 50% strain. When integrated with a 3D&#8208;printed heatsink, they can power wearable sensors, charge batteries, and illuminate LEDs by scavenging body heat at room temperature, demonstrating their application as self&#8208;sustainable electronics.

         <title>Triggering Reversible Intercalation&#8208;Conversion Combined Chemistry for High&#8208;Energy&#8211;Density Lithium Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing both intercalation and conversion mechanisms within a single phase represents an optimal approach for achieving high energy density in cathode materials. For the purposes of reversible operation and achieving a high redox voltage, the amorphization process is proposed as a strategic design method for cathode materials. The influence of amorphization on electrode materials is meticulously confirmed in thermodynamics and kinetics.








Abstract
Combining intercalation and conversion reactions maximizes the utilization of redox&#8208;active elements in electrodes, providing a means for overcoming the current capacity ceiling. However, integrating both mechanisms within a single electrode material presents significant challenges owing to their contrasting structural requirements. Intercalation requires a well&#8208;defined host structure for efficient lithium&#8208;ion diffusion, whereas conversion reactions entail structural reorganization, which can undermine intercalation capabilities. Based on the previous study that successfully demonstrated reversible intercalation&#8211;conversion chemistry in amorphous LiFeSO4F, this study aims to provide an in&#8208;depth understanding on how this can be enabled. Experimental and theoretical investigations of a model system based on tavorite&#8208;structured LiFeSO4F revealed that amorphization governs the activation and reversibility of the combined reactions. Enhanced reversibility is achieved through the facile migration of transition metals within the amorphous matrix. Unexpectedly, it is found that amorphization also narrowed the voltage gap between the intercalation and conversion reactions. This voltage&#8208;gap reduction is explained by the thermodynamic metastability of the amorphous phase. The applicability of the approach to other intercalation hosts is further demonstrated, showing that amorphization enables reversible intercalation and conversion. These findings suggest a new strategy that leverages the full potential of intercalation and conversion reactions, introducing new avenues for cathode design.

         <title>Unlocking Intracellular Protein Delivery by Harnessing Polymersomes Synthesized at Microliter Volumes using Photo&#8208;PISA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient intracellular delivery of therapeutic proteins is challenging due to poor cell membrane permeation and endolysosomal entrapment. An oxygen tolerant Photo&#8208;PISA process is reported for the microliter&#8208;scale synthesis of polymersomes that deliver proteins into the cytosol and activate antigen&#8208;presenting cells. This high throughput approach is a highly promising strategy for the screening of early&#8208;stage therapeutic proteins and vaccine antigen candidates.








Abstract
Efficient delivery of therapeutic proteins and vaccine antigens to intracellular targets is challenging due to generally poor cell membrane permeation and endolysosomal entrapment causing degradation. Herein, these challenges are addressed by developing an oxygen&#8208;tolerant photoinitiated polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (Photo&#8208;PISA) process, allowing for the microliter&#8208;scale (10&#160;&#181;L) synthesis of protein&#8208;loaded polymersomes directly in 1536&#8208;well plates. High&#8208;resolution techniques capable of analysis at a single particle level are employed to analyze protein encapsulation and release mechanisms. Using confocal microscopy and super&#8208;resolution stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) imaging, their ability to deliver proteins into the cytosol following endosomal escape is subsequently visualized. Lastly, the adaptability of these polymersomes is exploited to encapsulate and deliver a prototype vaccine antigen, demonstrating its ability to activate antigen&#8208;presenting cells and support antigen cross&#8208;presentation for applications in subunit vaccines and cancer immunotherapy. This combination of ultralow volume synthesis and efficient intracellular delivery holds significant promise for unlocking the high throughput screening of a broad range of otherwise cost&#8208;prohibitive or early&#8208;stage therapeutic protein and vaccine antigen candidates that can be difficult to obtain in large quantities. The versatility of this platform for rapid screening of intracellular protein delivery can result in significant advancements across the fields of nanomedicine and biomedical engineering.

         <title>Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte in Li&#8208;Mediated Nitrogen Reduction for Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates LHCE (localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte) as an effective electrolyte engineering strategy to enhance the efficiency of the Li&#8208;NRR process.








Abstract
The lithium&#8208;mediated nitrogen reduction reaction (Li&#8208;NRR) is a promising green alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for ammonia synthesis. The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for high efficiency and stability, as it regulates reactant diffusion and suppresses side reactions. The SEI properties are greatly influenced by the Li+ ion solvation structure, which is controllable through electrolyte engineering. Although anion&#8208;derived SEI enhances selectivity and stability, it has typically been engineered using high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (HCEs), which face mass transfer, viscosity, and cost issues. In this study, a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) in the Li&#8208;NRR is first introduced, enabling the formation of anion&#8208;derived SEI in a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LCE) by enhancing the Li&#8211;anion coordination using an antisolvent. Among various antisolvents, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE) achieves the highest ammonia Faradaic efficiency (73.6 &#177; 2.5%), more than double that of the LCE (34.3 &#177; 2.8%) and exceeding the HCE (56.0 &#177; 2.8%). Systematic calculations and experimental analyses show that the LHCE exhibits anion&#8208;rich solvation structures and forms&#160;thin, inorganic SEI. Moreover, the LHCE has advantages of low viscosity and high N2 solubility, which facilitate mass transport. This study suggests the application of LHCE as an effective electrolyte engineering strategy to enhance the Li&#8208;NRR efficiency.

         <title>Strong Silkworm Silk Fibers through CNT&#8208;Feeding and Forced Reeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A natural silkworm silk exhibiting strength of &#8776;1.2 GPa, on par with spider silk, has been developed through the integration of carbon nanotube feeding and in situ forced reeling. This method significantly enhances the &#946;&#8208;sheet nanocrystal content and alignment within silk, resulting in notable mechanical improvements. This work presents a scalable and eco&#8208;friendly approach for producing high&#8208;strength natural fibers.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance silk fibers, with their eco&#8208;friendly degradability and renewability, have long captivated researchers as an alternative to synthetic fibers. Spider dragline silk, renowned for its exceptional strength (&gt;1 GPa), has an extremely low yield, hindering its widespread use. While domesticated silkworms (Bombyx mori) can produce silk fibers industrially, their moderate strength (&#8776;0.5 GPa) pales in comparison to the formidable spider dragline silk. In this study, naturally produced strong silkworm silk fibers are reported with a tensile strength of &#8776;1.2 GPa achieved through combining feeding carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to silkworms and in situ forced reeling for alignment. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm the interaction between the CNTs and silk fibroin, while the forced reeling process aligns these reinforcing fillers and the silk fibroin &#946;&#8208;sheet nanocrystals along the fiber axis. Structural analysis reveals a significant enhancement in the content and alignment of &#946;&#8208;sheet nanocrystals within the silk fibers, accounting for their superior mechanical properties, including tensile strength of &#8776;1.2 GPa and Young's modulus of 24.4 GPa, surpassing various types of silkworm silk and spider silk. This advancement addresses the historical trade&#8208;off between the strength and scalability of silk, potentially paving the way for eco&#8208;friendly, biodegradable, and renewable alternatives to synthetic fibers in a variety of applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-performance silk fibers, with their eco-friendly degradability and renewability, have long captivated researchers as an alternative to synthetic fibers. Spider dragline silk, renowned for its exceptional strength (&amp;gt;1 GPa), has an extremely low yield, hindering its widespread use. While domesticated silkworms (&lt;i&gt;Bombyx mori&lt;/i&gt;) can produce silk fibers industrially, their moderate strength (&#8776;0.5 GPa) pales in comparison to the formidable spider dragline silk. In this study, naturally produced strong silkworm silk fibers are reported with a tensile strength of &#8776;1.2 GPa achieved through combining feeding carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to silkworms and in situ forced reeling for alignment. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm the interaction between the CNTs and silk fibroin, while the forced reeling process aligns these reinforcing fillers and the silk fibroin &#946;-sheet nanocrystals along the fiber axis. Structural analysis reveals a significant enhancement in the content and alignment of &#946;-sheet nanocrystals within the silk fibers, accounting for their superior mechanical properties, including tensile strength of &#8776;1.2 GPa and Young's modulus of 24.4 GPa, surpassing various types of silkworm silk and spider silk. This advancement addresses the historical trade-off between the strength and scalability of silk, potentially paving the way for eco-friendly, biodegradable, and renewable alternatives to synthetic fibers in a variety of applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Electroluminescence from Organic Fluorophore&#8208;Containing Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In light&#8208;emitting diodes using an organic fluorophore&#8208;containing 2D perovskite as the emitter, carrier transport, and exciton formation take place in the metal halide sheets. Then, the bright triplet excitons formed in the metal halide sheets are transferred to singlet states of the organic fluorophores. With these processes, efficient electroluminescence is observed from the organic fluorophores inside the perovskite.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional perovskites containing an organic fluorophore can be a unique emitter for light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of fluorophore&#8208;containing perovskite LEDs reported thus far are still very low. In this study, these are able to boost the EQE to &#8776;10% by choosing an organic fluorophore with appropriate energy levels for the perovskite structure organization. In the fluorophore&#8208;containing perovskite LEDs, carrier transport and exciton formation take place in the perovskite's metal halide framework, thereby avoiding the direct formation of nonradiative triplet excitons on the organic fluorophores. Subsequently, the bright triplet excitons formed in the metal halide framework are transferred to form the radiative singlet states of the organic fluorophores, leading to efficient electroluminescence (EL) from the organic fluorophores regularly dispersed inside the perovskite structure. Unexpectedly higher light&#8208;outcoupling efficiency, which is caused by the light scattering in the polycrystalline perovskite layer, will be another reason for efficient EL. These findings will contribute toward the fabrication of LED&#8208;based products with high performance at a low cost.

         <title>Highly Reversible Zn Anode Design Through Oriented ZnO(002) Facets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnO(002) lattice plane with low lattice mismatch to Zn(002) endows fast ion diffusion, high Coulombic efficiency, and uniform Zn deposition, while ZnO(100) plane tends to exacerbate dendrite growth and provoke unwanted side reactions compared to bare Zn. Therefore, ZnO(002) protection layer on Zn realizes more stable performance for Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The practical implementation of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries presents formidable hurdles, including uncontrolled dendrite growth, water&#8208;induced side reactions, suboptimal Zn metal utilization, and intricate Zn anode manufacturing. Here, large&#8208;scale construction of a highly oriented ZnO(002) lattice plane on Zn anode (ZnO(002)@Zn) with thermodynamic inertia and kinetic zincophilicity is designed to address such problems. Both theoretical calculations and experiment results elucidate that the ZnO(002)@Zn possesses high Zn chemical affinity, hydrogen evolution reaction suppression, and dendrite&#8208;free deposition ability due to the abundant lattice oxygen species in ZnO(002) and its low lattice mismatch with Zn(002). These features synergistically promote ion transport and enable homogeneous Zn deposition. Consequently, the ZnO(002)@Zn anode displays a stable and prolonged cycling lifespan exceeding 500&#160;h even under a larger depth of discharge (85.6%) and realizes an impressive average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7%. Moreover, its efficacy is also evident in V2O5&#8208;cathode coin cells and pouch cells with not only high discharge capacity but also exceptional cycling stability. This integrated approach presents a promising avenue for addressing the challenges associated with Zn metal anodes, thereby advancing the prospects of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery technologies.

         <title>Efficient and Ultrastable Seawater Electrolysis at Industrial Current Density with Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction and Dual Cl&#8722;&#8208;Repelling Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing a novel Os&#8208;Ni4Mo/MoO2 micropillar catalyst with strong metal&#8208;support interaction, this work presents a high&#8208;performance bifunctional electrocatalyst for seawater electrolysis. It highlights the innovative dual Cl&#8722;&#8208;repelling layer to suppress chloride oxidation, significantly enhancing stability and catalytic activity, representing a revolutionary advancement in catalyst development for seawater electrolysis.








Abstract
Direct seawater electrolysis is emerging as a promising renewable energy technology for large&#8208;scale hydrogen generation. The development of Os&#8208;Ni4Mo/MoO2 micropillar arrays with strong metal&#8208;support interaction (MSI) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for seawater electrolysis is reported. The micropillar structure enhances electron and mass transfer, extending catalytic reaction steps and improving seawater electrolysis efficiency. Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that the strong MSI between Os and Ni4Mo/MoO2 optimizes the surface electronic structure of the catalyst, reducing the reaction barrier and thereby improving catalytic activity. Importantly, for the first time, a dual Cl&#8722; repelling layer is constructed by electrostatic force to safeguard active sites against Cl&#8722; attack during seawater oxidation. This includes a strong Os&#9472;Cl adsorption and an in situ&#8208;formed MoO42&#8722; layer. As a result, the Os&#8208;Ni4Mo/MoO2 catalyst exhibits an ultralow overpotential of 113 and 336&#160;mV to reach 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for HER and OER in natural seawater from the South China Sea (without purification, with 1&#160;m KOH added). Notably, it demonstrates superior stability, degrading only 0.37 &#181;V h&#8722;1 after 2500 h of seawater oxidation, significantly surpassing the technical target of 1.0 &#181;V h&#8722;1 set by the United States Department of Energy.

         <title>Boolean Computation in Single&#8208;Transistor Neuron</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates an in situ reconfigurable &#8220;computing neuron&#8221; prototype with wafer&#8208;scale fabrication distinguished from a widespread collapsed integrator artificial neuron. The ambipolar nature can be further adapted to construct highly efficient soft&#8208;XOR&#8208;based neural networks.








Abstract
Brain neurons exhibit far more sophisticated and powerful information&#8208;processing capabilities than the simple integrators commonly modeled in neuromorphic computing. A biological neuron can in fact efficiently perform Boolean algebra, including linear nonseparable operations. Traditional logic circuits require more than a dozen transistors combined as NOT, AND, and OR gates to implement XOR. Lacking biological competency, artificial neural networks require multilayered solutions to exercise XOR operation. Here, it is shown that a single&#8208;transistor neuron, harnessing the intrinsic ambipolarity of graphene and ionic filamentary dynamics, can enable in situ reconfigurable multiple Boolean operations from linear separable to linear nonseparable in an ultra&#8208;compact design. By leveraging the spatiotemporal integration of inputs, bio&#8208;realistic spiking&#8208;dependent Boolean computation is fully realized, rivaling the efficiency of a human brain. Furthermore, a soft&#8208;XOR&#8208;based neural network via algorithm&#8208;hardware co&#8208;design, showcasing substantial performance improvement, is demonstrated. These results demonstrate how the artificial neuron, in the ultra&#8208;compact form of a single transistor, may function as a powerful platform for Boolean operations. These findings are anticipated to be a starting point for implementing more sophisticated computations at the individual transistor neuron level, leading to super&#8208;scalable neural networks for resource&#8208;efficient brain&#8208;inspired information processing.

         <title>Responsive Magnetic Particle Imaging Tracer: Overcoming &#8220;Always&#8208;On&#8221; Limitation, Eliminating Interference, and Ensuring Safety in Adaptive Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This responsive MPI tracer for subtraction&#8208;enhanced MPI imaging, accurate molecular imaging, and environment&#8208;adaptive therapy, offers the potential to maximize therapeutic outcomes and minimize side effects. This technique effectively eliminates interference signals originating from non&#8208;specific liver uptake.








Abstract
Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) has emerged as a novel technology utilizing superparamagnetic nanoparticles as tracers, essential for disease diagnosis and treatment guidance in preclinical animal models. Unlike other modalities, MPI provides high sensitivity, deep tissue penetration, and no signal attenuation. However, existing MPI tracers suffer from &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; signals, which complicate organ&#8208;specific imaging and hinder accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a responsive MPI tracer using pH&#8208;responsive PdFe alloy particles coated with a gatekeeper polymer. This tracer exhibits pH&#8208;sensitive Fe release and modulation of the MPI signal, enabling selective imaging with a higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and intratumoral pH quantification. Notably, this responsive tracer facilitates subtraction&#8208;enhanced MPI imaging, effectively eliminating interference from liver uptake and expanding the scope of abdominal imaging. Additionally, the tracer employs a dual&#8208;function mechanism for adaptive cancer therapy, combining pH&#8208;switchable enzyme&#8208;like catalysis with dual&#8208;key co&#8208;activation of ROS generation, and Pd skeleton that scavenges free radicals to minimize Fe&#8208;related toxicity. This advancement promises to significantly expand MPI's applicability in diagnostics and therapeutic monitoring, marking a leap forward in imaging technology.

         <title>A Metalgel with Liquid Metal Continuum Immobilized in Polymer Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a new liquid metal&#8208;polymer gel material termed &#8220;metalgel&#8221;. The 92.40% vol interconnected liquid metal expands throughout the whole volume of 3D polymer networks with polymer domain size down to nanometer scale. Liquid metal is stably immobilized in metalgel via electrostatic interactions. Metalgel exhibits ultrahigh electrical conductivity (up to 3.18 &#215; 106 S&#183;m&#8722;1) and tissue&#8208;like softness (Young's modulus as low as 70 kPa).








Abstract
Gels are formed by fluids that expand throughout the whole volume of 3D polymer networks. To unlock unprecedented properties, exploring new fluids immobilized in polymer networks is crucial. Here, a new liquid metal&#8208;polymer gel material termed &#8220;metalgel&#8221; is introduced via fluid replacement strategy, featuring 92.40%&#160;vol liquid metal fluid as a continuum immobilized by interconnected nanoscale polymer network. The unique structure endows metalgel with high electrical conductivity (up to 3.18&#160;&#215;&#160;106 S&#183;m&#8210;1), tissue&#8208;like softness (Young's modulus as low as 70&#160;kPa), and low gas permeability (4.50&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8210;22&#160;m2&#183;s&#8210;1&#183;Pa&#8210;1). Besides, metalgel demonstrates electrical stability under extreme deformations, such as being run over by a 4.5&#8208;metric&#8208;tonne truck, and maintains its integrity in various environments for up to 180 days. The immobilization of high&#8208;volume&#8208;fraction liquid metal fluid is realized by electrostatic interactions is further revealed. Potential applications for metalgel are diverse and include soft electromagnetic shielding, hermetic sealing, and stimulating/sensing electrodes in implantable bioelectronics, underscoring its broad applicability.

         <title>Instantaneous Tiltmeter Triggered by Dynamic Wetting Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic motion of liquid metal in a wheat awn modeled microchannel induces high precision tiltmeter, which realizes surface topography scanning after being equipped with three dimensions platform.








Abstract
A novel instantaneous tiltmeter with dynamic and static monitoring functions is reported that is based on liquid metal dynamic wetting behavior in a bio&#8208;fabricated anisotropic microchannel. The proposed system achieves instantaneous tiltmeter functionality, offering a broad detection range (&#8722;90&#176;&#8211;90&#176;) with high precision (0.05&#176;), a rapid reaction time (0.11 s), and enhanced durability. Moreover, a seamless integration has enabled water wave detection, language programming, and human limb monitoring. Especially, the integration of tiltmeter and a 3D motion platform results in a surface structure scanning system capable of effectively performing large area (&gt;200 cm2) and height difference scanning functions. This innovative approach holds great potential for transformative changes in the fields of advanced manufacturing, flexible robotics, and the flexible sensing, further facilitating widespread adoption.

The ether/ketonic&#8208;oxygen and Lewis&#8208;acid sites contribute to a high ionic conductivity (5.7 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1) and Li+ transference number (0.84). A 1.5 Ah pouch cell with an areal capacity of &#8776;4 mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 delivers a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density of 446&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
Utilizing solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) in high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;metal batteries is a promising strategy for achieving high energy density and safety. However, the SPEs face the challenges such as undesirable mechanical strength, low ionic conductivity and incompatible high&#8208;voltage interface. Here, a novel crosslinked poly(ether&#8208;urethane)&#8208;based SPE with a molecular cross&#8208;linked structure is fabricated to create high&#8208;throughput Li+ transport pathway. The amino&#8208;modified Zr&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (ZrMOF) are introduced as multisite cross&#8208;linking nodes and polymer chain extenders. The abundant ether/ketonic&#8208;oxygen and Lewis acid sites in the SPE achieve high Li+ conductivity (5.7 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C) and Li+ transference number (0.84). The interpenetrating cross&#8208;linked structure of SPE with robust mechanical strength results in a record cycle life of 8000&#160;h in Li||Li symmetric cell. The high structural stability of ZrMOF and abundant electron&#8208;withdrawing urethane/ureido groups in the SPE with high oxidation potential (5.1&#160;V) enables a discharge capacity of 182 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.3 C over 500 cycles in a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||Li cell. Remarkably, a high energy density of 446&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 in a 1.5&#8208;Ah pouch cell is obtained with high loading cathode (&#8776;4 mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), demonstrating a great prospect of the current SPE for practical application in solid&#8208;state, high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Semiconductor Device Enabling Optoelectronic Detection and Neuromorphic Processing with Extended Spectral Responsivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance dual&#8208;mode device is developed using a PbS/Si hybrid heterojunction with an ultra&#8208;thin Al2O3 passivation layer, enabling both optoelectronic detection and neuromorphic operation. In mode 1, it achieves ultra&#8208;wide spectral response and reproduces high&#8208;quality 256&#160;&#215;&#160;256 pixel images. In mode 2, it acts as a neuromorphic device, achieving 96.5% accuracy in classifying standard digits.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance semiconductor devices capable of multiple functions are pivotal in meeting the challenges of miniaturization and integration in advanced technologies. Despite the inherent difficulties of incorporating dual functionality within a single device, a high&#8208;performance, dual&#8208;mode device is reported. This device integrates an ultra&#8208;thin Al2O3 passivation layer with a PbS/Si hybrid heterojunction, which can simultaneously enable optoelectronic detection and neuromorphic operation. In mode 1, the device efficiently separates photo&#8208;generated electron&#8208;hole pairs, exhibiting an ultra&#8208;wide spectral response from ultraviolet (265&#160;nm) to near&#8208;infrared (1650&#160;nm) wavelengths. It also reproduces high&#8208;quality images of 256&#160;&#215;&#160;256 pixels, achieving a Q&#8208;value as low as 0.00437&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a light intensity of 8.58&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2. Meanwhile, when in mode 2, the as&#8208;assembled device with typical persistent photoconductivity (PPC) behavior can act as a neuromorphic device, which can achieve 96.5% accuracy in classifying standard digits underscoring its efficacy in temporal information processing. It is believed that the present dual&#8208;function devices potentially advance the multifunctionality and miniaturization of chips for intelligence applications.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Mediated Organic Neurohybrid Synapses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic artificial synapse interacts with non&#8208;electroactive neurotransmitters present in the central nervous system by exploiting key electroactive species (i.e., H2O2) produced by neurotransmitter&#8208;specific enzymatic reactions as synaptic modulator in an electrochemical neruomorphic organic device. This enzyme&#8208;mediated neurohybrid synapse can mimic biological learning&#8208;forgetting processes, showing a faster learning phase once previously learned information is forgotten compared to the initial learning stage.








Abstract
The development of organic artificial synapses that exhibit biomimicry features also may enable a more seamless integration of neuroelectronic devices in the nervous system, allowing artificial neuromodulation to be perceived as natural behavior by neuronal cells. Nevertheless, the capability to interact with both electroactive and non&#8208;electroactive neurotransmitters remains a challenge since state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices mainly rely on the oxidation of electroactive species. Here, the study proposes an organic artificial synapse engineered to enable interaction with non&#8208;electroactive species present in the central nervous system. By integrating a conductive polymeric film functionalized with platinum nanoparticles, the device can catalyze the oxidation of electroactive molecules (i.e., H2O2) resulting from neurotransmitter&#8208;specific enzymatic reactions following an enzymatic functionalization, therefore exhibiting neuromorphic functions driven by non&#8208;electroactive neurotransmitters. The creation of devices that can interact with or monitor these neurotransmitters can be seen as a significant step toward innovative technologies to expand the understanding of the mechanisms underlying neurological disorders and the development of novel, more effective treatments for them.

         <title>Peripheral Substitution Engineering of MR&#8208;TADF Emitters Embedded With B&#8210;N Covalent Bond Towards Efficient BT.2020 Blue Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a novel B&#8211;N embedded framework, a peripheral substitution engineering has been proposed to afford ultrapure blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters, revealing a record&#8208;high EQE of 20.3%, a narrow FWHM of 20&#160;nm and CIE coordinates of (0.152, 0.046) that align with the BT.2020 blue standard.








Abstract
Compared with the classical boron/nitrogen (B/N) doped ones, multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters embedded with B&#8211;N covalent bond behave a significantly blue&#8208;shifted narrowband TADF, and thus show a greater potential in ultrapure blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). As a proof of concept, herein a peripheral substitution engineering is demonstrated based on such a B&#8210;N embedded parent core. The simple approach is found to ensure easy synthesis via a one&#8208;pot lithium&#8208;free borylation&#8208;annulation, manipulate the excited states through different electronic coupling between core and substituent, and introduce the steric hindrance to minimize the unwanted spectral broadening. Impressively, ultrapure blue OLEDs are realized to give a high external quantum efficiency of 20.3% together with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.152, 0.046). The performance is well competent with those of B/N doped MR&#8208;TADF emitters, clearly highlighting that the B&#8210;N embedded framework is a novel promising paradigm towards efficient BT.2020 blue standard.

         <title>A High&#8208;Voltage n&#8208;type Organic Cathode Materials Enabled by Tetraalkylammonium Complexing Agents for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;voltage n&#8208;type organic electrode material featuring hexacyano&#8208;substituted cyclopropane dianion (CpCN62&#8211;) is reported. By leveraging the common&#8208;ion effect of tetrabutylammonium (TBA) cation in the electrolyte, the TBA salt of CpCN62&#8211; exhibits reversible two&#8208;electron redox process at 1.43 V discharge potential with stable long&#8208;term cycling, underscoring its potential as a high&#8208;performance and sustainable organic cathode material.








Abstract
Tetrabutylammonium (TBA) salt of hexacyano&#8208;substituted cyclopropane dianion (Cp(CN)62&#8722;) is prepared through a facile two&#8208;step synthetic protocol from commercially available materials and fully characterized as a high&#8208;voltage n&#8208;type organic cathode in rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). The addition of tetrabutylammonium triflate (TBAOTf)&#160;to the electrolyte mitigates dissolution issues, leading to enhanced cycling stability. Remarkably, the Cp(CN)62&#8722; cathode demonstrates a high discharge voltage of 1.43&#160;V in AZIBs and retains 85% of its capacity after 1000 cycles at a high loading of 10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and a cycling rate of 10C. These results, combined with spectroscopic analyses, elucidate a reversible two&#8208;electron redox process of Cp(CN)62&#8722; facilitated by the insertion/de&#8208;insertion of TBA cation. These findings underscore the potential of Cp(CN)62&#8722; as a conversion&#8208;based n&#8208;type cathode in energy storage applications.

         <title>Internal Capsulation Via Self&#8208;Cross&#8208;linking and &#960;&#8208;Effects Achieves Highly Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an internal encapsulation strategy utilizing the synergistic effect of in situ cross&#8208;linking and &#960;&#8208;effects, achieving an upgrade of the protective layer from linear to mesh&#8208;like coverage. The internal encapsulated device exhibits an enhanced efficiency of 25.31 % and noticeably improved stability.








Abstract
Pursuing high stability becomes the core challenge in realizing the widespread application of perovskite solar cells (PerSCs). Here, a practical internal&#8208;capsulation strategy is proposed by introducing cross&#8208;linkable methacrylate analogs upon the perovskite layer, hindering ion migration and preventing lead leakage to achieve stable PerSCs. Butyl methacrylate (UMA) and benzyl methacrylate (BMA) can chemically interact with the perovskite layer, especially for the BMA dimer with significant &#960;&#8208;interactions among the hanging benzene rings. Such configuration facilitated more compact coordination, thereby restoring the Fermi level of perovskite to a defect&#8208;free state and reducing carrier recombination losses. Moreover, by integrating the self&#8208;cross&#8208;linking and intermolecular &#960;&#8208;effect, the application of BMA upgraded the internal capsulation from linear protection to a compact mesh&#8208;like scale. Consequently, the application of BMA not only boosted the efficiency to 25.31% but also greatly enhanced the stability of the perovskite layer, especially for water resistance and preventing lead linkage. The internal capsulation strategy upgrading from linear to mesh&#8208;like marked an innovative direction in protecting the perovskite layer, paving the way for more sustainable PerSCs in further application.

         <title>Eradication of Large Tumors by Nanoscale Drug Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale self&#8208;assemblies constructed from Ce6 and mitoxantrone through hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction, and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking achieve photodynamic, photothermal, chemotherapy, and subsequently immunotherapy, under a single laser irradiation, to eradicate large tumors and prevent recurrence in various tumor models. The easy preparation, simple treatment process, and excellent therapeutic effect make this formulation a promising potential for clinical translation.








Abstract
Most patients with cancer are first diagnosed at an advanced disease stage, when tumors are already large and/or metastases are present. This circumstance has a negative impact on the prognosis and therapeutic effect of anticancer drugs. In this study, it is demonstrated that photosensitizer chlorin e6 and the photochemotherapy drug mitoxantrone self&#8208;assemble into relatively stable nanoassemblies (CM NAs) through hydrogen&#8208;bonding effect, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, and hydrophobic interactions. Administration of CM NAs in combination with 660&#160;nm laser irradiation shows chemotherapeutic, photothermal, and photodynamic effects, causing tumor cell apoptosis and pyroptosis and enabling noninvasive tumor ablation without compromising the surrounding normal tissue. More importantly, treatment with CM NAs increases tumor immunogenicity, leading to a strong and long&#8208;term antitumor immune response that eradicates large tumors and provides long&#8208;term protection against tumor recurrence on various tumor models.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Lifetime Probe for Detecting Intramolecular Noncovalent Interaction in Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular noncovalent interactions boost the device performance in the optoelectronic field, but cannot be directly detected in organic semiconductor films thus far. Spin lifetime as a probe to detect intramolecular noncovalent interaction is innovatively used since it can influence the spin&#8208;orbit coupling strength and thus modulate the spin lifetime. This work will significantly advance the interdisciplinary research of organic spintronics and electronics.








Abstract
Intramolecular noncovalent interaction (INCI), a crucial strategy for effectively enhancing molecular planarity and extending &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization in organic semiconductors (OSCs), has played an increasingly important role in optoelectronic applications. However, though the INCI formation is regularly considered to improve the device performance by literature, there is no feasible approach to directly and reliably characterizing its formation in practical&#8208;OSC films thus far. Here in this study, by theoretical analysis and calculation, the generation of INCIs in OSCs is found, normally consisting of relatively heavy elements, such as O&#183;&#183;&#183;Se, O&#183;&#183;&#183;S, N&#183;&#183;&#183;S interactions, etc., can induce enhanced strength of spin&#8208;orbit coupling, the primary factor dominating spin lifetime in OSCs. Based on this newly discovered theory, spin lifetime is creatively employed as a probe for sensitively detecting INCIs in OSC films via spin valves or field&#8208;induced electron paramagnetic resonance, respectively. This study will highly promote academic and applicable developments of the cross&#8208;cutting frontier research field between organic spintronics and electronics.

         <title>Supramolecular Polymer Additives as Repairable Reinforcements for Dynamic Covalent Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an innovative non&#8208;covalent reinforcement strategy for dynamic covalent networks (DCNs) using a supramolecular additive (S&#8208;T) that can depolymerize and reform on demand. Acting as both compatibilizer and filler, S&#8208;T improves mechanical properties while providing a tool to control processability, thus offering an alternative to traditional non&#8208;repairable reinforcements. 








Abstract
Employing rigid (in)organic materials as reinforcement for dynamic covalent networks (DCNs) is an effective approach to develop high&#8208;performance materials. Yet, recycling of these materials after failure often necessitates inefficient chemical reprocessing or inevitably alters their performance due to unrepairable inert components. Here, a non&#8208;covalent reinforcement strategy is presented by introducing a supramolecular additive to a DCN that can reversibly depolymerize and reform on demand, therefore acting as an adaptive and repairable reinforcement. The strong hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions in the supramolecular polymer of triazine&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tribenzenecarboxamide (S&#8208;T) strengthen the DCN at room temperature, while its non&#8208;covalent nature allows for easy one&#8208;pot reprocessing at high temperatures. Depending on wether S&#8208;T is covalently bond to the DCN or not, it can play either the role of compatibilizer or filler, providing a synthetic tool to control the relaxation dynamics, reprocessability and mechanical properties. Moreover, the S&#8208;T reinforcement can be chemically recovered with high yield and purity, showcasing the recyclability of the composite. This conceptually novel supramolecular reinforcement strategy with temperature&#8208;controlled dynamics highlights the potential of supramolecular polymer additives to replace conventional unrepairable reinforcements.

         <title>Sergeant&#8208;and&#8208;Soldier Effect in an Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Host&#8208;Guest System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel host&#8208;guest system, wherein TPP&#8208;4C&#8208;BI is doped into TPP&#8208;4C&#8208;Cz crystals, is experimentally shown to enhance room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence quantum yields 10&#8208;fold. Groundbreaking visualization of typically undetectable guest molecules is achieved for the first time within the host crystal structure. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals a unique &#8220;sergeant&#8208;and&#8208;soldier&#8221; effect, where the guest molecules control the conformations of the host, significantly influencing crystal packing. This system also exhibits efficient triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer from host to guest, promoting improved radiative decay.








Abstract
Host&#8208;guest systems have emerged as an efficient strategy for promoting organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). Despite the advantages of doping guest molecules into a host matrix, the complexity of these systems and the lack of techniques to visualize host&#8208;guest interactions at the molecular scale pose significant challenges in understanding the underlying mechanisms. Here, a novel host&#8208;guest RTP system is developed by incorporating low concentrations (1&#8211;10 mol%) of TPP&#8208;4C&#8208;BI (guest) into crystalline TPP&#8208;4C&#8208;Cz (host). Utilizing structural isomerism, the guest molecules are regularly incorporated into the host crystal lattice, resulting in phosphorescence quantum yields almost ten times higher than the pure compounds. The system enabled resolution of the molecular packing of the single crystal through X&#8208;ray diffraction, providing unprecedented visualization of host&#8208;guest interactions. A &#8220;sergeant&#8208;and&#8208;soldier&#8221; effect, where the minority dopant molecules (sergeants) significantly influence the packing arrangement of the host molecules (soldiers), enhances RTP is identified. Further analyses revealed that due to the host molecule's inefficient phosphorescence pathway, its long&#8208;lived dark triplets are channeled to the guest via triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer (TTET), allowing the excited energy to radiatively decay more efficiently. These insights advance the understanding of RTP mechanisms and offer practical implications for designing high&#8208;efficiency phosphorescent materials.

Groundbreaking visualization of typically undetectable guest molecules is achieved for the first time within the host crystal structure. Single crystal X-ray diffraction reveals a unique &#8220;sergeant-and-soldier&#8221; effect, where the guest molecules control the conformations of the host, significantly influencing crystal packing. This system also exhibits efficient triplet-triplet energy transfer from host to guest, promoting improved radiative decay.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host-guest systems have emerged as an efficient strategy for promoting organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). Despite the advantages of doping guest molecules into a host matrix, the complexity of these systems and the lack of techniques to visualize host-guest interactions at the molecular scale pose significant challenges in understanding the underlying mechanisms. Here, a novel host-guest RTP system is developed by incorporating low concentrations (1&#8211;10 mol%) of TPP-4C-BI (guest) into crystalline TPP-4C-Cz (host). Utilizing structural isomerism, the guest molecules are regularly incorporated into the host crystal lattice, resulting in phosphorescence quantum yields almost ten times higher than the pure compounds. The system enabled resolution of the molecular packing of the single crystal through X-ray diffraction, providing unprecedented visualization of host-guest interactions. A &#8220;sergeant-and-soldier&#8221; effect, where the minority dopant molecules (sergeants) significantly influence the packing arrangement of the host molecules (soldiers), enhances RTP is identified. Further analyses revealed that due to the host molecule's inefficient phosphorescence pathway, its long-lived dark triplets are channeled to the guest via triplet-triplet energy transfer (TTET), allowing the excited energy to radiatively decay more efficiently. These insights advance the understanding of RTP mechanisms and offer practical implications for designing high-efficiency phosphorescent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This study presents VO&#8322;&#8208;based photothermoelectric near&#8208;infrared photodetectors showing electrode&#8208;dependent and tunable super&#8208;linear photoresponse with ultralow modulation bias. The device demonstrates an exceptional photocurrent on/off ratio and high detectivity. The electrode dependence, driven by the polarity difference in the Seebeck coefficient, is also elucidated. It is ideal for intensity&#8208;selective near&#8208;sensor processing and night vision pattern reorganization even with noisy inputs, making it a low&#8208;power and integrative technology for future smart edge sensors.








Abstract
Brain&#8208;like intelligence is ushering humanity into an era of the Internet of Perceptions (IoP), where the vast amounts of data generated by numerous sensing nodes pose significant challenges to transmission bandwidth and computing hardware. A recently proposed near&#8208;sensor computing architecture offers an effective solution to reduce data processing delays and energy consumption. However, a pressing need remains for innovative hardware with multifunctional near&#8208;sensor image processing capabilities. In this work, Mott material (vanadium dioxide)&#8208;based photothermoelectric near&#8208;infrared photodetectors are developed that exhibit electrode&#8208;dependent and tunable super&#8208;linear photoresponse (exponent &#945; &gt; 33) with ultralow modulation bias. These devices demonstrate an opto&#8208;thermo&#8208;electro&#8208;coupled phase transition, resulting in a large photocurrent on/off ratio (&gt;105), high responsivity (&#8776;500 A W&#8722;1), and well detectivity (&#8776;3.9&#160;&#215; 1012 Jones), all while maintaining rapid response speeds (&#964;r = 2 &#181;s and &#964;d = 5 &#181;s) under the bias of 1&#160;V. This electrode&#8208;dependent super&#8208;linear response is found to arise from the electron doping effect determined by the polarity of the Seebeck coefficient. Furthermore, the work showcases intensity&#8208;selective near&#8208;sensor processing and night vision pattern reorganization, even with noisy inputs. This work paves the way for developing near&#8208;sensor devices with potential applications in medical image preprocessing, flexible electronics, and intelligent edge sensing.

Through the meticulous design of a type&#8208;I heterojunction with a single&#8208;side barrier on the valence band and near&#8208;zero offset on the conduction band, the Sb2Te3/WSe2 heterojunction achieves the best&#8208;reported combined performance in light and gas detection. This enabled the development of the first visual&#8208;olfactory dual&#8208;mode sensor, boosting recognition accuracy of electric and fuel&#8208;powered vehicles from &#8776;50% to &#8776;96%.








Abstract
The design and fabrication of materials that can concurrently respond to light and gas within the dual&#8208;modal recognition domain present a significant challenge due to contradictory structural requirements. This innovative strategy introduces a type&#8208;I heterojunction, combining the properties of Sb2Te3 and WSe2 nanosheets, to overcome these obstacles. The heterojunction is prepared through a precise stacking approach to create a single&#8208;side barrier on the valence band and a near&#8208;zero offset on the conduction band. The resulting Sb2Te3/WSe2 heterojunction demonstrates unparalleled performance, showcasing the best integrated photoelectric and gas sensing performance in a single device to date. Based on the above features, the heterojunction successfully integrates visual and olfactory sensing performance, achieving the first biomimetic visual&#8208;olfactory dual&#8208;mode recognition in a single device. This simulation increased the accuracy of distinguishing electric and fuel&#8208;powered cars from &#8776;50% to &#8776;96%. This work introduces a novel approach to creating efficient, self&#8208;powered sensing materials, paving the way for next&#8208;generation biomimetic dual&#8208;model devices with broad applications in environmental protection, medical care, and other fields.

         <title>Plasmonic Supramolecular Nanozyme&#8208;Based Bio&#8208;Cockleburs for Synergistic Therapy of Infected Diabetic Wounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of the plasmonic&#8208;enhanced nanozyme catalysis and self&#8208;cascade reaction strategy is employed to construct a bimetallic nanozyme&#8208;based biomimetic nano&#8208;cocklebur (GNR@CeO2@GNPs) for diabetic wound healing. Experimental results demonstrate that this promising approach maximizes the utilization of endogenous hyperglycemia and oxidative stress for downregulating hyperglycemia, non&#8208;antibiotic antibacterial, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and accelerating skin regeneration.








Abstract
Diabetic wounds are a major devastating complication of diabetes due to hyperglycemia, bacterial invasion, and persistent inflammation, and the current antibiotic treatments can lead to the emergence of multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria. Herein, a bimetallic nanozyme&#8208;based biomimetic bio&#8208;cocklebur (GNR@CeO2@GNPs) is designed and synthesized for diabetic wound management by depositing spiky ceria (CeO2) shells and gold nanoparticles (GNPs) on a gold nanorod (GNR) nanoantenna. The plasmonic&#8208;enhanced nanozyme catalysis and self&#8208;cascade reaction properties simultaneously boost the two&#8208;step enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activity of GNR@CeO2@GNPs, leading to a significant improvement in overall therapeutic efficacy rather than mere additive effects. Under the glucose activation and 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, GNR@CeO2@GNPs material captures photons and promotes the transfer of hot electrons from GNR and GNPs into CeO2, realizing a &#8220;butterfly effect&#8221; of consuming local glucose, overcoming the limited antibacterial efficiency of an individual PTT modality, and providing substantial reactive oxygen species. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate the material's exceptional antibacterial and antibiofilm properties against Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, which can reduce inflammation, promote collagen deposition, and facilitate angiogenesis, thereby accelerating wound healing. This study provides a promising new strategy to develop plasmonic&#8208;enhanced nanozymes with a catalytic cascade mode for the antibiotic&#8208;free synergistic treatment of infected diabetic wounds.

         <title>Light&#8208;Operated Diverse Logic Gates Enabled by Modulating Time&#8208;Dependent Fluorescence of Dissipative Self&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;fueled dissipative self&#8208;assembly systems with variable optical signals are achieved to realize diverse logic gates by modulating time&#8208;dependent fluorescence variations of the loaded fluorophores. It develops diverse light&#8208;operated logic gates, incorporating AND, and XOR operations, by utilizing the on/off irradiation wavelength of photoreaction and fluorescence excitation wavelength as optical inputs, while monitoring time&#8208;dependent changes in fluorescence as outputs.








Abstract
Light&#8208;fueled dissipative self&#8208;assembly possesses enormous potential in the field of optical information due to controllable time&#8208;dependent optical signals, but remains a great challenge for constructing intelligent light&#8208;operated logic circuits due to the limited availability of optical signal inputs and outputs. Herein, a series of light&#8208;fueled dissipative self&#8208;assembly systems with variable optical signals are reported to realize diverse logic gates by modulating time&#8208;dependent fluorescence variations of the loaded fluorophores. Three kinds of alkyl trimethylammonium homologs are employed to co&#8208;assemble with a merocyanine&#8208;based photoinduced amphiphile separately to construct a series of dissipative self&#8208;assemblies, showing unexpectedly different fluorescence control behaviors of loaded fluorophores during light irradiation and thermal relaxation processes. The opposite monotonicity of time&#8208;dependent emission intensity is achieved just by changing the excitation wavelength.

     alt="Light-Operated Diverse Logic Gates Enabled by Modulating Time-Dependent Fluorescence of Dissipative Self-Assemblies"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light-fueled dissipative self-assembly systems with variable optical signals are achieved to realize diverse logic gates by modulating time-dependent fluorescence variations of the loaded fluorophores. It develops diverse light-operated logic gates, incorporating AND, and XOR operations, by utilizing the on/off irradiation wavelength of photoreaction and fluorescence excitation wavelength as optical inputs, while monitoring time-dependent changes in fluorescence as outputs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light-fueled dissipative self-assembly possesses enormous potential in the field of optical information due to controllable time-dependent optical signals, but remains a great challenge for constructing intelligent light-operated logic circuits due to the limited availability of optical signal inputs and outputs. Herein, a series of light-fueled dissipative self-assembly systems with variable optical signals are reported to realize diverse logic gates by modulating time-dependent fluorescence variations of the loaded fluorophores. Three kinds of alkyl trimethylammonium homologs are employed to co-assemble with a merocyanine-based photoinduced amphiphile separately to construct a series of dissipative self-assemblies, showing unexpectedly different fluorescence control behaviors of loaded fluorophores during light irradiation and thermal relaxation processes. The opposite monotonicity of time-dependent emission intensity is achieved just by changing the excitation wavelength. Furthermore, by varying the types of trimethylammoniums and excitation wavelengths, a robust logic system is accomplished, integrating AND, XNOR, and XOR functions, which provides an effective pathway for advancing information transmission applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Nanotheranostics with a Switchable Irradiation Mode for Immunogenic Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents new insights into a multifunctional drug delivery system (NPRBOXA) with a sequentially switching irradiation mode for cancer theranostics. NPRBOXA enables a combination of sonodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy for tumor treatment. The versatile design of NPRBOXA holds promise for advancing precision oncology through enhanced therapeutic efficacy and imaging guidance.








Abstract
Nanotheranostics, which integrate diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities, offer significant potential for tumor treatment. However, current nanotheranostic systems typically involve multiple molecules, each providing a singular diagnostic or therapeutic function, leading to challenges such as complex structural composition, poor targeting efficiency, lack of spatiotemporal control, and dependence on a single therapeutic modality. This study introduces NPRBOXA, a nanoparticle functionalized with surface&#8208;bound cRGD for targeted delivery to &#945;v&#946;3/&#945;v&#946;5 receptors on tumor cells, achieving theranostic integration by sequentially switching its irradiation modes. Under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, NPRBOXA emits NIR&#8208;II fluorescence, which aids in identifying the nanoparticle's location and fluorescence intensity, thereby determining the optimal treatment window. Following this, the irradiation mode switches to ultrasound irradiation at the optimal treatment window. Ultrasound irradiation induces NPRBOXA to generate reactive oxygen species, promoting the reduction of OXA&#8208;IV to OXA&#8208;II, which in turn triggers immunogenic cell death. This mechanism enables a combination of sonodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy for tumor treatment. The versatile design of NPRBOXA holds promise for advancing precision oncology through enhanced therapeutic efficacy and real&#8208;time imaging guidance.

Liquid crystalline network (LCN)&#8208;based actuators grafted with Donor&#8211;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts (DASAs) are fabricated. The LCN&#8208;DASAs films present synergistic effects and interactions of photochemical and photothermal effects under visible light. Furthermore, multiple applications of films including information encryptions, off&#8208;equilibrium motions grippers, and reconfigurable deformations are achieved.








Abstract
Liquid crystalline network (LCN)&#8211;based soft actuators have opened up great opportunities to fabricate emerging and intriguing smart materials, serving as potential building blocks for intelligent soft robotics. Endowing LCN actuators with complex responsive behaviors to enhance their intelligence is both challenging and highly demanded. Herein, Donor&#8211;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts (DASAs) molecules with rod&#8208;like mesogen and the polymerizable group are judiciously designed and synthesized, which is strong&#8208;colored at linear form and de&#8208;coloration at cyclic form after visible light. In the colored state, the DASA presents a striking photothermal effect that is capable of driving the motions of LCN film. Upon visible light irradiation, the DASA becomes colorless, making the diminishing photothermal effect. The light&#8208;gated switching of the photothermal effect renders the LCN films to be reconfigurable and perform off&#8208;equilibrium motions. The varying glass transition temperature of LCN matrix endowing tunable isomerization rates of DASAs and the equilibrium balance of photo&#8208; and thermal&#8208;isomerization at different temperatures in LCN&#8208;P&#8208;DASA film mainly guiding the off&#8208;equilibrium or stable motions, providing high adjustability of the novel visible light&#8208;driven LCN actuators. The multiply modulated LCN&#8208;P&#8208;DASA film holds great potential in constructing complex visible light&#8208;driven soft actuators based on the synergetic effect and interactions of photochemical and photothermal effects.

         <title>2D Titanium Carbide MXene and Single&#8208;Molecule Fluorescence: Distance&#8208;Dependent Nonradiative Energy Transfer and Leaflet&#8208;Resolved Dye Sensing in Lipid Bilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXenes' distance&#8208;dependent energy transfer properties are examined using single&#8208;molecule fluorescence microscopy and DNA origami nanopositioners. The findings reveal MXenes as short&#8208;distance spectroscopic nanorulers, achieving 50% energy transfer efficiency at 2.7&#160;nm with a cubic power law dependency. Single&#8208;molecule leaflet&#8208;resolved dye sensing of lipid bilayers are demonstrated with MXene energy transfer due to MXenes&#8217; sensitivity at the interface.








Abstract
Despite their growing popularity, many fundamental properties and applications of MXene materials remain underexplored. Here, the nonradiative energy transfer properties of 2D titanium carbide MXene are investigated&#160;and their application in single&#8208;molecule biosensing is explored for the first time. DNA origami positioners are used for single dye placement immobilized by a specific chemistry based on glycine&#8208;MXene interactions, allowing precise control of their orientation on the surface. Each DNA origami structure carries a single dye molecule at predetermined heights. Single&#8208;molecule fluorescence confocal microscopy reveals that energy transfer of an organic emitter (ATTO 542) on transparent thin films made of spincast Ti3C2Tx flakes follows a cubic distance dependence, where 50% of energy transfer efficiency is reached at 2.7&#160;nm (d0). MXenes are applied as short&#8208;distance spectroscopic nanorulers, determining z distances of dye&#8208;labeled supported lipid bilayers fused on MXene's hydrophilic surface. Hydration layer (2.1&#160;nm) and lipid bilayer thickness (4.5&#160;nm) values that agree with the literature are obtained. These results highlight titanium carbide MXenes as promising substrates for single&#8208;molecule biosensing of ultrathin assemblies, owing to their sensitivity near the interface, a distance regime that is typically inaccessible to other energy transfer tools.

         <title>Realizing Ultrahigh Conversion Efficiency of &#8776;9.0% in YbCd2Sb2/Mg3Sb2 Zintl Module for Thermoelectric Power Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high ZT of &#8776;1.43 is obtained for YbCd1.425Zn0.475Mg0.1Sb2 enabled by orbital alignment. Moreover, thermal expansion matches Fe90Sb10 barrier material with low contact resistivity and high stability is delicately designed. Leveraging the transient liquid phase bonding technique, for the first time, a YbCd2Sb2/Mg3(Sb, Bi)2 module with an ultrahigh conversion efficiency of &#8776;9.0% and good stability is successfully assembled.








Abstract
Recently, YbCd2Sb2&#8208;based Zintl compounds have been widely investigated owing to their extraordinary thermoelectric (TE) performance. However, its p orbitals of anions that determined the valence band structure are split due to crystal field splitting that provides a good platform for band manipulation by doping/alloying and, more importantly, the YbCd2Sb2&#8208;based device has yet to be reported. In this work, single&#8208;phase YbCd1.5Zn0.5Sb2 is successfully obtained through precise chemical composition control. Then, YbMg2Sb2&#8208;alloying increases the cationic vacancy defect formation energy and further optimizes carrier concentration. Moreover, the band structure of YbCd1.5Zn0.5Sb2 is subtly manipulated, and the underlying mechanism is experimentally explored. Combined with the reduced lattice thermal conductivity, a high peak ZT value of &#8764;1.43 at 700&#160;K is obtained for YbCd1.425Zn0.475Mg0.1Sb2. Subsequently, choosing Fe90Sb10 as the diffusion barrier layer and adopting the transient liquid phase bonding technique, for the first time, it is demonstrated that YbCd2Sb2/Mg3(Sb, Bi)2 TE module with an ultrahigh conversion efficiency of &#8776;9.0% at a heat difference of 430&#160;K. More importantly, this module displays good thermal stability. This work paves the way for YbCd2Sb2 materials and devices in mid&#8208;temperature heat recovery.

Leveraging the transient liquid phase bonding technique, for the first time, a YbCd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(Sb, Bi)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; module with an ultrahigh conversion efficiency of &#8776;9.0% and good stability is successfully assembled.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, YbCd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based Zintl compounds have been widely investigated owing to their extraordinary thermoelectric (TE) performance. However, its &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbitals of anions that determined the valence band structure are split due to crystal field splitting that provides a good platform for band manipulation by doping/alloying and, more importantly, the YbCd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based device has yet to be reported. In this work, single-phase YbCd&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is successfully obtained through precise chemical composition control. Then, YbMg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-alloying increases the cationic vacancy defect formation energy and further optimizes carrier concentration. Moreover, the band structure of YbCd&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is subtly manipulated, and the underlying mechanism is experimentally explored. Combined with the reduced lattice thermal conductivity, a high peak &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt; value of &#8764;1.43 at 700&#160;K is obtained for YbCd&lt;sub&gt;1.425&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.475&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Subsequently, choosing Fe&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; as the diffusion barrier layer and adopting the transient liquid phase bonding technique, for the first time, it is demonstrated that YbCd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(Sb, Bi)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; TE module with an ultrahigh conversion efficiency of &#8776;9.0% at a heat difference of 430&#160;K. More importantly, this module displays good thermal stability. This work paves the way for YbCd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; materials and devices in mid-temperature heat recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>AI&#8208;Driven Electrolyte Additive Selection to Boost Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theoretical model driven by physical and chemical knowledge is proposed, summarizing descriptors and training sets through computational simulation combined with extensive literature. By integrating machine learning prediction and artificial intelligence clustering, electrolyte additives are screened and designed for Zn&#8208;ion batteries to achieve higher stability. Experimental verification confirms the practical applicability of this approach.








Abstract
In tackling the stability challenge of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) for large&#8208;scale energy storage, the adoption of electrolyte additive emerges as a practical solution. Unlike current trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods for selecting electrolyte additives, a data&#8208;driven strategy is proposed using theoretically computed surface free energy as a stability descriptor, benchmarked against experimental results. Numerous additives are calculated from existing literature, forming a database for machine learning (ML) training. Importantly, this ML model relies solely on experimental values, effectively addressing the challenge of large solvent molecule models that are difficult to handle with quantum chemistry computation. The interpretable linear regression algorithm identifies the number of heavy atoms in the additive molecule and the liquid surface tension as key factors. Artificial intelligence (AI) clustering categorizes additive molecules, identifying regions with the most significant impact on enhancing battery stability. Experimental verification successfully confirms the exceptional performance of 1,2,3&#8208;butanetriol and acetone in the optimal region. This integrated methodology, combining theoretical models, data&#8208;driven ML, and experimental validation, provides insights into the rational design of battery electrolyte additives.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Polarized PdCu&#8211;Fe3O4 In&#8208;Plane Heterostructures with Tandem Catalytic Mechanism for Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nanosheet assemblies composed of spin&#8208;polarized PdCu&#8211;Fe3O4 in&#8208;plane heterostructures are precisely synthesized via a liquid&#8208;phase short&#8208;range atomic diffusion strategy. A multi&#8208;site tandem mechanism is revealed on the deliberate&#8208;engineered heterostructures &#9472;O2 molecules are initially activated and cleaved on Fe sites to form O* and OH*, which are then transferred to Pd sites for the following proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer steps.








Abstract
Alloying has significantly upgraded the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of Pd&#8208;based catalysts through regulating the thermodynamics of oxygenated intermediates. However, the unsatisfactory activation ability of Pd&#8208;based alloys toward O2 molecules limits further improvement of ORR kinetics. Herein, the precise synthesis of nanosheet assemblies of spin&#8208;polarized PdCu&#8211;Fe3O4 in&#8208;plane heterostructures for drastically activating O2 molecules and boosting ORR kinetics is reported. It is demonstrated that the deliberate&#8208;engineered in&#8208;plane heterostructures not only tailor the d&#8208;band center of Pd sites with weakened adsorption of oxygenated intermediates but also endow electrophilic Fe sites with strong ability to activate O2 molecules, which make PdCu&#8211;Fe3O4 in&#8208;plane heterostructures exhibit the highest ORR specific activity among the state&#8208;of&#8208;art Pd&#8208;based catalysts so far. In situ electrochemical spectroscopy and theoretical investigations reveal a tandem catalytic mechanism on PdCu&#8211;Fe3O4&#9472;Fe sites that initially activate molecular O2 and generate oxygenated intermediates being transferred to Pd sites to finish the subsequent proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer steps.

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cell Modules by Mediated Vapor Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vapor&#8208;to&#8208;solid deposition of high&#8208;quality large&#8208;area perovskite films is developed via a new process based on a 2D intermediated phase. Efficiencies of 21.1% and 20.1% are achieved for perovskite modules with active areas of 12.5 and 48.0 cm2, respectively.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) can enable renewable electricity generation at low levelized costs, subject to the invention of an economically feasible technology for their large&#8208;scale fabrication, like vapor deposition. This approach is effective for the fabrication of small area (&lt;1 cm2) PSCs, but its scale&#8208;up to produce high&#8208;efficiency larger area modules has been limited by a severe imbalance between the vapor&#8208;solid reaction kinetics and the mass&#8208;transport of the volatile ammonium salt precursor. In this study, an amidine&#8208;based low&#8208;dimensional perovskite is introduced as an intermediate of the solid&#8208;vapor reaction to help resolve this limitation. This improves reaction pathway produces unique vertically monolithic grains with no detectable horizontal boundaries, which is used to produce 1.0 cm2 PSCs with an efficiency of 22.1%, as well as 12.5 and 48 cm2 modules delivering 21.1% and 20.1% efficiency, respectively. The modules retain &#8776;85% of their initial performance after 900 h of continuous operation (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 protocol) and &#8776;100% after 2800 h of storage in an ambient environment (ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;1 protocol).

         <title>Lattice Match&#8208;Enabled Covalent Heterointerfaces with Built&#8208;in Electric Field for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice&#8208;matched In2S3/CdS heterojunction with coherent heterointerface and built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) is crafted for efficient H2O2 photosynthesis. It features a covalent In&#9472;S&#9472;Cd bridge, an exceptionally low lattice mismatch of 0.27%, and a BIEF from In2S3 to CdS. It entails rapid charge separation and transfer, achieving an outstanding H2O2 production rate of 2.09 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 without the need for scavengers and oxygen bubbling.








Abstract
Crafting semiconducting heterojunctions represents an effective route to enhance photocatalysis by improving interfacial charge separation and transport. However, lattice mismatch (&#948;) between different semiconductors can significantly hinder charge dynamics. Here, meticulous lattice tailoring is reported to create a covalent heterointerface with a built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF), imparting markedly improved hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis. Specifically, an In2S3/CdS heterojunction with a coherent heterointerface, characterized by covalent In&#9472;S&#9472;Cd bridge and exceptionally low lattice mismatch of 0.27%, and a BIEF from In2S3 to CdS, is rationally designed. This heterojunction entails rapid charge separation and transfer, achieving an outstanding H2O2 production rate of 2.09 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 without the need for scavengers and oxygen bubbling, and a high apparent quantum efficiency of 17.73% at 400 nm. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that this Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction facilitates the adsorption of *O2 and the generation of *OOH intermediates during the 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction, associated with a low Gibbs free energy. This study underscores the significance of fine&#8208;tuning interfacial lattices and integrating BIEF to accelerate photocatalysis. The simple yet robust strategy can be conveniently leveraged to enhance device performance in optoelectronics, electrocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis, and sensing.

&lt;p&gt;A lattice-matched In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CdS heterojunction with coherent heterointerface and built-in electric field (BIEF) is crafted for efficient H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis. It features a covalent In&#9472;S&#9472;Cd bridge, an exceptionally low lattice mismatch of 0.27%, and a BIEF from In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to CdS. It entails rapid charge separation and transfer, achieving an outstanding H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 2.09 mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; without the need for scavengers and oxygen bubbling.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crafting semiconducting heterojunctions represents an effective route to enhance photocatalysis by improving interfacial charge separation and transport. However, lattice mismatch (&lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;) between different semiconductors can significantly hinder charge dynamics. Here, meticulous lattice tailoring is reported to create a covalent heterointerface with a built-in electric field (BIEF), imparting markedly improved hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) photosynthesis. Specifically, an In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CdS heterojunction with a coherent heterointerface, characterized by covalent In&#9472;S&#9472;Cd bridge and exceptionally low lattice mismatch of 0.27%, and a BIEF from In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to CdS, is rationally designed. This heterojunction entails rapid charge separation and transfer, achieving an outstanding H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 2.09 mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; without the need for scavengers and oxygen bubbling, and a high apparent quantum efficiency of 17.73% at 400 nm. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that this Z-scheme heterojunction facilitates the adsorption of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the generation of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;OOH intermediates during the 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction reaction, associated with a low Gibbs free energy. This study underscores the significance of fine-tuning interfacial lattices and integrating BIEF to accelerate photocatalysis. The simple yet robust strategy can be conveniently leveraged to enhance device performance in optoelectronics, electrocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis, and sensing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Bioprinting of Liquid High&#8208;Cell&#8208;Proportion Bioinks in Liquid Granular Bath</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
There are challenges for extrusion 3D bioprinting in simultaneously satisfying the requirements of high&#8208;cell&#8208;activity, high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion, and low&#8208;viscosity bioinks, which allows the establishment of improved cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell communication and enhanced biological. Here, liquid high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion GelMA are found to be printed in liquid granular through ink&#8208;bath electrostatic interaction, that is, liquid&#8208;in&#8208;liquid 3D bioprinting (LL3DBP).








Abstract
Embedded 3D bioprinting techniques have emerged as a powerful method to fabricate 3D engineered constructs&#160;using low strength bioinks; however, there are challenges in simultaneously satisfying the requirements of high&#8208;cell&#8208;activity, high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion, and low&#8208;viscosity bioinks. In particular, the printing capacity of embedded 3D bioprinting is limited as two main challenges: spreading and diffusion, especially for liquid, high&#8208;cell&#8208;activity bioinks that can facilitate high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion. Here, a liquid&#8208;in&#8208;liquid 3D bioprinting (LL3DBP) strategy is developed, which used a liquid granular bath to prevent the spreading of liquid bioinks during 3D printing, and electrostatic interaction between the liquid bioinks and liquid granular baths is found to effectively prevent the diffusion of liquid bioinks. As an example, the printing of positively charged 5% w/v gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) in a liquid granular bath prepared with negatively charged &#954;&#8208;carrageenan is proved to be achievable. By LL3DBP, printing capacity is greatly advanced and bioinks with over 90% v/v cell can be printed, and printed structures with high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion exhibit excellent bioactivity.

         <title>In Situ Molecular Reconfiguration of Pyrene Redox&#8208;Active Molecules for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural evolution of organic electrolysis is revealed at the molecular level in a flow battery and decreases the electrosynthesis yield of isomers and dimers with low electrochemical activity by more than one order of magnitude through pyrene precursor structure regulation. The molecular reconfigured pyrene&#8208;based catholytes achieved a high electrolyte utilization, electron concentration, and recordable cell performance without obvious capacity decay.








Abstract
Aqueous organic flow batteries (AOFBs) hold great potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage, however, scalable, green, and economical synthetic methods for stable organic redox&#8208;active molecules (ORAMs) are still required for their practical applications. Herein, pyrene&#8208;based ORAMs are obtained via an in situ organic electrolysis strategy in a flow cell. It is revealed that the water attacking pyrenes restructured molecules to produce a variety of isomers and dimers during the electrolysis, which can be modulated by regulating the local electron cloud density and steric hindrance of pyrene precursors. As a result, the molecularly reconfigured pyrene&#8208;based catholytes, even without any further purification, achieved a high electrolyte utilization of &#8776;96% and volumetric capacity above 50&#160;Ah&#160;L&#8722;1. Inspiringly, remarkable cell stability with almost no capacity decay for &#8776;70 days is achieved, benefiting from the robust aromatic structure of the pyrene cores. The insights into the in situ electrosynthesis of pyrene&#8208;based ORAMs provided in the work will provide guidance for designing ultra&#8208;stable ORAMs for AOFB applications.

         <title>Molecular Reconfiguration of Disordered Tellurium Oxide Transistors with Biomimetic Spectral Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconfigurable transistors and neuromorphic devices are realized through surface processes on disordered tellurium oxides. The enhanced surface interactions effectively regulate carrier concentration in the channel, leading to logic functions and biomimetic wavelength selectivity. This molecular reconfiguration strategy increases the integration level of circuits and significantly promotes the development of next&#8208;generation multifunctional electronic devices.








Abstract
Reconfigurable devices with field&#8208;effect transistor features and neuromorphic behaviors are promising for enhancing data processing capability and reducing power consumption in next&#8208;generation semiconductor platforms. However, commonly used 2D materials for reconfigurable devices require additional modulation terminals and suffer from complex and stringent operating rules to obtain specific functionalities. Here, a p&#8208;type disordered tellurium oxide is introduced that realizes dual&#8208;mode reconfigurability as a logic transistor and a neuromorphic device. Due to the disordered film surface, the enhanced adsorption of oxygen molecules and laser&#8208;induced desorption concurrently regulate the carrier concentration in the channel. The device exhibits high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type characteristics with a field&#8208;effect hole mobility of 10.02 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an Ion/Ioff ratio exceeding 106 in the transistor mode. As a neuromorphic device, the vision system exhibits biomimetic bee vision, explicitly responding to the blue&#8208;to&#8208;ultraviolet light. Finally, in&#8208;sensor denoising and invisible image recognition in static and dynamic scenarios are achieved.

         <title>Balancing Potassiophilicity and Catalytic Activity of Artificial Interface Layer for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium/Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon layer with a locally ordered structure has been developed as an artificial interface to achieve a balance between K affinity and catalytic activity, which can significantly enhance the cycle life of potassium metal batteries, achieving an impressive life of 2000 h at 0.5 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a capacity of 0.5 mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Potassium metal batteries (PMBs), with high energy density and low cost, are considered a promising option for grid&#8208;scale energy storage systems. However, challenges such as the uneven nucleation of K and instability of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer result in dendrite growth and poor cyclic performance, limiting practical application. To address them, constructing an artificial interface layer with rich defects can enhance the potassium affinity and promote the uniform nucleation of potassium, yet this can also catalyze electrolyte to decompose, leading to unstable SEI formation and poor cycle stability. Herein, a carbon layer with a locally ordered structure (SC&#8208;1600) is constructed as the artificial interface to achieve a balance between K affinity and catalytic activity. This optimized design allows for the uniform nucleation of potassium metal and the formation of a dense SEI layer. SC&#8208;1600@K symmetric cell can operate for 2000&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a capacity of 0.5 mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, and the developed full cell shows a high capacity retention of 78% after 1500 cycles at 1 A&#160;g&#8722;1. Besides, SC&#8208;1600@Na effectively extend the life of sodium metal batteries. This work provides a new insight for the construction of efficient K metal artificial interface layer.

SC-1600@K symmetric cell can operate for 2000&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a capacity of 0.5 mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the developed full cell shows a high capacity retention of 78% after 1500 cycles at 1 A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Besides, SC-1600@Na effectively extend the life of sodium metal batteries. This work provides a new insight for the construction of efficient K metal artificial interface layer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intrinsic Narrowband Blue Phosphorescent Materials and Their Applications in 3D Printed Self&#8208;monitoring Microfluidic Chips</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to achieve intrinsic narrowband blue phosphorescent materials is demonstrated. When doping guest molecules into hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA)&#8208;acrylic acid (AA) polymer matrix, narrowband phosphorescence with the full width at half maximum of 36 nm is achieved. 3D printed structures based on 2O&#8208;Cphpz@HEA&#8208;AA are also fabricated, expanding potential applications for self&#8208;monitoring the trajectories of droplet by optical methods.








Abstract
Organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials, especially with narrowband emission properties, exhibit great potential for applications in display and sensing, but have been seldom reported. Herein, a rare example of the intrinsic narrowband blue RTP material is fabricated and reported. A series of indolo[3,2,1&#8208;kl]phenothiazine derivatives, named Cphpz, 1O&#8208;Cphpz, and 2O&#8208;Cphpz, are designed and synthesized. Due to their relatively rigid structures, these three compounds showed deep blue narrowband emissions ranging from 396 to 434&#160;nm with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 31, 26, and 31&#160;nm, respectively. To the delight, compound 2O&#8208;Cphpz displayed intrinsic narrowband blue RTP at 448 nm with FWHM of 36 nm and a long&#8208;lived lifetime of 1.08 s in hydroxyethyl acrylate and acrylic acid matrix. Photophysical studies, single crystal analyses, and TD&#8208;DFT calculations are performed to elucidate further the relationships between molecular structures and the narrowband blue RTP properties. Meanwhile, because the narrowband blue RTP is highly sensitive to humidity, a visualizing droplet path optical microfluidic chip is efficiently fabricated through the digital light processing 3D printing.This work provides a rare example and a reliable strategy to realize narrowband blue RTP and further expand their applications in self&#8208;monitoring 3D printed structures.

         <title>Embedding Reverse Electron Transfer Between Stably Bare Cu Nanoparticles and Cation&#8208;Vacancy CuWO4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An embedded cation&#8208;vacancy metal&#8208;oxide interface is developed to induce the reverse strong metal&#8208;support interactions in Cu NPs, which inhibits its surface oxidation in ambient air, high&#8208;temperature agglomeration, and CO poisoning adsorption. In contrast to the Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood mechanism observed in the deposited Cu NPs, the exsolved electron&#8208;enriched Cu NPs with anion oxygen protective layers follow the Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanism during CO oxidation.








Abstract
Cu nanoparticles (NPs) have attracted widespread attention in electronics, energy, and catalysis. However, conventionally synthesized Cu NPs face some challenges such as surface passivation and agglomeration in applications, which impairs their functionalities in the physicochemical properties. Here, the issues above by engineering an embedded interface of stably bare Cu NPs on the cation&#8208;vacancy CuWO4 support is addressed, which induces the strong metal&#8208;support interactions and reverse electron transfer. Various atomic&#8208;scale analyses directly demonstrate the unique electronic structure of the embedded Cu NPs with negative charge and anion oxygen protective layer, which mitigates the typical degradation pathways such as oxidation in ambient air, high&#8208;temperature agglomeration, and CO poisoning adsorption. Kinetics and in situ spectroscopic studies unveil that the embedded electron&#8208;enriched Cu NPs follow the typical Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanism in CO oxidation, contrasting the Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood mechanism on the traditional Cu NPs. This mechanistic shift is driven by the Coulombic repulsion in anion oxygen layer, enabling its direct reaction with gaseous CO to form the easily desorbed monodentate carbonate.

         <title>Functional Carbon Springs Enabled Dynamic Tunable Microwave Absorption and Thermal Insulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional carbon spring (FCS) aerogels possess dynamic tunable microwave absorption and excellent thermal insulation due to their unique lamellar multi&#8208;arch microstructure. This design resolves the current conflict in co&#8208;optimizing these functions, providing the best &#8220;electromagnetic&#8208;thermal&#8221; dual protection known.









Abstract
Electromagnetic (EM) wave pollution and thermal damage pose serious hazards to delicate instruments. Functional aerogels offer a promising solution by mitigating EM interference and isolating heat. However, most of these materials struggle to balance thermal protection with microwave absorption (MA) efficiency due to a previously unidentified conflict between the optimizing strategies of the two properties. Herein, this study reports a solution involving the design of a carbon&#8208;based aerogel called functional carbon spring (FCS). Its unique long&#8208;range lamellar multi&#8208;arch microstructure enables tunable MA performance and excellent thermal insulation capability. Adjusting compression strain from 0% to 50%, the adjustable effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) spans up to 13.4&#160;GHz, covering 84% of the measured frequency spectrum. Notably, at 75% strain, the EAB drops to 0&#160;GHz, demonstrating a novel &#8220;on&#8208;off&#8221; switchability for MA performance. Its ultralow vertical thermal conductivity (12.7&#160;mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) and unique anisotropic heat transfer mechanism endow FCS with superior thermal protection effectiveness. Numerical simulations demonstrate that FCS outperforms common honeycomb structures and isotropic porous aerogels in thermal management. Furthermore, an &#8220;electromagnetic&#8208;thermal&#8221; dual&#8208;protection material database is established, which intuitively demonstrates the superiority of the solution. This work contributes to the advancement of multifunctional MA materials with significant potential for practical applications.

         <title>Dynamic Lock&#8208;And&#8208;Release Mechanism Enables Reduced &#916;G at Low Temperatures for High&#8208;Performance Polyanionic Cathode in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;adaptive coordination field regulation (SACFR) strategy, underpinned by a dynamic lock&#8208;and&#8208;release (DLR) mechanism, is proposed for the first time to dynamically regulate the coordination field of reactant ions. This dynamic regulation improves reaction kinetics and reduces &#916;G at low temperatures, enabling the efficient synthesis of high&#8208;performance, high&#8208;crystalline Na3V2O2(PO4)2F cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature synthesis of polyanionic cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries is highly desirable but often plagued by prolonged reaction times and suboptimal crystallinity. To address these challenges, a novel self&#8208;adaptive coordination field regulation (SACFR) strategy based on a dynamic lock&#8208;and&#8208;release (DLR) mechanism is introduced. Specifically, urea is used as a DLR carrier during synthesis, which dynamically &#8220;locks&#8221; and &#8220;releases&#8221; vanadium ions for controlled release, simultaneously &#8220;locking&#8221; H+ ions to enhance phosphate group release, thereby creating a self&#8208;adaptive coordination field that can intelligently respond to real&#8208;time demands of the reaction system. This dynamic coordination behavior contributes to both an improvement in reaction kinetics and a significant reduction in Gibbs free energy change (&#916;G). As a result, the kinetic efficiency and thermodynamic spontaneity of the reaction are greatly enhanced, enabling the efficient synthesis of high&#8208;crystalline Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) at 90 &#176;C within just 3 hours. The as&#8208;prepared NVOPF cathode exhibits exceptional rate performance and ultra&#8208;stable cycling stability across a broad temperature range. Furthermore, the successful kilogram&#8208;scale synthesis underscores the practical potential of the innovative strategy. This work pioneers the regulation of coordination field chemistry for polyanionic cathode synthesis, providing transformative insights into material design.

         <title>Ionized Phenanthroline Derivatives Suppressing Interface Chemical Interactions with Active Layer for High&#8208;efficiency Organic Solar Cells with Exceptional Device Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel alcohol&#8208;soluble phenanthroline derivative, tbp&#8208;PhenBr, is innovatively designed and synthesized as cathode interlayer material, which can effectively suppress interface chemical interactions with the non&#8208;fullerene active layer for high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells with exceptional device stability.








Abstract
The contact interface between the charge transport interlayer and the active layer is crucial for the non&#8208;fullerene organic solar cells (NF OSCs) to achieve high efficiency and long&#8208;term stability. In this study, two novel phenanthroline (Phen) derivatives, tbp&#8208;Phen and tbp&#8208;PhenBr, are developed as efficient cathode interfacial materials (CIMs). The larger steric hindrance substituents and the ionization of nitrogen atoms on the Phen framework jointly enable the tbp&#8208;PhenBr CIM with a stable film morphology and immensely suppress the detrimental interface chemical interactions with the NF active layer. Consequently, tbp&#8208;PhenBr&#8208;based OSC achieves a higher efficiency (PCE&#160;=&#160;16.34%) than bathocuproine (BCP)&#8208;based control device (PCE&#160;=&#160;13.70%) using PM6:Y6 as the active layer. More importantly, the tbp&#8208;PhenBr&#8208;based device maintains 80% of its initial efficiency (T80) for 3264 h in dark conditions and 220 h after being heated at 85&#160;&#176;C, significantly outperforming the BCP&#8208;based device. The tbp&#8208;PhenBr CIM also shows broad applicability across various binary and ternary active layer systems, affording a notable PCE of 19.49%. Additionally, the tbp&#8208;PhenBr CIM can be processed via a thermal evaporation technique and the prepared devices exhibit high reproducibility. This work provides innovative insights into the molecular design of the CIMs for stable and efficient NF OSCs.

         <title>An Energy&#8208;Adjustable, Deformable, and Packable Wireless Charging Fiber Supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated wireless charging fiber supercapacitor developed by only one fiber features with adjustable size (2&#8211;20&#160;cm diameter circle), arbitrary shape and controllable wireless charging energy (0.003&#8211;313&#160;mW power), exhibiting extraordinary energy density at 1004 &#181;Wh cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Wireless charging energy storage devices eliminate bulky wires of wearable electronics. However, rigid shape and specific charging energy restrict their applications in space&#8208;limited portable electronics. Herein, an all&#8208;carbon fiber supercapacitor is presented that features shape&#8208;adjustable, packable, and energy&#8208;controllable wireless charging functions. With the unique on&#8208;dimensional circuit structure, the maximum energy transfer efficiency from the electrical energy received by the wireless charging unit to the output energy of the fiber supercapacitor can reach up to &#8776;60.8%, and meanwhile this integrated fiber device exhibits an outstanding area capacity of 803 mF cm&#8722;2 and energy density of 1004 &#181;Wh cm&#8722;2, superior to most of the fiber supercapacitors. Moreover, this unique device can endure significant deformation in shape of circles ranging from 2 to 20&#160;cm diameter, and can be packed into narrow spaces, such as smart bracelet and disk&#8208;shaped pet global positioning system (GPS). By altering the device shape, the wireless charging current, voltage, and power can be adjusted in the range of 0.5&#8211;20&#160;mA, 1.4&#8211;15.5&#160;V, and 0.003&#8211;313&#160;mW, accommodating the energy requirements for nearly all existing micro&#8208;electronics. This work offers unprecedented opportunities for packable, space&#8208;confined and energy harvesting controllable wearable electronics.

         <title>Enhancing the Filler Utilization of Composite Gel Electrolytes via In Situ Solution&#8208;Processable Method for Sustainable Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processable method is developed to fabricate composite gel electrolytes with high filler utilization. Uniform distributed UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 fillers enhance its mechanical toughness, ionic conductivity, and cation transference number, and stabilize the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. This strategy enables the sodium&#8208;ion batteries to achieve excellent cycling and wide&#8208;temperature performance.








Abstract
The composite gel electrolyte (CGE), which combines the advantages of inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes and solid polymer electrolytes, is regarded as the ultimate candidate for constructing batteries with high safety and superior electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface contact. However, the ubiquitous agglomeration of nanofillers results in low filler utilization, which seriously reduces structural uniformity and ion transport efficiency, thus restricting the development of consistent and durable batteries. Herein, a solution&#8208;processable method to in situ construct CGE with high filler utilization is introduced. The homogeneous metal&#8211;organic framework fillers contribute to uniform ionic and electronic filed distribution, realizing a stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Consequently, the CGE with high filler utilization achieves an ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 10&#160;000 cycles with a capacity retention of 80.2%. This work provides guidance for constructing high&#8208;performance CGEs in electrochemical energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Amorphous to Crystalline Transition in Nanoimprinted Sol&#8211;Gel Titanium Oxide Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wafer&#8208;scale manufacturing platform is introduced for crystalline TiO2 metasurfaces. Anatase or rutile metalenses are fabricated via thermal nanoimprint lithography and sintering. The high refractive index enhances conversion efficiency and numerical aperture. These metalenses demonstrate diffraction&#8208;limited focusing and imaging capabilities, showcasing the potential of crystalline TiO2 in advanced flat optics for improved performance in various applications.








Abstract
Crystalline titanium dioxide (TiO2) (anatase and rutile) possesses a higher refractive index than amorphous TiO2 and near&#8208;zero absorption in the visible region, making them an ideal material for visible metasurfaces. However, fabrication limitations hinder their implementation into flat optics. In this work, a wafer&#8208;scale manufacturing platform is proposed for crystalline TiO2 metasurfaces. Sol&#8211;gel TiO2 is developed as a printable material in which its material phase can be precisely controlled to produce amorphous, anatase, or rutile, depending on the crystallization temperature. Therefore, anatase or rutile metalenses can be fabricated on a wafer scale using thermal nanoimprint lithography and sintering process. The high refractive index of the crystalline TiO2 contributes to the enhanced conversion efficiency of the fabricated metalenses. The fabricated metalenses exhibit diffraction&#8208;limited focusing and imaging capabilities, comparable to the theoretically ideal lenses.

Precise control over gene delivery in 3D can refine tissue models providing insights into the complex, multicellular processes underlying development, degeneration, and disease progression. This work presents an optoporation strategy based on light&#8208;responsive porous silicon nanoparticles for the spatially&#8208;resolved transfection of organoids.








Abstract
Engineering the spatial organisation of organotypic cultures is pivotal for refining tissue models that are useful for gaining deeper insights into complex, non&#8208;cell autonomous processes. These advanced models are key to improving the understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms and therapeutic strategies. Controlling gene regulation through spatially&#8208;resolved delivery of nucleic acids provides an attractive approach to produce such tissue models. An emerging strategy for spatially&#8208;resolved transfection uses photosensitizing nanoparticles coupled with laser pulses to optoporate cells in culture and locally mediate gene delivery. However, localized optoporation in 3D systems remains challenging. Here we propose a solution to this longstanding hurdle, demonstrating that porous silicon nanoparticles are a safe and bioresorbable photosensitising nanomaterial capable of spatially&#8208;resolved transfection of mRNA in MCF&#8208;7 organoids by near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon optoporation. Functionalization with an azobenzene&#8211;lysine photo&#8208;switchable moiety enhances the transfection efficiency of the nanoparticles up to 84% in a 2D cell system. Moreover, the nanoparticles enable spatially selective mRNA transfection to MCF&#8208;7 spheroids, demonstrating targeted &#160;gene delivery in complex 3D cellular environments. The approach for spatially&#8208;resolved 3D optoporation offers a way forward for the design of tailored spheroids and organoids by spatially selective nucleic acids delivery.

         <title>Optimization of Charge Extraction and Interconnecting Layers for Highly Efficient Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells with High Fill Factor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developshighly efficient perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (POTSC) via the simultaneous optimization of quaternary organic BHJ blend, and reduction of optical and electrical losses of interconnecting layers via self&#8208;assembly monolayer. The resultant POTSCs achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.56% (certified: 24.65%), with a record fill factor (FF) of 83.62% of all types of perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells (TSCs) till now.








Abstract
Perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (POTSCs) have garnered significant attention due to their potential for achieving high photovoltaic (PV) performance. However, the reported power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and fill factors (FFs) are still subpar due to the challenges associated with charge extraction in the organic bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) and significant energy losses in the interconnecting layers (ICLs). Here, a quaternary organic BHJ blend is developed to enhance the charge extraction in the organic subcell, contributing to an increased FF of &#8805;78% under 1 sun illumination and even more under lower illumination intensities. Meanwhile, energy losses in the ICLs are reduced via the incorporation of a self&#8208;assembly monolayer (SAM), (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;4PACz), in organic BHJ to form a MoOx/SAM interface and the thorough control of the MoOx thickness to suppress parasitic absorption. The resultant POTSCs achieve a remarkable PCE of 25.56% (certified: 24.65%), with a record FF of 83.62%, which is among the highest PCEs of POTSCs and the highest FF of all types of perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells (TSCs) till now. This work proves the optimization of charge extraction and ICLs are effective strategies to promote the performance of POTSCs to surpass other solution&#8208;processed perovskite&#8208;based TSCs in the near future.

         <title>Ultrafast Synthesis of MXenes in Minutes via Low&#8208;Temperature Molten Salt Etching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXenes, including Ti3C2Tx, V4C3Tx, Nb4C3Tx, Mo2TiC2Tx, and Mo2CTx, can be rapidly synthesized via the low&#8208;temperature (130&#8211;195&#160;&#176;C) NH4HF2 molten salt etching process from their corresponding MAX phases in just 5&#8211;40&#160;min. This low&#8208;temperature molten salt etching method is easy to scale up and can yield more than 100&#160;g MXene in a single reaction.








Abstract
Developing green and efficient preparation strategies is a persistent pursuit in the field of 2D transition metal nitrides and/or carbides (MXenes). Traditional etching methods, such as HF&#8208;based or high&#8208;temperature Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;molten&#8208;salt etching route, require harsher etching conditions and exhibit lower preparation efficiency with limited scalability, severely constraining their commercial production and practical application. Here, an ultrafast low&#8208;temperature molten salt (LTMS) etching method is presented for the large&#8208;scale synthesis of diverse MXenes within minutes by employing NH4HF2 as the etchant. The increased thermal motion and improved diffusion of molten NH4HF2 molecules significantly expedite the etching process of MAX phases, thus achieving the preparation of Ti3C2Tx MXene in just 5&#160;minutes. The universality of the LTMS method renders it a valuable approach for the rapid synthesis of various MXenes, including V4C3Tx, Nb4C3Tx, Mo2TiC2Tx, and Mo2CTx. The LTMS method is easy to scale up and can yield more than 100&#160;g Ti3C2Tx in a single reaction. The obtained LTMS&#8208;MXene exhibits excellent electrochemical performance for supercapacitors, evidently proving the effectiveness of the LTMS method. This work provides an ultrafast, universal, and scalable LTMS etching method for the large&#8208;scale commercial production of MXenes.

         <title>Iodide Management and Oriented Crystallization Modulation for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Air Processed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up, all&#8208;in&#8208;one modification strategy is proposed by introducing a multisite antioxidant ergothioneine (EGT) at the buried interface to manage iodide ions and manipulate crystallization dynamics. The EGT&#8208;optimization firmly anchors I&#8722; and inhibits their oxidation to I2. The optimized all&#8208;air processed device achieves a remarkable PCE of 25.13%, which is among the highest values reported for devices fabricated in air.








Abstract
Halide&#8208;related defects at the buried interface not only cause nonradiative recombination, but also seriously impair the long&#8208;term stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a bottom&#8208;up, all&#8208;in&#8208;one modification strategy is proposed by introducing a multisite antioxidant ergothioneine (EGT) at the buried interface to manage iodide ions and manipulate crystallization dynamics. The findings demonstrate that EGT not only passivates uncoordinated Sn4+/Pb2+ defects, but also firmly anchors iodide ions and inhibits their oxidation to I2. Additionally, the modification by EGT enhances the oriented crystallization of perovskite, improves the carrier dynamics, and releases residual stresses. Consequently, the optimized all&#8208;air processed device (Rb0.02(FA0.95Cs0.05)0.98PbI2.91Br0.03Cl0.06) achieves a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.13%, which is among the highest values reported for devices fabricated in air, along with ultrahigh open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.191&#160;V and fill factor (FF) of 84.9%. The optimized device without encapsulation exhibits strong humidity, thermal, and operational stability under ISOS protocol. Specifically, the initial efficiency of the device is retained at 90.12% after 1512 h of thermal ageing at 65&#160;&#176;C and 90.14% after 930 h of continuous maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under simulated AM1.5 illumination.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Actuated Ferroptosis Nanomotor for Enhanced Tumor Penetration and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIR&#8208;driven ROS self&#8208;supplying Z@P&#8208;F nanomotor with efficient lysosome escape and enhanced tumor penetration is successfully developed for synergistic tumor CDT/PTT. By releasing Fe2+ and H2O2 under NIR irradiation and acidic TME, Z@P&#8208;F nanomotors continuously generate large amounts of lipid ROS in the tumor and deplete intracellular GSH, thus facilitating Fe2+&#8208;mediated ferroptosis and eventually achieving effective tumor eradication.








Abstract
Ferroptosis nano&#8208;inducers have drawn considerable attention in the treatment of malignant tumors. However, low intratumoral hydrogen peroxide level and complex biological barriers hinder the ability of nanomedicines to generate sufficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) and achieve tumor penetration. Here a near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;driven ROS self&#8208;supplying nanomotor is successfully designed for synergistic tumor chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). Janus nanomotor is created by the asymmetrical modification of polydopamine (PDA) with zinc peroxide (ZnO2) and subsequent ferrous ion (Fe2+) chelation via the polyphenol groups from the PDA, here refer as ZnO2@PDA&#8208;Fe (Z@P&#8208;F). ZnO2 is capable of slowly releasing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into an acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) providing sufficient ingredients for the Fenton reaction necessary for ferroptosis. Upon NIR laser irradiation, the loaded Fe2+ is released and a thermal gradient is simultaneously formed owing to the asymmetric PDA coating, thus endowing the nanomotor with self&#8208;thermophoresis based enhanced diffusion for subsequent lysosomal escape and tumor penetration. Therefore, the release of ferrous ions (Fe2+), self&#8208;supplied H2O2, and self&#8208;thermophoresis of nanomotors with NIR actuation further improve the synergistic CDT/PTT efficacy, showing great potential for active tumor therapy.

         <title>Construction of COF/COF Organic S&#8208;Scheme Heterostructure for Enhanced Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of organic COF/COF heterojunction with an S&#8208;scheme charge transfer pathway is designed for enhanced photocatalytic overall water splitting without sacrificial agents, and the record high visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 and O2 evolution rates achieved for COF&#8208;316/Pt@TpBpy&#8208;COF.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as a new type of photocatalysts have shown unique advantages in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution, while the reported overall water&#8208;splitting systems are still very rare among various COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Herein, two COFs are integrated to construct a type of organic S&#8208;scheme heterojunction for improved overall water splitting. In this system, TpBpy&#8208;COF and COF&#8208;316 serve as H2&#8208; and O2&#8208;evolving components, respectively, which are combined through &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction between conjugated aromatic rings. By introducing ultra&#8208;small Pt nanoparticles (NPs) into the pores of the TpBpy&#8208;COF nanosheets (NS), the resultant COF&#8208;316/Pt@TpBpy&#8208;COF NS heterostructure achieves extremely high H2 and O2 evolution rates of 220.4 and 110.2&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, respectively, under visible light irradiation (&#955; &#8805; 420&#160;nm). The results of transient absorption spectra (TAS) and photoelectronic measurements indicate that the organic heterojunction interface notably facilitates the separation and transfer of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. Further, theoretical calculations and in situ experiments confirm the spontaneous formation of the COF/COF heterojunction interface and the active sites for overall water splitting.

         <title>Boosting the Quantum Efficiency of Ionic Carbon Nitrides in Photocatalytic H2O2 Evolution via Controllable n &#8594; &#960;* Electronic Transition Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable activation of n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition is presented to boost the photocatalytic H2O2 evolution in ionic carbon nitrides through the simultaneous introduction of structural distortions and defect sites. The best catalyst (2%Ox&#8208;KPHI) shows an apparent quantum yield of 41% at 410&#160;nm without the need for any cocatalysts, outperforming most previously reported carbon nitride&#8208;based photocatalysts.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a crucial chemical used in numerous industrial applications, yet its manufacturing relies on the energy&#8208;demanding anthraquinone process. Solar&#8208;driven synthesis of H2O2 is gaining traction as a promising research area, providing a sustainable method for its production. Herein, a controllable activation of n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition is presented to boost the photocatalytic H2O2 evolution in ionic carbon nitrides. This enhancement is achieved through the simultaneous introduction of structural distortions and defect sites (&#9472;C &#8801; N groups and N vacancies) into the KPHI framework. The optimal catalyst (2%Ox&#8208;KPHI) reached an apparent quantum yield of 41% at 410&#160;nm without the need for any cocatalysts, outperforming most previously reported carbon nitride&#8208;based photocatalysts. Extensive experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations confirm that a corrugated configuration and the presence of defects significantly broaden the light absorption profile, improve carrier separation and migration, promote O2 adsorption, and lower the energy barriers for H2O2 desorption. Transient absorption spectroscopy indicates that the enhanced photocatalytic performance of 2%Ox&#8208;KPHI is largely attributed to the preferential migration of electrons at defect sites over extended timescales, following the diffusion of geminate carriers across the PHI sheets.

CAT&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Macrophages
A roller, equipped with needle tires and loaded with CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms, traversed this road. CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms appear like graceful angels, clearing away DPP4+ fibroblasts and regulating the fibrotic phenotype of vascular endothelial cells. The &#8220;scarred road&#8221; undergoes a transformation into smooth and flat road following compaction by a roller. More details can be found in article number 2406153 by Wen Zeng and co&#8208;workers.

Self&#8208;Thermophoretic Nanomotor
Self&#8208;thermophoresis confers Z@P&#8208;F nanomotors motility to achieve enhanced deep tumor penetration and therapy. By releasing massive Fe2+ and H2O2, Z@P&#8208;F nanomotors continuously generate ROS in the tumor, thus eventually achieving effective tumor ferroptosis. More details can be found in article number 2412227 by Yingfeng Tu, Fei Peng, Hao Tian, and co&#8208;workers.

3D Bioprinting of Liquid High&#8208;Cell&#8208;Proportion Bioinks
In extrusion&#8208;based bioprinting, bioinks have long been subject to trade&#8208;offs between physicochemical properties and biological outcomes. Due to insufficient viscosity, liquid bioinks have been considered unprintable. In article number 2412127, Lei Shao, Yong He, Xueping Wang and co&#8208;workers developed a liquid granular bath that enables embedded 3D bioprinting of liquid, high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion bioinks to address this challenge.

         <title>Recent Progress on 3D Printing of Lightweight Metal Thin&#8208;Walled Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Additive manufacturing (AM) has become an integral part of industry to manufacture complex parts with a shorter turnaround time. Metal thin&#8208;walled structures are ubiquitous in many of these parts. This review aims to discuss the structure design of additively manufactured metal thin walls and the impact that thin walls have on the geometrical accuracy, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the part.








Abstract
Metal thin&#8208;walled structures are ubiquitous in various industrial applications and fabricating them through additive manufacturing (AM) enables intricate thin&#8208;wall geometries with no assembly required. However, additively manufactured metal thin walls suffer from increased heat accumulation and reduced structural stability, making it difficult to print geometrically accurate thin walls with minimal distortion and defects. Thin&#8208;walled structures also experience different thermal histories and solidification conditions compared to bulk structures, leading to drastic differences in the microstructure and mechanical properties. In this review article, the AM processing of metal thin&#8208;walled structures will be introduced. An in&#8208;depth discussion on the design strategies of additively manufactured metal thin walls will be presented regarding the restrictions imposed by the AM technology, the integration of thin walls in lightweight structures, and novel design ideation through topology optimization. The effects that the thin wall design has on the geometrical accuracy, microstructure, and mechanical properties will then be elucidated. The utilization of AM for fabricating metal thin walls across various industries will also be summarized. Finally, this review article will close on some perspectives and future work on the AM of metal thin&#8208;walled structures.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal thin-walled structures are ubiquitous in various industrial applications and fabricating them through additive manufacturing (AM) enables intricate thin-wall geometries with no assembly required. However, additively manufactured metal thin walls suffer from increased heat accumulation and reduced structural stability, making it difficult to print geometrically accurate thin walls with minimal distortion and defects. Thin-walled structures also experience different thermal histories and solidification conditions compared to bulk structures, leading to drastic differences in the microstructure and mechanical properties. In this review article, the AM processing of metal thin-walled structures will be introduced. An in-depth discussion on the design strategies of additively manufactured metal thin walls will be presented regarding the restrictions imposed by the AM technology, the integration of thin walls in lightweight structures, and novel design ideation through topology optimization.

         <title>Boosting Light&#8722;Matter Interactions in Plasmonic Nanogaps</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmonic nanogap systems enhance optical processes via antenna or cavity plasmon modes, which are influenced by gap morphology. Emitters such as self&#8208;assembled monolayer molecules, quantum dots, and 2D materials couple within the nanogaps. The resulting enhanced optical processes include Raman scattering, infrared absorption, nonlinear optics, photoluminescence, strong coupling, electroluminescence, and photochemistry.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanogaps in strongly coupled metal nanostructures can confine light to nanoscale regions, leading to huge electric field enhancement. This unique capability makes plasmonic nanogaps powerful platforms for boosting light&#8211;matter interactions, thereby enabling the rapid development of novel phenomena and applications. This review traces the progress of nanogap systems characterized by well&#8208;defined morphologies, controllable optical responses, and a focus on achieving extreme performance. The properties of plasmonic gap modes in far&#8208;field resonance and near&#8208;field enhancement are explored and a detailed comparative analysis of nanogap fabrication techniques down to sub&#8208;nanometer scales is provided, including bottom&#8208;up, top&#8208;down, and their combined approaches. Additionally, recent advancements and applications across various frontier research areas are highlighted, including surface&#8208;enhanced spectroscopy, plasmon&#8208;exciton strong coupling, nonlinear optics, optoelectronic devices, and other applications beyond photonics. Finally, the challenges and promising emerging directions in the field are discussed, such as light&#8208;driven atomic effects, molecular optomechanics, and alternative new materials.

         <title>Multifunctional Strategies of Advanced Electrocatalysts for Efficient Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an in&#8208;depth exploration of engineering modification strategies for catalytic materials and their promising applications in C&#9472;N coupling for urea electrosynthesis. Additionally, it highlights the significance of integrating diverse modification strategies to improve the efficiency of C&#9472;N coupling in urea synthesis. Finally, the review evaluates the potential challenges and opportunities that catalytic materials for C&#9472;N coupling may encounter in the path toward future commercialization.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of nitrogenous species (such as N2, NO, NO2&#8722;, and NO3&#8722;) for urea synthesis under ambient conditions has been extensively studied due to their potential to realize carbon/nitrogen neutrality and mitigate environmental pollution, as well as provide a means to store renewable electricity generated from intermittent sources such as wind and solar power. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics and the scarcity of active sites on electrocatalysts have significantly hindered the advancement of their practical applications. Multifunctional engineering of electrocatalysts has been rationally designed and investigated to adjust their electronic structures, increase the density of active sites, and optimize the binding energies to enhance electrocatalytic performance. Here, surface engineering, defect engineering, doping engineering, and heterostructure engineering strategies for efficient nitrogen electro&#8208;reduction are comprehensively summarized. The role of each element in engineered electrocatalysts is elucidated at the atomic level, revealing the intrinsic active site, and understanding the relationship between atomic structure and catalytic performance. This review highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress of electrocatalytic reactions of waste nitrogenous species into urea. Moreover, this review outlines the challenges and opportunities for urea synthesis and aims to facilitate further research into the development of advanced electrocatalysts for a sustainable future.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Based Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a key green energy oxidant with growing interest. This review examines non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR), aiming to optimize H2O2 production through active site regulation, heterometallic effects, oxygen vacancy engineering, and local electronic environment. It suggests a future research direction for more advanced catalyst design.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a high&#8208;value chemical widely used in electronics, textiles, paper bleaching, medical disinfection, and wastewater treatment. Traditional production methods, such as the anthraquinone oxidation process and direct synthesis, require high energy consumption, and involve risks from toxic substances and explosions. Researchers are now exploring photochemical, electrochemical, and photoelectrochemical synthesis methods to reduce energy use and pollution. This review focuses on the 2&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) for the electrochemical synthesis of H2O2, and discusses how catalyst active sites influence O2 adsorption. Strategies to enhance H2O2 selectivity by regulating these sites are presented. Catalysts require strong O2 adsorption to initiate reactions and weak *OOH adsorption to promote H2O2 formation. The review also covers advances in single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), multi&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts, and highlights non&#8208;noble metal oxides, especially perovskite oxides, for their versatile structures and potential in 2e&#8722; ORR. The potential of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effects to enhance catalyst performance is also discussed. In conclusion, emphasis is placed on optimizing catalyst structures through theoretical and experimental methods to achieve efficient and selective H2O2 production, aiming for sustainable and commercial applications.

         <title>Breathable and Stretchable Epidermal Electronics for Health Management: Recent Advances and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the latest advancements in stretchable and breathable epidermal electronics for personalized healthcare. It examines the design principles, fabrication techniques, and practical applications of porous substrates, highlighting their advantages in terms of breathability, biocompatibility, and mechanical robustness. Key challenges and future directions for developing high&#8208;performance on&#8208;skin electronics are also discussed.








Abstract
Advanced epidermal electronic devices, capable of real&#8208;time monitoring of physical, physiological, and biochemical signals and administering appropriate therapeutics, are revolutionizing personalized healthcare technology. However, conventional portable electronic devices are predominantly constructed from impermeable and rigid materials, which thus leads to the mechanical and biochemical disparities between the devices and human tissues, resulting in skin irritation, tissue damage, compromised signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR), and limited operational lifespans. To address these limitations, a new generation of wearable on&#8208;skin electronics built on stretchable and porous substrates has emerged. These substrates offer significant advantages including breathability, conformability, biocompatibility, and mechanical robustness, thus providing solutions for the aforementioned challenges.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced epidermal electronic devices, capable of real-time monitoring of physical, physiological, and biochemical signals and administering appropriate therapeutics, are revolutionizing personalized healthcare technology. However, conventional portable electronic devices are predominantly constructed from impermeable and rigid materials, which thus leads to the mechanical and biochemical disparities between the devices and human tissues, resulting in skin irritation, tissue damage, compromised signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and limited operational lifespans. To address these limitations, a new generation of wearable on-skin electronics built on stretchable and porous substrates has emerged. These substrates offer significant advantages including breathability, conformability, biocompatibility, and mechanical robustness, thus providing solutions for the aforementioned challenges. However, given their diverse nature and varying application scenarios, the careful selection and engineering of suitable substrates is paramount when developing high-performance on-skin electronics tailored to specific applications. This comprehensive review begins with an overview of various stretchable porous substrates, specifically focusing on their fundamental design principles, fabrication processes, and practical applications. Subsequently, a concise comparison of various methods is offered to fabricate epidermal electronics by applying these porous substrates. Following these, the latest advancements and applications of these electronics are highlighted. Finally, the current challenges are summarized and potential future directions in this dynamic field are explored.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Inorganic Nanomaterials Characterized by Advanced TEM: A Qualitative and Quantitative Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Focusing on chiral inorganic nanomaterials (CINMs), this review elucidates how advanced TEM techniques facilitate precise qualitative analysis of CINMs, including chiral atomic&#8208;level features, 0D, 1D, and 2D nanocrystals, and assemblies. It also highlights quantitative methods for determining chirality, such as 3D electron tomography, and discusses the evolution of chiral structures as monitored by the ex situ and in situ TEM technologies.








Abstract
Chiral inorganic nanomaterials (CINMs) have garnered significant interest due to their exceptional optical, electronic, and catalytic properties, offering promising advancements in energy conversion, data storage, catalysis, and biomedicine. While traditional optical spectrophotometers reveal the chiroptical performance of CINMs on an ensemble level, the direct structural visualization for the qualitative and quantitative discernment of their chiral features has become increasingly distinct with the advancements of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. The need for reasonable and high&#8208;standard discrimination requirements of CINMs has driven the progress of chirality&#8208;based TEM technologies. Therefore, this review in the good season takes the initiative to summarize the current advancements in TEM technologies for CINMs characterization, emphasizing a qualitative analysis of chiral atomic&#8208;level features, 0D, 1D, and 2D nanocrystals, and assembled nanomaterials. Then, the quantitative methods for determining chirality is also highlighted, such as 3D electron tomography, and further address the evolution of chiral structures monitored by the Ex&#8208;situ and In&#8208;situ TEM technologies. By providing a roadmap for the current challenges and proposing future advancements in TEM technologies for the qualitative, quantitative, and real&#8208;time analysis of CINMs, it can drive innovations in the field of chiral nanomaterials as well as the development of TEM technologies.

         <title>Sensing Interfaces Engineering for Organic Thin Film Transistors&#8208;Based Biosensors: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs)&#8208;based biosensors are fascinating due to their properties of low cost, label&#8208;free, and inherent signal amplification. The review provides a comprehensive and timely review of optimization in sensing interface engineering, and how efficient immobilization of biological sensing probes on sensing interfaces can contribute to the development of high&#8208;performance OTFTs&#8208;based biosensors.








Abstract
Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) enable rapid and label&#8208;free high&#8208;sensitivity detection of target analytes due to their low cost, large&#8208;area processing, biocompatibility, and inherent signal amplification. At the same time, the freedom of synthesis, tailorability, and functionalization of organic semiconductor materials and their ability to be combined with flexible substrates make them one of the ideal platforms for biosensing. However, OTFTs&#8208;based biosensors still face significant challenges, such as unexpected surface adsorption, disordered conformation, inhomogeneous graft density, and flexibility of probe molecules that biological sensing probes would face during immobilization. In this review, efficient immobilization strategies based on OTFTs biological sensing probes developed in the last 5 years are highlighted. First, the biosensors are classified according to their sensing interface. Second, a comprehensive discussion of the types of biological sensing probes is presented. Third, three commonly used methods for immobilizing biological sensing probes and their challenges are briefly described. Finally, the applications of OTFTs&#8208;based biosensors for liquid phase detection are summarized. This review provides a comprehensive and timely review of optimization in sensing interface engineering so that efficient immobilization of biological sensing probes with sensing interfaces will contribute to the development of high&#8208;performance OTFTs&#8208;based biosensors.
