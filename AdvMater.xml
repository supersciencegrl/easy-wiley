      <title>Locomotion of Miniature Soft Robots</title>
      <dc:description>
Miniature soft robots are made of smart materials that can be actuated by external stimuli to realize their desired functionalities. Here, critical analyses and discussions on the locomotion producible by soft robots in micro&#8208; to centimeter length scales are provided. It is envisioned that this progress report can inspire future development of miniature soft robots that can be significantly more dexterous and robust.








Abstract
Miniature soft robots are mobile devices, which are made of smart materials that can be actuated by external stimuli to realize their desired functionalities. Here, the key advancements and challenges of the locomotion producible by miniature soft robots in micro&#8208; to centimeter length scales are highlighted. It is highly desirable to endow these small machines with dexterous locomotive gaits as it enables them to easily access highly confined and enclosed spaces via a noninvasive manner. If miniature soft robots are able to capitalize this unique ability, they will have the potential to transform a vast range of applications, including but not limited to, minimally invasive medical treatments, lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip applications, and search&#8208;and&#8208;rescue missions. The gaits of miniature soft robots are categorized into terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial locomotion. Except for the centimeter&#8208;scale robots that can perform aerial locomotion, the discussions in this report are centered around soft robots that are in the micro&#8208; to millimeter length scales. Under each category of locomotion, prospective methods and strategies that can improve their gait performances are also discussed. This report provides critical analyses and discussions that can inspire future strategies to make miniature soft robots significantly more agile.

      <dc:description>
In future, robots will be seamlessly integrated in everyday life and&#8212;as much as consumer electronics is omnipresent today&#8212;assist in a myriad of tasks. However, environmental concerns at their end&#8208;of&#8208;life phase necessitate sustainable solutions for actuators, energy storage, electronics, and all involved materials.

Abstract
The advancement of technology has a profound and far&#8208;reaching impact on the society, now penetrating all areas of life. From cradle to grave, one is supported by and depends on a wide range of electronic and robotic appliances, with an ever more intimate integration of the digital and biological spheres. These advances, however, often come at the price of negatively impacting our ecosystem, with growing demands on energy, contributions to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution&#8212;from production to improper disposal. Mitigating these adverse effects is among the grand challenges of the society and at the forefront of materials research. The currently emerging forms of soft, biologically inspired electronics and robotics have the unique potential of becoming not only like their natural antitypes in performance and capabilities, but also in terms of their ecological footprint. This review outlines the rise of sustainable materials in soft and bioinspired robotics, targeting all robotic components from actuators to energy storage and electronics. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in biobased robotics spans flourishing fields and applications ranging from microbots operating in vivo to biohybrid machines and fully biodegradable yet resilient actuators.

      <title>Tunnel Intergrowth LixMnO2 Nanosheet Arrays as 3D Cathode for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Thin Film Lithium Microbatteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Tunnel intergrowth LixMnO2 nanosheet arrays consisting of alternating 1 &#215; 3 and 1 &#215; 2 tunnels are developed by a facile electrolyte Li+ ion infusion method at a low temperature of 180 &#176;C. Benefiting from the stable tunnel structure for the cathode and favorable architecture with abundant 3D cathode/electrolyte interface, the constructed LixMnO2/LiPON/Li thin film battery achieves large specific capacity and outstanding cycle life.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state thin film lithium batteries (TFBs) are proposed as the ideal power sources for microelectronic devices. However, the high&#8208;temperature (&gt;500 &#176;C) annealing process of cathode films, such as LiCoO2 and LiMn2O4, restricts the on&#8208;chip integration and potential applications of TFBs. Herein, tunnel structured LixMnO2 nanosheet arrays are fabricated as 3D cathode for TFBs by a facile electrolyte Li+ ion infusion method at very low temperature of 180 &#176;C. Featuring an interesting tunnel intergrowth structure consisting of alternating 1 &#215; 3 and 1 &#215; 2 tunnels, the LixMnO2 cathode shows high specific capacity with good structural stability between 2.0 and 4.3 V (vs. Li+/Li). By utilizing the 3D LixMnO2 cathode, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LixMnO2/LiPON/Li TFB (3DLMO&#8208;TFB) has been successfully constructed with prominent advantages of greatly enriched cathode/electrolyte interface and shortened Li+ diffusion length in the 3D structure. Consequently, the 3DLMO&#8208;TFB device exhibits large specific capacity (185 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50 mA g&#8722;1), good rate performance, and excellent cycle performance (81.3% capacity retention after 1000 cycles), outperforming the TFBs using spinel LiMn2O4 thin film cathodes fabricated at high temperature. Importantly, the low&#8208;temperature preparation of high&#8208;performance cathode film enables the fabrication of TFBs on various rigid and flexible substrates, which could greatly expand their potential applications in microelectronics.

      <title>Extremely Fast Optical and Nonvolatile Control of Mixed&#8208;Phase Multiferroic BiFeO3 via Instantaneous Strain Perturbation</title>
      <dc:description>
All&#8208;optical manipulation of the complex phases and domain structures in multiferroic BiFeO3 thin films on ultrafast timescale is demonstrated by adoption of extremely short light pulses. The configuration of large&#8208;area optically written domains can be controlled by tuning the competing elastic and electrostatic energies. These results offer a novel route for development of all&#8208;optical switchable devices and high&#8208;speed multifunctional optoelectronics.








Abstract
Multiferroics&#8212;materials that exhibit coupled ferroic orders&#8212;are considered to be one of the most promising candidate material systems for next&#8208;generation spintronics, memory, low&#8208;power nanoelectronics and so on. To advance potential applications, approaches that lead to persistent and extremely fast functional property changes are in demand. Herein, it is revealed that the phase transition and the correlated ferroic orders in multiferroic BiFeO3 (BFO) can be modulated via illumination of single short/ultrashort light pulses. Heat transport simulations and ultrafast optical pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy reveal that the transient strain induced by light pulses plays a key role in determining the persistent final states. Having identified the diffusionless phase transformation features via scanning transmission electron microscopy, sequential laser pulse illumination is further demonstrated to perform large&#8208;area phase and domain manipulation in a deterministic way. The work contributes to all&#8208;optical and rapid nonvolatile control of multiferroicity, offering different routes while designing novel optoelectronics.

      <title>Anharmonicity&#8208;Driven Rashba Cohelical Excitons Break Quantum Efficiency Limitation</title>
      <dc:description>
An emission mechanism of lead halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLED) is revealed in which A&#8208;site cation disorder caused by unstable non&#8208;centrosymmetric vibrations plays a crucial role. The subsequent disorder of A&#8208;site cation leads to Rashba spin&#8208;orbit coupling and the lowest&#8208;lying bright cohelical exciton state. This allows for PeLED to overcome the internal 25% efficiency limitation of closed&#8208;shell LEDs.








Abstract
Closed&#8208;shell light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) suffer from the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) limitation imposed by optically inactive triplet excitons. Here, an unrevealed emission mechanism of lead halide perovskites (LHPs) APbX3 (A&#160;=&#160;Cs/CN2H5; X&#160;=&#160;Cl/Br/I) that circumvents the efficiency limit of closed&#8208;shell LEDs is explored. Though efficient emission is prohibited by optically inactive J&#160;=&#160;0 in inversion symmetric LHPs, the anharmonicity arising from stereochemistry of Pb and resonant orbital&#8208;bonding network along the imaginary A+&#8230;X&#8722;(T1u) transverse optical (TO) modes, breaks inversion symmetry, introducing disorder and Rashba&#8211;Dresselhaus spin&#8208;orbit coupling (RD&#8208;SOC). This results in bright cohelical and dark antihelical excitons. Many&#8208;body theory and first&#8208;principles calculations show that the optically active cohelical exciton is the lowest excited state in organic/inorganic LHPs. Thus, RD&#8208;SOC can drive to achieve the ideal 50% IQE by utilizing anharmonicity, much over the 25% IQE limitation for closed&#8208;shell LEDs.

      <title>Direct Magnetic Reinforcement of Electrocatalytic ORR/OER with Electromagnetic Induction of Magnetic Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
An external magnetic field increases the probability of spin polarization of magnetic metal nanoparticles and thus can enhance their oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER) catalytic activity. In this paper, carbon&#8208;based bifunctional catalysts of magnetic catalytic nanocages are fabricated by uniformly embedding cobalt nanoparticles into macroporous carbon nanofibers. The direct magnetic enhancement is verified by investigating the electrocatalytic ORR/OER performance under an external magnetic field.








Abstract
Designing stable and efficient electrocatalysts for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) at low&#8208;cost is challenging. Here, a carbon&#8208;based bifunctional catalyst of magnetic catalytic nanocages that can direct enhance the oxygen catalytic activity by simply applying a moderate (350 mT) magnetic field is reported. The catalysts, with high porosity of 90% and conductivity of 905 S m&#8722;1, are created by in situ doping metallic cobalt nanodots (&#8776;10&#160;nm) into macroporous carbon nanofibers with a facile electrospinning method. An external magnetic field makes the cobalt magnetized into nanomagnets with high spin polarization, which promote the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;intermediates and electron transfer, significantly improving the catalytic efficiency. Impressively, the half wave&#8208;potential is increased by 20&#160;mV for ORR, and the overpotential at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is decreased by 15&#160;mV for OER. Compared with the commercial Pt/C+IrO2 catalysts, the magnetic catalyzed Zn&#8211;air batteries deliver 2.5&#8208;fold of capacities and exhibit much longer durability over 155 h. The findings point out a very promising strategy of using electromagnetic induction to boost oxygen catalytic activity.

      <title>Water&#8208;Surface Drag Coating: A New Route Toward High&#8208;Quality Conjugated Small&#8208;Molecule Thin Films with Enhanced Charge Transport Properties</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel water&#8208;surface drag coating method is developed for large&#8208;area fabrication of high&#8208;quality conjugated small&#8208;molecule thin films with enhanced charge transport properties. 2,8&#8208;Difluoro&#8208;5,11&#8208;bis(triethylsilylethynyl)anthradithiophene thin films with millimeter&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystal domains and pure crystallographic orientations are realized, showing a significant enhancement (4.7 times) of carrier mobility compared to that of thin films fabricated by the conventional solution&#8208;coating method.








Abstract
Electronic properties of organic semiconductor (OSC) thin films are largely determined by their morphologies and crystallinities. However, solution&#8208;processed conjugated small&#8208;molecule OSC thin films usually exhibit abundant grain boundaries and impure grain orientations because of complex fluid dynamics during solution coating. Here, a novel methodology, water&#8208;surface drag coating, is demonstrated to fabricate high&#8208;quality OSC thin films with greatly enhanced charge transport properties. This method utilizes the water surface to alter the evaporation dynamics of solution to enlarge the grain size, and a unique drag&#8208;coating process to achieve the unidirectional growth of organic crystals. Using 2,8&#8208;difluoro&#8208;5,11&#8208;bis(triethylsilylethynyl)anthradithiophene (Dif&#8208;TES&#8208;ADT) as an example, thin films with millimeter&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystal domains and pure crystallographic orientations are achieved, revealing a significant enhancement (4.7 times) of carrier mobility. More importantly, the resulting film can be directly transferred onto any desired flexible substrates, and flexible transistors based on the Dif&#8208;TES&#8208;ADT thin films show a mobility as high as 16.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which represents the highest mobility value for the flexible transistors reported thus far. The method is general for the growth of various high&#8208;quality OSC thin films, thus opening up opportunities for high&#8208;performance organic flexible electronics.

      <title>Biomaterials and 3D Bioprinting Strategies to Model Glioblastoma and the Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress on 3D&#8208;bioprinted models of glioblastoma and the blood&#8211;brain barrier are reviewed. In order to inform future design and implementation of 3D modeling, cellular and extracellular matrix components of the native tissue microenvironments, relevant natural and synthetic biomaterials and various 3D bioprinting strategies are discussed in detail.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and lethal adult primary central nervous system cancer. An immunosuppresive and highly heterogeneous tumor microenvironment, restricted delivery of chemotherapy or immunotherapy through the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), together with the brain's unique biochemical and anatomical features result in its universal recurrence and poor prognosis. As conventional models fail to predict therapeutic efficacy in GBM, in vitro 3D models of GBM and BBB leveraging patient&#8208; or healthy&#8208;individual&#8208;derived cells and biomaterials through 3D bioprinting technologies potentially mimic essential physiological and pathological features of GBM and BBB. 3D&#8208;bioprinted constructs enable investigation of cellular and cell&#8211;extracellular matrix interactions in a species&#8208;matched, high&#8208;throughput, and reproducible manner, serving as screening or drug delivery platforms. Here, an overview of current 3D&#8208;bioprinted GBM and BBB models is provided, elaborating on the microenvironmental compositions of GBM and BBB, relevant biomaterials to mimic the native tissues, and bioprinting strategies to implement the model fabrication. Collectively, 3D&#8208;bioprinted GBM and BBB models are promising systems and biomimetic alternatives to traditional models for more reliable mechanistic studies and preclinical drug screenings that may eventually accelerate the drug development process for GBM.

      <title>A High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Battery with Ion&#8208;Selective Nanofluidic Transport in a Conjugated Microporous Polymer Protective Layer</title>
      <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;processable conjugated microporous polymers are developed as protective layers for lithium anodes to achieve high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries with a long cycle life. A pouch cell fabricated using CMP&#8208;modified lithium foil achieves an energy density exceeding 400 Wh kg&#8722;1 and cycle stability &gt;65 cycles.








Abstract
Lithium metal is the &#8220;holy grail&#8221; of anodes, capable of unlocking the full potential of cathodes in next&#8208;generation batteries. However, the use of pure lithium anodes faces several challenges in terms of safety, cycle life, and rate capability. Herein, a solution&#8208;processable conjugated microporous thermosetting polymer (CMP) is developed. The CMP can be further converted into a large&#8208;scale membrane with nanofluidic channels (5&#8211;6 &#197;). These channels can serve as facile and selective Li&#8208;ion diffusion pathways on the surfaces of lithium anodes, thereby ensuring stable lithium stripping/plating even at high areal current densities. CMP&#8208;modified lithium anodes (CMP&#8208;Li) exhibit cycle stability of 2550 h at an areal current density of 20 mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, CMP is readily amenable to solution&#8208;processing and spray coating, rendering it highly applicable to continuous roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll lithium metal treatment processes. Pouch cells with CMP&#8208;Li as the anode and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) as the cathode exhibits a stable energy density of 400 Wh kg&#8722;1.

      <title>In Operando Modulation of Rectification in Molecular Tunneling Junctions Comprising Reconfigurable Molecular Self&#8208;Assemblies</title>
      <dc:description>
Large&#8208;area molecular tunneling junctions embedded in microfluidic channels convert information encoded in chemical packets into electrical signals by reconstituting themselves through chemical exchange while in operation.








Abstract
The reconfiguration of molecular tunneling junctions during operation via the self&#8208;assembly of bilayers of glycol ethers is described. Well&#8208;established functional groups are used to modulate the magnitude and direction of rectification in assembled tunneling junctions by exposing them to solutions containing different glycol ethers. Variable&#8208;temperature measurements confirm that rectification occurs by the expected bias&#8208;dependent tunneling&#8211;hopping mechanism for these functional groups and that glycol ethers, besides being an unusually efficient tunneling medium, behave similarly to alkanes. Memory bits are fabricated from crossbar junctions prepared by injecting eutectic Ga&#8211;In (EGaIn) into microfluidic channels. The states of two 8&#8208;bit registers were set by trains of droplets such that they are able to perform logical AND operations on bit strings encoded into chemical packets that alter the composition of the crossbar junctions through self&#8208;assembly to effect memristor&#8208;like properties. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept work demonstrates the potential for fieldable devices based on molecular tunneling junctions comprising self&#8208;assembled monolayers and&#160;bilayers.

      <title>2D Polarized Materials: Ferromagnetic, Ferrovalley, Ferroelectric Materials, and Related Heterostructures</title>
      <dc:description>
The distinct physical origin of 2D polarizations and modulation on degrees of freedom are comprehensively summarized based on the hysteresis behaviors and interface effects. The novel multifunctional polarized devices are discussed, from which perspectives and guidelines are proposed for developing the &#8220;Beyond Moore&#8221; integrated devices and circuits.








Abstract
The emergence of 2D polarized materials, including ferromagnetic, ferrovalley, and ferroelectric materials, has demonstrated unique quantum behaviors at atomic scales. These polarization behaviors are tightly bonded to the new degrees of freedom (DOFs) for next generation information storage and processing, which have been dramatically developed in the past few years. Here, the basic 2D polarized materials system and related devices&#8217; application in spintronics, valleytronics, and electronics are reviewed. Specifically, the underlying physical mechanism accompanied with symmetry broken theory and the modulation process through heterostructure engineering are highlighted. These summarized works focusing on the 2D polarization would continue to enrich the cognition of 2D quantum system and promising practical applications.

      <title>3D&#8208;Bioprinted Inflammation Modulating Polymer Scaffolds for Soft Tissue Repair</title>
      <dc:description>
An intrinsic inflammation modulating bioscaffold is developed by 3D&#8208;bioprinting for the surgical soft tissue repair. The bioscaffold is designed to sequester proinflammatory cytokines and acts as an inflammation trap. The in vivo studies in rat ventral hernia model have demonstrated the enhanced efficacy of the bioscaffold by inhibiting visceral adhesions formation and minimizing postsurgical complications.








Abstract
Development of inflammation modulating polymer scaffolds for soft tissue repair with minimal postsurgical complications is a compelling clinical need. However, the current standard of care soft tissue repair meshes for hernia repair is highly inflammatory and initiates a dysregulated inflammatory process causing visceral adhesions and postsurgical complications. Herein, the development of an inflammation modulating biomaterial scaffold (bioscaffold) for soft tissue repair is presented. The bioscaffold design is based on the idea that, if the excess proinflammatory cytokines are sequestered from the site of injury by the surgical implantation of a bioscaffold, the inflammatory response can be modulated, and the visceral adhesion formations and postsurgical complications can be minimized. The bioscaffold is fabricated by 3D&#8208;bioprinting of an in situ phosphate crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) polymer. In vivo efficacy of the bioscaffold is evaluated in a rat ventral hernia model. In vivo proinflammatory cytokine expression analysis and histopathological analysis of the tissues have confirmed that the bioscaffold acts as an inflammation trap and captures the proinflammatory cytokines secreted at the implant site and effectively modulates the local inflammation without the need for exogenous anti&#8208;inflammatory agents. The bioscaffold is very effective in inhibiting visceral adhesions formation and minimizing postsurgical complications.

      <title>Second Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermal Semiconducting Polymer Nanoadjuvant for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
A second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal semiconducting polymer nanoadjuvant is developed for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. Upon NIR&#8208;II photoirradiation, the nanoadjuvant exerts photothermal effect to induce immunogenic cell death and on&#8208;demand release of toll&#8208;like receptor agonist, which enhances dendritic cell maturation. A synergistic action of photothermal immunotherapy thus occurs to inhibit the growth of primary and distant tumors and eliminate lung metastasis.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has offered new treatment options for cancer; however, the therapeutic benefits are often modest and desired to be improved. A semiconducting polymer nanoadjuvant (SPNIIR) with a photothermally triggered cargo release for second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal immunotherapy is reported here. SPNIIR consists of a semiconducting polymer nanoparticle core as an NIR&#8208;II photothermal converter, which is doped with a toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR) agonist as an immunotherapy adjuvant and coated with a thermally responsive lipid shell. Upon NIR&#8208;II photoirradiation, SPNIIR effectively generates heat not only to ablate tumors and induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), but also to melt the lipid layers for on&#8208;demand release of the TLR agonist. The combination of ICD and activation of TLR7/TLR8 enhances the maturation of dendritic cells, which amplifies anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. Thus, a single treatment of SPNIIR&#8208;mediated NIR&#8208;II photothermal immunotherapy effectively inhibits growth of both primary and distant tumors and eliminates lung metastasis in a murine mouse model. This study thus provides a remote&#8208;controlled smart delivery system to synergize photomedicine with immunotherapy for enhanced cancer treatment.

      <title>Recognition and Removal of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; by a Heteromultivalent Macrocyclic Coassembly: A Potential Strategy for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
      <dc:description>
A heteromultivalent coassembly composed of cyclodextrin and calixarene (CD&#8211;CA coassembly) according to the composition of amino acids in A&#946;1&#8208;42 effectively recognizes and disaggregates A&#946;1&#8208;42 fibrils. Intranasal administration of the CD&#8211;CA coassembly eliminates amyloid plaque and neurodegeneration in the brain, and improves cognitive deficits in 5xFAD mice. This supramolecular approach is a promising novel strategy for treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).








Abstract
The imbalance of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) production and clearance causes aggregation of A&#946;1&#8208;42 monomers to form fibrils and amyloid plaques, which is an indispensable process in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and eventually leads to pathological changes and cognitive impairment. Consequently, A&#946;1&#8208;42 is the most important target for the treatment of AD. However, developing a single treatment method that can recognize A&#946;1&#8208;42, inhibit A&#946;1&#8208;42 fibrillation, eliminate amyloid plaques, improve cognitive impairments, and alleviate AD&#8208;like pathology is challenging. Here, a coassembly composed of cyclodextrin (CD) and calixarene (CA) is designed, and it is used as an anti&#8208;A&#946; therapy agent. The CD&#8211;CA coassembly is based on the previously reported heteromultivalent recognition strategy and is able to successfully eliminate amyloid plaques and degrade A&#946;1&#8208;42 monomers in 5xFAD mice. More importantly, the coassembly improves recognition and spatial cognition deficits, and synaptic plasticity impairment in the 5xFAD mice. In addition, the coassembly ameliorates AD&#8208;like pathology including prevention of neuronal apoptosis and oxidant stress, and alteration of M1/M2 microglial polarization states. This supramolecular approach makes full use of both molecular recognition and self&#8208;assembly of macrocyclic amphiphiles, and is a promising novel strategy for AD treatment.

      <title>Nanomaterials Facilitating Microbial Extracellular Electron Transfer at Interfaces</title>
      <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;electrochemical systems (BESs) harnessing the microbial extracellular electron transfer (EET) process have attracted worldwide interest. Recent advances in nanomaterials facilitating EET at both the bacteria&#8211;electrode and the biotic interface are summarized. The behavior of nanomaterials in different EET routes and their influence on BESs performance are described, which will guide rational design of EET&#8208;related materials and better understanding of EET mechanisms.








Abstract
Electrochemically active bacteria can transport their metabolically generated electrons to anodes, or accept electrons from cathodes to synthesize high&#8208;value chemicals and fuels, via a process known as extracellular electron transfer (EET). Harnessing of this microbial EET process has led to the development of microbial bio&#8208;electrochemical systems (BESs), which can achieve the interconversion of electrical and chemical energy and enable electricity generation, hydrogen production, electrosynthesis, wastewater treatment, desalination, water and soil remediation, and sensing. Here, the focus is on the current understanding of the microbial EET process occurring at both the bacteria&#8211;electrode interface and the biotic interface, as well as some attempts to improve the EET by using various nanomaterials. The behavior of nanomaterials in different EET routes and their influence on the performance of BESs are described. The inherent mechanisms will guide rational design of EET&#8208;related materials and lead to a better understanding of EET mechanisms.

&lt;p&gt;Bio&#8208;electrochemical systems (BESs) harnessing the microbial extracellular electron transfer (EET) process have attracted worldwide interest. Recent advances in nanomaterials facilitating EET at both the bacteria&#8211;electrode and the biotic interface are summarized. The behavior of nanomaterials in different EET routes and their influence on BESs performance are described, which will guide rational design of EET&#8208;related materials and better understanding of EET mechanisms.

      <title>Assembly of Multi&#8208;Spheroid Cellular Architectures by Programmable Droplet Merging</title>
      <dc:description>
Artificial multicellular systems allow biological structures and behavior to be reconstituted in vitro in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In this work, a programmable droplet merging method is demonstrated for high&#8208;throughput generation of complex multi&#8208;spheroidal cellular architectures. The potential of this methodology is validated by studying the propagation of Wnt signaling within hetero&#8208;spheroids.








Abstract
Artificial multicellular systems are gaining importance in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Reconstruction of complex tissue architectures in vitro is nevertheless challenging, and methods permitting controllable and high&#8208;throughput fabrication of complex multicellular architectures are needed. Here, a facile and high&#8208;throughput method is developed based on a tunable droplet&#8208;fusion technique, allowing programmed assembly of multiple cell spheroids into complex multicellular architectures. The droplet&#8208;fusion technique allows for construction of various multicellular architectures (double&#8208;spheroids, multi&#8208;spheroids, hetero&#8208;spheroids) in a miniaturized high&#8208;density array format. As an example of application, the propagation of Wnt signaling is investigated within hetero&#8208;spheroids formed from two fused Wnt&#8208;releasing and Wnt&#8208;reporter cell spheroids. The developed method provides an approach for miniaturized, high&#8208;throughput construction of complex 3D multicellular architectures and can be applied for studying various biological processes including cell signaling, cancer invasion, embryogenesis, and neural development.

      <title>Linear Electro&#8208;Optic Modulation in Highly Polarizable Organic Perovskites</title>
      <dc:description>
The linear electro&#8208;optic (EO) effect in organic perovskites is demonstrated. The crystal structures and polarizability can be modified by the rational design of the organic components to realize an enhancement of the EO performance. This work provides a molecular perspective on the design of organic perovskites for EO modulation and new applications in nonlinear optics.








Abstract
Electrical&#8208;to&#8208;optical signal conversion is widely employed in information technology and is implemented using on&#8208;chip optical modulators. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art modulator technologies are incompatible with silicon manufacturing techniques: inorganic nonlinear crystals such as LiNbO3 are integrated with silicon photonic chips only using complex approaches, and hybrid silicon&#8211;LiNbO3 optical modulators show either low bandwidth or high operating voltage. Organic perovskites are solution&#8208;processed materials readily integrated with silicon photonics; and organic molecules embedded within the perovskite scaffold allow in principle for high polarizability. However, it is found that the large molecules required for high polarizability also require an increase of the size of the perovskite cavity: specifically, using the highly polarizable DR2+ (R = H, F, Cl) in the A site necessitates the exploration of new X&#8208;site options. Only by introducing BF4&#8211; as the X&#8208;site molecule is it possible to synthesize (DCl)(NH4)(BF4)3, a material exhibiting a linear EO coefficient of 20 pm V&#8211;1, which is 10 times higher than that of metal halide perovskites and is a 1.5 fold enhancement compared to reported organic perovskites. The EO response of the organic perovskite approaches that of LiNbO3 (reff&#160;&#8776; 30 pm V&#8211;1) and highlights the promise of rationally designed organic perovskites for use in efficient EO modulators.

      <title>Vaccines: SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RBD Neutralizing Antibody Induction is Enhanced by Particulate Vaccination (Adv. Mater. 50/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2005637, Jonathan F. Lovell and co&#8208;workers show that the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RBD surface protein becomes a potent immunogen when presented in nanoparticle format. Using a vaccine adjuvant that spontaneously converts soluble recombinant antigens into stable particles, immunization studies in mice and rabbits shows that the particle&#8208;based RBD elicits strong immune responses and potent antibodies capable of neutralizing the virus.

In article number 2002471, Antonio Tricoli and co&#8208;workers use the scale&#8208;invariant features of fractals obtained by Brownian motion for the realization of a tunable family of photonic metamaterials consisting of a 3D distribution of plasmonic and semiconductor nanoparticles. The short&#8208; and long&#8208;range periodicity of these fractal metamaterials enables advanced light&#8211;matter&#8211;fluid interaction and, when used for optical sensing of volatile molecules, they demonstrate an outstanding room&#8208;temperature sensitivity.

      <title>Flexible Ferroelectrics: Periodic Wrinkle&#8208;Patterned Single&#8208;Crystalline Ferroelectric Oxide Membranes with Enhanced Piezoelectricity (Adv. Mater. 50/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2004477, Ziyao Zhou, Xiangdong Ding, Tai Min, Ming Liu, and  co&#8208;workers present a periodically wrinkled structure that combines flexible ferroelectric membranes and organic elastomers. Enhanced piezoelectricity is observed at the sites  of the peaks and valleys of the wrinkles where the largest strain gradient is generated. The wrinkle&#8208;patterned ferroelectric membranes offer an ideal platform to explore the  periodic&#8208;electric&#8208;potential&#8208;induced functions in flexible electrical and optical devices.

      <title>Topological Materials: Criteria for Realizing Room&#8208;Temperature Electrical Transport Applications of Topological Materials (Adv. Mater. 50/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
The unusual properties exhibited by topological materials, such as 1D edge states that are spin&#8208;polarized, can enable routes to faster data processing with lower energy consumption. To realize such technologies, however, it is required that unwanted parallel bulk conduction through the trivial 2D/3D states is eliminated. In article number 2005698, Matthew Brahlek shows that redesigning materials at the atomic level to delicately balance bandgap, dielectric constant, and effective mass is critical to achieve this new generation of quantum&#8208;based technologies.

      <title>Colors of Single&#8208;Wall Carbon Nanotubes</title>
      <dc:description>
Colors of 466 species of single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are revealed by experiments on clean dry thin films and modeling of the carbon nanotube absorbance spectra. A quantitative coloration model of SWCNTs is proposed and is verified by existing experimental data. This model predicts the existence of brilliantly colored carbon nanotube films that can display the full rainbow.








Abstract
Although single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) exhibit various colors in suspension, directly synthesized SWCNT films usually appear black. Recently, a unique one&#8208;step method for directly fabricating green and brown films has been developed. Such remarkable progress, however, has brought up several new questions. The coloration mechanism, potentially achievable colors, and color controllability of SWCNTs are unknown. Here, a quantitative model is reported that can predict the specific colors of SWCNT films and unambiguously identify the coloration mechanism. Using this model, colors of 466 different SWCNT species are calculated, which reveals a broad spectrum of potentially achievable colors of SWCNTs. The calculated colors are in excellent agreement with existing experimental data. Furthermore, the theory predicts the existence of many brilliantly colored SWCNT films, which are experimentally expected. This study shows that SWCNTs as a form of pure carbon, can display a full spectrum of vivid colors, which is expected to complement the general understanding of carbon materials.

      <title>Recent Progress in Solution&#8208;Based Metal Oxide Resistive Switching Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;based metal oxide thin films allow the achievement of ultra&#8208;low power and high&#8208;density resistive switching devices by using low&#8208;cost and simple processes being compatible with large area manufacturing required by internet of things. To enhance the performance of solution&#8208;based resistive random&#8208;access memory (S&#8208;RRAM) some challenges such as stability and reproducibility can be surpassed by controlling the metal oxide synthesis parameters.








Abstract
Metal oxide resistive switching memories have been a crucial component for the requirements of the Internet of Things, which demands ultra&#8208;low power and high&#8208;density devices with new computing principles, exploiting low cost green products and technologies. Most of the reported resistive switching devices use conventional methods (physical and chemical vapor deposition), which are quite expensive due to their up&#8208;scale production. Solution&#8208;processing methods have been improved, being now a reliable technology that offers many advantages for resistive random&#8208;access memory (RRAM) such as high versatility, large area uniformity, transparency, low&#8208;cost and a simple fabrication of two&#8208;terminal structures. Solution&#8208;based metal oxide RRAM devices are emergent and promising non&#8208;volatile memories for future electronics. In this review, a brief history of non&#8208;volatile memories is highlighted as well as the present status of solution&#8208;based metal oxide resistive random&#8208;access memory (S&#8208;RRAM). Then, a focus on describing the solution synthesis parameters of S&#8208;RRAMs which induce a massive influence in the overall performance of these devices is discussed. Next, a precise analysis is performed on the metal oxide thin film and electrode interface and the recent advances on S&#8208;RRAM that will allow their large&#8208;area manufacturing. Finally, the figures of merit and the main challenges in S&#8208;RRAMs are discussed and future trends are proposed.

To enhance the performance of solution&#8208;based resistive random&#8208;access memory (S&#8208;RRAM) some challenges such as stability and reproducibility can be surpassed by controlling the metal oxide synthesis parameters.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal oxide resistive switching memories have been a crucial component for the requirements of the Internet of Things, which demands ultra&#8208;low power and high&#8208;density devices with new computing principles, exploiting low cost green products and technologies. Most of the reported resistive switching devices use conventional methods (physical and chemical vapor deposition), which are quite expensive due to their up&#8208;scale production. Solution&#8208;processing methods have been improved, being now a reliable technology that offers many advantages for resistive random&#8208;access memory (RRAM) such as high versatility, large area uniformity, transparency, low&#8208;cost and a simple fabrication of two&#8208;terminal structures. Solution&#8208;based metal oxide RRAM devices are emergent and promising non&#8208;volatile memories for future electronics. In this review, a brief history of non&#8208;volatile memories is highlighted as well as the present status of solution&#8208;based metal oxide resistive random&#8208;access memory (S&#8208;RRAM). Then, a focus on describing the solution synthesis parameters of S&#8208;RRAMs which induce a massive influence in the overall performance of these devices is discussed. Next, a precise analysis is performed on the metal oxide thin film and electrode interface and the recent advances on S&#8208;RRAM that will allow their large&#8208;area manufacturing. Finally, the figures of merit and the main challenges in S&#8208;RRAMs are discussed and future trends are proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ultrasoft and High&#8208;Mobility Block Copolymers for Skin&#8208;Compatible Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
Triblock copolymers (TBCs) comprising a high&#8208;performance polymer semiconductor endcapped with soft elastomeric chains can phase segregate on the nanoscale, while preserving the properties of the individual blocks. The TBCs are ultrasoft (5 MPa), electronically functional (0.1 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1), stretchable and durable, and maintain conductivity after 1500 cycles to 50% strain in a doped state.








Abstract
Polymer semiconductors (PSCs) are an essential component of organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), but their potential for stretchable electronics is limited by their brittleness and failure susceptibility upon strain. Herein, a covalent connection of two state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymers&#8212;semiconducting poly&#8208;diketo&#8208;pyrrolopyrrole&#8208;thienothiophene (PDPP&#8208;TT) and elastomeric poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)&#8212;in a single triblock copolymer (TBC) chain is reported, which enables high charge carrier mobility and low modulus in one system. Three TBCs containing up to 65 wt% PDMS were obtained, and the TBC with 65 wt% PDMS content exhibits mobilities up to 0.1 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, in the range of the fully conjugated reference polymer PDPP&#8208;TT (0.7 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1). The TBC is ultrasoft with a low elastic modulus (5 MPa) in the range of mammalian tissue. The TBC exhibits an excellent stretchability and extraordinary durability, fully maintaining the initial electric conductivity in a doped state after 1500 cycles to 50% strain.

      <title>Selective Ethanol Oxidation Reaction at the Rh&#8211;SnO2 Interface</title>
      <dc:description>
The Rh&#8211;SnO2 interface can be used as a highly active and selective site for ethanol oxidation to form CO2, where the strong synergy at the Rh&#8211;SnO2 interface significantly facilitates both electron transfer from the Rh to the Sn species and oxidation of the poisonous intermediates, leading to improved selectivity to the C1 pathway and excellent durability for the ethanol oxidation reaction.








Abstract
Direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) are regarded as an attractive power source with high energy density, bio&#8208;renewability, and convenient storage and transportation. However, the anodic reaction of DEFCs, that is, the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), suffers from poor efficiency due to the low selectivity to CO2 (C1 pathway) and high selectivity to CH3COOH (C2 pathway). In this study, the selective EOR to CO2 can be achieved at the Rh&#8211;SnO2 interface in SnO2&#8211;Rh nanosheets (NSs). The optimized catalyst of 0.2SnO2&#8211;Rh NSs/C exhibits excellent alkaline EOR performance with a mass activity of 213.2 mA mgRh&#8722;1 and a Faraday efficiency of 72.8% for the C1 pathway, which are 1.7 and 1.9 times higher than those of Rh NSs/C. Mechanism studies indicate that the strong synergy at the Rh&#8211;SnO2 interface significantly promotes the breaking of C&#63743;C bond of C2H5OH to form CO2, and facilitates oxidation of the poisonous intermediates (*CO and *CH3) to suppress the deactivation of the catalyst. This work not only provides a highly selective, active, and stable catalyst for the EOR, but also promotes fundamental research for the design of efficient catalysts via interface modification.

      <title>A Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium/Carbon Nanotube Hybrid for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A dendrite&#8208;free Li/carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid has been fabricated by direct coating molten Li on CNTs for Li&#8208;metal batteries. Favorable thermodynamic and kinetic conditions are a powerful force to drive the rapid lift upwards and infusion of molten Li into CNTs network. The obtained hybrid exhibits super&#8208;stable function even at an ultrahigh current density.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal is promising in the next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, its practical application is still hindered by the poor cycling performance and serious safety issues for the consequence of dendritic Li. Herein, a dendrite&#8208;free Li/carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid is proposed, which is fabricated by direct coating molten Li on CNTs, for Li&#8208;metal batteries. The favorable thermodynamic and kinetic conditions are the powerful force to drive the rapid lift upwards and infusion of molten Li into CNTs network, which is the key to form a uniform metallic layer in Li/CNTs hybrid. The obtained hybrid indicates super&#8208;stable functions even at an ultrahigh current density of 40&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 2000 cycles with a stripping/plating capacity of 2 mAh cm&#8722;2 in symmetric cells. Subsequently, this hybrid also demonstrates a significantly decreased resistance, excellent cycling stability at high current density and flexibility in the full Li&#8208;S battery. This work provides valuable concepts in fabricating Li anodes toward Li&#8208;metal batteries and beyond for their high&#8208;level services.

      <title>Strong Ferromagnetism Achieved via Breathing Lattices in Atomically Thin Cobaltites</title>
      <dc:description>
Atomically thin cobaltite remaining strongly ferromagnetic is achieved by local structural modification. A surprisingly large magnetic moment (0.5 &#956;B/Co) and Curie temperature (75 K), values larger than previously reported for any monolayer oxides, are observed in the LaCoO3 monolayer, demonstrating a strategy for creating functional quantum heterostructures by exploiting atomic interface engineering.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional quantum materials that remain strongly ferromagnetic down to monolayer thickness are highly desired for spintronic applications. Although oxide materials are important candidates for the next generation of spintronics, ferromagnetism decays severely when the thickness is scaled to the nanometer regime, leading to deterioration of device performance. Here, a methodology is reported for maintaining strong ferromagnetism in insulating LaCoO3 (LCO) layers down to the thickness of a single unit cell. It is found that the magnetic and electronic states of LCO are linked intimately to the structural parameters of adjacent &#8220;breathing lattice&#8221; SrCuO2 (SCO). As the dimensionality of SCO is reduced, the lattice constant elongates over 10% along the growth direction, leading to a significant distortion of the CoO6 octahedra, and promoting a higher spin state and long&#8208;range spin ordering. For atomically thin LCO layers, surprisingly large magnetic moment (0.5 &#956;B/Co) and Curie temperature (75 K), values larger than previously reported for any monolayer oxides are observed. The results demonstrate a strategy for creating ultrathin ferromagnetic oxides by exploiting atomic heterointerface engineering, confinement&#8208;driven structural transformation, and spin&#8208;lattice entanglement in strongly correlated materials.

      <title>Gate&#8208;Tunable Polar Optical Phonon to Piezoelectric Scattering in Few&#8208;Layer Bi2O2Se for High&#8208;Performance Thermoelectrics</title>
      <dc:description>
The thermoelectric (TE) transport in few&#8208;layer Bi2O2Se is probed, where gating can effectively modulate its scattering mechanism from polar optical phonon to piezoelectric scattering. This facilitates the capacity of drastic mobility engineering, and high TE performance over a wide range of temperature can be achieved due to persistently high mobility arising from the highly gate&#8208;tunable scattering mechanism.








Abstract
Atomically thin Bi2O2Se has emerged as a new member in 2D materials with ultrahigh carrier mobility and excellent air&#8208;stability, showing great potential for electronics and optoelectronics. In addition, its ferroelectric nature renders an ultralow thermal conductivity, making it a perfect candidate for thermoelectrics. In this work, the thermoelectric performance of 2D Bi2O2Se is investigated over a wide temperature range (20&#8211;300 K). A gate&#8208;tunable transition from polar optical phonon (POP) scattering to piezoelectric scattering is observed, which facilitates the capacity of drastic mobility engineering in 2D Bi2O2Se. Consequently, a high power factor of more than 400&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2 over an unprecedented temperature range (80&#8211;200 K) is achieved, corresponding to the persistently high mobility arising from the highly gate&#8208;tunable scattering mechanism. This finding provides a new avenue for maximizing thermoelectric performance by changing the scattering mechanism and carrier mobility over a wide temperature range.

     alt="Gate&#8208;Tunable Polar Optical Phonon to Piezoelectric Scattering in Few&#8208;Layer Bi2O2Se for High&#8208;Performance Thermoelectrics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thermoelectric (TE) transport in few&#8208;layer Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se is probed, where gating can effectively modulate its scattering mechanism from polar optical phonon to piezoelectric scattering. This facilitates the capacity of drastic mobility engineering, and high TE performance over a wide range of temperature can be achieved due to persistently high mobility arising from the highly gate&#8208;tunable scattering mechanism.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomically thin Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se has emerged as a new member in 2D materials with ultrahigh carrier mobility and excellent air&#8208;stability, showing great potential for electronics and optoelectronics. In addition, its ferroelectric nature renders an ultralow thermal conductivity, making it a perfect candidate for thermoelectrics. In this work, the thermoelectric performance of 2D Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se is investigated over a wide temperature range (20&#8211;300 K). A gate&#8208;tunable transition from polar optical phonon (POP) scattering to piezoelectric scattering is observed, which facilitates the capacity of drastic mobility engineering in 2D Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se. Consequently, a high power factor of more than 400&#160;&lt;b&gt;&#181;&lt;/b&gt;W&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; over an unprecedented temperature range (80&#8211;200 K) is achieved, corresponding to the persistently high mobility arising from the highly gate&#8208;tunable scattering mechanism. This finding provides a new avenue for maximizing thermoelectric performance by changing the scattering mechanism and carrier mobility over a wide temperature range.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emerging Light&#8208;Emitting Materials for Photonic Integration</title>
      <dc:description>
Emerging 2D and metal halide perovskites light&#8208;emitting materials for photonic integration are reviewed, including their unique optical properties, fabrication methods, and the progress made in realizing on&#8208;chip light emitters based on these materials. Moreover, the existing challenges and future perspectives are discussed toward the realization of high&#8208;efficiency light sources for optical interconnections.








Abstract
The arrival of the information explosion era is urging the development of large&#8208;bandwidth high&#8208;data&#8208;rate optical interconnection technology. Up to now, the biggest stumbling block in optical interconnections has been the lack of efficient light sources despite significant progress that has been made in germanium&#8208;on&#8208;silicon (Ge&#8208;on&#8208;Si) and III&#8208;V&#8208;on&#8208;silicon (III&#8208;V&#8208;on&#8208;Si) lasers. 2D materials and metal halide perovskites have attracted much attention in recent years, and exhibit distinctive advantages in the application of on&#8208;chip light emitters. Herein, this Progress Report reviews the recent progress made in light&#8208;emitting materials with a focus on new materials, i.e., 2D materials and metal halide perovskites. The report briefly introduces the current status of Ge&#8208;on&#8208;Si and III&#8208;V&#8208;on&#8208;Si lasers and discusses the advances of 2D and perovskite light&#8208;emitting materials for photonic integration, including their optical properties, preparation methods, as well as the light sources based on these materials. Finally, challenges and perspectives of these emerging materials on the way to the efficient light sources are discussed.

      <title>Path&#8208;Dependent Thermal Metadevice beyond Janus Functionalities</title>
      <dc:description>
A 3D path&#8208;dependent thermal metadevice can be designed to achieve three heat transfer behaviors (cloaking, concentrating, and transparency) along different directions at the same time by breaking the symmetry using successive 3D transformations. This path&#8208;dependent strategy provides a new dimension for multifunctional metamaterial devices in the thermal field and for more general diffusion processes.








Abstract
Janus metamaterials, metasurfaces, and monolayers have received intensive attention in nanophotonics and 2D materials. Their core concept is to introduce asymmetry along the wave propagation direction, by stacking different materials or layers of meta&#8208;atoms, or breaking out&#8208;of&#8208;plane mirror asymmetry with external biases. Nevertheless, it has been hitherto elusive to realize a diffusive Janus metadevice, since scalar diffusion systems such as heat conduction normally operate in the absence of polarization control, spin manipulation, or electric&#8208;field stimuli, which all are widely used in achieving optical Janus devices. It is even more challenging, if not impossible, for a single diffusive metadevice to exhibit more than two thermal functions. Here a path&#8208;dependent thermal metadevice beyond Janus characteristics is proposed, which can exhibit three distinct thermal behaviors (cloaking, concentrating, and transparency) under different directions of heat flow. The rotation transformation mechanism of thermal conductivity provides a robust platform to assign a specific thermal behavior in any direction. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of anisotropic in&#8208;plane conduction successfully validates such a path&#8208;dependent trifunction thermal metamaterial device. It is anticipated that this path&#8208;dependent strategy can provide a new dimension for multifunctional metamaterial devices in the thermal field, as well as for a more general diffusion process.

      <title>Activatable Polymer Nanoenzymes for Photodynamic Immunometabolic Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
An activatable organic nanoenzyme (SPNK) is developed for photodynamic immunometabolic cancer therapy. Near&#8208;infrared photoirradiation of SPNK can not only induce immunogenic cell death by photodynamic therapy but also activate kynureninase to in situ degrade immunosuppressive kynurenine, leading to enhanced systemic antitumor immunity and inhibition of both primary and distant tumors.








Abstract
Tumor immunometabolism contributes substantially to tumor proliferation and immune cell activity, and thus plays a crucial role in the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Modulation of immunometabolism to boost cancer immunotherapy is mostly based on small&#8208;molecule inhibitors, which often encounter the issues of off&#8208;target adverse effects, drug resistance, and unsustainable response. In contrast, enzymatic therapeutics can potentially bypass these limitations but has been less exploited. Herein, an organic polymer nanoenzyme (SPNK) with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photoactivatable immunotherapeutic effects is reported for photodynamic immunometabolic therapy. SPNK is composed of a semiconducting polymer core conjugated with kynureninase (KYNase) via PEGylated singlet oxygen (1O2) cleavable linker. Upon NIR photoirradiation, SPNK generates 1O2 not only to exert photodynamic effect to induce the immunogenic cell death of cancer, but also to unleash KYNase and trigger its activity to degrade the immunosuppressive kynurenine (Kyn). Such a combinational effect mediated by SPNK promotes the proliferation and infiltration of effector T cells, enhances systemic antitumor T cell immunity, and ultimately permits inhibition of both primary and distant tumors in living mice. Therefore, this study provides a promising photodynamic approach toward remotely controlled enzymatic immunomodulation for improved anticancer therapy.

      <title>Magnetic Moments Induced by Atomic Vacancies in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Flakes</title>
      <dc:description>
Localized magnetic moments induced by Pt vacancies in air&#8208;stable non&#8208;magnetic PtSe2 nanoflakes are reported and the induced magnetic moments in PtSe2 nanoflakes are found to be nearly thickness dependent in thinner nanoflakes. The authors&#8217; findings demonstrate a new way to induce magnetism in non&#8208;magnetic 2D materials.








Abstract
2D magnetism plays a key role in both fundamental physics and potential device applications. However, the instability of the discovered 2D magnetic materials has been one main obstacle in deep research and potential application of 2D magnetism. Here, a localized magnetic moment induced by Pt vacancies in air&#8208;stable type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal PtSe2 flakes is reported. The localized magnetic moments give rise to the Kondo effect, evidenced by logarithmic increment of resistance with decreasing temperature and isotropic negative longitudinal magnetoresistance. Additionally, the induced magnetic moment and Kondo temperature appear to depend on thickness in the thinner samples (&lt;10&#160;nm). The small magnetocrystalline anisotropy revealed by first&#8208;principles calculation indicates that the magnetic moments are randomly localized instead of long&#8208;range ordered. The findings demonstrate a new means to induce magnetism in 2D non&#8208;magnetic materials.

      <title>Amphipathic Side Chain of a Conjugated Polymer Optimizes Dopant Location toward Efficient N&#8208;Type Organic Thermoelectrics</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective increase in the Seebeck coefficient and improving the power factor by a factor of &#8776;5 in an n&#8208;doped donor&#8211;acceptor copolymer are realized by the use of amphipathic side chains. This strategy can properly control the dopant sites away from the backbone, which minimizes the adverse influence of counterions. Therefore, an excellent power factor of 18 &#181;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 is achieved.








Abstract
There is no molecular strategy for selectively increasing the Seebeck coefficient without reducing the electrical conductivity for organic thermoelectrics. Here, it is reported that the use of amphipathic side chains in an n&#8208;type donor&#8211;acceptor copolymer can selectively increase the Seebeck coefficient and thus increase the power factor by a factor of &#8776;5. The amphipathic side chain contains an alkyl chain segment as a spacer between the polymer backbone and an ethylene glycol type chain segment. The use of this alkyl spacer does not only reduce the energetic disorder in the conjugated polymer film but can also properly control the dopant sites away from the backbone, which minimizes the adverse influence of counterions. As confirmed by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations with the host&#8211;dopant distance as the only variable, a reduced Coulombic interaction resulting from a larger host&#8211;dopant distance contributes to a higher Seebeck coefficient for a given electrical conductivity. Finally, an optimized power factor of 18 &#181;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 is achieved in the doped polymer film. This work provides a facile molecular strategy for selectively improving the Seebeck coefficient and opens up a new route for optimizing the dopant location toward realizing better n&#8208;type polymeric thermoelectrics.

As confirmed by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations with the host&#8211;dopant distance as the only variable, a reduced Coulombic interaction resulting from a larger host&#8211;dopant distance contributes to a higher Seebeck coefficient for a given electrical conductivity. Finally, an optimized power factor of 18 &#181;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved in the doped polymer film. This work provides a facile molecular strategy for selectively improving the Seebeck coefficient and opens up a new route for optimizing the dopant location toward realizing better n&#8208;type polymeric thermoelectrics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fast Response Organic Supramolecular Transistors Utilizing In&#8208;Situ &#960;&#8208;Ion Gels</title>
      <dc:description>
A new class of supramolecular devices is presented. In a device dubbed a &#960;&#8208;ion gel transistor (PIGT), an in situ &#960;&#8208;ion gel is directly employed as a core part of the device. PIGT exhibits volumetric conductivity with an ultrafast response time. The device configuration is rational to induce the potent property of &#960;&#8208;gels to a macroscale device.








Abstract
Despite their remarkable charge carrier mobility when forming well&#8208;ordered fibers, supramolecular transistors often suffer from poor processability that hinders device integration, resulting in disappointing transconductance and output currents. Here, a new class of supramolecular transistors, &#960;&#8208;ion gel transistors (PIGTs), is presented. An in situ &#960;&#8208;ion gel, which is an unprecedented composite of semiconducting nanofibers and an enclosed ionic liquid, is directly employed as an active material and internal capacitor. In comparison to other supramolecular transistors, a PIGT displays a high transconductance (133 &#181;S) and output current (139 &#181;A at &#8722;6 V), while retaining a high charge&#8208;carrier mobility (4.2 &#215; 10&#8722;2 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and on/off ratio (3.7 &#215; 104). Importantly, the unique device configuration and the high ionic conductivity associated with the distinct nanosegregation enables the fastest response among accumulation&#8208;mode electrochemical&#8208;based transistors (&lt;20 &#181;s). Considering the advantages of the absence of dielectric layers and the facile fabrication process, PIGT has great potential to be utilized in printed flexible devices. The device platform is widely applicable to various supramolecular assemblies, shedding light on the interdisciplinary research of supramolecular chemistry and organic electronics.

      <title>Redox Targeting&#8208;Based Thermally Regenerative Electrochemical Cycle Flow Cell for Enhanced Low&#8208;Grade Heat Harnessing</title>
      <dc:description>
Redox targeting (RT)&#8208;based thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle flow cell via the RT&#8208;reactions between redox mediators and solid materials is demonstrated with combined advantages of redox flow battery and static battery for enhanced thermoelectric energy conversion and decoupled high&#8208;energy&#8208;density large&#8208;scale electricity storage.








Abstract
A large amount of low&#8208;grade heat (&lt;100&#160;&#176;C) is produced in electrical devices and mostly wasted. This type of heat without effective dissipation also causes compromised device performance, reliability, and lifespan. To tackle these issues, a redox targeting (RT)&#8208;based flow cell with judiciously designed thermoelectrically active redox materials is demonstrated for the first time for efficient heat&#8208;to&#8208;electricity conversion through a thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle (TREC). Compared with the conventional TREC systems, the RT&#8208;based flow cell not only reveals considerably enhanced thermoelectric efficiency, but the flow of redox fluids also provides a cooling function to the system. In this work, solid material Ni0.2Co0.8(OH)2 and redox mediator [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/3&#8722;, both of which have negative temperature coefficient and share identical redox potential, are paired via RT&#8208;reactions to boost the capacity and meanwhile thermoelectric efficiency of a [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/3&#8722;/Zn0/2+&#8208;based flow cell. Upon operating over the TREC cycle, the RT&#8208;based flow cell converts heat to electricity at an unprecedented absolute thermoelectric efficiency of 3.61% in the temperature range of 25&#8211;55&#160;&#176;C.

      <title>Self&#8208;Driven Perovskite Narrowband Photodetectors with Tunable Spectral Responses</title>
      <dc:description>
Filterless and self&#8208;driven charge&#8208;collection&#8208;narrowing (CCN)&#8208;type perovskite narrowband photodetectors are fabricated with tunable spectral responses from the red to the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. Specifically, the MAPbI3&#8208;based narrowband photodetector exhibits remarkable performances at 800&#160;nm with full&#8208;width at half maximum less than 30&#160;nm, which are comparable to the highest reported values, allowing to successfully demonstration of narrowband imaging.








Abstract
Narrowband photodetectors with tunable spectral responses are highly desirable for applications in image sensing, machine vision, and optical communication. Herein, a filterless and self&#8208;driven perovskite narrowband photodetector (PNPD) based on the defect&#8208;assisted charge collection narrowing (CCN) mechanism is reported, which is enabled by a high&#8208;quality thick perovskite film. By adjusting the halide component of the perovskite layer, the bandgap is successfully modulated and the corresponding narrowband photodetectors show a wide spectral response range from the red to the near&#8208;infrared (NIR), all with full&#8208;widths at half maximum (FWHMs) below 30&#160;nm. Specifically, the methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) narrowband photodetector exhibits a characteristic detection peak at 800&#160;nm with a very low noise current of &#8776;0.02 pA Hz&#8211;1/2, a high specific detectivity up to 1.27 &#215; 1012 Jones, and a fast response speed with rise/fall time of 12.7/6.9 &#181;s. Impressively, these values are among the highest of their kind reported previously, and allow demonstration of narrowband imaging. The excellent performance of self&#8208;driven PNPDs lights up their prospect in high&#8208;efficiency optoelectronic devices without external power sources.

      <title>Extracellular&#8208;Matrix&#8208;Reinforced Bioinks for 3D Bioprinting Human Tissue</title>
      <dc:description>
In this study, a new class of microscale phase&#8208;separated hybrid bioinks is described by combining tissue specific extracellular matrix (ECM) with alginate. This novel rECM hybrid bioink is tissue specific, cytocompatible, biocompatible, and pro&#8208;angiogenic and is used to bioprint human airways composed of multiple, regionally specified primary human lung cell types.








Abstract
Recent advances in 3D bioprinting allow for generating intricate structures with dimensions relevant for human tissue, but suitable bioinks for producing translationally relevant tissue with complex geometries remain unidentified. Here, a tissue&#8208;specific hybrid bioink is described, composed of a natural polymer, alginate, reinforced with extracellular matrix derived from decellularized tissue (rECM). rECM has rheological and gelation properties beneficial for 3D bioprinting while retaining biologically inductive properties supporting tissue maturation ex vivo and in vivo. These bioinks are shear thinning, resist cell sedimentation, improve viability of multiple cell types, and enhance mechanical stability in hydrogels derived from them. 3D printed constructs generated from rECM bioinks suppress the foreign body response, are pro&#8208;angiogenic and support recipient&#8208;derived de novo blood vessel formation across the entire graft thickness in a murine model of transplant immunosuppression. Their proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for generating human tissue is demonstrated by 3D bioprinting human airways composed of regionally specified primary human airway epithelial progenitor and smooth muscle cells. Airway lumens remained patent with viable cells for one month in vitro with evidence of differentiation into mature epithelial cell types found in native human airways. rECM bioinks are a promising new approach for generating functional human tissue using 3D bioprinting.

      <title>Revealing the Degradation and Self&#8208;Healing Mechanisms in Perovskite Solar Cells by Sub&#8208;Bandgap External Quantum Efficiency Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
A highly sensitive sub&#8208;bandgap external quantum efficiency (s&#8208;EQE) spectroscopy for in situ monitoring the ion dissociation process is developed for the first time to reveal the mechanism of the intrinsic perovskite material degradation.








Abstract
Ion dissociation has been identified to determine the intrinsic stability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), but the underlying degradation mechanism is still elusive. Herein, by combining highly sensitive sub&#8208;bandgap external quantum efficiency (s&#8208;EQE) spectroscopy, impedance analysis, and theoretical calculations, the evolution of defect states in PVSCs during the degradation can be monitored. It is found that the degradation of PVSCs can be divided into three steps: 1) dissociation of ions from perovskite lattices, 2) migration of dissociated ions, and 3) consumption of I&#8722; by reacting with metal electrode. Importantly, step (3) is found to be crucial as it will accelerate the first two steps and lead to continuous degradation. By replacing the metal with more chemically robust indium tin oxide (ITO), it is found that the dissociated ions under light soaking will only saturate at the perovskite/ITO interface. Importantly, the dissociated ions will subsequently restore to the corresponding vacancies under dark condition to heal the perovskite and photovoltaic performance. Such shuttling of mobile ions without consumption in the ITO&#8208;contact PVSCs results in harvesting&#8211;rest&#8211;recovery cycles in natural day/night operation. It is envisioned that the mechanism of the intrinsic perovskite material degradation reported here will lead to clearer research directions toward highly stable PVSCs.

Herein, by combining highly sensitive sub&#8208;bandgap external quantum efficiency (s&#8208;EQE) spectroscopy, impedance analysis, and theoretical calculations, the evolution of defect states in PVSCs during the degradation can be monitored. It is found that the degradation of PVSCs can be divided into three steps: 1) dissociation of ions from perovskite lattices, 2) migration of dissociated ions, and 3) consumption of I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; by reacting with metal electrode. Importantly, step (3) is found to be crucial as it will accelerate the first two steps and lead to continuous degradation. By replacing the metal with more chemically robust indium tin oxide (ITO), it is found that the dissociated ions under light soaking will only saturate at the perovskite/ITO interface. Importantly, the dissociated ions will subsequently restore to the corresponding vacancies under dark condition to heal the perovskite and photovoltaic performance. Such shuttling of mobile ions without consumption in the ITO&#8208;contact PVSCs results in harvesting&#8211;rest&#8211;recovery cycles in natural day/night operation. It is envisioned that the mechanism of the intrinsic perovskite material degradation reported here will lead to clearer research directions toward highly stable PVSCs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Earth's Lithosphere Inspires Materials Design</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel lithomimetic approach is proposed, which entails mimicking structures and processes occurring in the Earth's lithosphere to produce man&#8208;made advanced materials. Severe plastic deformation is considered as a viable vehicle for that.








Abstract
Structural patterns found in living organisms have long been inspiring biomimetic materials design. Here, it is suggested that a rich palette of patterns occurring in inanimate Nature, and especially in the Earth's lithosphere, could be not less inspirational for design of novel architectured materials. This materials design paradigm is referred to as lithomimetics and it is demonstrated that some of the patterns found in the lithosphere can be emulated by established processes of severe plastic deformation. This opens up interesting avenues for materials design in which potentially promising structural patterns are borrowed from the lithosphere's repository. The key aim here is to promulgate the &#8220;lithomimetics&#8221; paradigm as a promising approach to developing novel architectured materials.

      <title>Voluntary&#8208;Opsonization&#8208;Enabled Precision Nanomedicines for Inflammation Treatment</title>
      <dc:description>
Molecularly engineered liposomes are shown to &#8220;hitch&#8208;hike&#8221; neutrophils through complementary &#8220;voluntary opsonization&#8221;. The chemotaxis of neutrophils overcomes the physiological barriers and dramatically enhances the accumulation of nanomedicines in the inflamed lungs for effective inflammation treatment. This strategy opens up new paths for neutrophil&#8208;enabled precision nanomedicines for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.








Abstract
Nanomedicines that target specific blood cells represent an emerging strategy to improve drug biodistribution. However, the protein corona usually disrupts nanomedicine targeting to cells and tissues. Herein, instead of exploring synthetic methods to mitigate the impact of the protein corona, its natural interactions with blood cells are leveraged and turn the protein corona into an active ingredient in treating lung inflammation. It is discovered that molecularly engineered liposomes with inverse phosphocholine lipids rapidly enrich complement fragment iC3b by &#8220;voluntary opsonization,&#8221; which triggers neutrophil hijacking through complement receptor 3 phagocytosis. This neutrophil targeting is cell&#8208;state dependent as only those activated by acute inflammation display efficient neutrophil reconstruction. The liposome&#8208;loaded neutrophils migrate across the alveolar&#8208;capillary barrier, accumulate in the inflamed lung parenchyma within hours, and release their payloads to kill the bacteria. This work shows that, in addition to biological cells, the protein corona can be a new platform for active and precision nanomedicine.

      <title>Polarization&#8208;Modulated Multidirectional Photothermal Actuators</title>
      <dc:description>
Magnetic&#8211;plasmonic hybrid Fe3O4/Ag nanorods are used as building blocks to create a freestanding, multidirectional photothermal robot. The hybrid nanorods are magnetically aligned with perfect orientational order in specific robot domains to enable on&#8208;demand locomotion by modulating the polarization and on&#8211;off switching of a laser beam.








Abstract
Photothermal actuators have attracted increasing attention due to their ability to convert light energy into mechanical deformation and locomotion. This work reports a freestanding, multidirectional photothermal robot that can walk along a predesigned pathway by modulating laser polarization and on&#8211;off switching. Magnetic&#8211;plasmonic hybrid Fe3O4/Ag nanorods are synthesized using an unconventional templating approach. The coupled magnetic and plasmonic anisotropy allows control of the rod orientation, plasmonic excitation, and photothermal conversion by simply applying a magnetic field. Once the rods are fixed with desirable orientations in a bimorph actuator by magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;assisted lithography, the bending of the actuator can be controlled by switching the laser polarization. A bipedal robot is created by coupling the rod orientation with the alternating actuation of its two legs. Irradiating the robot by a laser with alternating or fixed polarization synergistically results in basic movement (backward and forward) and turning (including left&#8208;, right&#8208;, and U&#8208;turn), respectively. A complex walk along predesigned pathways can be potentially programmed by combining the movement and turning modes of the robots. This strategy provides an alternative driving mechanism for preparing functional soft robots, thus breaking through the limitations in the existing systems in terms of light sources and actuation manners.

      <title>Reaction Mechanism and Structural Evolution of Fluorographite Cathodes in Solid&#8208;State K/Na/Li Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
The real&#8208;time K/Na/Li ion insertion mobility and reaction mechanism of the CFx cathode are studied using an in situ all&#8208;solid&#8208;state nanobattery transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique. A two&#8208;phase reaction is discovered with crystalline KF (NaF nanoparticles and amorphous LiF) generated uniformly within an amorphous carbon matrix, retaining an unchanged volume during alkali&#8208;ion intercalation.








Abstract
Fluorographites (CFx) are ultrahigh&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials for alkaline&#8208;metal primary batteries. However, they are generally not rechargeable. To elucidate the reaction mechanism of CFx cathodes, in situ transmission electron microscopy characterizations and ab initio calculations are employed. It is found that it is a two&#8208;phase mechanism upon K/Na/Li ion insertion; crystalline KF (crystalline NaF nanoparticles and amorphous LiF) is generated uniformly within the amorphous carbon matrix, retaining an unchanged volume during the discharge process. The diffusivity for K/Na/Li ion migration within the CFx is &#8776;2.2&#8211;2.5 &#215; 10&#8211;12, 3.4&#8211;5.3 &#215; 10&#8211;12 , and 1.8&#8211;2.5 &#215; 10&#8211;11 cm2 s&#8211;1, respectively, which is comparable to the diffusivity of K/Na/Li ions in liquid&#8208;state cells. Encouraged by the in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results, a new rechargeable all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li/CFx battery is further designed that shows a part of the reversible specific discharge capacity at the 2nd cycle. These findings demonstrate that a solid&#8208;state electrolyte provides a different reaction process compared with a conventional liquid electrolyte, and enables CFx to be partly rechargeable in solid&#8208;state Li batteries.

      <title>Thermoelectric Properties of Novel Semimetals: A Case Study of YbMnSb2</title>
      <dc:description>
Single crystals of the YbMnSb2 nodal line semimetal demonstrate the synergetic contribution of Dirac bands and regular band to the thermoelectric performance. A high power factor over 2.1 mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 is achieved due to both high mobility and large thermopower.








Abstract
The emerging class of topological materials provides a platform to engineer exotic electronic structures for a variety of applications. As complex band structures and Fermi surfaces can directly benefit thermoelectric performance it is important to identify the role of featured topological bands in thermoelectrics particularly when there are coexisting classic regular bands. In this work, the contribution of Dirac bands to thermoelectric performance and their ability to concurrently achieve large thermopower and low resistivity in novel semimetals is investigated. By examining the YbMnSb2 nodal line semimetal as an example, the Dirac bands appear to provide a low resistivity along the direction in which they are highly dispersive. Moreover, because of the regular&#8208;band&#8208;provided density of states, a large Seebeck coefficient over 160 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at 300 K is achieved in both directions, which is very high for a semimetal with high carrier concentration. The combined highly dispersive Dirac and regular bands lead to ten times increase in power factor, reaching a value of 2.1&#160;mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 at 300 K. The present work highlights the potential of such novel semimetals for unusual electronic transport properties and guides strategies towards high thermoelectric performance.

      <title>Roles of MACl in Sequentially Deposited Bromine&#8208;Free Perovskite Absorbers for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
The role of methylammonium chloride (MACl) in sequentially deposited bromine (Br)&#8208;free formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3)&#8208;based perovskite is systematically demonstrated to regulate the PbI2/FAI reaction, tune the phase transition at room temperature, and adjust the PbI2 residual through an intermediate&#8208;related perovskite decomposition during thermal annealing. The resulting optimized solar cells achieve a remarkable efficiency of 23.1% with considerably improved photostability.








Abstract
So far, the combination of methylammonium bromide/methylammonium chloride (MABr/MACl) or methylammonium iodide (MAI)/MACl is the most frequently used additives to stabilize formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) fabricated by the sequential deposition method. However, the enlarged bandgap due to the addition of bromide and the ambiguous functions of these additives in lead iodide (PbI2) transformation are still worth considering. Herein, the roles of MACl in sequentially deposited Br&#8208;free FA&#8208;based perovskites are systematically investigated. It is found that MACl can finely regulate the PbI2/FAI reaction, tune the phase transition at room temperature, and adjust intermediate&#8208;related perovskite crystallization and decomposition during thermal annealing. Compared to FAPbI3, the perovskite with MACl exhibits larger grain, longer carrier lifetime, and reduced trap density. The resultant solar cell therefore achieves a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.1% under reverse scan with a stabilized power output of 23.0%. In addition, it shows much improved photostability under 100&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 white illumination (xenon lamp) in nitrogen atmosphere without encapsulation.

      <title>Biopolymer Immune Implants&#8217; Sequential Activation of Innate and Adaptive Immunity for Colorectal Cancer Postoperative Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
This study provides a biopolymer immune implant for colorectal cancer post&#8208;surgical management. The implant sequentially elicits innate, adaptive, and memory immune responses, and results in complete residual tumor clearance, inhibition of tumor recurrence and distal tumor, and resistance to tumor re&#8208;challenge. The results presented will encourage potential clinical translation of this optimized implant upon tumor resection.








Abstract
Surgical resection is the first&#8208;line therapy for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, for advanced CRC, the curative effect of surgical resection is limited due to either local recurrence or distal metastasis. Postoperative in situ immunotherapy, presents a promising option for preventing tumor recurrence and metastasis, owing to the fact that surgeons have unique opportunities and direct access to the surgical site. Herein, a designed biopolymer immune implant for CRC post&#8208;surgical therapy, characterized with tissue adhesion, sustained drug release, and sequential elicitation of innate immunity, adaptive immunity, and immune memory effects, is reported. With gradual release of the loaded resiquimod (R848) and anti&#8208;OX40 antibody (aOX40), the immune implant can eradicate residual tumors post&#8208;surgery (with no tumor recurrence in 150 days), inhibit the growth of distal tumors and elicit immune memory effects to resist tumor re&#8208;challenge. Immunological analysis reveal that the biopolymer immune plant treatment leads to a two&#8208;stage action, with enhanced natural killer cells (NK cells) infiltration and activation of dendritic cells (DCs) in the first several days, then a greatly increased population of infiltrating T cells, and finally immune memory effects are established. The reported biopolymer immune implants provide a valuable and clinically&#8208;relevant option for post&#8208;surgical CRC management.

      <title>Driving Force and Optical Signatures of Bipolaron Formation in Chemically Doped Conjugated Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>
A chemically doped donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated polymer is studied using ultrafast spectroscopy, showing conclusively that the carriers created by doping are exclusively bipolarons and not single polarons at all doping levels. DFT calculations show that the physical size of the donor unit is what determines the relative stability of polarons and bipolarons in push&#8211;pull semiconducting polymer systems.








Abstract
Molecular dopants are often added to semiconducting polymers to improve electrical conductivity. However, the use of such dopants does not always produce mobile charge carriers. In this work, ultrafast spectroscopy is used to explore the nature of the carriers created following doping of conjugated push&#8211;pull polymers with both F4TCNQ (2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane) and FeCl3. It is shown that for one particular push&#8211;pull material, the charge carriers created by doping are entirely non&#8208;conductive bipolarons and not single polarons, and that transient absorption spectroscopy following excitation in the infrared can readily distinguish the two types of charge carriers. Based on density functional theory calculations and experiments on multiple push&#8211;pull conjugated polymers, it is argued that the size of the donor push units determines the relative stabilities of polarons and bipolarons, with larger donor units stabilizing the bipolarons by providing more area for two charges to&#160;co&#8208;reside.

&lt;p&gt;Akin to &#8220;luminous pearls&#8221; in ancient Chinese tales of legend, afterglow nanoparticles display unusual extremely long&#8208;life&#8208;time luminescence properties after the cessation of excitation. In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202003881"&gt;2003881&lt;/a&gt;, Zhanjun Li, Gang Han, and co&#8208;workers report multicolor afterglow &#8220;luminous pearls&#8221; with tailorable emission colors and uniform size. High&#8208;contrast multichannel afterglow imaging can be readily accomplished without the current need of a time&#8208;gating system.

      <title>Polymer Films: Improvement of Electrical Conductivity in Conjugated Polymers through Cascade Doping with Small&#8208;Molecular Dopants (Adv. Mater. 49/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Molecular sequential doping using conjugated polymers is a promising approach to modulate or improve electrical conductivity without sacrificing the morphology of a pristine polymer film. In article number 2005129, Hyungtak Seo, Jong H. Kim, Bong&#8208;Gi Kim, and co&#8208;workers develop a cascade doping strategy that realizes excellent electrical conductivity through a separated doping process using two different dopants. The first dopant provides a kinetically favorable working environment for the second dopant, through regeneration, reengagement, and replacement during the secondary doping step.

      <dc:description>
For six decades, electronic charge transport in oxides has been described by the small&#8208;polaron hopping model. However, this model was developed for binary oxides only. By characterizing structure, site occupation, and transport, in article number 2004490, Maytal Caspary Toroker, Richard D. Robinson, and co&#8208;workers show  that the conventional model is inaccurate for oxides with more than two types of cation. They present an accurate model, opening new design avenues for high&#8208;performance devices.

      <title>Surface Termination of Solution&#8208;Processed CH3NH3PbI3 Perovskite Film Examined using Electron Spectroscopies</title>
      <dc:description>
The interface property of perovskite is governed by the surface termination. The combination of ultraviolet photoelectron and metastable&#8208;atom electron spectroscopies is demonstrated as a versatile technique to prove the surface termination. This method is applied to a solution&#8208;processed CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film to show that the surface is terminated with a layer consisting of CH3NH3 and I.








Abstract
The interfaces of a perovskite solar cell significantly influence the charge processes in the cell, which contributes to the device performance with direct implication for surface potential, electronic structure, and chemical reactivity. The properties of the interface are strongly affected by the surface termination. In this work, the combination of ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and metastable&#8208;atom electron spectroscopy is demonstrated, to examine the surface termination of a solution&#8208;processed CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film. The results show that the surface of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film is terminated with a layer consisting of CH3NH3 and I. The interface energy level alignment for both occupied and unoccupied levels between CH3NH3PbI3 and C60 is also examined using UPS and low&#8208;energy inverse photoelectron spectroscopy. It turns out that an ideal energy level alignment is established for the electron collection and hole block at the perovskite and C60 interface.

      <title>Design of Local Atomic Environments in Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts for Renewable Energy Conversions</title>
      <dc:description>
A rich variety of distinct chemical bonding configurations of a single&#8208;metal atom with its surrounding host atoms creates vast opportunities for the rational design and synthesis of single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts with tunable local atomic environment for high&#8208;performance renewable energy conversions.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts (SAECs) have recently attracted tremendous research interest due to their often remarkable catalytic responses, unmatched by conventional catalysts. The electrocatalytic performance of SAECs is closely related to the specific metal species and their local atomic environments, including their coordination number, the determined structure of the coordination sites, and the chemical identity of nearest and second nearest neighboring atoms. The wide range of distinct chemical bonding configurations of a single&#8208;metal atom with its surrounding host atoms creates virtually limitless opportunities for the rational design and synthesis of SAECs with tunable local atomic environment for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysis. In this review, the authors first identify fundamental hurdles in electrochemical conversions and highlight the relevance of SAECs. They then critically examine the role of the local atomic structures, encompassing the first and second coordination spheres of the isolated metal atoms, on the design of high&#8208;performance SAECs. The relevance of single&#8208;atom dopants for host activation is also discussed. Insights into the correlation between local structures of SAECs and their catalytic response are analyzed and discussed. Finally, the authors summarize major challenges to be addressed in the field of SAECs and provide some perspectives in the rational construction of superior SAECs for a wide range of electrochemical conversions.

The wide range of distinct chemical bonding configurations of a single&#8208;metal atom with its surrounding host atoms creates virtually limitless opportunities for the rational design and synthesis of SAECs with tunable local atomic environment for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysis. In this review, the authors first identify fundamental hurdles in electrochemical conversions and highlight the relevance of SAECs. They then critically examine the role of the local atomic structures, encompassing the first and second coordination spheres of the isolated metal atoms, on the design of high&#8208;performance SAECs. The relevance of single&#8208;atom dopants for host activation is also discussed. Insights into the correlation between local structures of SAECs and their catalytic response are analyzed and discussed. Finally, the authors summarize major challenges to be addressed in the field of SAECs and provide some perspectives in the rational construction of superior SAECs for a wide range of electrochemical conversions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>3D Interfacing between Soft Electronic Tools and Complex Biological Tissues</title>
      <dc:description>
Soft electronics enable biocompatible interfaces for physiological sensing and stimulation. However, their typical forms as 2D sheets create difficulties for integration with organs and tissues with complex 3D geometry. Recent strategies involve a transformation of soft electronic tools for building adaptive 3D interfaces with natural organs and tissues, providing advanced capabilities for biological research and therapeutic innovation.








Abstract
Recent developments in soft functional materials have created opportunities for building bioelectronic devices with tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties. Their integration with the human body could enable advanced sensing and stimulation for medical diagnosis and therapies. However, most of the available soft electronics are constructed as planar sheets, which are difficult to interface with the target organs and tissues that have complex 3D structures. Here, the recent approaches are highlighted to building 3D interfaces between soft electronic tools and complex biological organs and tissues. Examples involve mesh devices for conformal contact, imaging&#8208;guided fabrication of organ&#8208;specific electronics, miniaturized probes for neurointerfaces, instrumented scaffold for tissue engineering, and many other soft 3D systems. They represent diverse routes for reconciling the interfacial mismatches between electronic tools and biological tissues. The remaining challenges include device scaling to approach the complexity of target organs, biological data acquisition and processing, 3D manufacturing techniques, etc., providing a range of opportunities for scientific research and technological innovation.

      <title>Activatable NIR&#8208;II Plasmonic Nanotheranostics for Efficient Photoacoustic Imaging and Photothermal Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
An activatable NIR&#8208;II plasmonic theranostics system for accurate tumor diagnosis and effective treatment is reported. This gold nanochain structure breaks through the traditional molecular imaging window, shifting from the visible to the NIR&#8208;II region, owing to fusion between adjacent gold nanoparticles in the restricted local space triggered by the high H2O2 level in the tumor microenvironment.








Abstract
Precise manipulation of optical properties through the structure&#8208;evolution of plasmonic nanoparticles is of great interest in biomedical fields including bioimaging and phototherapy. However, previous success has been limited to fixed assembled structures or visible&#8211;NIR&#8208;I absorption. Here, an activatable NIR&#8208;II plasmonic theranostics system based on silica&#8208;encapsulated self&#8208;assembled gold nanochains (AuNCs@SiO2) for accurate tumor diagnosis and effective treatment is reported. This transformable chain structure breaks through the traditional molecular imaging window, whose absorption can be redshifted from the visible to the NIR&#8208;II region owing to the fusion between adjacent gold nanoparticles in the restricted local space of AuNCs@SiO2 triggered by the high H2O2 level in the tumor microenvironment (TME), leading to the generation of a new string&#8208;like structure with strong NIR&#8208;II absorption, which is further confirmed by finite&#8208;difference&#8208;time&#8208;domain (FDTD) simulation. With the TME&#8208;activated characteristics, AuNCs@SiO2 exhibits excellent properties for photoacoustic imaging and a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 82.2% at 1064&#160;nm leading to severe cell death and remarkable tumor growth inhibition in vivo. These prominent intelligent TME&#8208;responsive features of AuNCs@SiO2 may open up a new avenue to explore optical regulated nano&#8208;platform for intelligent, accurate, and noninvasive theranostics in NIR&#8208;II window.

      <title>Hammett Relationship in Oxidase&#8208;Mimicking Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Revealed through a Protein&#8208;Engineering&#8208;Inspired Strategy</title>
      <dc:description>
Studying the structure&#8211;activity relationships of nanozymes requires overcoming the composition&#8208; and site&#8208;heterogeneity limitations in nanomaterials. Inspired by natural metalloenzymes, a set of substituted metal&#8211;organic frameworks is employed, and a Hammett&#8208;type structure&#8211;activity linear free energy relationship is revealed, where increasing Hammett &#963;m value leads to the enhancement of the oxidase&#8208;mimicking activity.








Abstract
While the unique physicochemical properties of nanomaterials that enable regulation of nanozyme activities are demonstrated in many systems, quantitative relationships between the nanomaterials structure and their enzymatic activities remain poorly understood, due to the heterogeneity of compositions and active sites in these nanomaterials. Here, inspired by metalloenzymes with well&#8208;defined metal&#8211;ligand coordination, a set of substituted metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with similar coordination is employed to investigate the relationship between structure and oxidase&#8208;mimicking activity. Both experimental results and density functional theory calculations reveal a Hammett&#8208;type structure&#8211;activity linear free energy relationship (H&#8208;SALR) of MIL&#8208;53(Fe) (MIL = Materials of Institute Lavoisier) nanozymes, in which increasing the Hammett &#963;m value with electron&#8208;withdrawing ligands increases the oxidase&#8208;mimicking activity. As a result, MIL&#8208;53(Fe) &#63743;NO2 with the strongest electron&#8208;withdrawing NO2 substituent shows a tenfold higher activity than the unsubstituted MIL&#8208;53(Fe). Furthermore, the generality of H&#8208;SALR is demonstrated for a range of substrates, one other metal (Cr), and even one other MOF type (MIL&#8208;101). Such biologically inspired quantitative studies demonstrate that it is possible to identify quantitative structure&#8211;activity relationships of nanozymes, and to provide detailed insight into the catalytic mechanisms as those in native enzymes, making it possible to use these relationships to develop high&#8208;performance nanomaterials.

      <title>Cathodoluminescence of Ultrathin Twisted Ge1&#8211;xSnxS van der Waals Nanoribbon Waveguides</title>
      <dc:description>
Ultrathin twisted Ge1&#8211;xSnxS nanoribbons, realized via scalable vapor&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid growth over gold catalysts, provide a unique platform for probing guided excitonic waveguide modes in van der Waals semiconductors. Nanophotonic experiments using local electron&#8208;beam excitation detect the confined modes in the plane of the layered crystal and enable the measurement of key properties such as the field distribution into the adjacent cladding layers.








Abstract
Ultrathin van der Waals semiconductors have shown extraordinary optoelectronic and photonic properties. Propagating photonic modes make layered crystal waveguides attractive for photonic circuitry and for studying hybrid light&#8211;matter states. Accessing guided modes by conventional optics is challenging due to the limited spatial resolution and poor out&#8208;of&#8208;plane far&#8208;field coupling. Scanning near&#8208;field optical microscopy can overcome these issues and can characterize waveguide modes down to a resolution of tens of nanometers, albeit for planar samples or nanostructures with moderate height variations. Electron microscopy provides atomic&#8208;scale localization also for more complex geometries, and recent advances have extended the accessible excitations from interband transitions to phonons. Here, bottom&#8208;up synthesized layered semiconductor (Ge1&#8211;xSnxS) nanoribbons with an axial twist and deep subwavelength thickness are demonstrated as a platform for realizing waveguide modes, and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy is introduced as a tool to characterize them. Combined experiments and simulations show the excitation of guided modes by the electron beam and their efficient detection via photons emitted in the ribbon plane, which enables the measurement of key properties such as the evanescent field into the vacuum cladding with nanometer resolution. The results identify van der Waals waveguides operating in the infrared and highlight an electron&#8208;microscopy&#8208;based approach for probing complex&#8208;shaped nanophotonic structures.

      <title>Multifunctional Reversible Self&#8208;Assembled Structures of Cellulose&#8208;Derived Phase&#8208;Change Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;change nanocrystals (C18&#8208;UCNCs) are prepared via surface esterification and further thiol&#8211;ene reaction on cellulose nanocrystals. These nanocrystals can assemble into flaky structures in the solid&#8208;state, which exhibit excellent thermoinduced imaging property, thermoinduced reversibility, and self&#8208;healing property. The multifunctional flaky structures can manipulate energy conversion, surface morphology, surface wetting, and optical properties, largely expanding their potential uses in various fields.








Abstract
Owing to advantageous properties attributed to well&#8208;organized structures, multifunctional materials with reversible hierarchical and highly ordered arrangement in solid&#8208;state assembled structures have drawn tremendous interest. However, such materials rarely exist. Based on the reversible phase transition of phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs), phase&#8208;change nanocrystals (C18&#8208;UCNCs) are presented herein, which are capable of self&#8208;assembling into well&#8208;ordered hierarchical structures. C18&#8208;UCNCs have a core&#8211;shell structure consisting of a cellulose crystalline core that retains the basic structure and a soft shell containing octadecyl chains that allow phase transition. The distinct core&#8211;shell structure and phase transition of octadecyl chains allow C18&#8208;UCNCs to self&#8208;assemble into flaky nano/microstructures. These self&#8208;assembled C18&#8208;UCNCs exhibit efficient thermal transport and light&#8208;to&#8208;thermal energy conversion, and thus are promising for thermosensitive imaging. Specifically, flaky self&#8208;assembled nano/microstructures with manipulable surface morphology, surface wetting, and optical properties are thermoreversible and show thermally induced self&#8208;healing properties. By using phase&#8208;change nanocrystals as a novel group of PCMs, reversible self&#8208;assembled multifunctional materials can be engineered. This study proposes a promising approach for constructing self&#8208;assembled hierarchical structures by using phase&#8208;change nanocrystals and thereby significantly expands the application of PCMs.

&lt;p&gt;Phase&#8208;change nanocrystals (C18&#8208;UCNCs) are prepared via surface esterification and further thiol&#8211;ene reaction on cellulose nanocrystals. These nanocrystals can assemble into flaky structures in the solid&#8208;state, which exhibit excellent thermoinduced imaging property, thermoinduced reversibility, and self&#8208;healing property. The multifunctional flaky structures can manipulate energy conversion, surface morphology, surface wetting, and optical properties, largely expanding their potential uses in various fields.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to advantageous properties attributed to well&#8208;organized structures, multifunctional materials with reversible hierarchical and highly ordered arrangement in solid&#8208;state assembled structures have drawn tremendous interest. However, such materials rarely exist. Based on the reversible phase transition of phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs), phase&#8208;change nanocrystals (C18&#8208;UCNCs) are presented herein, which are capable of self&#8208;assembling into well&#8208;ordered hierarchical structures. C18&#8208;UCNCs have a core&#8211;shell structure consisting of a cellulose crystalline core that retains the basic structure and a soft shell containing octadecyl chains that allow phase transition. The distinct core&#8211;shell structure and phase transition of octadecyl chains allow C18&#8208;UCNCs to self&#8208;assemble into flaky nano/microstructures. These self&#8208;assembled C18&#8208;UCNCs exhibit efficient thermal transport and light&#8208;to&#8208;thermal energy conversion, and thus are promising for thermosensitive imaging. Specifically, flaky self&#8208;assembled nano/microstructures with manipulable surface morphology, surface wetting, and optical properties are thermoreversible and show thermally induced self&#8208;healing properties. By using phase&#8208;change nanocrystals as a novel group of PCMs, reversible self&#8208;assembled multifunctional materials can be engineered. This study proposes a promising approach for constructing self&#8208;assembled hierarchical structures by using phase&#8208;change nanocrystals and thereby significantly expands the application of PCMs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reversible Crystal&#8211;Glass Transition in a Metal Halide Perovskite</title>
      <dc:description>
2D hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halide perovskites are introduced into the field of semiconducting glasses through deliberate synthetic design of the hybrid structure, resulting in facile and reversible glass&#8211;crystalline switching under moderate thermal cycling. Such glasses can find prospective application in, for example, memory, computing, nonlinear optics, communication, catalysis, sensing, and batteries.








Abstract
Crystalline metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have provided unprecedented advances in interdisciplinary fields of materials, electronics, and photonics. While crystallinity offers numerous advantages, the ability to access a glassy state with distinct properties provides unique opportunities to extend the associated structure&#8211;property relationship, as well as broaden the application space for MHPs. Amorphous analogs for MHPs have so far been restricted to high pressures, limiting detailed studies and applications. Here, a 2D MHP is structurally tailored using bulky chiral organic cations to exhibit an unusual confluence of exceptionally low melting temperature (175&#160;&#176;C) and inhibited crystallization. The chiral MHP can thus be melt&#8208;quenched into a stable glassy state, otherwise inhibited in the analogous racemic MHP. Facile and reversible switching between glassy and crystalline states is demonstrated for the chiral MHP, each with distinct optoelectronic character, opening new opportunities for applications including, for example nonvolatile memory, optical communication, and neuromorphic computing.

      <title>Gigantic Current Control of Coercive Field and Magnetic Memory Based on Nanometer&#8208;Thin Ferromagnetic van der Waals Fe3GeTe2</title>
      <dc:description>
Substantial coercivity reduction by the current, larger at least by two orders of magnitude than those in previous reports, is found in the van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2. It is theoretically shown to arise from an unusual type of gigantic spin&#8211;orbit torque, which itself is directly related to its special symmetries, large Berry curvature, and band topology. A working model of a new robust nonvolatile magnetic memory based on Fe3GeTe2, controlled by a much smaller current, is also produced.








Abstract
Controlling magnetic states by a small current is essential for the next&#8208;generation of energy&#8208;efficient spintronic devices. However, it invariably requires considerable energy to change a magnetic ground state of intrinsically quantum nature governed by fundamental Hamiltonian, once stabilized below a phase&#8208;transition temperature. Here, it is reported that, surprisingly, an in&#8208;plane current can tune the magnetic state of the nanometer&#8208;thin van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 from a hard magnetic state to a soft magnetic state. It is a direct demonstration of the current&#8208;induced substantial reduction of the coercive field. This surprising finding is possible because the in&#8208;plane current produces a highly unusual type of gigantic spin&#8211;orbit torque for Fe3GeTe2. In addition, a working model of a new nonvolatile magnetic memory based on the principle of the discovery in Fe3GeTe2, controlled by a tiny current, is further demonstrated. The findings open up a new window of exciting opportunities for magnetic van der Waals materials with potentially huge impact on the future development of spintronic and magnetic memory.

      <dc:description>
Cascade enzyme&#8208;based drug delivery bioreactors, GOx/hemin@ZIF&#8208;8@DHA (GHZD NCs), are fabricated with augmented biocatalytic efficiency. Free radicals and self&#8208;sufficient H2O2 in the tumor microenvironment trigger irretrievable apoptosis and necrosis, which burst severe damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) for activation of sequential immune responses. Moreover, GHZD NCs induce synergetic therapy with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 eliciting strong immunoreactions for inhibition of cancer metastasis.








Abstract
Biocatalytic nanomaterials have been verified to modulate the immunosuppressive state of an extensive range of solid tumors and directly induce antitumor immune response, which effectively combats the holdbacks in cancer immunotherapy. Herein, biomimetic cascade enzyme&#8208;initiated toxic&#8208;radical&#8208;generating devices (GHZD NCs) are fabricated by enveloping glucose oxidase (GOx), artificial nanozyme hemin, and sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide derived dihydroartemisinin (DHA) into zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) for enhanced biocatalytic immunotherapy. The GHZD NCs exhibit amplified multienzyme&#8208;mimic (glucose oxidase, peroxidase, and glutathione peroxidase) cascade reactions in artificial nanoscale proximity. Concurrently, a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;stimulated labile iron&#8208;current amplifier boosts C&#8208;centered free radicals, which endows the GHZD NCs with tumor&#8208;specific and self&#8208;circulating generation ability of vicious C&#8208;centered free radicals. Irreversible free radicals (&#183;C and &#183;OH) and sustainable H2O2 from sequential catalytic processes logically and selectively elevate the oxidative stress in the tumor, which further triggers an efficient immunogenic cell death (ICD) progress. In addition, the in situ nanozyme&#8208;based immunotherapy employed for tumor suppression successfully elicits the long&#8208;lasting immunological memory effect, which hinders the growth of distant tumors and lung metastasis.

      <title>Trends in Micro&#8208;/Nanorobotics: Materials Development, Actuation, Localization, and System Integration for Biomedical Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
The design and fabrication, functionalization, actuation, and tracking of individual and a swarm of micro/nanorobots are the indispensable part for achieving the biomedical applications. This review focuses on how to combine and integrate all the four aspects together and realize a biomedical therapeutic function using the micro&#8208;/nanorobotic strategy.








Abstract
Micro&#8208;/nanorobots (m&#8208;bots) have attracted significant interest due to their suitability for applications in biomedical engineering and environmental remediation. Particularly, their applications in in vivo diagnosis and intervention have been the focus of extensive research in recent years with various clinical imaging techniques being applied for localization and tracking. The successful integration of well&#8208;designed m&#8208;bots with surface functionalization, remote actuation systems, and imaging techniques becomes the crucial step toward biomedical applications, especially for the in vivo uses. This review thus addresses four different aspects of biomedical m&#8208;bots: design/fabrication, functionalization, actuation, and localization. The biomedical applications of the m&#8208;bots in diagnosis, sensing, microsurgery, targeted drug/cell delivery, thrombus ablation, and wound healing are reviewed from these viewpoints. The developed biomedical m&#8208;bot systems are comprehensively compared and evaluated based on their characteristics. The current challenges and the directions of future research in this field are summarized.

      <title>Extremely Stable Luminescent Crosslinked Perovskite Nanoparticles under Harsh Environments over 1.5 Years</title>
      <dc:description>
An extraordinarily long stability, exceeding 1.5 years, for crosslinked perovskite nanoparticles (NPs) under harsh environments, by a novel materials design strategy, is reported. Surprisingly, the photoluminescence of the perovskite NPs is significantly increased under air, moisture, and chemicals, overcoming their instability in oxygen, water, and polar chemicals.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite nanoparticles (NPs) are a very strong candidate emitter that can meet the high luminescence efficiency and high color standard of Rec.2020. However, the instability of perovskite NPs is the most critical unsolved problem that limits their practical application. Here, an extremely stable crosslinked perovskite NP (CPN) is reported that maintains high photoluminescence quantum yield for 1.5 years (&gt;600 d) in air and in harsher liquid environments (e.g., in water, acid, or base solutions, and in various polar solvents), and for more than 100 d under 85&#160;&#176;C and 85% relative humidity without additional encapsulation. Unsaturated hydrocarbons in both the acid and base ligands of NPs are chemically crosslinked with a methacrylate&#8208;functionalized matrix, which prevents decomposition of the perovskite crystals. Counterintuitively, water vapor permeating through the crosslinked matrix chemically passivates surface defects in the NPs and reduces nonradiative recombination. Green&#8208;emitting and white&#8208;emitting flexible large&#8208;area displays are demonstrated, which are stable for &gt;400 d in air and in water. The high stability of the CPN in water enables biocompatible cell proliferation which is usually impossible when toxic Pb elements are present. The stable materials design strategies provide a breakthrough toward commercialization of perovskite NPs in displays and bio&#8208;related applications.

Here, an extremely stable crosslinked perovskite NP (CPN) is reported that maintains high photoluminescence quantum yield for 1.5 years (&amp;gt;600 d) in air and in harsher liquid environments (e.g., in water, acid, or base solutions, and in various polar solvents), and for more than 100 d under 85&#160;&#176;C and 85% relative humidity without additional encapsulation. Unsaturated hydrocarbons in both the acid and base ligands of NPs are chemically crosslinked with a methacrylate&#8208;functionalized matrix, which prevents decomposition of the perovskite crystals. Counterintuitively, water vapor permeating through the crosslinked matrix chemically passivates surface defects in the NPs and reduces nonradiative recombination. Green&#8208;emitting and white&#8208;emitting flexible large&#8208;area displays are demonstrated, which are stable for &amp;gt;400 d in air and in water. The high stability of the CPN in water enables biocompatible cell proliferation which is usually impossible when toxic Pb elements are present. The stable materials design strategies provide a breakthrough toward commercialization of perovskite NPs in displays and bio&#8208;related applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ultrathin Ga2O3 Glass: A Large&#8208;Scale Passivation and Protection Material for Monolayer WS2</title>
      <dc:description>
2D transition metal dichalcogenides have promising properties for future semiconductor technologies. Their integration into functional devices requires cost&#8208;efficient and large&#8208;scale passivation and protection against material deposition. This work introduces ultrathin Ga2O3 glass as a new, scalable capping material for monolayer WS2. It exhibits a novel passivation mechanism and offers extraordinary protection against deposition of dielectric materials, for example, for top&#8208;gating.








Abstract
Atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenide crystals (TMDCs) have extraordinary optical properties that make them attractive for future optoelectronic applications. Integration of TMDCs into practical all&#8208;dielectric heterostructures hinges on the ability to passivate and protect them against necessary fabrication steps on large scales. Despite its limited scalability, encapsulation of TMDCs in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) currently has no viable alternative for achieving high performance of the final device. Here, it is shown that the novel, ultrathin Ga2O3 glass is an ideal centimeter&#8208;scale coating material that enhances optical performance of the monolayers and protects them against further material deposition. In particular, Ga2O3 capping of monolayer WS2 outperforms commercial&#8208;grade hBN in both scalability and optical performance at room temperature. These properties make Ga2O3 highly suitable for large&#8208;scale passivation and protection of monolayer TMDCs in functional&#160;heterostructures.

      <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance poly(vinylidene difluoride)/dopamine core/shell piezoelectric nanofibers with excellent stability are successfully fabricated by one&#8208;step electrospinning in large scale and quantity, offering an extraordinary building block for developing self&#8208;powered sensor devices to detect weak absolute pressure change from soft tissues in vivo.

Abstract
Fabrication of soft piezoelectric nanomaterials is essential for the development of wearable and implantable biomedical devices. However, a big challenge in this soft functional material development is to achieve a high piezoelectric property with long&#8208;term stability in a biological environment. Here, a one&#8208;step strategy for fabricating core/shell poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF)/dopamine (DA) nanofibers (NFs) with a very high &#946;&#8208;phase content and self&#8208;aligned polarization is reported. The self&#8208;assembled core/shell structure is believed essential for the formation and alignment of &#946;&#8208;phase PVDF, where strong intermolecular interaction between the &#63743;NH2 groups on DA and the &#63743;CF2 groups on PVDF is responsible for aligning the PVDF chains and promoting &#946;&#8208;phase nucleation. The as&#8208;received PVDF/DA NFs exhibit significantly enhanced piezoelectric performance and excellent stability and biocompatibility. An all&#8208;fiber&#8208;based soft sensor is fabricated and tested on human skin and in vivo in mice. The devices show a high sensitivity and accuracy for detecting weak physiological mechanical stimulation from diaphragm motions and blood pulsation. This sensing capability offers great diagnostic potential for the early assessment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases and respiratory disorders.

      <title>Finding the Next Superhard Material through Ensemble Learning</title>
      <dc:description>
An ensemble machine&#8208;learning method capable of finding new superhard materials is constructed by directly predicting the experimentally measured load&#8208;dependent Vickers hardness based only on chemical composition. The model is then used to conduct high&#8208;throughput screening of crystal databases and machine&#8208;learning generated phase diagrams to suggest undiscovered superhard materials.








Abstract
An ensemble machine&#8208;learning method is demonstrated to be capable of finding superhard materials by directly predicting the load&#8208;dependent Vickers hardness based only on the chemical composition. A total of 1062 experimentally measured load&#8208;dependent Vickers hardness data are extracted from the literature and used to train a supervised machine&#8208;learning algorithm utilizing boosting, achieving excellent accuracy (R2&#160;= 0.97). This new model is then tested by synthesizing and measuring the load&#8208;dependent hardness of several unreported disilicides and analyzing the predicted hardness of several classic superhard materials. The trained ensemble method is then employed to screen for superhard materials by examining more than 66&#8201;000 compounds in crystal structure databases, which show that 68 known materials have a Vickers hardness &#8805;40 GPa at 0.5 N (applied force) and only 10 exceed this mark at 5 N. The hardness model is then combined with the data&#8208;driven phase diagram generation tool to expand the limited number of reported high hardness compounds. Eleven ternary borocarbide phase spaces are studied, and more than ten thermodynamically favorable compositions with a hardness above 40 GPa (at 0.5 N) are identified, proving this ensemble model's ability to find previously unknown materials with outstanding mechanical&#160;properties.

      <dc:description>
A facile method for the preparation of graphene&#8208;MOF hybrids with an amine functionalized metal&#8208;organic framework and carboxylate functionalized graphene via amide bonds for capacitance applications is demonstrated.








Abstract
In this work, the covalent attachment of an amine functionalized metal&#8208;organic framework (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#160;= Zr6O4(OH)4(bdc&#8208;NH2)6; bdc&#8208;NH2&#160;= 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate) (UiO&#8208;Universitetet i Oslo) to the basal&#8208;plane of carboxylate functionalized graphene (graphene acid = GA) via amide bonds is reported. The resultant GA@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 hybrid displayed a large specific surface area, hierarchical pores and an interconnected conductive network. The electrochemical characterizations demonstrated that the hybrid GA@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 acts as an effective charge storing material with a capacitance of up to 651 F g&#8722;1, significantly higher than traditional graphene&#8208;based materials. The results suggest that the amide linkage plays a key role in the formation of a &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, which facilitates charge transfer and consequently offers good capacitance and cycling stability. Furthermore, to realize the practical feasibility, an asymmetric supercapacitor using a GA@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 positive electrode with Ti3C2TX MXene as the opposing electrode has been constructed. The cell is able to deliver a power density of up to 16&#160;kW kg&#8722;1 and an energy density of up to 73&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, which are comparable to several commercial devices such as Pb&#8208;acid and Ni/MH batteries. Under an intermediate level of loading, the device retained 88% of its initial capacitance after 10 000 cycles.

      <title>Alloyed Palladium&#8211;Silver Nanowires Enabling Ultrastable Carbon Dioxide Reduction to Formate</title>
      <dc:description>
Alloyed Pd&#8211;Ag nanowires exhibit significantly improved stability for electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate at potentials where people previously believed that the product could not be stably formed on Pd. This is due to the markedly enhanced CO tolerance and selective stabilization of key reaction intermediates on alloy nanowires.








Abstract
Palladium can enable the electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate with nearly zero overpotential and good selectivity. However, it usually has very limited stability owing to CO poisoning from the side reaction intermediate. Herein, it is demonstrated that alloying palladium with silver is a viable strategy to significantly enhance the electrocatalytic stability. Palladium&#8211;silver alloy nanowires are prepared in aqueous solution with tunable chemical compositions, large aspect ratio, and roughened surfaces. Thanks to the unique synergy between palladium and silver, these nanowires exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic performances for selective formate production. Most remarkably, impressive long&#8208;term stability is measured even at &lt;&#8201;&#8208;0.4&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode where people previously believed that formate cannot be stably formed on palladium. Such stability results from the enhanced CO tolerance and selective stabilization of key reaction intermediates on alloy nanowires as supported by detailed electrochemical characterizations and theoretical computations.

&lt;p&gt;Alloyed Pd&#8211;Ag nanowires exhibit significantly improved stability for electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to formate at potentials where people previously believed that the product could not be stably formed on Pd. This is due to the markedly enhanced CO tolerance and selective stabilization of key reaction intermediates on alloy nanowires.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palladium can enable the electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to formate with nearly zero overpotential and good selectivity. However, it usually has very limited stability owing to CO poisoning from the side reaction intermediate. Herein, it is demonstrated that alloying palladium with silver is a viable strategy to significantly enhance the electrocatalytic stability. Palladium&#8211;silver alloy nanowires are prepared in aqueous solution with tunable chemical compositions, large aspect ratio, and roughened surfaces. Thanks to the unique synergy between palladium and silver, these nanowires exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic performances for selective formate production. Most remarkably, impressive long&#8208;term stability is measured even at &amp;lt;&#8201;&#8208;0.4&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode where people previously believed that formate cannot be stably formed on palladium. Such stability results from the enhanced CO tolerance and selective stabilization of key reaction intermediates on alloy nanowires as supported by detailed electrochemical characterizations and theoretical computations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>
In article number 2004897, Shin&#8208;ichi Ohkoshi and co&#8208;workers propose a new magnetic recording methodology, &#8220;focused&#8208;millimeter&#8208;wave&#8208;assisted magnetic recording (F&#8208;MIMR)&#8221;, to drastically increase the recording density of magnetic tapes. Demonstrations are performed using magnetic films based on a series of epsilon iron oxide, &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3. Irradiation of the focused millimeter wave generated from terahertz (THz) light flips the magnetic pole direction, leading to a breakthrough technology for high&#8208;density magnetic recordings.

      <title>Magnetic Patterning: Magneto&#8208;Driven Gradients of Diamagnetic Objects for Engineering Complex Tissues (Adv. Mater. 48/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2005030, Robert L. Mauck and co&#8208;workers magnetically pattern diamagnetic objects in 3D hydrogels to engineer complex tissues. Because the diamagnetic objects are suspended in a transiently paramagnetic solution, the objects are repelled from a permanent magnet. Most notably, unlabeled living cells are magneto&#8208;patterned to generate cartilaginous tissues with a native&#8208;like cell gradient.

A comprehensive analytical system that connects flow pattern, crystallization, and thin&#8208;film properties is introduced by Steve Park, Jaewook Nam, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2004864. Using 3D&#8208;patterned microfluidic channels, flow pattern is precisely manipulated. 3D numerical simulation and in situ microscopy enable tracking of the flow pattern along its entire path, elucidating its relation to the crystallization process. The resulting organic thin&#8208;film transistors have superior device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformity.
