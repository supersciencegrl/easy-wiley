         <title>Designing Mechanical Metamaterials with Kirigami&#8208;Inspired, Hierarchical Constructions for Giant Positive and Negative Thermal Expansion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of 2D hierarchical metamaterial that incorporates kirigami&#8208;inspired bilayer actuating elements into periodic lattice patterns to allow for giant positive/negative CTEs is developed. Quantitative comparison to existing mechanical metamaterials suggests that the presented hierarchical metamaterials can substantially enlarge the accessible range of CTE in the Ashby plot, by nearly an order of magnitude for the biaxial CTE.








Abstract
Advanced mechanical metamaterials with unusual thermal expansion properties represent an area of growing interest, due to their promising potential for use in a broad range of areas. In spite of previous work on metamaterials with large or ultralow coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), achieving a broad range of CTE values with access to large thermally induced dimensional changes in structures with high filling ratios remains a key challenge. Here, design concepts and fabrication strategies for a kirigami&#8208;inspired class of 2D hierarchical metamaterials that can effectively convert the thermal mismatch between two closely packed constituent materials into giant levels of biaxial/uniaxial thermal expansion/shrinkage are presented. At large filling ratios (&gt;50%), these systems offer not only unprecedented negative and positive biaxial CTE (i.e., &#8722;5950 and 10 710&#160;ppm K&#8722;1), but also large biaxial thermal expansion properties (e.g., &gt;&#160;21% for 20 K temperature increase). Theoretical modeling of thermal deformations provides a clear understanding of the microstructure&#8211;property relationships and serves as a basis for design choices for desired CTE values. An Ashby plot of the CTE versus density serves as a quantitative comparison of the hierarchical metamaterials presented here to previously reported systems, indicating the capability for substantially enlarging the accessible range of CTE.

         <title>Recent Advances in Hyperthermia Therapy&#8208;Based Synergistic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomaterial&#8208;based hyperthermia therapy (HTT) including photothermal therapy and magnetic hyperthermia can not only ablate different types of primary tumors, but also sensitize tumors to create a highly immunogenic tumor microenvironment for immunotherapy to further fight against cancer metastasis and recurrence. Hence, such HTT&#8208;synergized immunotherapy approach offers a powerful method for curing cancer completely.








Abstract
The past decades have witnessed hyperthermia therapy (HTT) as an emerging strategy against malignant tumors. Nanomaterial&#8208;based photothermal therapy (PTT) and magnetic hyperthermia (MHT), as highly effective and noninvasive treatment models, offer advantages over other strategies in the treatment of different types of tumors. However, both PTT and MHT cannot completely cure cancer due to recurrence and distal metastasis. In recent years, cancer immunotherapy has attracted widespread attention owing to its capability to activate the body's own natural defense to identify, attack, and eradicate cancer cells. Significant efforts have been devoted to studying the activated immune responses caused by hyperthermia&#8208;ablated tumors. In this article, the synergistic mechanism of HTT in immunotherapy, including immunogenic cell death and reversal of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment is discussed. The reports of the combination of HTT or HTT&#8208;based multimodal therapy with immunotherapy, including immunoadjuvant exploitation, immune checkpoint blockade therapy, and adoptive cellular immunotherapy are summarized. As highlighted, these strategies could achieve synergistically enhanced therapeutic outcomes against both primary tumors and metastatic lesions, prevent cancer recurrence, and prolong the survival period. Finally, current challenges and prospective developments in HTT&#8208;synergized immunotherapy are also reviewed.

         <title>Nanocellulose: Recent Fundamental Advances and Emerging Biological and Biomimicking Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocelluloses have recently become the focal point of sustainable nanoconstruction. Beyond the classic approaches dealing with, for example, reinforced nanocomposites, barriers, films, and structural color, the fundamental interactions within nanocelluloses, multifunctional hybrid gels, multicomponent fibers, and nanocelluloses in artificial photosynthesis are reviewed.








Abstract
In the effort toward sustainable advanced functional materials, nanocelluloses have attracted extensive recent attention. Nanocelluloses range from rod&#8208;like highly crystalline cellulose nanocrystals to longer and more entangled cellulose nanofibers, earlier denoted also as microfibrillated celluloses and bacterial cellulose. In recent years, they have spurred research toward a wide range of applications, ranging from nanocomposites, viscosity modifiers, films, barrier layers, fibers, structural color, gels, aerogels and foams, and energy applications, until filtering membranes, to name a few. Still, nanocelluloses continue to show surprisingly high challenges to master their interactions and tailorability to allow well&#8208;controlled assemblies for functional materials. Rather than trying to review the already extensive nanocellulose literature at large, here selected aspects of the recent progress are the focus. Water interactions, which are central for processing for the functional properties, are discussed first. Then advanced hybrid gels toward (multi)stimuli responses, shape&#8208;memory materials, self&#8208;healing, adhesion and gluing, biological scaffolding, and forensic applications are discussed. Finally, composite fibers are discussed, as well as nanocellulose as a strategy for improvement of photosynthesis&#8208;based chemicals production. In summary, selected perspectives toward new directions for sustainable high&#8208;tech functional materials science based on nanocelluloses are described.

         <title>Identifying Ionic and Electronic Charge Transfer at Oxide Heterointerfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combined role of ionic and electronic charge transfer in oxide heterointerfaces (LaAlO3/SrTiO3) is investigated. New near&#8208;ambient&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy data proves a reversible Sr cation reconstruction under thermodynamic treatment to be responsible for lowered interface conductivity and enhanced magnetism under low temperatures. Ionic movement is found to be considerably higher and more influential than in the bulk.








Abstract
The ability to tailor oxide heterointerfaces has led to novel properties in low&#8208;dimensional oxide systems. A fundamental understanding of these properties is based on the concept of electronic charge transfer. However, the electronic properties of oxide heterointerfaces crucially depend on their ionic constitution and defect structure: ionic charges contribute to charge transfer and screening at oxide interfaces, triggering a thermodynamic balance of ionic and electronic structures. Quantitative understanding of the electronic and ionic roles regarding charge&#8208;transfer phenomena poses a central challenge. Here, the electronic and ionic structure is simultaneously investigated at the prototypical charge&#8208;transfer heterointerface, LaAlO3/SrTiO3. Applying in situ photoemission spectroscopy under oxygen ambient, ionic and electronic charge transfer is deconvoluted in response to the oxygen atmosphere at elevated temperatures. In this way, both the rich and variable chemistry of complex oxides and the associated electronic properties are equally embraced. The interfacial electron gas is depleted through an ionic rearrangement in the strontium cation sublattice when oxygen is applied, resulting in an inverse and reversible balance between cation vacancies and electrons, while the mobility of ionic species is found to be considerably enhanced as compared to the bulk. Triggered by these ionic phenomena, the electronic transport and magnetic signature of the heterointerface are significantly altered.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a straightforward polyTPD passivation is introduced to reduce the defect&#8208;mediated recombination by elucidating the imperfections on the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite materials. Suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination and improved interfacial hole extraction result in perovskite solar cells with stabilized efficiency exceeding 21%. Moreover, ultra&#8208;hydrophobic and thermally robust polyTPD passivated devices retain 94% of the initial efficiency after 800 h under operational conditions.








Abstract
The failure of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to maintain their maximum efficiency over a prolonged time is due to the deterioration of the light harvesting material under environmental factors such as humidity, heat, and light. Systematically elucidating and eliminating such degradation pathways are critical to imminent commercial use of this technology. Here, a straightforward approach is introduced to reduce the level of defect&#8208;states present at the perovskite and hole transporting layer interface by treating the various perovskite surfaces with poly(N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;4&#8208;butylphenyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisphenyl)benzidine (polyTPD) molecules. This strategy significantly suppresses the defect&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative recombination in the ensuing devices and prevents the penetration of degrading agents into the inner layers by passivating the perovskite surface and grain boundaries. Suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination and improved interfacial hole extraction result in PSCs with stabilized efficiency exceeding 21% with negligible hysteresis (&#8776;19.1% for control device). Moreover, ultra&#8208;hydrophobic polyTPD passivant considerably alleviates moisture penetration, showing &#8776;91% retention of initial efficiencies after 300 h storage at high relative humidity of 80%. Similarly, passivated device retains 94% of its initial efficiency after 800 h under operational conditions (maximum power point tracking under continuous illumination at 60&#160;&#176;C). In addition to interfacial passivation function, hole&#8208;selective role of dopant&#8208;free polyTPD is also evaluated and discussed in this study.

Suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination and improved interfacial hole extraction result in perovskite solar cells with stabilized efficiency exceeding 21%. Moreover, ultra&#8208;hydrophobic and thermally robust polyTPD passivated devices retain 94% of the initial efficiency after 800 h under operational conditions.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failure of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to maintain their maximum efficiency over a prolonged time is due to the deterioration of the light harvesting material under environmental factors such as humidity, heat, and light. Systematically elucidating and eliminating such degradation pathways are critical to imminent commercial use of this technology. Here, a straightforward approach is introduced to reduce the level of defect&#8208;states present at the perovskite and hole transporting layer interface by treating the various perovskite surfaces with poly(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;4&#8208;butylphenyl&#8208;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;&#8208;bisphenyl)benzidine (polyTPD) molecules. This strategy significantly suppresses the defect&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative recombination in the ensuing devices and prevents the penetration of degrading agents into the inner layers by passivating the perovskite surface and grain boundaries. Suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination and improved interfacial hole extraction result in PSCs with stabilized efficiency exceeding 21% with negligible hysteresis (&#8776;19.1% for control device). Moreover, ultra&#8208;hydrophobic polyTPD passivant considerably alleviates moisture penetration, showing &#8776;91% retention of initial efficiencies after 300 h storage at high relative humidity of 80%. Similarly, passivated device retains 94% of its initial efficiency after 800 h under operational conditions (maximum power point tracking under continuous illumination at 60&#160;&#176;C). In addition to interfacial passivation function, hole&#8208;selective role of dopant&#8208;free polyTPD is also evaluated and discussed in this study.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Strain&#8208;Mediated High Conductivity in Ultrathin Antiferromagnetic Metallic Nitrides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronic state transitions in highly crystalline antiferromagnetic CrN films are mediated with strain and reduced dimensionality. Surprisingly, the CrN layer is still highly conductive when its thickness shrinks to 1&#8208;unit&#8208;cell, which is far below the critical thickness of most metallic films. The ability to achieve highly conductive nitride ultrathin films can be used for utilizing their exceptional characteristics.








Abstract
Strain engineering provides the ability to control the ground states and associated phase transition in epitaxial films. However, the systematic study of the intrinsic character and strain dependency in transition&#8208;metal nitrides remains challenging due to the difficulty in fabricating stoichiometric and high&#8208;quality films. Here the observation of an electronic state transition in highly crystalline antiferromagnetic CrN films with strain and reduced dimensionality is reported. By shrinking the film thickness to a critical value of &#8776;30 unit cells, a profound conductivity reduction accompanied by unexpected volume expansion is observed in CrN films. The electrical conductivity is observed surprisingly when the CrN layer is as thin as a single unit cell thick, which is far below the critical thickness of most metallic films. It is found that the metallicity of an ultrathin CrN film recovers from insulating behavior upon the removal of the as&#8208;grown strain by the fabrication of freestanding nitride films. Both first&#8208;principles calculations and linear dichroism measurements reveal that the strain&#8208;mediated orbital splitting effectively customizes the relatively small bandgap at the Fermi level, leading to an exotic phase transition in CrN. The ability to achieve highly conductive nitride ultrathin films by harnessing strain&#8208;control over competing phases can be used for utilizing their exceptional characteristics.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, microfluidic technologies have increasingly been applied toward the accelerated synthesis science studies of solution&#8208;processed nanomaterials, allowing greater control over synthesis conditions, lower reagent consumption, and unique data access through online monitoring techniques. Adoption of microfluidic synthesis technologies offers potential access to higher performing nanomaterials through autonomous robotic experimentation.








Abstract
In recent years, microfluidic technologies have emerged as a powerful approach for the advanced synthesis and rapid optimization of various solution&#8208;processed nanomaterials, including semiconductor quantum dots and nanoplatelets, and metal plasmonic and reticular framework nanoparticles. These fluidic systems offer access to previously unattainable measurements and synthesis conditions at unparalleled efficiencies and sampling rates. Despite these advantages, microfluidic systems have yet to be extensively adopted by the colloidal nanomaterial community. To help bridge the gap, this progress report details the basic principles of microfluidic reactor design and performance, as well as the current state of online diagnostics and autonomous robotic experimentation strategies, toward the size, shape, and composition&#8208;controlled synthesis of various colloidal nanomaterials. By discussing the application of fluidic platforms in recent high&#8208;priority colloidal nanomaterial studies and their potential for integration with rapidly emerging artificial intelligence&#8208;based decision&#8208;making strategies, this report seeks to encourage interdisciplinary collaborations between microfluidic reactor engineers and colloidal nanomaterial chemists. Full convergence of these two research efforts offers significantly expedited and enhanced nanomaterial discovery, optimization, and manufacturing.

         <title>An Ultrahigh&#8208;Field&#8208;Tailored T1&#8211;T2 Dual&#8208;Mode MRI Contrast Agent for High&#8208;Performance Vascular Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrahigh magnetic field (UHF)&#8208;tailored T1&#8211;T2 dual&#8208;mode iron oxide nanoparticle&#8208;based contrast agent (UDIOC) with a near&#8208;paramagnetic core and ultracompact hydrophilic surface modification is developed, which exhibits a dually enhanced T1&#8211;T2 contrast effect under UHF. By virtue of high&#8208;resolution UHF magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a simple double&#8208;checking process, UDIOC&#8208;based dual&#8208;mode imaging enables the assessment of the vascular anatomy and functions with high sensitivity and accuracy.








Abstract
The assessment of vascular anatomy and functions using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for medical diagnosis, whereas the commonly used low&#8208;field MRI system (&#8804;3 T) suffers from low spatial resolution. Ultrahigh field (UHF) MRI (&#8805;7 T), with significantly improved resolution and signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, shows great potential to provide high&#8208;resolution vasculature images. However, practical applications of UHF MRI technology for vascular imaging are currently limited by the low sensitivity and accuracy of single&#8208;mode (T1 or T2) contrast agents. Herein, a UHF&#8208;tailored T1&#8211;T2 dual&#8208;mode iron oxide nanoparticle&#8208;based contrast agent (UDIOC) with extremely small core size and ultracompact hydrophilic surface modification, exhibiting dually enhanced T1&#8211;T2 contrast effect under the 7 T magnetic field, is reported. The UDIOC enables clear visualization of microvasculature as small as &#8776;140&#160;&#181;m in diameter under UHF MRI, extending the detection limit of the 7 T MR angiography. Moreover, by virtue of high&#8208;resolution UHF MRI and a simple double&#8208;checking process, UDIOC&#8208;based dual&#8208;mode dynamic contrast&#8208;enhanced MRI is successfully applied to detect tumor vascular permeability with extremely high sensitivity and accuracy, providing a novel paradigm for the precise medical diagnosis of vascular&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Realization of Regular&#8208;Mixed Quasi&#8208;1D Borophene Chains with Long&#8208;Range Order</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
New structural phases of borophene grown by molecular beam epitaxy are observed on a Ag(100) substrate. Low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy measurements and ab initio calculations are consistent in the discovery of mixed phases, which can be described as a combination of quasi&#8208;1D borophene chains and can be separated by substrate orientation.








Abstract
The polymorphism of borophene makes it a promising system to realize tunable physical or chemical properties. Various pure borophene phases consisting of quasi&#8208;1D boron chains with different widths have been commonly obtained in experimental studies. Here, it is shown that, due to a substrate mediation effect, artificial long&#8208;range ordered phases of borophene consisting of different combinations of boron chains seamlessly joined together can be achieved on Ag(100). Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that mixed&#8208;chain phases are more stable than the pure phase, and interact only weakly with the substrate. The mixed&#8208;chain phases with various proportions of different chains can be well separated based on the crystal direction of the substrate. The successful growth of mixed&#8208;chain phases is expected to deepen the impact of substrate tailored synthesis of borophene.

         <title>Highly Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence via an Unconjugated Donor&#8211;Acceptor System Realizing EQE of Over 30%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter, 2tDMG, is designed and synthesized based on the donor (D)/acceptor (A) spatially intramolecular noncovalent interaction. The D/A units are connected via a rigid linker, thereby confining them into a close&#8208;packed coplanar configuration for small singlet&#8211;triplet splitting energy. 2tDMG achieves a high external quantum efficiency of 30.8% with a low efficiency roll&#8208;off in evaporation&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).








Abstract
In this work, two novel thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, 2tDMG and 3tDMG, are synthesized for high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), The two emitters have a tilted face&#8208;to&#8208;face alignment of donor (D)/acceptor (A) units presenting intramolecular noncovalent interactions. The two TADF materials are deposited either by an evaporation&#8208;process or by a solution&#8208;process, both of them leading to high OLED performance. 2tDMG used as the emitter in evaporation&#8208;processed OLEDs achieves a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.8% with a very flat efficiency roll&#8208;off of 7% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. The solution&#8208;processed OLEDs also display an interesting EQE of 16.2%. 3tDMG shows improved solubility and solution processability as compared to 2tDMG, and thus a high EQE of 20.2% in solution&#8208;processed OLEDs is recorded. The corresponding evaporation&#8208;processed OLEDs also reach a reasonably high EQE of 26.3%. Encouragingly, this work provides a novel strategy to address the imperious demands for OLEDs with high EQE and low roll&#8208;off.

         <title>Black Bioceramics: Combining Regeneration with Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new generation of black bioceramics is successfully synthesized through a magnesium thermal&#8208;reduction strategy. The black bioceramics possess an excellent skin/bone tumor therapy effect while retaining their initial bioactivity, extending the functions of bioceramics from tissue regeneration to disease therapy. Such black bioceramics, with both cancer therapy and tissue regeneration, should greatly promote the scientific revival and clinical application of bioceramics.








Abstract
Bioceramics have been developed from bioinert to bioactive or biodegradable materials in the past few decades. However, at present, traditional bioceramics are still mainly used in bone tissue regeneration and dental restoration. In this work, a new generation of &#8220;black bioceramics,&#8221; extending the applications from tissue regeneration to disease therapy, is presented. Black bioceramics, through magnesium thermal reduction of traditional white ceramics, including silicate&#8208;based (e.g., CaSiO3, MgSiO3) and phosphate&#8208;based (e.g., Ca3(PO4)2, Ca5(PO4)3(OH)), are successfully synthesized. Due to the presence of oxygen vacancies and structural defects, the black bioceramics possess photothermal functionality while maintaining their initial high bioactivity and regenerative capacity. These black bioceramics show excellent photothermal antitumor effects for both skin and bone tumors. At the same time, they have significantly improved bioactivity for skin/bone tissue repair in vitro and in vivo. These fascinating properties award the black bioceramics with profound applications in both tumor therapy and tissue regeneration, which should greatly promote the scientific relevance and clinical application of bioceramics, representing a promising new direction of cell&#8208;instructive biomaterials.

         <title>Reversible Deposition of Lithium Particles Enabled by Ultraconformal and Stretchable Graphene Film for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stacked graphene layers are built in situ on Li metal as an ultraconformal and deformable protective skin. This skin inhibits direct contact between the Li metal and the electrolyte while enabling fast Li&#8208;ion transfer for Li deposition beneath. Interlayer slip and wrinkles ensure the graphene film is ultraconformal during reversible expansion and shrinkage of the micro&#8208;sized Li particles, which suppresses Li dendrites and pulverization.








Abstract
Originating from inhomogeneous Li deposition and dissolution, the formation of dendritic and/or dead Li lies as a fundamental barrier to the practical implementation of Li metal anodes for high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries. Here, an ultraconformal and stretchable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) composed of parallelly stacked few&#8208;layer defect&#8208;free graphene nanosheets, which can deform to remain ultraconformal during the expansion and shrinkage of micro&#8208;sized Li metal particles is reported. The shape&#8208;adaptive graphene protective skin is prepared via a facile mechanical method followed by Li stripping, which enables fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion, and inhibits Li dendrites and Li pulverization. The interlayer slips and wrinkles of the graphene film endow the robust protective skin with high stretchability. This work represents a unique strategy of building ultraconformal and stretchable 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;based protective skins on the surface of Li metal toward high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;life, and safe Li metal batteries.

         <title>Dirac Fermion Kinetics in 3D Curved Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D curved graphene with a wide range of curvature radii from 25 to 1000 nm demonstrates that nanoscale curvature is a new degree of freedom to tune the transport properties of graphene by manipulating 2D electron kinetics on 3D curved surfaces.








Abstract
3D integration of&#160;graphene has attracted attention for realizing&#160;carbon&#8208;based electronic devices. While the 3D integration can amplify various excellent properties of graphene, the influence of 3D curved surfaces on the fundamental physical properties of graphene has not been clarified. The electronic properties of 3D nanoporous graphene with a curvature radius down to 25&#8211;50 nm are systematically investigated and the ambipolar electronic states of Dirac fermions are essentially preserved in the 3D graphene nanoarchitectures, while the 3D curvature can effectively suppress the slope of the linear density of states of Dirac fermion near the Fermi level are demonstrated. Importantly, the 3D curvature can be utilized to tune the back&#8208;scattering&#8208;suppressed electrical transport of Dirac fermions and enhance&#160;both electron localization and electron&#8211;electron interaction. As a result, nanoscale curvature&#160;provides a new degree of freedom to manipulate&#160;3D graphene electrical properties, which may pave a new way to design new 3D graphene devices with preserved 2D electronic properties&#160;and novel functionalities.

         <title>Negative&#8208;Pressure&#8208;Induced Large Polarization in Nanosized PbTiO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
0D freestanding PbTiO3 nanoparticles (NPs) are synthesized through a two&#8208;phase solvethermal method. Raised tetragonality, as well as enhanced spontaneous polarization are achieved, induced by a negative pressure along the c axis. This originates from strengthened Pb&#8211;O hybridization induced by plentiful distribution of PbO terminations on the surface of the PbTiO3 NPs, which has been theoretically identified as a crucial factor of ferroelectricity.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials usually undergo decay with particle size decreasing into the nanoscale. At the critical value, the crystal structure undergoes a transition from the ferroelectric to paraelectric phase and the ferroelectricity vanishes. It is a big issue to sufficiently maintain strong ferroelectricity at the nanoscale. Herein, it is reported that synthesized 0D freestanding PbTiO3 nanoparticles (NPs) present negative pressure along the c axis (&#916;c/cbulk &#215; 100% =&#160;&#8722;2.406), inducing large spontaneous polarization PS (71.2 &#181;C cm&#8722;2 in 12&#160;nm). Further local structural studies by atomic pair distribution functions and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure indicate the structural evolution of nanosized PbTiO3. High&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field STEM images reveal the existence of preponderant PbO&#8208;terminations on the surface of the PbTiO3 NPs. Ab initio calculation reveals the enhanced hybridization between Pb and O ions, which gives rise to the negative pressure and tensile stress to stabilize the high tetragonality and large polarization. The present work demonstrates an untraditional route to enhance the ferroelectricity and related properties in functional nanostructured materials, being of significance to nanodevices.

Herein, it is reported that synthesized 0D freestanding PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles (NPs) present negative pressure along the &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; axis (&#916;&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;bulk&lt;/sub&gt; &#215; 100% =&#160;&#8722;2.406), inducing large spontaneous polarization &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; (71.2 &#181;C cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 12&#160;nm). Further local structural studies by atomic pair distribution functions and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure indicate the structural evolution of nanosized PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. High&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field STEM images reveal the existence of preponderant PbO&#8208;terminations on the surface of the PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NPs. Ab initio calculation reveals the enhanced hybridization between Pb and O ions, which gives rise to the negative pressure and tensile stress to stabilize the high tetragonality and large polarization. The present work demonstrates an untraditional route to enhance the ferroelectricity and related properties in functional nanostructured materials, being of significance to nanodevices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Pole Flip by Millimeter Wave</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new magnetic recording methodology, &#8220;focused&#8208;millimeter&#8208;wave&#8208;assisted magnetic recording (F&#8208;MIMR)&#8221;, is demonstrated by irradiating a focused millimeter wave onto epsilon iron oxide. In F&#8208;MIMR, the magnetic pole direction is instantly switched by the focused millimeter wave generated from terahertz light, and the heat&#8208;up effect of the recording media is suppressed. Thus, F&#8208;MIMR can be applied to high&#8208;density magnetic recordings.








Abstract
In the era of Big Data and the Internet of Things, data archiving is a key technology. From this viewpoint, magnetic recordings are drawing attention because they guarantee long&#8208;term data storage. To archive an enormous amount of data, further increase of the recording density is necessary. Herein a new magnetic recording methodology, &#8220;focused&#8208;millimeter&#8208;wave&#8208;assisted magnetic recording (F&#8208;MIMR),&#8221; is proposed. To test this methodology, magnetic films based on epsilon iron oxide nanoparticles are prepared and a focused&#8208;millimeter&#8208;wave generator is constructed using terahertz (THz) light. Irradiating the focused millimeter wave to epsilon iron oxide instantly switches its magnetic pole direction. The spin dynamics of F&#8208;MIMR are also calculated using the stochastic Landau&#8211;Lifshitz&#8211;Gilbert model considering all of the spins in an epsilon iron oxide nanoparticle. In F&#8208;MIMR, the heat&#8208;up effect of the recording media is expected to be suppressed. Thus, F&#8208;MIMR can be applied to high&#8208;density magnetic recordings.

         <title>Highly Ordered 2D&#8208;Assemblies of Phase&#8208;Segregated Block Molecules for Upconverted Linearly Polarized Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triplet&#8208;energy&#8208;migration&#8208;based photon upconversion is demonstrated in films of 2D crystalline sheets of 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene functionalized with discrete&#8208;length oligodimethylsiloxane. Annealing increases the upconverted photoluminescence intensity up to 100&#8208;fold due to increased chromophore ordering and enhanced donor dispersion. Upconversion imaging microscopy spatially resolves the triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion intensity with micrometer resolution. Millimeter&#8208;sized domains show linearly polarized upconverted emission.








Abstract
Materials based on the laminar ordering of self&#8208;assembled molecules have a unique potential for applications requiring efficient energy migration through densely packed chromophores. Here, employing molecular assemblies of coil&#8211;rod&#8211;coil block molecules for triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) based on triplet energy migration with linearly polarized emission is reported. By covalently attaching discrete&#8208;length oligodimethylsiloxane (oDMS) to 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA), highly ordered 2D crystalline DPA sheets separated by oDMS layers are obtained. Transparent films of this material doped with small amounts of triplet sensitizer PtII octaethylporphyrin show air&#8208;stable TTA&#8208;UC under non&#8208;coherent excitation. Upon annealing, an increase in TTA&#8208;UC up to two orders of magnitude is observed originating from both an improved molecular ordering of DPA and an increased dispersion of the sensitizer. The molecular alignment in millimeter&#8208;sized domains leads to upconverted linearly polarized emission without alignment layers. By using a novel technique, upconversion imaging microscopy, the TTA&#8208;UC intensity is spatially resolved on a micrometer scale to visually demonstrate the importance of molecular dispersion of sensitizer molecules for efficient TTA&#8208;UC. The reported results are promising for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and 3D night&#8208;vision applications, but also exemplify the potential of discrete oligodimethylsiloxane functionalized chromophores for highly aligned and densely packed molecular materials.

         <title>Dislocation&#8208;Strained IrNi Alloy Nanoparticles Driven by Thermal Shock for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dislocation&#8208;strained IrNi nanoparticles with competitive HER activity are realized by unsteady thermal shock progress in an extreme environment, and they are uniformly distributed within a carbon nanotube sponge (DSIrNi@CNTS). Numerous dislocations are generated in self&#8208;assembled IrNi nanoparticles due to ultrafast quenching, inducing strain effects into the IrNi nanoparticles, which optimize the electronic structure of the active sites.








Abstract
Designing high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts is crucial for the electrochemical production of hydrogen. Dislocation&#8208;strained IrNi nanoparticles loaded on a carbon nanotube sponge (DSIrNi@CNTS) driven by unsteady thermal shock in an extreme environment are reported here as a highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst. Experimental results demonstrate that numerous dislocations are kinetically trapped in self&#8208;assembled IrNi nanoparticles due to the ultrafast quenching and different atomic radii, which can induce strain effects into the IrNi nanoparticles. Such strain&#8208;induced high&#8208;energy surface structures arising from bulk defects (dislocations), are more likely to be resistant to surface restructuring during catalysis. The catalyst exhibits outstanding HER activity with only 17 mV overpotential to achieve 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in an alkaline electrolyte with fabulous stability, exceeding state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C catalysts.&#160;These&#160;density functional theory results demonstrate that the electronic structure of as&#8208;synthesized IrNi nanostructure can be optimized by the strain effects induced by the dislocations, and the free energy of HER can be tuned toward the optimal region.

         <title>Neutrophils Enable Local and Non&#8208;Invasive Liposome Delivery to Inflamed Skeletal Muscle and Ischemic Heart</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neutrophil&#8208;based drug delivery system, obtained through ex vivo neutrophil loading and intravenous reinjection, is designed to transport methotrexate (MTX)&#8208;loaded liposomes to inflamed tissue. This hybrid system efficiently delivers liposomes to inflamed skeletal muscle and ischemia reperfusion injured myocardium. Upon arrival in the inflamed muscle, neutrophils release the MTX&#8208;loaded liposomes with anti&#8208;inflammatory outcome.








Abstract
Uncontrolled inflammation is a major pathological factor underlying a range of diseases including autoimmune conditions, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Improving localized delivery of immunosuppressive drugs to inflamed tissue in a non&#8208;invasive manner offers significant promise to reduce severe side effects caused by systemic administration. Here, a neutrophil&#8208;mediated delivery system able to transport drug&#8208;loaded nanocarriers to inflamed tissue by exploiting the inherent ability of neutrophils to migrate to inflammatory tissue is reported. This hybrid system (neutrophils loaded with liposomes ex vivo) efficiently migrates in vitro following an inflammatory chemokine gradient. Furthermore, the triggered release of loaded liposomes and reuptake by target macrophages is studied. The migratory behavior of liposome&#8208;loaded neutrophils is confirmed in vivo by demonstrating the delivery of drug&#8208;loaded liposomes to an inflamed skeletal muscle in mice. A single low&#8208;dose injection of the hybrid system locally reduces inflammatory cytokine levels. Biodistribution of liposome&#8208;loaded neutrophils in a human&#8208;disease&#8208;relevant myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury mouse model after i.v. injection confirms the ability of injected neutrophils to carry loaded liposomes to inflammation sites. This strategy shows the potential of nanocarrier&#8208;loaded neutrophils as a universal platform to deliver anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs to promote tissue regeneration in inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Rich Adhesive Molybdenum Disulfide/rGO Vertical Heterostructures with Enhanced Nanozyme Activity for Smart Bacterial Killing Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molybdenum disulfide/rGO vertical heterostructures are demonstrated to possess triple enzyme&#8208;like activities, which are further enhanced through light irradiation. Coupled with the rough surface that contributes excellent capacity for bacterial capture, preeminent antibacterial efficacy against drug&#8208;resistant bacteria is exhibited both in vitro and in vivo by such a defect&#8208;rich adhesive nanozyme, which will blaze a new path for the development of alternative antibiotics.








Abstract
Nanomaterials with intrinsic enzyme&#8208;like activities, namely &#8220;nanozymes,&#8221; are showing increasing potential as a new type of broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotics. However, their feasibility is still far from satisfactory, due to their low catalytic activity, poor bacterial capturing capacity, and complicated material design. Herein, a facile synthesis of a defect&#8208;rich adhesive molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)/rGO vertical heterostructure (VHS) through a one&#8208;step microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal method is reported. This simple, convenient but effective method for rapid material synthesis enables extremely uniform and well&#8208;dispersed MoS2/rGO VHS with abundant S and Mo vacancies and rough surface, for a performance approaching the requirements of practical application. It is demonstrated experimentally and theoretically that the as&#8208;prepared MoS2/rGO VHS possesses defect and irradiation dual&#8208;enhanced triple enzyme&#8208;like activities (oxidase, peroxidase, and catalase) for promoting free&#8208;radical generation, owing to much more active edge sites exposure. Meanwhile, the VHS&#8208;achieved rough surface exhibits excellent capacity for bacterial capture, with elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) destruction through local topological interactions. As a result, optimized efficacy against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria can be explored by such defect&#8208;rich adhesive nanozymes, demonstrating a simple but powerful way to engineered nanozymes for alternative antibiotics.

         <title>Six Birds with One Stone: Versatile Nanoporphyrin for Single&#8208;Laser&#8208;Triggered Synergistic Phototheranostics and Robust Immune Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile nanoporphyrin (Pp18&#8208;lipo) that is self&#8208;assembled from lipid&#8211;purpurin 18 conjugates (Pp18&#8208;lipids) and pure lipids is developed for multifunctional cancer theranostics. Upon exposure to a single 705&#160;nm&#8208;laser, the as&#8208;prepared Pp18&#8208;lipos with two different proportions of Pp18&#8208;lipids can simultaneously realize photoacoustic imaging, fluorescence imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, and immune activation.








Abstract
Simultaneous photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) can reduce the risks of drug leakage, body burden, and preparation complexity in traditional combination PDT/PTT. Here, a versatile nanoporphyrin (Pp18&#8208;lipos) self&#8208;assembled from lipid&#8211;purpurin 18 conjugates (Pp18&#8208;lipids) and pure lipids is presented. The as&#8208;prepared Pp18&#8208;lipos with 2 mol% Pp18&#8208;lipids can perform effective PDT and fluorescence imaging. The Pp18&#8208;lipos with 65 mol% Pp18 can perform potent PTT and photoacoustic imaging. The chelation of Mn2+ endows the Pp18&#8208;lipids&#8208;Mn2+ a high T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance imaging contrast. Notably, pretreatment of low&#8208;dose PDT facilitates the endocytosis and tumor accumulation of Pp18&#8208;lipos, thus achieving synergistic PDT/PTT. Upon exposure to a single 705&#160;nm&#8208;laser, the combination of PDT/PTT achieves a significantly higher tumor growth inhibition rate than PDT or PTT alone. In addition, it is found that the synergistic PDT/PTT triggers more potent anti&#8208;tumor immune response including tumor infiltration of immune cells and release of related cytokines.

         <title>Microfabricated Ion&#8208;Selective Transistors with Fast and Super&#8208;Nernstian Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfabricated ion&#8208;selective transistors with fast response and super&#8208;Nernstian sensitivity are demonstrated. The remarkable performance arises from the use of a thin polyelectrolyte film as an internal ion reservoir between the ion&#8208;selective membrane and the organic electrochemical transistor. The sensor architecture is generic and applicable to sensing of various ions, opening new frontiers for wearable and implantable ion sensors.








Abstract
Transistor&#8208;based ion sensors have evolved significantly, but the best&#8208;performing ones rely on a liquid electrolyte as an internal ion reservoir between the ion&#8208;selective membrane and the channel. This liquid reservoir makes sensor miniaturization difficult and leads to devices that are bulky and have limited mechanical flexibility, which is holding back the development of high&#8208;performance wearable/implantable ion sensors. This work demonstrates microfabricated ion&#8208;selective organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) with a transconductance of 4&#160;mS, in which a thin polyelectrolyte film with mobile sodium ions replaces the liquid reservoir. These devices are capable of selective detection of various ions with a fast response time (&#8776;1&#160;s), a super&#8208;Nernstian sensitivity (85&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1), and a high current sensitivity (224&#160;&#181;A&#160;dec&#8722;1), comparing favorably to other ion sensors based on traditional and emerging materials. Furthermore, the ion&#8208;selective OECTs are stable with highly reproducible sensitivity even after 5 months. These characteristics pave the way for new applications in implantable and wearable electronics.

         <title>A Tuned Alternating D&#8211;A Copolymer Hole&#8208;Transport Layer Enables Colloidal Quantum Dot Solar Cells with Superior Fill Factor and Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new DPP&#8208;based alternating D&#8211;A copolymer (PD2FCT&#8208;29DPP) is developed for use as a hole&#8208;transport layer. PD2FCT&#8208;29DPP addresses the different requirements for an HTL, offering favorable energetics, near&#8208;infrared absorption, and efficient charge transfer. Therefore, a PD2FCT&#8208;29DPP&#8208;based device achieves a remarkable FF of 70% and the highest PCE of 14.0% among PbS CQD&#8208;SCs.








Abstract
The need for optoelectronic and chemical compatibility between the layers in colloidal quantum dot (CQD) photovoltaic devices remains a bottleneck in further increasing performance. Conjugated polymers are promising candidates as new hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL) materials in CQD solar cells (CQD&#8208;SCs) owing to the highly tunable optoelectronic properties and compatible chemistries. A diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymer with benzothiadiazole derivatives (PD2FCT&#8208;29DPP) as an HTL in these devices is reported. The energy level, molecular orientation, and hole mobility of this HTL are manipulated through molecular engineering. By levering the polymer's optical absorption spectrum complementary to that of the CQD active layer, EQE across the visible and near&#8208;infrared regions is maximized. As a result, a PD2FCT&#8208;29DPP&#8208;based device exhibits a fill factor of 70% and approximately 35% efficiency enhancement compared to a PTB7&#8208;based device.

         <title>Numerical Simulations and In Situ Optical Microscopy Connecting Flow Pattern, Crystallization, and Thin&#8208;Film Properties for Organic Transistors with Superior Device&#8208;to&#8208;Device Uniformity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive analytical system that can manipulate and track low patterns along its entire path is utilized, elucidating the correlation between flow pattern, crystallization process, and thin&#8208;film properties. Under the chaotic advection, unprecedented device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformity with the coefficient of variation (CV) in mobility of 7.3% with high average mobility of 2.04 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 in doped TIPS&#8208;pentacene is achieved.








Abstract
Currently, due to the lack of precise control of flow behavior and the understanding of how it influences thin&#8208;film crystallization, strict tuning of thin&#8208;film properties during solution&#8208;based coating is difficult. In this work, a continuous&#8208;flow microfluidic&#8208;channel&#8208;based meniscus&#8208;guided coating (CoMiC) is introduced, which is a system that enables manipulation of flow patterns and analysis connecting flow pattern, crystallization, and thin&#8208;film properties. Continuous supply of a solution of an organic semiconductor with various flow patterns is generated using microfluidic channels. 3D numerical simulations and in situ microscopy allow the tracking of the flow pattern along its entire path (from within the microfluidic channel to near the liquid&#8211;solid boundary), and enable direct observation of thin&#8208;film crystallization process. In particular, the generation of chaotic flow results in unprecedented device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformity, with coefficient of variation (CV) of 7.3% and average mobility of 2.04 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in doped TIPS&#8208;pentacene. Furthermore, CV and average mobility of 9.6% and 11.4 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 are achieved, respectively, in a small molecule:polymer blend system. CoMiC can serve as a guideline for elucidating the relation between flow behavior, liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition, and device performance, which has thus far been unknown.

         <title>Promoted Photocharge Separation in 2D Lateral Epitaxial Heterostructure for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D lateral heterostructure is in situ fabricated. Benefiting from the strong chemical bonding at the heterointerface, a strong internal electric field is generated between two components of the heterostructure, which facilitates photoexcited charge separation and transfer kinetics, and results in improved solar&#8208;energy conversion efficiency.








Abstract
Photocarrier recombination remains a big barrier for the improvement of solar energy conversion efficiency. For 2D materials, construction of heterostructures represents an efficient strategy to promote photoexcited carrier separation via an internal electric field at the heterointerface. However, due to the difficulty in seeking two components with suitable crystal lattice mismatch, most of the current 2D heterostructures are vertical heterostructures and the exploration of 2D lateral heterostructures is scarce and limited. Here, lateral epitaxial heterostructures of BiOCl&#8202;@&#8202;Bi2O3 at the atomic level are fabricated via sonicating&#8208;assisted etching of Cl in BiOCl. This unique lateral heterostructure expedites photoexcited charge separation and transportation through the internal electric field induced by chemical bonding at the lateral interface. As a result, the lateral BiOCl&#8202;@&#8202;Bi2O3 heterostructure demonstrates superior CO2 photoreduction properties with a CO yield rate of about 30&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under visible light illumination. The strategy to fabricate lateral epitaxial heterostructures in this work is expected to provide inspiration for preparing other 2D lateral heterostructures used in optoelectronic devices, energy conversion, and storage fields.

         <title>Precisely Controlling the Position of Bromine on the End Group Enables Well&#8208;Regular Polymer Acceptors for All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Efficiencies over 15%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two well&#8208;regular polymer acceptors (PY&#8208;IT and PY&#8208;OT) with different polymerization sites are developed. For comparison, a random ternary copolymer (PY&#8208;IOT) with the same ratio of the two acceptors is synthesized. All&#8208;polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on PM6:PY&#8208;IT achieve an excellent PCE of 15.05%, which is significantly higher than those based on PY&#8208;OT (10.04%) and PY&#8208;IOT (12.12%).








Abstract
Recent advances in the development of polymerized A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) have promoted the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) over 13%. However, the monomer of an SMA typically consists of a mixture of three isomers due to the regio&#8208;isomeric brominated end groups (IC&#8208;Br(in) and IC&#8208;Br(out)). In this work, the two isomeric end groups are successfully separated, the regioisomeric issue is solved, and three polymer acceptors, named PY&#8208;IT, PY&#8208;OT, and PY&#8208;IOT, are developed, where PY&#8208;IOT is a random terpolymer with the same ratio of the two acceptors. Interestingly, from PY&#8208;OT, PY&#8208;IOT to PY&#8208;IT, the absorption edge gradually redshifts and electron mobility progressively increases. Theory calculation indicates that the LUMOs are distributed on the entire molecular backbone of PY&#8208;IT, contributing to the enhanced electron transport. Consequently, the PM6:PY&#8208;IT system achieves an excellent PCE of 15.05%, significantly higher than those for PY&#8208;OT (10.04%) and PY&#8208;IOT (12.12%). Morphological and device characterization reveals that the highest PCE for the PY&#8208;IT&#8208;based device is the fruit of enhanced absorption, more balanced charge transport, and favorable morphology. This work demonstrates that the site of polymerization on SMAs strongly affects device performance, offering insights into the development of efficient polymer acceptors for all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Driven Gradients of Diamagnetic Objects for Engineering Complex Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and predictable magnetics&#8208;based approach is developed and implemented to pattern a range of diamagnetic objects, including living cells, in 3D crosslinkable solutions without magnetically tagging the objects. This approach is applied to engineer complex tissues that mimic the native depth&#8208;dependent cellularity of articular cartilage. This work provides a foundation for engineers to create opposing gradients in continuous materials.








Abstract
Engineering complex tissues represents an extraordinary challenge and, to date, there have been few strategies developed that can easily recapitulate native&#8208;like cell and biofactor gradients in 3D materials. This is true despite the fact that mimicry of these gradients may be essential for the functionality of engineered graft tissues. Here, a non&#8208;traditional magnetics&#8208;based approach is developed to predictably position naturally diamagnetic objects in 3D hydrogels. Rather than magnetizing the objects within the hydrogel, the magnetic susceptibility of the surrounding hydrogel precursor solution is enhanced. In this way, a range of diamagnetic objects (e.g., polystyrene beads, drug delivery microcapsules, and living cells) are patterned in response to a brief exposure to a magnetic field. Upon photo&#8208;crosslinking the hydrogel precursor, object positioning is maintained, and the magnetic contrast agent diffuses out of the hydrogel, supporting long&#8208;term construct viability. This approach is applied to engineer cartilage constructs with a depth&#8208;dependent cellularity mirroring that of native tissue. These are thought to be the first results showing that magnetically unaltered cells can be magneto&#8208;patterned in hydrogels and cultured to generate heterogeneous tissues. This work provides a foundation for the formation of opposing magnetic&#8208;susceptibility&#8208;based gradients within a single continuous material.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Unidirectional Manipulation of Microdroplets by Horizontal Vibration on Femtosecond Laser&#8208;Induced Slant Microwall Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;performance unidirectional manipulation of microdroplets, such as multimode (rolling, bouncing/reverse bouncing, converging/diffusing, climbing, 90&#176; turning, and sequential transport), large&#8208;volume&#8208;range and high&#8208;speed transport, by horizontal vibration is achieved on a polymeric substrate with slant microgroove arrays fabricated by femtosecond laser oblique ablation technology, demonstrating great potential in the field of liquid microreactions.








Abstract
The high&#8208;performance unidirectional manipulation of microdroplets is crucial for many vital applications including water collection and bioanalysis. Among several actuation methods (e.g., electric, magnetic, light, and thermal actuation), mechanical vibration is pollution&#8208;free and biocompatible. However, it suffers from limited droplet movement mode, small volume range (VMax/VMin&#160;&lt;&#160;3), and low transport velocity (&#8804;11.5&#160;mm s&#8722;1) because the droplet motion is a sliding state caused by the vertical vibration on the asymmetric hydrophobic microstructures. Here, an alternative strategy is proposed&#8212;horizontal vibration for multimode (rolling, bouncing/reverse bouncing, converging/diffusing, climbing, 90o turning, and sequential transport), large&#8208;volume&#8208;range (VMax/VMin&#160;&#8776; 100), and high&#8208;speed (&#8776;22.86&#160;mm s&#8722;1) unidirectional microdroplet manipulation, which is ascribed to the rolling state on superhydrophobic slant microwall arrays (SMWAs) fabricated by the one&#8208;step femtosecond laser oblique ablation. The unidirectional transport mechanism relies on the variance of viscous resistance induced by the difference of contact area between the microdroplet and the slant microwalls. Furthermore, a circular, curved, and &#8220;L&#8221;&#8208;shaped SMWA is designed and fabricated for droplet motion with particular paths. Finally, sequential transport of large&#8208;volume&#8208;range droplets and chemical mixing microreaction of water&#8208;based droplets are demonstrated on the SMWA, which demonstrates the great potential in the field of microdroplet manipulation.

         <title>Spontaneous (Anti)meron Chains in the Domain Walls of van der Waals Ferromagnetic Fe5&#8722;xGeTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of (anti)meron chains from conventional domain walls is directly observed at zero field in 2D ferromagnetic Fe5&#8722;xGeTe2, which closely correlates with the weak van der Waals interaction and temperature&#8208;dependent spin anisotropy transformation. The simultaneous topological Hall effect and the collectively dynamic behavior of the (anti)meron chains under external fields experimentally highlight the theoretical prediction of magnetic&#8208;domain&#8208;wall topology.








Abstract
The promise of topologically vortex&#8208;like magnetic spin textures hinges on the intriguing physical properties and theories in fundamental research and their distinguished roles as high&#8208;efficiency information units in future spintronics. The exploration of such magnetic states with unique spin configurations has never ceased. In this study, the emergence of unconventional (anti)meron chains from a domain wall pair is directly observed at zero field in 2D ferromagnetic Fe5&#8722;xGeTe2, closely correlated with significant enhancement of the in&#8208;plane magnetization and weak van der Waals interactions. The simultaneous appearance of a large topological Hall effect is observed at the same temperature range as that of the abnormal magnetic transition. Moreover, the distinctive features of the (anti)meron chains and their collective dynamic behavior under external fields may provide concrete experimental evidence for the recent theoretical prediction of the magnetic&#8208;domain&#8208;wall topology and endorse a broader range of possibilities for electronics, spintronics, condensed matter physics, etc.

         <title>Ionic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Ion&#8208;Responsive Antimicrobial Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalization of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) can be achieved in a porphyrin&#8208;based anionic HOF structure, endowing the material with synergistic photodynamic and chemical antimicrobial efficacy. By further taking advantage of the unbonded carboxyl groups on the HOF particle surface, a freestanding flexible membrane that shows high permeability, good stability, and excellent antibacterial activity is successfully fabricated.








Abstract
Functionalization of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) for specific applications has been a long&#8208;lasting challenge in HOF materials. Here, an efficient way to integrate functional species in the HOF structure through constructing an anionic framework is presented. The obtained HOFs, taking PFC&#8208;33 (PFC = porous materials from FJIRSM,CAS) as an example, integrate a porphyrin photosensitizer as a porous backbone and a commercial biocide as counterions in the structure. The permanent channels and the electrostatic interaction between the framework and the counterions provide PFC&#8208;33 ion&#8208;responsive biocide&#8208;release behavior in various physiological environments, thus exhibiting synergistic photodynamic and chemical antimicrobial efficiency. The unbonded carboxyl groups residing on the HOF surface further allow for manipulating the interfacial interaction between the PFC&#8208;33 and the polymer matrix for membrane fabrication. Therefore, a polyHOF membrane with high stability, desired flexibility, and good permeability is obtained, which demonstrates noticeable bacterial inhibition toward Escherichia coli. This study may shed light on the functionalization of HOF materials for broad application potentials.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Derivative Valleytronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically thin all&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;free perovskite derivative, Cs3Bi2I9, which exhibits strong light&#8211;matter interaction, is synthesized by the chemical vapor deposition method. Robust optical helicity is observed in all odd&#8208;layer&#8208;number crystals with inversion symmetry breaking, indicating excitonic coherence extending well beyond 11 layers. The excellent optical and valley properties of Cs3Bi2I9 arise from the unique parallel bands, according to first&#8208;principles calculations.








Abstract
Halide perovskites are revolutionizing the renewable energy sector owing to their high photovoltaic efficiency, low manufacturing cost, and flexibility. Their remarkable mobility and long carrier lifetime are also valuable for information technology, but fundamental challenges like poor stability under an electric field prevent realistic applications of halide perovskites in electronics. Here, it is discovered that valleytronics is a promising route to leverage the advantages of halide perovskites and derivatives for information storage and processing. The synthesized all&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;free perovskite derivative, Cs3Bi2I9, exhibits strong light&#8211;matter interaction and parity&#8208;dependent optically addressable valley degree of freedom. Robust optical helicity in all odd&#8208;layer&#8208;number crystals with inversion symmetry breaking is observed, indicating excitonic coherence extending well beyond 11 layers. The excellent optical and valley properties of Cs3Bi2I9 arise from the unique parallel bands, according to first principles calculations. This discovery points to new materials design principles for scalable valleytronic devices and demonstrates the promise of perovskite derivatives beyond energy applications.

         <title>Isotope Effect in the Magneto&#8208;Optoelectronic Response of Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Donor&#8211;Acceptor Exciplexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
In organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence of donor&#8211;acceptor blends, both the magneto&#8208;electroluminescence response and electron magnetic resonance spectrum are found to be independent of the particular hydrogen isotope (protium or deuterium) present. This shows that the reverse intersystem crossing process from the triplet to singlet states occurs in the exciplex manifold rather than that of the polaron pair.








Abstract
The isotope effect is studied in the magneto&#8208;electroluminescence (MEL) and pulsed electrically detected magnetic resonance of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from donor&#8211;acceptor exciplexes that are either protonated (H) or deuterated (D). It is found that at ambient temperature, the exchange of H to D has no effect on the spin&#8208;dependent current and MEL responses in the devices. However, at cryogenic temperatures, where the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) from triplet to singlet exciplex diminishes, a pronounced isotope effect is observed. These results show that the RISC process is not governed by the hyperfine interaction as thought previously, but proceeds through spin&#8208;mixing in the triplet exciplex. The observations are corroborated by electrically detected transient spin nutation experiments that show relatively long dephasing time at ambient temperature, and interpreted in the context of a model that involves exchange and hyperfine interactions in the spin triplet exciplex. These findings deepen the understanding of the RISC process in TADF materials.

     alt="Isotope Effect in the Magneto&#8208;Optoelectronic Response of Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Donor&#8211;Acceptor Exciplexes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence of donor&#8211;acceptor blends, both the magneto&#8208;electroluminescence response and electron magnetic resonance spectrum are found to be independent of the particular hydrogen isotope (protium or deuterium) present. This shows that the reverse intersystem crossing process from the triplet to singlet states occurs in the exciplex manifold rather than that of the polaron pair.


&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An Adaptable Cryptosystem Enabled by Synergies of Luminogens with Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Character</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adaptable optical cryptosystem is established based on the synergies among three interconnected and orthogonal covalent reactions concerning aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogens. The four variants adapted by organizing the reactions and molecules in different ways allow the balance between accessibility and security, variable decryption from individual encryption, and reconstruction of hidden chemical information through given algorithms.








Abstract
The strong emission in the solid state and the feasibility of introducing stimuli responsiveness make aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogens promising for optical information encryption. Yet, the vast majority of previous reports rely on subtle changes in the molecular conformation or intermolecular interactions, limiting the robustness, multiplicity, capacity, and security of the resulting cryptosystems. Herein, a versatile cryptographic system is presented based on three interconnected and orthogonal covalent transformations concerning a tetraphenylethylene&#8211;maleimide conjugate. The cryptosystem is adapted into four configurations with different functionalities by organizing the reactions and molecules in different ways. These variants either balance the accessibility and security of the encrypted information or improve the security and density in data encryption. Significantly, they allow variable decryption from a single encryption and reconstruction of the chemical nature hidden in the fluorescent pattern can only be accessed through given algorithms. These results highlight the importance of multi&#8208;component synergies in advancing information encryption systems, which is enabled by the robustness and diversity stemming from the covalent nature of these transformations.

         <title>Combinatorial Strategy for Studying Biochemical Pathways in Double Emulsion Templated Cell&#8208;Sized Compartments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel combinatorial strategy for studying enzymatic cascade reactions inside synthetic compartments, produced via high&#8208;precision double&#8208;emulsion microfluidics can be applied to any multi&#8208;step cascades, and enables discovering unwanted pathways, detecting undesirable intermediates, and identifying routes for rapid toxins consumption. Such appealing aspects will enhance capabilities of biotechnological applications as enzyme replacement therapy, biological detoxification, chemical synthesis, and biosensors.








Abstract
Cells rely upon producing enzymes at precise rates and stoichiometry for maximizing functionalities. The reasons for this optimal control are unknown, primarily because of the interconnectivity of the enzymatic cascade effects within multi&#8208;step pathways. Here, an elegant strategy for studying such behavior, by controlling segregation/combination of enzymes/metabolites in synthetic cell&#8208;sized compartments, while preserving vital cellular elements is presented. Therefore, compartments shaped into polymer GUVs are developed, producing via high&#8208;precision double&#8208;emulsion microfluidics that enable: i) tight control over the absolute and relative enzymatic contents inside the GUVs, reaching nearly 100% encapsulation and co&#8208;encapsulation efficiencies, and ii) functional reconstitution of biopores and membrane proteins in the GUVs polymeric membrane, thus supporting in situ reactions. GUVs equipped with biopores/membrane proteins and loaded with one or more enzymes are arranged in a variety of combinations that allow the study of a three&#8208;step cascade in multiple topologies. Due to the spatiotemporal control provided, optimum conditions for decreasing the accumulation of inhibitors are unveiled, and benefited from reactive intermediates to maximize the overall cascade efficiency in compartments. The non&#8208;system&#8208;specific feature of the novel strategy makes this system an ideal candidate for the development of new synthetic routes as well as for screening natural and more complex pathways.

         <title>A Freestanding 3D Heterostructure Film Stitched by MOF&#8208;Derived Carbon Nanotube Microsphere Superstructure and Reduced Graphene Oxide Sheets: A Superior Multifunctional Electrode for Overall Water Splitting and Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A freestanding 3D heterostructure film stitched by a metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived carbon nanotube (CNT) microsphere superstructure and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets is synthesized. The high specific surface area, hierarchical pores, controlled dopants, and conductive CNT@rGO heterostructure render the freestanding film as having excellent multifunctional activity and superior stability toward the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Developing a scalable approach to construct efficient and multifunctional electrodes for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an urgent need for overall water splitting and zinc&#8211;air batteries. In this work, a freestanding 3D heterostructure film is synthesized from a Ni&#8208;centered metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF)/graphene oxide. During the pyrolysis process, 1D carbon nanotubes formed from the MOF link with the 2D reduced graphene oxide sheets to stitch the 3D freestanding film. The results of the experiments and theoretical calculations show that the synergistic effect of the N&#8208;doped carbon shell and Ni nanoparticles leads to an optimized film with excellent electrocatalytic activity. Low overpotentials of 95 and 260&#160;mV are merely needed for HER and OER, respectively, to reach a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In addition, a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.875&#160;V is obtained for the ORR, which is comparable to that of Pt/RuO2 and ranks among the top of non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal catalysts. The use of an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; film as the electrode leads to excellent performance of the homemade water electrolyzer and zinc&#8211;air battery, indicating the potential of the film for practical applications.

         <title>Mesenchymal Stem Cells Functionalized Sonodynamic Treatment for Improving Therapeutic Efficacy and Compliance of Orthotopic Oral Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nondestructive sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is developed for the treatment of oral cancer with good compliance. An ultrasound&#8208;responsive mesenchymal stem cells membrane functionalized liposome is designed for co&#8208;delivery of sonosensitizer and oxygen, which not only increases tumor targeting and penetration but also supplies oxygen to enhance SDT effects to eliminate tumors, resulting in prolonged survival and maintenance of oral functions.








Abstract
Despite multiple treatment options being available, many critical challenges are still ongoing in the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Particularly, the major hurdle is to avoid facial disfigurement and oral function disability during treatment. Herein, nanoengineered mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are developed as a supersonosensitizer, named M/LPV/O2, for improving nondestructive sonodynamic therapy (SDT) against OSCC along with good therapeutic compliance. M/LPV/O2 is composed of an MSCs membrane functionalized liposomal formulation of oxygen&#8208;loading perfluorocarbon and sonosensitizer verteporfin (M/LPV/O2), which can not only increase circulation and targeting efficacy but also supply oxygen to overcome tumor&#8208;hypoxia&#8208;associated resistance in SDT, resulting in enhanced therapeutic outcomes in vitro and in vivo. It is identified that M/LPV/O2 effectively stimulates the generation of reactive oxygen species even in hypoxic conditions, and consequently tremendously induces cancer cell death. In addition, M/LPV/O2 displays good tumor accumulation and penetration under ultrasound stimulation, and efficiently induces tumor inhibition and even abrogation, leading to prolonged survival of tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Importantly, M/LPV/O2&#8208;based SDT exhibits minimal systemic adverse effects and successfully maintains oral functions with no facial tissue damage. Therefore, these studies provide a promising therapeutic strategy for OSCC, which has a potential to enhance life quality and compliance after treatment.

         <title>Self&#8208;Winding Gelatin&#8211;Amyloid Wires for Soft Actuators and Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gelatin matrix is loaded with amyloid fibrils, similarly to fiber&#8208;reinforced composites. This material is dry&#8208;spun into wires with asymmetric core&#8211;shell cross&#8208;sections that develop Young's modulus gradients. In water, these wires undergo differential swelling, causing spontaneous self&#8208;winding, corresponding to climbing plants&#8217; tendrils. The functionalization of amyloid fibrils enables the fabrication of functional wires with accurate sensing and actuation properties.








Abstract
The origin of self&#8208;winding mechanisms in plants&#8217; tendrils has fascinated scientists for centuries and continues to inspire developments in material science and nanotechnology. Here, bioinspired water&#8208;responsive wires that replicate these mechanisms, including the formation of coils and chiral perversions, are presented. A right&#8208;handed gelatin matrix is loaded with rigid left&#8208;handed amyloid fibrils and roll&#8211;dry&#8208;spun into wires in which self&#8208;winding activation emerges from simultaneous bending and twisting deformations. Wire bending is a consequence of amyloid fibrils&#8217; concentration and distribution within the wire, whereas twisting is controlled by amyloid fibrils&#8217; orientation. The resultant wires can be functionalized by organic molecules and inorganic nanoparticles, and potential applications in magnetic actuators and sensors are demonstrated. The simple fabrication method and the remarkable spontaneous self&#8208;winding response of these gelatin&#8211;amyloid wires exemplify how biomaterials based on mixed proteins have striking potential to develop advanced and tunable properties that can serve robotics, soft machines, and engineering&#160;systems.

         <title>Topological Interlocking and Geometric Stiffening as Complementary Strategies for Strong Plant Shells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seed encapsulation in hard shells is common for protection and dispersal. This study reveals previously unknown functional interrelations between the structure, geometry, and mechanics on multiple length scales in (nut)shells, suggesting that simple geometric modifications, such as the development of puzzle&#8208;shaped instead of round cells, and small spherical shells instead of large ellipsoidal shells, increase their fracture resistance resource&#8208;efficiently.








Abstract
Many organisms encapsulate their embryos in hard, protective shells. While birds and reptiles largely rely on mineralized shells, plants often develop highly robust lignocellulosic shells. Despite the abundance of hard plant shells, particularly nutshells, it remains unclear which fundamental properties drive their mechanical stability. This multiscale analysis of six prominent (nut)shells (pine, pistachio, walnut, pecan, hazelnut, and macadamia) reveals geometric and structural strengthening mechanisms on the cellular and macroscopic length scales. The strongest tissues, found in walnut and pistachio, exploit the topological interlocking of 3D&#8208;puzzle cells and thereby outperform the fiber&#8208;reinforced structure of macadamia under tensile and compressive loading. On the macroscopic scale, strengthening occurs via an increased shell thickness, spherical shape, small size, and a lack of extended sutures. These functional interrelations suggest that simple geometric modifications are a powerful and resource&#8208;efficient strategy for plants to enhance the fracture resistance of entire shells and their tissues. Understanding the interplay between structure, geometry, and mechanics in hard plant shells provides new perspectives on the evolutionary diversification of hard seed coats, as well as insights for nutshell&#8208;based material applications.

In article number 2004897, Shin&#8208;ichi Ohkoshi and co&#8208;workers propose a new magnetic recording methodology, &#8220;focused&#8208;millimeter&#8208;wave&#8208;assisted magnetic recording (F&#8208;MIMR)&#8221;, to drastically increase the recording density of magnetic tapes. Demonstrations are performed using magnetic films based on a series of epsilon iron oxide, &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3. Irradiation of the focused millimeter wave generated from terahertz (THz) light flips the magnetic pole direction, leading to a breakthrough technology for high&#8208;density magnetic recordings.

In article number 2003313, Liting Yan, Jianxing Shen, Xuebo Zhao, Lianzhou Wang, and co&#8208;workers report a facile and versatile MOF&#8208;assisted strategy to construct a freestanding 3D CNT/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) heterostructure film (CGHF). The film shows remarkable multifunctional electrocatalytic performance in an alkaline electrolyte and can be used in highly efficient electrodes for overall water splitting and Zn&#8211;air batteries. The strategy is controllable and versatile, and it can be easily extended to prepare binary and even ternary hybrids films for advanced electrochemical energy storage and conversion.

         <title>In a Nutshell: Topological Interlocking and Geometric Stiffening as Complementary Strategies for Strong Plant Shells (Adv. Mater. 48/2020)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2004519, Jessica C. Huss, Notburga Gierlinger, and co&#8208;workers reveal previously unknown functional interrelations between the structure, geometry, and mechanics in (nut)shells. Their multi&#8208;scale analysis suggests that simple geometric modifications, such as the development of puzzle&#8208;shaped instead of round cells, and small spherical shells instead of large ellipsoidal shells, increase the fracture resistance of hard plant shells resource&#8208;efficiently.

         <title>Magnetic Patterning: Magneto&#8208;Driven Gradients of Diamagnetic Objects for Engineering Complex Tissues (Adv. Mater. 48/2020)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2005030, Robert L. Mauck and co&#8208;workers magnetically pattern diamagnetic objects in 3D hydrogels to engineer complex tissues. Because the diamagnetic objects are suspended in a transiently paramagnetic solution, the objects are repelled from a permanent magnet. Most notably, unlabeled living cells are magneto&#8208;patterned to generate cartilaginous tissues with a native&#8208;like cell gradient.

         <dc:description>
A comprehensive analytical system that connects flow pattern, crystallization, and thin&#8208;film properties is introduced by Steve Park, Jaewook Nam, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2004864. Using 3D&#8208;patterned microfluidic channels, flow pattern is precisely manipulated. 3D numerical simulation and in situ microscopy enable tracking of the flow pattern along its entire path, elucidating its relation to the crystallization process. The resulting organic thin&#8208;film transistors have superior device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformity.

         <title>Dendrites in Zn&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc&#8208;based batteries demonstrate both intrinsic safety and high energy density compared with other metal batteries. Nevertheless, zinc&#8208;dendrite issues such as special morphology and nucleation require unique protections, which develop rapidly and need further improvement. The remaining challenges are discussed and the future directions, i.e., dynamic contact, atomic&#8208;level ionic flow mediation, dendrite protection under high depth of discharge, etc., are proposed.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn batteries that provide a synergistic integration of absolute safety and high energy density have been considered&#160;as highly promising energy&#8208;storage systems for powering&#160;electronics. Despite the rapid progress made in developing high&#8208;performance cathodes and electrolytes, the underestimated but non&#8208;negligible dendrites of&#160;Zn anode have been observed to&#160;shorten battery lifespan. Herein, this dendrite issue in Zn anodes, with regard to fundamentals, protection strategies, characterization techniques, and theoretical simulations, is systematically discussed. An overall comparison between the Zn dendrite and its Li and Al counterparts, to highlight their differences in both origin and topology, is given. Subsequently, in&#8208;depth clarifications of the specific influence factors of Zn dendrites, including the accumulation effect and the cathode loading mass (a distinct factor for laboratory studies and practical applications) are presented. Recent advances in Zn dendrite protection are then comprehensively summarized and categorized to generate an overview of respective superiorities and limitations of various strategies. Accordingly, theoretical computations and advanced characterization approaches are introduced as mechanism guidelines and measurement criteria for dendrite suppression, respectively. The concluding section emphasizes future challenges in addressing the Zn dendrite issue and potential approaches to further promoting the lifespan of Zn batteries.

         <title>Size&#8208;Transformable Nanostructures: From Design to Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 32, Issue 48, December 3, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Size&#8208;transformable nanostructures that can inherit the merits of both small and large ones are powerful platforms for enhanced disease theranostics with long&#8208;term retention, deep penetration, and rapid clearance. Various strategies to realize the transformation between large and small nanostructures are introduced. The biomedical application potential of this kind of nanostructures is also discussed.








Abstract
The size of nanostructures (NSs) strongly affects their chemical and physical properties and further impacts their actions in biological systems. Both small and large NSs possess respective advantages for disease theranostics, and this therefore presents a paradox when choosing NSs with suitable sizes. To overcome this challenge, size&#8208;transformable NSs have emerged as a powerful tool, as they can be manipulated to possess the merits of both types of NSs. Herein, various strategies to construct size&#8208;transformable NSs are summarized, and the recent research progress regarding their biomedical applications, particularly within the fields of cancer and bacterial theranostics, is highlighted. This review will inspire researchers to further develop various methods that can be used to construct size&#8208;transformable NSs for use in novel applications within different fields.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Swelling Polymeric Mixed Conductor Operating in Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although beneficial to ion transport, swelling can affect the performance and durability of organic mixed conductor devices. This communication presents a hydrophilic conjugated polymer, poly[3&#8208;(6&#8208;hydroxy)hexylthiophene], comparing its swelling properties to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art glycolated organic semiconductors for bioelectronics. Hydroxyl functionalization of poly(thiophene) backbone minimizes swelling while still allowing good ion uptake, resulting in robust organic electrochemical transistor operation in aqueous electrolytes.








Abstract
Organic mixed conductors find use in batteries, bioelectronics technologies, neuromorphic computing, and sensing. While great progress has been achieved, polymer&#8208;based mixed conductors frequently experience significant volumetric changes during ion uptake/rejection, i.e., during doping/de&#8208;doping and charging/discharging. Although ion dynamics may be enhanced in expanded networks, these volumetric changes can have undesirable consequences, e.g., negatively affecting hole/electron conduction and severely shortening device lifetime. Here, the authors present a new material poly[3&#8208;(6&#8208;hydroxy)hexylthiophene] (P3HHT) that is able to transport ions and electrons/holes, as tested in electrochemical absorption spectroscopy and organic electrochemical transistors, and that exhibits low swelling, attributed to the hydroxylated alkyl side&#8208;chain functionalization. P3HHT displays a thickness change upon passive swelling of only +2.5%, compared to +90% observed for the ubiquitous poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate, and +10 to +15% for polymers such as poly(2&#8208;(3,3&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;(2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)&#8208;[2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophen]&#8208;5&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) (p[g2T&#8208;TT]). Applying a bias pulse during swelling, this discrepancy becomes even more pronounced, with the thickness of P3HHT films changing by &lt;10%&#160;while that of p(g2T&#8208;TT) structures increases by +75 to +80%. Importantly, the initial P3HHT film thickness is essentially restored after de&#8208;doping while p(g2T&#8208;TT) remains substantially swollen. The authors, thus, expand the materials&#8208;design toolbox for the creation of low&#8208;swelling soft mixed conductors with tailored properties and applications in bioelectronics and beyond.

         <title>Transparent Hybrid Opals with Unexpected Strong Resonance&#8208;Enhanced Photothermal Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optical absorption, being absent in the pure polymer matrix and that with ordered particles, is remarkably amplified in a self&#8208;assembled polymer&#8208;tethered (brush) particles comprised of low contrast constituents. The amplification is shown to be caused by &#8220;photon slowdown&#8221; and to induce rapid &#8220;melting&#8221; of materials even in the absence of &#8220;visible&#8221; absorption.








Abstract
Photothermal energy conversion is of fundamental importance to applications ranging from drug delivery to microfluidics and from ablation to fabrication. It typically originates from absorptive processes in materials that&#8212;when coupled with non&#8208;radiative dissipative processes&#8212;allow the conversion of radiative energy into heat. Microstructure design provides versatile strategies for controlling light&#8211;matter interactions. In particular, the deliberate engineering of the band structure in photonic materials is known to be an effective approach to amplify absorption in materials. However, photonic amplification is generally tied to high optical contrast materials which limit the applicability of the concept to metamaterials such as microfabricated metal&#8211;air hybrids. This contribution describes the first observation of pronounced amplification of absorption in low contrast opals formed by the self&#8208;assembly of polymer&#8208;tethered particles. The dependence of the amplification factor on the length scale and degree of order of materials as well as the angle of incidence reveal that it is related to the slow photon effect. A remarkable amplification factor of 16 is shown to facilitate the rapid &#8220;melting&#8221; of opal films even in the absence of &#8220;visible&#8221; absorption. The results point to novel opportunities for tailoring light&#8211;matter interactions in hybrid materials that can benefit the manipulation and fabrication of functional materials.

         <title>Ternary Ta2PdS6 Atomic Layers for an Ultrahigh Broadband Photoresponsive Phototransistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 2D material, atomic layer Ta2PdS6, is introduced to the 2D family, and exhibits excellent optoelectronic and electronic performances including an ultrahigh photoresponsivity of 1.42&#160;&#215; 106 A W&#8722;1, photoconductive gain of 2.7&#160;&#215; 106, electron mobility of 25 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1, Ion/Ioff ratio of 106 and one&#8208;year air stability, making it a promising 2D material for nano&#8208;electronic and nano&#8208;optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
2D noble&#8208;transition&#8208;metal chalcogenides (NTMCs) are emerging as a promising class of optoelectronic materials due to ultrahigh air stability, large bandgap tunability, and high photoresponse. Here, a new set of 2D NTMC: Ta2PdS6 atomic layers is developed, displaying the excellent comprehensive optoelectronic performance with an ultrahigh photoresponsivity of 1.42&#160;&#215; 106 A W&#8722;1, detectivity of 7.1&#160;&#215; 1010 Jones and a high photoconductive gain of 2.7&#160;&#215; 106 under laser illumination at a wavelength of 633&#160;nm with a power of 0.025 W m&#8722;2, which is ascribed to a photogating effect via study of the device band profiles. Especially, few&#8208;layer Ta2PdS6 exhibits a good broadband photoresponse, ranging from 450&#160;nm in the ultraviolet region to 1450&#160;nm in the shortwave infrared (SIR) region. Moreover, this material also delivers an impressive electronic performance with electron mobility of &#8776;25 cm2V&#8211;1s&#8211;1, Ion/Ioff ratio of 106, and a one&#8208;year air stability, which is better than those of most reported 2D materials. Our&#160;studies underscore Ta2PdS6 as a promising 2D material for nano&#8208;electronic and nano&#8208;optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Persistent Conjugated Backbone and Disordered Lamellar Packing Impart Polymers with Efficient n&#8208;Doping and High Conductivities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two conjugated polymers with rigid planar backbones, but with disordered crystalline structures, exhibit surprising structural tolerance to commonly used n&#8208;dopants. These properties allow both high concentrations and high mobility of the charge carriers to be realized simultaneously in n&#8208;doped polymers, resulting in excellent electrical conductivity of over 90 S cm&#8722;1 and thermoelectric performance up to 106 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable highly conductive polymers are of great interest in emerging electronic applications. For p&#8208;doped polymers, conductivities as high a nearly 105 S cm&#8722;1 have been reported.

&lt;p&gt;Two conjugated polymers with rigid planar backbones, but with disordered crystalline structures, exhibit surprising structural tolerance to commonly used n&#8208;dopants. These properties allow both high concentrations and high mobility of the charge carriers to be realized simultaneously in n&#8208;doped polymers, resulting in excellent electrical conductivity of over 90 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and thermoelectric performance up to 106 &#181;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution&#8208;processable highly conductive polymers are of great interest in emerging electronic applications. For p&#8208;doped polymers, conductivities as high a nearly 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; have been reported.

         <title>Elucidation of the Synergistic Effect of Dopants and Vacancies on Promoted Selectivity for CO2 Electroreduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel SnO2 nanosheet catalyst presents a possible synergistic effect of N dopants and oxygen vacancies on the activity and selectivity for CO2 electroreduction to formate. Low coordination Sn&#8211;N moieties with optimal N dopants and O vacancies are identified as active sites with intrinsically enhanced activity.








Abstract
Sn&#8208;based materials are identified as promising catalysts for the CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) to formate (HCOO&#8722;). However, their insufficient selectivity and activity remain grand challenges. A new type of SnO2 nanosheet with simultaneous N dopants and oxygen vacancies (VO&#8208;rich N&#8208;SnO2 NS) for promoting CO2 conversion to HCOO&#8722; is reported. Due to the likely synergistic effect of N dopant and VO, the VO&#8208;rich N&#8208;SnO2 NS exhibits high catalytic selectivity featured by an HCOO&#8722; Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 83% at &#8722;0.9 V and an FE of &gt; 90% for all C1 products (HCOO&#8722; and CO) at a wide potential range from &#8722;0.9 to &#8722;1.2 V. Low coordination Sn&#8211;N moieties are the active sites with optimal electronic and geometric structures regulated by VO and N dopants. Theoretical calculations elucidate that the reaction free energy of HCOO* protonation is decreased on the VO&#8208;rich N&#8208;SnO2 NS, thus enhancing HCOO&#8722; selectivity. The weakened H* adsorption energy also inhibits the hydrogen evolution reaction, a dominant side reaction during the CO2RR. Furthermore, using the catalyst as the cathode, a spontaneous Galvanic Zn&#8208;CO2 cell and a solar&#8208;powered electrolysis process successfully demonstrated the efficient HCOO&#8722; generation through CO2 conversion and storage.

         <title>The Art of Constructing Black Phosphorus Nanosheet Based Heterostructures: From 2D to 3D</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Black phosphorus nanosheet (BPNS)&#8208;based heterostructures are an emerging material with numerous potential applications in many appealing fields. In this article, recent advancements in the construction of BPNS&#8208;based heterostructures ranging from 2D hybrid structures to 3D networks, including preparation and characterization methods, optical and electronic properties, applications, challenges, and future directions, are discussed.








Abstract
Assembling different kinds of 2D nanosheets into heterostructures presents a promising way of designing novel artificial materials with new and improved functionalities by combining the unique properties of each component. In the past few years, black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs) have been recognized as a highly feasible 2D material with outstanding electronic properties, a tunable bandgap, and strong in&#8208;plane anisotropy, highlighting their suitability as a material for constructing heterostructures. In this study, recent progress in the construction of BPNS&#8208;based heterostructures ranging from 2D hybrid structures to 3D networks is discussed, emphasizing the different types of interactions (covalent or noncovalent) between individual layers. The preparation methods, optical and electronic properties, and various applications of these heterostructures&#8212;including electronic and optoelectronic devices, energy storage devices, photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, and biological applications&#8212;are discussed. Finally, critical challenges and prospective research aspects in BPNS&#8208;based heterostructures are also highlighted.

         <title>Full Concentration Gradient&#8208;Tailored Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxides for High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precise elemental gradient design for practical lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) agglomerated spheres is developed, providing a unique tool for the optimization of voltage retention and electrochemical/thermal stability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The effects of elemental gradient on the LLOs, especially from a mechanical/electrochemical stress point of view, have been quantitively elucidated for stability evaluation.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs) are prospective cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but severe voltage decay and energy attenuation with cycling still hinder their practical applications. Herein, a series of full concentration gradient&#8208;tailored agglomerated&#8208;sphere LLOs are designed with linearly decreasing Mn and linearly increasing Ni and Co from the particle center to the surface. The gradient&#8208;tailored LLOs exhibit noticeably reduced voltage decay, enhanced rate performance, improved cycle stability, and thermal stability. Without any material modifications or electrolyte optimizations, the gradient&#8208;tailored LLO with medium&#8208;slope shows the best electrochemical performance, with a very low average voltage decay of 0.8&#160;mV per cycle as well as a capacity retention of 88.4% within 200 cycles at 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1. These excellent findings are due to spinel structure suppression, electrochemical stress optimization, and Jahn&#8208;Teller effect inhibition. Further investigation shows that the gradient&#8208;tailored LLO reduces the thermal release percentage by as much as about 41% when the battery is charged to 4.4&#160;V. This study provides an effective method to suppress the voltage decay of LLOs for further practical utilization in LIBs and also puts forward a bulk&#8208;structure design strategy to prepare better electrode materials for different rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Tailored Mesoporous Inorganic Biomaterials: Assembly, Functionalization, and Drug Delivery Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored mesoporous inorganic nanocarriers with abundant compositions and structures exhibit unprecedented drug&#8208;loading capacity and sustained responsive release behavior under various stimuli (e.g., pH, redox, temperature, magnetic field, and light), and exceptionally mesoporous structure plays an important role in the diffusion and transport of drug molecules, which will open a new door for drug therapy and new biological nanocarriers.








Abstract
Infectious or immune diseases have caused serious threat to human health due to their complexity and specificity, and emerging drug delivery systems (DDSs) have evolved into the most promising therapeutic strategy for drug&#8208;targeted therapy. Various mesoporous biomaterials are exploited and applied as efficient nanocarriers to loading drugs by virtue of their large surface area, high porosity, and prominent biocompatibility. Nanosized mesoporous nanocarriers show great potential in biomedical research, and it has become the research hotspot in the interdisciplinary field. Herein, recent progress and assembly mechanisms on mesoporous inorganic biomaterials (e.g., silica, carbon, metal oxide) are summarized systematically, and typical functionalization methods (i.e., hybridization, polymerization, and doping) for nanocarriers are also discussed in depth. Particularly, structure&#8211;activity relationship and the effect of physicochemical parameters of mesoporous biomaterials, including morphologies (e.g., hollow, core&#8211;shell), pore textures (e.g., pore size, pore volume), and surface features (e.g., roughness and hydrophilic/hydrophobic) in DDS application are overviewed and elucidated in detail. As one of the important development directions, advanced stimuli&#8208;responsive DDSs (e.g., pH, temperature, redox, ultrasound, light, magnetic field) are highlighted. Finally, the prospect of mesoporous biomaterials in disease therapeutics is stated, and it will open a new spring for the development of mesoporous nanocarriers.

         <title>Recent Advances and Perspectives on Calcium&#8208;Ion Storage: Key Materials and Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ca&#8208;ion based technologies are attractive for low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance energy storage, while their development is currently far from practical applications. An overview of the key electrode materials for Ca2+ storage and a comprehensive insight of promising optimization strategies such as multi&#8208;ion strategy are critical to promote further development of Ca2+ technologies.








Abstract
The urgent demand for cost&#8208;effective energy storage devices for large&#8208;scale applications has led to the development of several beyond&#8208;lithium energy storage systems (EESs). Among them, calcium&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) are attractive due to abundant calcium resources, excellent volumetric and gravimetric capacities of Ca metal anode, and potential high energy density coming from the multivalent feature of Ca&#8208;ion. Therefore, the exploration of CIBs electrode materials and the construction of CIBs devices are gaining increasing research interest. Relevant publications cover a wide range of materials by both theoretical and experimental investigations, whereas the performances of rocking&#8208;chair CIBs have been unsatisfactory. Meanwhile, multi&#8208;ion strategies using more than one ion as the charge carrier have been demonstrated to be feasible and promising options in realizing room temperature CIBs. The summary and reflection of previous studies would provide useful information for future exploration and optimization. In this circumstance, this paper overviews the reported CIBs electrode materials, including both anode and cathode, and presents the latest progress of multi&#8208;ion strategies in CIBs. Fundamental challenges, potential solutions, and opportunities are accordingly proposed, mimicking other more mature EESs. This review may promote the development of electrode materials and accelerate the construction of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance CIBs.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Ti3C2Tx MXene Antennas for Radio&#8208;Frequency Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene microstrip patch antennas with ultrahigh&#8208;power radiation in a wide frequency range are fabricated by spray&#8208;coating. The radiation efficiency of a 5.5&#160;&#181;m thick MXene patch antenna reaches 99% at 16.4&#160;GHz, which is about the same as that of a 35&#160;&#181;m thick copper patch antenna. MXene outperforms all other materials evaluated for patch antennas to date.








Abstract
Highly integrated, flexible, and ultrathin wireless communication components are in significant demand due to the explosive growth of portable and wearable electronic devices in the fifth&#8208;generation (5G) network era, but only conventional metals meet the requirements for emerging radio&#8208;frequency (RF) devices so far. Here, it is reported on Ti3C2Tx MXene microstrip transmission lines with low&#8208;energy attenuation and patch antennas with high&#8208;power radiation at frequencies from 5.6 to 16.4&#160;GHz. The radiation efficiency of a 5.5&#160;&#181;m thick MXene patch antenna manufactured by spray&#8208;coating from aqueous solution reaches 99% at 16.4&#160;GHz, which is about the same as that of a standard 35&#160;&#181;m thick copper patch antenna at about 15% of its thickness and 7% of the copper weight. MXene outperforms all other materials evaluated for patch antennas to date. Moreover, it is demonstrated that an MXene patch antenna array with integrated feeding circuits on a conformal surface has comparable performance with that of a copper antenna array at 28&#160;GHz, which is a target frequency in practical 5G applications. The versatility of MXene antennas in wide frequency ranges coupled with the flexibility, scalability, and ease of solution processing makes MXene promising for integrated RF components in various flexible electronic devices.

         <title>Imaging Cellular Aerobic Glycolysis using Carbon Dots for Early Warning of Tumorigenesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The occurrence of aerobic glycolysis based on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)&#8208;induced enhancement of fluorescence emitted by nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon dots is revealed by a new strategy. This can be used to monitor the occurrence of tumorigenesis and provide an early warning of tumor formation with high accuracy and specificity.








Abstract
Early warning of tumor formation is crucial for the classification, treatment, and prognosis of tumor patients. Here, a new strategy is reported, aimed at realizing this goal based on imaging aerobic glycolysis processes using nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon dots (N&#8208;CDs) as fluorescent probes. The intensity of the photoluminescence emitted by the N&#8208;CDs is specifically enhanced by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+, oxidized) in the physiological environment. The N&#8208;CDs allow a few (five to ten) abnormal cells in spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma models to be identified before the in situ development of tumor tissue. The N&#8208;CD probes can also distinguish tumor cells from normal cells and be used to evaluate their proliferation activity (with a specificity of up to 96.15% in 13 types of tumor cells and 90.90% in orthotopic xenograft models). The N&#8208;CDs are successfully used to monitor the invasion of tumor cells into neighboring tissues and body fluids in 49 clinical samples (with a sensitivity up to 79.31%). These included three vitreous body samples (from patients with retinoblastoma), 42 urine samples (22 patients clinically diagnosed with urothelium carcinoma and 20 healthy persons), and four hydrothorax samples (from patients with metastatic lesions).

         <title>Observation of Standing Spin Waves in a van der Waals Magnetic Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Standing spin&#8208;wave modes are reported in a van der Waals magnetic material. These modes travel along the CrCl3 sample thickness of 20 mm and are reflected at the boundaries. These spin waves can be useful for creating tunable van der Waals magnonic devices operating at GHz frequencies.








Abstract
Spin waves are studied for data storage, communication, and logic circuits in the field of spintronics based on their potential to substitute electrons. The recent discovery of magnetism in 2D systems such as monolayer CrI3 and Cr2Ge2Te6 has led to a renewed interest in such applications of magnetism in the 2D limit. Here, direct evidence of standing spin waves is presented along with the uniform precessional resonance modes in the van der Waals magnetic material, CrCl3. This is the first direct observation of standing spin&#8208;wave modes, set up along a thickness of 20&#160;mm, in a van der Waals material. Standing spin waves are detected in the vicinity of both branches, optical and acoustic, of the antiferromagnetic resonance. Magnon&#8211;magnon coupling and softening of resonance modes with temperature enable extraction of interlayer exchange field as a function of temperature.

         <title>Electrochemical Delamination of Ultralarge Few&#8208;Layer Black Phosphorus with a Hydrogen&#8208;Free Intercalation Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultralarge few&#8208;layer black&#8208;phosphorus single crystals are obtained with a hydrogen&#8208;free electrochemical exfoliation mechanism using CH3COOTBA intercalation. The largest size is up to 119 &#181;m with an average around at 77.6 &#177; 15.0 &#181;m. A high hole mobility of 76 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1, and a broadband photoresponse from 532 to 1850 nm with ultrahigh responsivity are achieved at 298 K.








Abstract
Due to strong interlayer interaction and ease of oxidation issues of black phosphorus (BP), the domain size of artificial synthesized few&#8208;layer black phosphorus (FL&#8208;BP) crystals is often below 10&#160;&#181;m, which extremely limits its further applications in large&#8208;area thin&#8208;film devices and integrated circuits. Herein, a hydrogen&#8208;free electrochemical delamination strategy through weak Lewis acid intercalation enabled exfoliation is developed to produce ultralarge FL&#8208;BP single&#8208;crystalline domains with high quality. The interaction between the weak Lewis acid tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium acetate (CH3COOTBA) and P atoms promotes the average domain size of FL&#8208;BP crystal up to 77.6&#160;&#177; 15.0&#160;&#181;m and the largest domain size is found to be as large as 119&#160;&#181;m. The presence of H+ and H2O is found to sharply decrease the size of as&#8208;exfoliated FL&#8208;BP flakes. The electronic transport measurements show that the delaminated FL&#8208;BP crystals exhibit a high hole mobility of 76 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 and an on/off ratio of 103 at 298 K. A broadband photoresponse from 532 to 1850&#160;nm with ultrahigh responsivity is achieved. This work provides a scalable, simple, and low&#8208;cost approach for large&#8208;area BP films that meet industrial requirements for nanodevices applications.

A high hole mobility of 76 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and a broadband photoresponse from 532 to 1850 nm with ultrahigh responsivity are achieved at 298 K.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to strong interlayer interaction and ease of oxidation issues of black phosphorus (BP), the domain size of artificial synthesized few&#8208;layer black phosphorus (FL&#8208;BP) crystals is often below 10&#160;&#181;m, which extremely limits its further applications in large&#8208;area thin&#8208;film devices and integrated circuits. Herein, a hydrogen&#8208;free electrochemical delamination strategy through weak Lewis acid intercalation enabled exfoliation is developed to produce ultralarge FL&#8208;BP single&#8208;crystalline domains with high quality. The interaction between the weak Lewis acid tetra&#8208;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;butylammonium acetate (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOTBA) and P atoms promotes the average domain size of FL&#8208;BP crystal up to 77.6&#160;&#177; 15.0&#160;&#181;m and the largest domain size is found to be as large as 119&#160;&#181;m. The presence of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is found to sharply decrease the size of as&#8208;exfoliated FL&#8208;BP flakes. The electronic transport measurements show that the delaminated FL&#8208;BP crystals exhibit a high hole mobility of 76 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an on/off ratio of 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 298 K. A broadband photoresponse from 532 to 1850&#160;nm with ultrahigh responsivity is achieved. This work provides a scalable, simple, and low&#8208;cost approach for large&#8208;area BP films that meet industrial requirements for nanodevices applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide Driven by the Intrinsic Defects in the Carbon Plane of a Single Fe&#8211;N4 Site</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The outstanding electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction activity of the intrinsic defect in a carbon&#8208;based catalyst containing a single Fe&#8211;N4 site is highlighted. Benefiting from its immunity for the adsorbed intermediates, such as *CO, as well as the enhanced intrinsic activity after incorporating with the Fe&#8211;N4 site, the intrinsic defect acts as the real active center for carbon dioxide reduction and outperforms single Fe&#8211;N4 centers.








Abstract
Manipulating the in&#8208;plane defects of metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon catalysts to regulate the electroreduction reaction of CO2 (CO2RR) remains a challenging task. Here, it is demonstrated that the activity of the intrinsic carbon defects can be dramatically improved through coupling with single&#8208;atom Fe&#8211;N4 sites. The resulting catalyst delivers a maximum CO Faradaic efficiency of 90% and a CO partial current density of 33&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in 0.1 m KHCO3. The remarkable enhancements are maintained in concentrated electrolyte, endowing a rechargeable Zn&#8211;CO2 battery with a high CO selectivity of 86.5% at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Further analysis suggests that the intrinsic defect is the active sites for CO2RR, instead of the Fe&#8211;N4 center. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Fe&#8211;N4 coupled intrinsic defect exhibits a reduced energy barrier for CO2RR and suppresses the hydrogen evolution activity. The high intrinsic activity, coupled with fast electron&#8208;transfer capability and abundant exposed active sites, induces excellent electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Plant Nanobionic Sensors for Arsenic Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploiting the natural ability of plants to pre&#8208;concentrate and extract arsenite from the belowground environment, a living plant nanobionic sensor is engineered for non&#8208;destructive arsenite monitoring. By embedding near&#8208;infrared fluorescent nanosensors within the mesophyll, living plants are converted into environmental sensors for real&#8208;time arsenite detection. This demonstration opens new frontiers for plant&#8208;based sensors in environmental monitoring and food safety research.








Abstract
Arsenic is a highly toxic heavy&#8208;metal pollutant which poses a significant health risk to humans and other ecosystems. In this work, the natural ability of wild&#8208;type plants to pre&#8208;concentrate and extract arsenic from the belowground environment is exploited to engineer plant nanobionic sensors for real&#8208;time arsenic detection. Near&#8208;infrared fluorescent nanosensors are specifically designed for sensitive and selective detection of arsenite. These optical nanosensors are embedded in plant tissues to non&#8208;destructively access and monitor the internal dynamics of arsenic taken up by the plants via the roots. The integration of optical nanosensors with living plants enables the conversion of plants into self&#8208;powered autosamplers of arsenic from their environment. Arsenite detection is demonstrated with three different plant species as nanobionic sensors. Based on an experimentally validated kinetic model, the nanobionic sensor could detect 0.6 and 0.2 ppb levels of arsenic after 7 and 14 days respectively by exploiting the natural ability of Pteris cretica ferns to hyperaccumulate and tolerate exceptionally high level of arsenic. The sensor readout could also be interfaced with portable electronics at a standoff distance, potentially enabling applications in environmental monitoring and agronomic research.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Packaged 3D Lithium&#8208;Ion Microbatteries Fabricated Using Imprint Lithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance microbatteries with high active volume fraction, thick, 3D&#8208;structured electrodes (V2O5 cathode and Li metal anode) are realized through a combination of imprint lithography, self&#8208;assembly, and electrodeposition. The microbattery is infilled with a gel electrolyte to facilitate hermetic packaging. The packaged cell exhibits high areal energy and power densities of 1.24 J cm&#8722;2 and 75.5 mW cm&#8722;2, respectively.








Abstract
Fabrication of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and high&#8208;power&#8208;density packaged long&#8208;cycle&#8208;life rechargeable microbatteries remains a considerable challenge. Here, high&#8208;performance microbatteries with high active volume fraction, thick, 3D&#8208;structured electrodes (V2O5 cathode and Li metal anode) are realized through a combination of imprint lithography, self&#8208;assembly, and electrodeposition. To assist the critical challenge of hermetic packaging, the microbattery is infilled with a gel electrolyte. The packaged cell exhibits high areal energy and power densities of 1.24 J cm&#8722;2 and 75.5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, respectively, and can be cycled 550 times in argon or 200 times in air with 75% capacity retention of the initial discharge capacity. An unpackaged cell, using a liquid electrolyte, provides a power density of 218&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. As far as it is known, the microbatteries have the highest peak power density among all reported microbatteries.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Epitaxial Growth of Magnetic Nanostructures on 4H&#8208;Au Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal&#8208;phase engineering of Co and Ni nanostructures is reported, which is realized by quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth on 4H&#8208;Au nanoribbons. Notably, a new phase of Co, namely 14H, is formed due to the generation of ordered misfit dislocations in the grown Co nanostructures. The as&#8208;prepared 14H&#8208;Co nanostructures are ferromagnetic at room temperature.








Abstract
Phase engineering of nanomaterials is an effective strategy to tune the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials for various promising applications. Herein, by using the 4H&#8208;Au nanoribbons as templates, four novel magnetic nanostructures, namely 4H&#8208;Au&#8202;@&#8202;14H&#8208;Co nanobranches, 4H&#8208;Au&#8202;@&#8202;14H&#8208;Co nanoribbons, 4H&#8208;Au&#8202;@&#8202;2H&#8208;Co nanoribbons, and 4H&#8208;Au&#8202;@&#8202;2H&#8208;Ni nanoribbons, are synthesized based on the quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth. Different from the conventional epitaxial growth of metal nanomaterials, the obtained Co and Ni nanostructures possess different crystal phases from the Au template. Due to the large lattice mismatch between Au and the grown metals (i.e., Co and Ni), ordered misfit dislocations are generated at the Co/Au and Ni/Au interfaces. Notably, a new super&#8208;structure of Co is formed, denoted as 14H. Both 4H&#8208;Au&#8202;@&#8202;14H&#8208;Co nanobranches and nanoribbons are ferromagnetic at room temperature, showing similar Curie temperature. However, their magnetic behaviors exhibit distinct temperature dependence, resulting from the competition between spin and volume fluctuations as well as the unique geometry. This work paves the way to the templated synthesis of nanomaterials with unconventional crystal phases for the exploration of phase&#8208;dependent properties.

         <title>All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries with a Limited Lithium Metal Anode at Room Temperature using a Garnet&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to the stability between lithium metal and a garnet&#8208;type solid electrolyte, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are proved to possess longer cycling life than that of liquid&#8208;state LMBs under limited lithium anode condition. Moreover, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LMBs with long cycling life using a limited lithium metal anode are achieved at room temperature through a hybrid solid&#8208;state electrolyte design.








Abstract
Metallic lithium (Li), considered as the ultimate anode, is expected to promise high&#8208;energy rechargeable batteries. However, owing to the continuous Li consumption during the repeated Li plating/stripping cycling, excess amount of the Li metal anode is commonly utilized in lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs), leading to reduced energy density and increased cost. Here, an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal battery (ASSLMB) based on a garnet&#8208;oxide solid electrolyte with an ultralow negative/positive electrode capacity ratio (N/P ratio) is reported. Compared with the counterpart using a liquid electrolyte at the same low N/P ratios, ASSLMBs show longer cycling life, which is attributed to the higher Coulombic efficiency maintained during cycling. The effect of the species of the interface layer on the cycling performance of ASSLMBs with low N/P ratio is also studied. Importantly, it is demonstrated that the ASSLMB using a limited Li metal anode paired with a LiFePO4 cathode (5.9 N/P ratio) delivers a stable long&#8208;term cycling performance at room temperature. Furthermore, it is revealed that enhanced specific energies for ASSLMBs with low N/P ratios can be further achieved by the use of a high&#8208;voltage or high mass&#8208;loading cathode. This study sheds light on the practical high&#8208;energy all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries under the constrained condition of a limited Li metal anode.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed All&#8208;Ceramic Plasmonic Metamaterials for Efficient Solar&#8211;Thermal Conversion over 100&#8211;727&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed large&#8208;area plasmonic metamaterial with all&#8208;ceramic components is demonstrated to achieve high solar absorption but low IR emission over 100&#8211;727&#160;&#176;C, leading to higher solar&#8211;thermal conversion efficiency than vacuum&#8208;deposited absorbers. Accompanied by its great thermal stability (727&#160;&#176;C) and low cost (&lt;1.6&#160;USD&#160;m&#8722;2), the versatile metamaterial will benefit both low&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature solar&#8211;thermal systems.








Abstract
Low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;area solar&#8211;thermal absorbers with superior spectral selectivity and excellent thermal stability are vital for efficient and large&#8208;scale solar&#8211;thermal conversion applications, such as space heating, desalination, ice mitigation, photothermal catalysis, and concentrating solar power. Few state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art selective absorbers are qualified for both low&#8208; (&lt;200&#160;&#176;C) and high&#8208;temperature (&gt;600&#160;&#176;C) applications due to insufficient spectral selectivity or thermal stability over a wide temperature range. Here, a high&#8208;performance plasmonic metamaterial selective absorber is developed by facile solution&#8208;based processes via assembling an ultrathin (&#8776;120&#160;nm) titanium nitride (TiN) nanoparticle film on a TiN mirror. Enabled by the synergetic in&#8208;plane plasmon and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot resonances, the all&#8208;ceramic plasmonic metamaterial simultaneously achieves high, full&#8208;spectrum solar absorption (95%), low mid&#8208;IR emission (3% at 100&#160;&#176;C), and excellent stability over a temperature range of 100&#8211;727&#160;&#176;C, even outperforming most vacuum&#8208;deposited absorbers at their specific operating temperatures. The competitive performance of the solution&#8208;processed absorber is accompanied by a significant cost reduction compared with vacuum&#8208;deposited absorbers. All these merits render it a cost&#8208;effective, universal solution to offering high efficiency (89&#8211;93%) for both low&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature solar&#8211;thermal applications.

         <title>Lifshitz Transition and Non&#8208;Fermi Liquid Behavior in Highly Doped Semimetals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A physical model to quantitatively explain the Lifshitz transition and non&#8208;Fermi liquid behavior in highly doped monoclinic Nb2Se3 is reported. Based on Hall and magnetoresistance measurements, the two&#8208;band Drude model, and first&#8208;principles calculations, the non&#8208;quadratic temperature exponent in the resistivity can be quantitatively determined by the chemical potential shift under the framework of Fermi liquid theory.








Abstract
The classical Fermi liquid theory and Drude model have provided fundamental ways to understand the resistivity of most metals. The violation of the classical theory, known as non&#8208;Fermi liquid (NFL) transport, appears in certain metals, including topological semimetals, but quantitative understanding of the NFL behavior has not yet been established. In particular, the determination of the non&#8208;quadratic temperature exponent in the resistivity, a sign of NFL behavior, remains a puzzling issue. Here, a physical model to quantitatively explain the Lifshitz transition and NFL behavior in highly doped (a carrier density of &#8776;1022 cm&#8722;3) monoclinic Nb2Se3 is reported. Hall and magnetoresistance measurements, the two&#8208;band Drude model, and first&#8208;principles calculations demonstrate an apparent chemical potential shift by temperature in monoclinic Nb2Se3, which induces a Lifshitz transition and NFL behavior in the material. Accordingly, the non&#8208;quadratic temperature exponent in the resistivity can be quantitatively determined by the chemical potential shift under the framework of Fermi liquid theory. This model provides a new experimental insight for nontrivial transport with NFL behavior or sign inversion of Seebeck coefficients in emerging materials.

         <title>Mutually Reinforced Polymer&#8211;Graphene Bilayer Membranes for Energy&#8208;Efficient Acoustic Transduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To fabricate ultrahigh&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio, lightweight, and transparent conductive membranes, single&#8208;layer graphene is reinforced by high&#8208;performance polyetherimide to form a laminate bilayer. The bilayer is exceptionally strong, lightweight, transparent, and conductive and has a record&#8208;high aspect ratio of 1 &#215; 105. As an acoustic transducer in a prototype electrostatic speaker, the bilayer consumes 100 times less energy than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrodynamic speakers.








Abstract
Graphene holds promise for thin, ultralightweight, and high&#8208;performance nanoelectromechanical transducers. However, graphene&#8208;only devices are limited in size due to fatigue and fracture of suspended graphene membranes. Here, a lightweight, flexible, transparent, and conductive bilayer composite of polyetherimide and single&#8208;layer graphene is prepared and suspended on the centimeter scale with an unprecedentedly high aspect ratio of 105. The coupling of the two components leads to mutual reinforcement and creates an ultrastrong membrane that supports 30&#160;000 times its own weight. Upon electromechanical actuation, the membrane pushes a massive amount of air and generates high&#8208;quality acoustic sound. The energy efficiency is &#8776;10&#8211;100&#160;times better than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrodynamic speakers. The bilayer membrane's combined properties of electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, optical transparency, thermal stability, and chemical resistance will promote applications in electronics, mechanics, and optics.

         <title>Guest Encapsulation within Surface&#8208;Adsorbed Self&#8208;Assembled Cages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The adsorption of two metal&#8211;organic coordination capsules on alumina is quantified and the cages are shown to retain their ability to bind and release a molecular cargo following immobilization. The adsorbed cages are then used to stabilize the reagents of a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction prior to their subsequent release and reaction.








Abstract
Coordination cages encapsulate a wide variety of guests in the solution state. This ability renders them useful for applications such as catalysis and the sequestration of precious materials. A simple and general method for the immobilization of coordination cages on alumina is reported. Cage loadings are quantified via adsorption isotherms and guest displacement assays demonstrate that the adsorbed cages retain the ability to encapsulate and separate guest and non&#8208;guest molecules. Finally, a system of two cages, adsorbed on to different regions of alumina, stabilizes and separates a pair of Diels&#8211;Alder reagents. The addition of a single competitive guest results in the controlled release of the reagents, thus triggering their reaction. This method of coordination cage immobilization on solid phases is envisaged to be applicable to the extensive library of reported cages, enabling new applications based upon selective solid&#8208;phase molecular encapsulation.

         <title>Photosynthetic Nanomaterial Hybrids for Bioelectricity and Renewable Energy Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural photosynthesis absorbs solar energy and generates photosynthetic electrons by water splitting with an internal quantum efficiency close to 100%. Various nanomaterials applied to photosynthetic complexes are discussed in detail, including the working principles and improvements in photosynthetic electron generation, transfer, conversion, and storage efficiency.








Abstract
Harvesting solar energy in the form of electricity from the photosynthesis of plants, algal cells, and bacteria has been researched as the most environment&#8208;friendly renewable energy technology in the last decade. The primary challenge has been the engineering of electrochemical interfacing with photosynthetic apparatuses, organelles, or whole cells. However, with the aid of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials, there have been many advances, including enhanced photon absorption, increased generation of photosynthetic electrons (PEs), and more efficient transfer of PEs to electrodes. These advances have demonstrated the possibility for the technology to advance to a new level. In this article, the fundamentals of photosynthesis are introduced. How PE harvesting systems have improved concerning solar energy absorption, PE production, and PE collection by electrodes is discussed. The review focuses on how different kinds of nanomaterials are applied and function in interfacing with photosynthetic materials for enhanced PE harvesting. Finally, the review analyzes how the performance of PE harvesting and stand&#8208;alone systems have evolved so far and its future prospects.

         <title>A Review of Piezoelectric and Magnetostrictive Biosensor Materials for Detection of COVID&#8208;19 and Other Viruses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric and magnetostrictive biosensor materials are presented and discussed. It is found that these advanced materials show great potential for application in the detection of various viruses. Progress related to COVID&#8208;19 (coronavirus disease 2019) and the way to new and emerging sensors for virus detection for home application or wearability are considered.








Abstract
The spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has changed the lives of people around the world with a huge impact on economies and societies. The development of wearable sensors that can continuously monitor the environment for viruses may become an important research area. Here, the state of the art of research on biosensor materials for virus detection is reviewed. A general description of the principles for virus detection is included, along with a critique of the experimental work dedicated to various virus sensors, and a summary of their detection limitations. The piezoelectric sensors used for the detection of human papilloma, vaccinia, dengue, Ebola, influenza A, human immunodeficiency, and hepatitis B viruses are examined in the first section; then the second part deals with magnetostrictive sensors for the detection of bacterial spores, proteins, and classical swine fever. In addition, progress related to early detection of COVID&#8208;19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is discussed in the final section, where remaining challenges in the field are also identified. It is believed that this review will guide material researchers in their future work of developing smart biosensors, which can further improve detection sensitivity in monitoring currently known and future virus threats.

         <title>Fullerene Desymmetrization as a Means to Achieve Single&#8208;Enantiomer Electron Acceptors with Maximized Chiroptical Responsiveness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isomeric complexity of a common organic fullerene electron acceptor is resolved, giving ten enantiomeric pairs across six bond types with different chiroptical response. Single&#8208;enantiomer fullerene transistor devices discriminate circularly polarized light with a fast light response and very high photocurrent dissymmetry factor (up to gph&#160;= 1.2&#160;&#177; 0.06).








Abstract
Solubilized fullerene derivatives have revolutionized the development of organic photovoltaic devices, acting as excellent electron acceptors. The addition of solubilizing addends to the fullerene cage results in a large number of isomers, which are generally employed as isomeric mixtures. Moreover, a significant number of these isomers are chiral, which further adds to the isomeric complexity. The opportunities presented by single&#8208;isomer, and particularly single&#8208;enantiomer, fullerenes in organic electronic materials and devices are poorly understood however. Here, ten pairs of enantiomers are separated from the 19 structural isomers of bis[60]phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester, using them to elucidate important chiroptical relationships and demonstrating their application to a circularly polarized light (CPL)&#8208;detecting device. Larger chiroptical responses are found, occurring through the inherent chirality of the fullerene. When used in a single&#8208;enantiomer organic field&#8208;effect transistor, the potential to discriminate CPL with a fast light response time and with a very high photocurrent dissymmetry factor (gph&#160;= 1.27 &#177; 0.06)&#160;is demonstrated. This study thus provides key strategies to design fullerenes with large chiroptical responses for use as chiral components of organic electronic devices. It is anticipated that this data will position chiral fullerenes as an exciting material class for the growing field of chiral electronic technologies.

         <title>High Color&#8208;Rendering Index and Stable White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes by Assembling Two Broadband Emissive Self&#8208;Trapped Excitons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable and highly luminescent CsCu2I3@Cs3Cu2I5 composites are synthesized through a one&#8208;step spin&#8208;coating method. They exhibit white&#8208;light emission through self&#8208;trapped excitons, as well as cold/warm white&#8208;light tuning. By using the composites as a white&#8208;light emitter, electrically driven cold/warm tunable WLEDs with a record color&#8208;rendering index of 91.6 are successfully demonstrated, and a long half&#8208;lifetime of 238.5 min is achieved.








Abstract
White light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs) are promising next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state light sources. However, the commercialization route for WLED production suffers from challenges in terms of insufficient color&#8208;rendering index (CRI), color instability, and incorporation of rare&#8208;earth elements. Herein, a new two&#8208;component strategy is developed by assembling two broadband emissive materials with self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) for high CRI and stable WLEDs. The strategy addresses effectively the challenging issues facing current WLEDs. Based on first&#8208;principles thermodynamic calculations, copper&#8208;based ternary halides composites, CsCu2I3@Cs3Cu2I5, are synthesized by a facile one&#8208;step solution approach. The composites exhibit an ideal white&#8208;light emission with a cold/warm white&#8208;light tuning and a robust stability against heat, ultraviolet light, and environmental oxygen/moisture. A series of cold/warm tunable WLEDs is demonstrated with a maximum luminance of 145&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and an external quantum efficiency of 0.15%, and a record high CRI of 91.6 is achieved, which is the highest value for lead&#8208;free WLEDs. Importantly, the fabricated device demonstrates an excellent operation stability in a continuous current mode, exhibiting a long half&#8208;lifetime of 238.5&#160;min. The results promise the use of the hybrids of STEs&#8208;derived broadband emissive materials for high&#8208;performance WLEDs.

         <title>A Wearable Nutrition Tracker</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable nutrient tracker that allows monitoring of vitamin C in sweat, along with urine and blood, to assist tracking users&#8217; nutritional status is demonstrated. A longitudinal study is performed on two individuals to explore correlations of vitamin C concentrations in sweat and urine with blood. It has promising potential applications in nutritional assessment and dietary intervention.








Abstract
Nutrients are essential for the healthy development and proper maintenance of body functions in humans. For adequate nourishment, it is important to keep track of nutrients level in the body, apart from consuming sufficient nutrition that is in line with dietary guidelines. Sweat, which contains rich chemical information, is an attractive biofluid for routine non&#8208;invasive assessment of nutrient levels. Herein, a wearable sensor that can selectively measure vitamin C concentration in biofluids, including sweat, urine, and blood is developed. Detection through an electrochemical sensor modified with Au nanostructures, LiClO4&#8208;doped conductive polymer, and an enzymes&#8208;immobilized membrane is utilized to achieve wide detection linearity, high selectivity, and long&#8208;term stability. The sensor allows monitoring of temporal changes in vitamin C levels. The effect of vitamin C intake on the sweat and urine profile is explored by monitoring concentration changes upon consuming different amounts of vitamin C. A longitudinal study of sweat's and urine's vitamin C correlation with blood is performed on two individuals. The results suggest that sweat and urine analysis can be a promising method to routinely monitor nutrition through the sweat sensor and that this sensor can facilitate applications such as nutritional screening and dietary intervention.

         <title>Manipulating the Solvation Structure of Nonflammable Electrolyte and Interface to Enable Unprecedented Stability of Graphite Anodes beyond 2 Years for Safe Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonflammable electrolytes show great advantages over conventional electrolytes in terms of both safety and performance, exhibiting high compatibility with graphite electrodes with the longest cycling performance (&gt;2 years). The electrolyte structure and derived F&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase jointly contribute to the superlong cycling stability of graphite electrode, which highlights the importance of the electrolyte compatibility and the interface.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are attractive for low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale energy storage applications, in which graphite is one of the most promising anodes. However, the large size and the high activity of K+ ions and the highly catalytic surface of graphite largely prevent the development of safe and compatible electrolytes. Here, a nonflammable, moderate&#8208;concentration electrolyte is reported that is highly compatible with graphite anodes and that consists of fire&#8208;retardant trimethyl phosphate (TMP) and potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (KFSI) in a salt/solvent molar ratio of 3:8. It shows unprecedented stability, as evidenced by its 74% capacity retention over 24 months of cycling (over 2000 cycles) at the 0.2 C current rate. Electrolyte structure and surface analyses show that this excellent cycling stability is due to the nearly 100% solvation of TMP molecules with K+ cations and the formation of FSI&#8722;&#8208;derived F&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which effectively suppresses the decomposition of the solvent molecules toward the graphite anode. Furthermore, excellent performance on high&#8208;mass loaded graphite electrodes and in a full cell with perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride cathode is demonstrated. This study highlights the importance of the compatibility of both electrolyte and the interface, and offers new opportunities to design the electrolyte&#8211;SEI nexus for safe and practical PIBs.

         <title>Layered PtSe2 for Sensing, Photonic, and (Opto&#8208;)Electronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered PtSe2 holds great promise for industries benefiting from its exciting physical and chemical properties, high air&#8208;stability, and semiconductor&#8208;technology&#8208;compatible fabrication methods. An overview of the use of PtSe2 for applications in photonics, (opto&#8208;)electronics, and sensors is provided. Challenges associated with the synthesis and integration of PtSe2, and the outlook for industry adoption of this material, are discussed.








Abstract
Since the first experimental discovery of graphene 16 years ago, many other 2D layered nanomaterials have been reported. However, the majority of 2D nanostructures suffer from relatively complicated fabrication processes that have bottlenecked their development and their uptake by industry for practical applications. Here, the recent progress in sensing, photonic, and (opto&#8208;)electronic applications of PtSe2, a 2D layered material that is likely to be used in industries benefiting from its high air&#8208;stability and semiconductor&#8208;technology&#8208;compatible fabrication methods, is reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of a range of synthesis methods for PtSe2 are initially compared, followed by a discussion of its outstanding properties, and industrial and commercial advantages. Research focused on the broadband nonlinear photonic properties of PtSe2, as well as reports of its use as a saturable absorber in ultrafast lasers, are then reviewed. Additionally, the advances that have been achieved in a range of PtSe2&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistors, photodetectors, and sensors are summarized. Finally, a conclusion on these results along with the outlook for the future is presented.

         <title>Indium Nitride at the 2D Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bilayer of InN is formed between graphene and SiC by an intercalation process. The coverage of the SiC surface is very high, above 90%. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements prove a bandgap value of 2&#160;&#177; 0.1&#160;eV for the 2D InN.








Abstract
The properties of 2D InN are predicted to substantially differ from the bulk crystal. The predicted appealing properties relate to strong in&#8208; and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane excitons, high electron mobility, efficient strain engineering of their electronic and optical properties, and strong application potential in gas sensing. Until now, the realization of 2D InN remained elusive. In this work, the formation of 2D InN and measurements of its bandgap are reported. Bilayer InN is formed between graphene and SiC by an intercalation process in metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The thickness uniformity of the intercalated structure is investigated by conductive atomic force microscopy (C&#8208;AFM) and the structural properties by atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The coverage of the SiC surface is very high, above 90%, and a major part of the intercalated structure is represented by two sub&#8208;layers of indium (In) bonded to nitrogen (N). Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements give a bandgap value of 2&#160;&#177; 0.1&#160;eV for the 2D InN. The stabilization of 2D InN with a pragmatic wide bandgap and high lateral uniformity of intercalation is demonstrated.

         <title>MXenes for Rechargeable Batteries Beyond the Lithium&#8208;Ion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene and MXene&#8208;based materials are promising for emerging battery technologies beyond lithium ion batteries (including alkali&#8208;ion storage, multivalent&#8208;ion storage, and metal batteries). High conductivity, compositional diversity, and rich surface terminations allow MXenes to play various roles in emerging batteries, including as electrodes, metal anode protective layers, sulfur hosts, separator interlayers, and conductive additives.








Abstract
Research on next&#8208;generation battery technologies (beyond Li&#8208;ion batteries, or LIBs) has been accelerating over the past few years. A key challenge for these emerging batteries has been the lack of suitable electrode materials, which severely limits their further developments. MXenes, a new class of 2D transition metal carbides, carbonitrides, and nitrides, are proposed as electrode materials for these emerging batteries due to several desirable attributes. These attributes include large and tunable interlayer spaces, excellent hydrophilicity, extraordinary conductivity, compositional diversity, and abundant surface chemistries, making MXenes promising not only as electrode materials but also as other components in the cells of emerging batteries. Herein, an overview and assessment of the utilization of MXenes in rechargeable batteries beyond LIBs, including alkali&#8208;ion (e.g., Na+, K+) storage, multivalent&#8208;ion (e.g., Mg2+, Zn2+, and Al3+) storage, and metal batteries are presented. In particular, the synthetic strategies and properties of MXenes that enable MXenes to play various roles as electrodes, metal anode protective layers, sulfur hosts, separator modification layers, and conductive additives in these emerging batteries are discussed. Moreover, a perspective on promising future research directions on MXenes and MXene&#8208;based materials, ranging from material design and processing, fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanisms, to device performance optimization strategies is provided.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Design and Sensing Applications of Hemin/Coordination Polymer&#8208;Based Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining the properties of hemin and porous coordination polymers into novel nanocomposites, different types of sensors can be generated for testing the concentrations of different biological molecules. These biosensors are based on electrochemical, chemiluminescent, or colorimetric techniques, and have excellent detection limits and stability.








Abstract
The fabrication of biomimetic catalysts as substituents for enzymes is of critical interest in the field due to the problems associated with the extraction, purification, and storage of enzymes in sensing applications. Of these mimetics, hemin/coordination polymer&#8208;based nanocomposites, mainly hemin/metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF), have been developed for various biosensing applications because of the unique properties of each component, while trying to mimic the normal biological functions of heme within the protein milieu of enzymes. This critical review first discusses the different catalytic functions of heme in the body in the form of enzyme/protein structures. The properties of hemin dimerization are then elucidated with the supposed models of hemin oxidation. After that, the progress in the fabrication of hemin/MOF nanocomposites for the sensing of diverse biological molecules is discussed. Finally, the challenges in developing this type of composites are examined as well as possible proposals for future directions to enhance the sensing performance in this field further.

         <title>Tailored Graphene Micropatterns by Wafer&#8208;Scale Direct Transfer for Flexible Chemical Sensor Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to micropattern 2D materials on large&#8208;scale flexible substrates using direct polymer curing transfer method is demonstrated. Graphene microchannels on polymer substrates exhibit ultrahigh effective self&#8208;heating under the applied bias voltage of less than 10&#160;V. Entirely flexible and transparent chemical sensor array based on graphene micropatterns successfully discriminate gas species under the self&#8208;activated state without external heating.








Abstract
2D materials, such as graphene, exhibit great potential as functional materials for numerous novel applications due to their excellent properties. The grafting of conventional micropatterning techniques on new types of electronic devices is required to fully utilize the unique nature of graphene. However, the conventional lithography and polymer&#8208;supported transfer methods often induce the contamination and damage of the graphene surface due to polymer residues and harsh wet&#8208;transfer conditions. Herein, a novel strategy to obtain micropatterned graphene on polymer substrates using a direct curing process is demonstrated. Employing this method, entirely flexible, transparent, well&#8208;defined self&#8208;activated graphene sensor arrays, capable of gas discrimination without external heating, are fabricated on 4 in. wafer&#8208;scale substrates. Finite element method simulations show the potential of this patterning technique to maximize the performance of the sensor devices when the active channels of the 2D material are suspended and nanoscaled. This study contributes considerably to the development of flexible functional electronic devices based on 2D materials.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Flowing Graphene Chip&#8208;Based High&#8208;Resolution Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The liquid&#8208;flowing graphene chip (LFGC) is a novel imaging platform enabling the atomic&#8208;scale observation of liquid&#8208;phase reactions in operando circumstances. Graphene viewing windows and anti&#8208;bulging SiNx supports provide a controllable liquid thickness and structural integrity under harsh experimental conditions. Using LFGC, both atomic&#8208;resolution imaging and molecular&#8208;level information for inorganic and biological samples can be acquired under liquid circulation.








Abstract
The recent advances in liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy represent tremendous potential in many different fields and exciting new opportunities. However, achieving both high&#8208;resolution imaging and operando capabilities remain a significant challenge. This work suggests a novel in situ imaging platform of liquid&#8208;flowing graphene chip TEM (LFGC&#8208;TEM) equipped with graphene viewing windows and a liquid exchange system. The LFGCs are robust under high&#8208;pressure gradients and rapid liquid circulation in ranges covering the experimental conditions accessible with conventional thick SiNx chips. LFGC&#8208;TEM provides atomic resolution for colloidal nanoparticles and molecular&#8208;level information limits for unstained wet biomolecules and cells that are comparable to the resolutions achievable with solid&#8208;phase and cryogenic TEM, respectively. This imaging platform can provide an opportunity for live imaging of biological phenomena that is not yet achieved using any current methods.

         <title>Hybrid Solid Electrolyte Interphases Enabled Ultralong Life Ca&#8211;Metal Batteries Working at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable Ca plating/stripping process for more than 1000 h is realized through a Na/Ca hybrid SEI strategy. This enables an ultralong life and high operation voltage, up to 4.5 V, for room&#8208;temperature Ca&#8211;metal batteries.








Abstract
Currently, the application of calcium metal anodes is challenged by rapidly degenerated plating/stripping electrochemistry without suitable solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) capable of fast Ca2+ transport kinetics and superior ability to resist anion oxidation. Here, through in situ evolved Na/Ca hybrid SEIs, symmetrical Ca//Ca batteries readily remain stable for more than 1000 h deposition&#8211;dissolution cycles (versus less than 60 h for those with pure Ca SEIs under the same condition). Coupled with a specially designed freestanding lattice&#8208;expanded graphitic carbon fiber membrane and tailored operation voltages, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept Ca&#8208;metal batteries reversibly run for almost 1900 cycles with &#8776;83% capacity retention and a high average discharge voltage of 3.16&#160;V. The good performance not only benefits from the stable SEIs at the Ca metal surface which affords free Ca2+ transports and prohibits out&#8208;of&#8208;control fluridation of Ca (forming CaF2 ion&#8208;/electron&#8208;insulating layer) but is also attributed to reversible relay insertion/extraction electrochemistry in the cathode. This work sheds new light on durable metal battery technology.

         <title>Compositional Fluctuations Locked by Athermal Transformation Yielding High Thermoelectric Performance in GeTe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interplay between phase decomposition and athermal phase transition is leveraged in a Ge&#8208;Sb&#8208;Te ternary system to enable exquisite microstructure features by strong composition fluctuations and coexistence of rhombohedral&#8208; and cubic GeTe. Specifically, alloying GeTe with Sb2Te3 significantly suppresses thermal conductivity while retaining eligible carrier concentration over a wide composition range, resulting in high zT values &gt; 2.6.








Abstract
Phase transition in thermoelectric (TE) material is a double&#8208;edged sword&#8212;it is undesired for device operation in applications, but the fluctuations near an electronic instability are favorable. Here, Sb doping is used to elicit a spontaneous composition fluctuation showing uphill diffusion in GeTe that is otherwise suspended by diffusionless athermal cubic&#8208;to&#8208;rhombohedral phase transition at around 700 K. The interplay between these two phase transitions yields exquisite composition fluctuations and a coexistence of cubic and rhombohedral phases in favor of exceptional figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit zT. Specifically, alloying GeTe by Sb2Te3 significantly suppresses the thermal conductivity while retaining eligible carrier concentration over a wide composition range, resulting in high zT values of &gt;2.6. These results not only attest to the efficacy of using phase transition in manipulating the microstructures of GeTe&#8208;based materials but also open up a new thermodynamic route to develop higher performance TE materials in general.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Enabled by Efficient Energy Transfer between Coupled Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional ligand of 4&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl) benzoic acid cation is incorporated into perovskite to simultaneously diminish the weak van der Waals gap and passivate the defects for efficient energy transfer and radiative recombination. Fabricated blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes show an external quantum efficiency of 10.11% and a long stability of 81.3 min, indicating that this is an effective approach for high device performance.

While there has been extensive investigation into modulating quasi&#8208;2D perovskite compositions in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) for promoting their electroluminescence, very few reports have studied approaches involving enhancement of the energy transfer between quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layers of the film, which plays very important role for achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs). In this work, a bifunctional ligand of 4&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)benzoic acid (ABA) cation is strategically introduced into the perovskite to diminish the weak van der Waals gap between individual perovskite layers for promoting coupled quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layers. In particular, the strengthened interaction between coupled quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layers favors an efficient energy transfer in the perovskite films. The introduced ABA can also simultaneously passivate the perovskite defects by reducing metallic Pb for less nonradiative recombination loss. Benefiting from the advanced properties of ABA incorporated perovskites, highly efficient blue PeLEDs with external quantum efficiency of 10.11% and a very long operational stability of 81.3&#160;min, among the best performing blue quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs, are achieved. Consequently, this work contributes an effective approach for high&#8208;performance and stable blue PeLEDs toward practical applications.

         <title>Machine Learning Predictions of Block Copolymer Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning is used to analyze the self&#8208;assembly of block copolymer thin films. The neural networks predict the effect of process parameters on morphology and defectivity during solvent annealing, and a ridge regression model identifies the critical parameters that determine the quality of line/space patterns. These results illustrate the potential of machine learning to inform nanomanufacturing processes.








Abstract
Directed self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers is a key enabler for nanofabrication of devices with sub&#8208;10 nm feature sizes, allowing patterning far below the resolution limit of conventional photolithography. Among all the process steps involved in block copolymer self&#8208;assembly, solvent annealing plays a dominant role in determining the film morphology and pattern quality, yet the interplay of the multiple parameters during solvent annealing, including the initial thickness, swelling, time, and solvent ratio, makes it difficult to predict and control the resultant self&#8208;assembled pattern. Here, machine learning tools are applied to analyze the solvent annealing process and predict the effect of process parameters on morphology and defectivity. Two neural networks are constructed and trained, yielding accurate prediction of the final morphology in agreement with experimental data. A ridge regression model is constructed to identify the critical parameters that determine the quality of line/space patterns. These results illustrate the potential of machine learning to inform nanomanufacturing processes.

         <title>Self&#8208;Strengthening Adhesive Force Promotes Cell Mechanotransduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the spontaneous merocyanine&#8208;to&#8208;spiropyran isomerization, a coating displays dynamic self&#8208;strengthening of the interfacial adhesive force. Cells enable remodeling of the underlaying interfaces to meet their demand for adhesion when the ligand anchoring strength is weak. The subsequent self&#8208;strengthening process offers progressive force stimulation following the adaptation step to mediate cell behaviors and ultimately drive cell fate specification.








Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) undergoes dynamic remodeling and progressive stiffening during tissue regeneration and disease progression. However, most of the artificial ECMs and in vitro disease models are mechanically static. Here, a self&#8208;strengthening polymer coating mimicking the dynamic nature of native ECM is designed to study the cellular response to dynamic biophysical cues and promote cell mechanical sensitive response. Spiropyran (SP) is utilized as dynamic anchor group to regulate the strength of cell adhesive peptide ligands. Benefiting from spontaneous thermal merocyanine&#8208;to&#8208;spiropyran (MC&#8211;SP) isomerization, the resulting self&#8208;responsive coating displays dynamic self&#8208;strengthening of interfacial interactions. Comparing with the static and all of the previous dynamic artificial ECMs, cells on this self&#8208;responsive surface remodel the weakly bonded MC&#8208;based coatings to activate &#945;5&#946;1 integrin and Rac signaling in the early adhesion stage. The subsequent MC&#8208;to&#8208;SP conversion strengthens the ligand&#8211;integrin interaction to further activate &#945;v&#946;3 integrin and RhoA/ROCK signaling in the latter stage. This sequential process enhances cellular mechanotransduction as well as the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). It is worth emphasizing that the self&#8208;strengthening occurs spontaneously in the absence of any stimulus, making it especially useful for implanted scaffolds in regenerative medicine.

         <title>Unraveling the Nature of Excellent Potassium Storage in Small&#8208;Molecule Se@Peapod&#8208;Like N&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;molecule Se embedded in freestanding N&#8208;doped porous carbon nanofibers thin film is prepared as the cathode for K&#8211;Se batteries. The short&#8208;chain Se confined in the micropores is eventually transformed to K2Se by a two&#8208;step conversion reaction via an &#8220;all&#8208;solid&#8208;state&#8221; electrochemical process which hinders the generation of polyselenides and promotes complete conversion thus enhancing the utilization of Se.








Abstract
The potassium&#8211;selenium (K&#8211;Se) battery is considered as an alternative solution for stationary energy storage because of abundant resource of K. However, the detailed mechanism of the energy storage process is yet to be unraveled. Herein, the findings in probing the working mechanism of the K&#8208;ion storage in Se cathode are reported using both experimental and computational approaches. A flexible K&#8211;Se battery is prepared by employing the small&#8208;molecule Se embedded in freestanding N &#8208;doped porous carbon nanofibers thin film (Se@NPCFs) as cathode. The reaction mechanisms are elucidated by identifying the existence of short&#8208;chain molecular Se encapsulated inside the microporous host, which transforms to K2Se by a two&#8208;step conversion reaction via an &#8220;all&#8208;solid&#8208;state&#8221; electrochemical process in the carbonate electrolyte system. Through the whole reaction, the generation of polyselenides (K2Sen, 3&#160;&#8804;&#160;n&#160;&#8804;&#160;8) is effectively suppressed by electrochemical reaction dominated by Se2 molecules, thus significantly enhancing the utilization of Se and effecting the voltage platform of the K&#8211;Se battery. This work offers a practical pathway to optimize the K&#8211;Se battery performance through structure engineering and manipulation of selenium chemistry for the formation of selective species and reveal its internal reaction mechanism in the carbonate electrolyte.

         <title>High&#8208;Definition Single&#8208;Cell Printing: Cell&#8208;by&#8208;Cell Fabrication of Biological Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional bioprinting methods cannot reliably print single cells. A novel microfluidic bioprinting technology with a highly miniaturized cell sorter is presented to accurately print single cells. Through selective cell&#8208;by&#8208;cell printing, intricate cell patterns at single&#8208;cell resolution and uniform spheroids with defined composition and morphology are fabricated.








Abstract
Bioprinting is a powerful technology with the potential to transform medical device manufacturing, organ replacement, and the treatment of diseases and physiologic malformations. However, current bioprinters are unable to reliably print the fundamental unit of all living things, single cells. A high&#8208;definition single&#8208;cell printing, a novel microfluidic technology, is presented here that can accurately print single cells from a mixture of multiple candidates. The bioprinter employs a highly miniaturized microfluidic sorter to deterministically select single cells of interest for printing, achieving an accuracy of &#8776;10&#160;&#181;m and speed of &#8776;100&#160;Hz. This approach is demonstrated by fabricating intricate cell patterns with pre&#8208;defined features through selective single&#8208;cell printing. The approach is used to synthesize well&#8208;defined spheroids with controlled composition and morphology. The speed, accuracy, and flexibility of the approach will advance bioprinting to enable new studies in organoid science, tissue engineering, and spatially targeted cell therapies.

         <title>Fully Light&#8208;Controlled Memory and Neuromorphic Computation in Layered Black Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;optically tunable neuromorphic imaging element based on black phosphorus (BP) is demonstrated. Unusual wavelength&#8208;dependent photocurrent in BP is harnessed to optically program and erase visual memory elements. Concurrently, the same elements are capable of in&#8208;pixel image pre&#8208;processing in an array and optoelectronic machine learning for image recognition through artificial neural networks.








Abstract
Imprinting vision as memory is a core attribute of human cognitive learning. Fundamental to artificial intelligence systems are bioinspired neuromorphic vision components for the visible and invisible segments of the electromagnetic spectrum. Realization of a single imaging unit with a combination of in&#8208;built memory and signal processing capability is imperative to deploy efficient brain&#8208;like vision systems. However, the lack of a platform that can be fully controlled by light without the need to apply alternating polarity electric signals has hampered this technological advance. Here, a neuromorphic imaging element based on a fully light&#8208;modulated 2D semiconductor in a simple reconfigurable phototransistor structure is presented. This standalone device exhibits inherent characteristics that enable neuromorphic image pre&#8208;processing and recognition. Fundamentally, the unique photoresponse induced by oxidation&#8208;related defects in 2D black phosphorus (BP) is exploited to achieve visual memory, wavelength&#8208;selective multibit programming, and erasing functions, which allow in&#8208;pixel image pre&#8208;processing. Furthermore, all&#8208;optically driven neuromorphic computation is demonstrated by machine learning to classify numbers and recognize images with an accuracy of over 90%. The devices provide a promising approach toward neurorobotics, human&#8211;machine interaction technologies, and scalable bionic systems with visual data storage/buffering and processing.

         <title>Relationship between the Processing, Structure, and Properties of Microfibrillar Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfibrillar composites (MFCs) are considered as a promising group of environmentally friendly fiber composites, which might replace the commercial glass&#8208; and carbon&#8208;fiber composites in the final applications. A comprehensive overview of the complex processing&#8211;structure&#8211;properties relationship for MFCs is presented. It is known that carefully developed microstructure is one of the most important requirements for achieving composites&#8217; good mechanical properties.








Abstract
The relationship between processing, morphology, and properties of polymeric materials has been the subject of numerous studies of academic and industrial research. Finding an answer to this question might result in guidelines on how to design polymeric materials. Microfibrillar composites (MFCs) are an interesting class of polymer&#8211;polymer composites. The advantage of the MFC concept lies in developing in situ microfibrils by which a perfect homogeneous distribution of the reinforcement in the matrix can be achieved. Their potentially excellent mechanical properties are strongly dependent on the aspect ratio of the fibrils, which is developed through a three&#8208;stage production process: melt blending, fibrillation, and isotropization. During melt blending, the polymers undergo different morphological changes, such as a breakup and coalescence of the droplets, which play a crucial role in defining the microstructure. During processing, various parameters may affect the morphology of the MFCs, which must be taken into account. Besides the processing parameters, the microstructure of the composite is dependent on the composition ratio of the blend and viscosity of the components, as well as the dispersion and distribution of the microfibrils. The objective here is to outline this importance and bring together an overview of the processing&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationship for MFCs.

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Bridged Donor&#8211;Acceptor sp2&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Linked 2D Conjugated Polymers as Photocathodes for Water Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bithiophene&#8208;bridged D&#8211;A&#8208;based 2D sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked conjugated polymer (2D CCP&#8208;Th) is synthesized via Knoevenagel polymerization. Benefiting from the robust sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked conjugations and donor&#8211;acceptor structures, when employed as a photocathode for water reduction, 2D CCP&#8208;Th demonstrates a superb saturated photocurrent density (5.5 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 at 0.3&#160;V and 7.9 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 at 0&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode).








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water reduction, converting solar energy into environmentally friendly hydrogen fuel, requires delicate design and synthesis of semiconductors with appropriate bandgaps, suitable energy levels of the frontier orbitals, and high intrinsic charge mobility. In this work, the synthesis of a novel bithiophene&#8208;bridged donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based 2D sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked conjugated polymer (2D CCP) is demonstrated. The Knoevenagel polymerization between the electron&#8208;accepting building block 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexa(4&#8208;formylphenyl) diquinoxalino[2,3&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine (HATN&#8208;6CHO) and the first electron&#8208;donating linker 2,2&#8242;&#8208;([2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene]&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;diyl)diacetonitrile (ThDAN) provides the 2D CCP&#8208;HATNThDAN (2D CCP&#8208;Th). Compared with the corresponding biphenyl&#8208;bridged 2D CCP&#8208;HATN&#8208;BDAN (2D CCP&#8208;BD), the bithiophene&#8208;based 2D CCP&#8208;Th exhibits a wide light&#8208;harvesting range (up to 674&#160;nm), a optical energy gap (2.04&#160;eV), and highest energy occupied molecular orbital&#8211;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital distributions for facilitated charge transfer, which make 2D CCP&#8208;Th a promising candidate for PEC water reduction. As a result, 2D CCP&#8208;Th presents a superb H2&#8208;evolution photocurrent density up to &#8776;7.9 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 at 0&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is superior to the reported 2D covalent organic frameworks and most carbon nitride materials (0.09&#8211;6.0 &#181;A cm&#8722;2). Density functional theory calculations identify the thiophene units and cyano substituents at the vinylene linkage as active sites for the evolution of H2.

         <title>CANDYBOTS: A New Generation of 3D&#8208;Printed Sugar&#8208;Based Transient Small&#8208;Scale Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sugars are among the main sources of energy and structural building blocks for almost all forms of life. Because of their degradability and biocompatibility, sugars are compelling materials in transient devices and robotics. An additive manufacturing approach for the production of 3D sugar&#8208;based composites is introduced, which can pave the way for a new generation of transient small&#8208;scale devices.








Abstract
Sugars are ubiquitous in food, and are among the main sources of energy for almost all forms of life. Sugars can also form structural building blocks such as cellulose in plants. Because of their inherent degradability and biocompatibility characteristics, sugars are compelling materials for transient devices. Here, an additive manufacturing approach for the production of magnetic sugar&#8208;based composites is introduced. First, it is shown that sugar&#8208;based 3D architectures can be 3D printed by selective laser sintering. This method enables not only the caramelization chemistry but also the mechanical properties of the sugar architectures to be adjusted by varying the laser energy. It is also demonstrated that mixtures of sugar and magnetic particles can be processed as 3D composites. As a proof of concept, a sugar&#8208;based millimeter&#8208;scale helical swimmer, which is capable of corkscrew motion in a solution with a viscosity comparable to those of biological fluids, is fabricated. The millirobot quickly dissolves in water, while being manipulated through magnetic fields. The present fabrication method can pave the way to a new generation of transient sugar&#8208;based small&#8208;scale robots for minimally invasive procedures. Due to their rapid dissolution, sugars can be used as an intermediate step for transporting swarms of particles to specific target locations.

         <title>Shelf&#8208;Stable Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with High Operational Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) demonstrate high operational performance but poor shelf stability. This work reveals that both positive ageing and negative ageing of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art QLEDs are associated with in situ reactions induced by organic acids. The understanding leads to novel electron&#8208;transporting oxide bilayers to realize shelf&#8208;stable devices with high operational performance.








Abstract
Quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) promise a new generation of high&#8208;performance, large&#8208;area, and cost&#8208;effective electroluminescent devices for both display and solid&#8208;state lighting technologies. However, a positive ageing process is generally required to improve device performance for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art QLEDs. Here, it is revealed that the in situ reactions induced by organic acids in the commonly used encapsulation acrylic resin lead to positive ageing and, most importantly, the progression of in situ reactions inevitably results in negative ageing, i.e., deterioration of device performance after long&#8208;term shelf storage. In&#8208;depth mechanism studies focusing on the correlations between the in situ chemical reactions and the shelf&#8208;ageing behaviors of QLEDs inspire the design of an electron&#8208;transporting bilayer, which delivers both improved electrical conductivity and suppressed interfacial exciton quenching. This material innovation enables red QLEDs exhibiting neglectable changes of external quantum efficiency (&gt;20.0%) and ultralong operational lifetime (T95: 5500 h at 1000 nits) after storage for 180 days. This work provides design principles for oxide electron&#8208;transporting layers to realize shelf&#8208;stable and high&#8208;operational&#8208;performance QLEDs, representing a new starting point for both fundamental studies and practical applications.

&lt;p&gt;State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) demonstrate high operational performance but poor shelf stability. This work reveals that both positive ageing and negative ageing of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art QLEDs are associated with in situ reactions induced by organic acids. The understanding leads to novel electron&#8208;transporting oxide bilayers to realize shelf&#8208;stable devices with high operational performance.

         <title>A Suspended Silicon Single&#8208;Hole Transistor as an Extremely Scaled Gigahertz Nanoelectromechanical Beam Resonator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silicon single&#8208;hole transistor, a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation electronics, is suspended to function as a nanoelectromechanical resonator, demonstrating a record&#8208;high resonant frequency and large zero&#8208;point motion. The mechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical signal transducing is dominated by the piezoresistive effect with a giant piezoresistive gauge factor strongly correlated to single&#8208;hole tunneling, providing great potential in interfacing charge carriers with mechanical vibrations.








Abstract
Suspended single&#8208;hole transistors (SHTs) can also serve as nanoelectromechanical resonators, providing an ideal platform for investigating interactions between mechanical vibrations and charge carriers. Demonstrating such a device in silicon (Si) is of particular interest, due to the strong piezoresistive effect of Si and potential applications in Si&#8208;based quantum computation. Here, a suspended Si SHT also acting as a nanoelectromechanical beam resonator is demonstrated. The resonant frequency and zero&#8208;point motion of the device are &#8776;3&#160;GHz and 0.2&#160;pm, respectively, reaching the best level among similar devices demonstrated with Si&#8208;containing materials. The mechanical vibration is transduced to electrical readout by the SHT. The signal transduction mechanism is dominated by the piezoresistive effect. A giant apparent effective piezoresistive gauge factor with strong correlation to single&#8208;hole tunneling is extracted in this device. The results show the great potential of the device in interfacing charge carriers with mechanical vibrations, as well as investigating potential quantum behavior of the vibration phonon mode.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Preserving Chemical Conversion of Architected Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shaping, sculpting, and forging customizable compounds into arbitrary forms has the potential to revolutionize technologies for advanced functional materials. Understanding ion&#8208;exchange reactions in nanocomposites enables shape&#8208;controlled microscopic architectures with a large diversity of metal chalcogenide compositions that are of interest for their electronic, catalytic, and magnetic properties.








Abstract
Forging customizable compounds into arbitrary shapes and structures has the potential to revolutionize functional materials, where independent control over shape and composition is essential. Current self&#8208;assembly strategies allow impressive levels of control over either shape or composition, but not both, as self&#8208;assembly inherently entangles shape and composition. Herein, independent control over shape and composition is achieved by chemical conversion reactions on nanocrystals, which are first self&#8208;assembled in nanocomposites with programmable microscopic shapes. The multiscale character of nanocomposites is crucial: nanocrystals (5&#8211;50&#160;nm) offer enhanced chemical reactivity, while the composite layout accommodates volume changes of the nanocrystals (&#8776;25%), which together leads to complete chemical conversion with full shape preservation. These reactions are surprisingly materials agnostic, allowing a large diversity of chemical pathways, and development of conversion pathways yielding a wide selection of shape&#8208;controlled transition metal chalcogenides (cadmium, manganese, iron, and nickel oxides and sulfides). Finally, the versatility and application potential of this strategy is demonstrated by assembling: 1) a scalable and highly reactive nickel catalyst for the dry reforming of butane, 2) an agile magnetic&#8208;controlled particle, and 3) an electron&#8208;beam&#8208;controlled reversible microactuator with sub&#8208;micrometer precision. Previously unimaginable customization of shape and composition is now achievable for assembling advanced functional components.

         <title>Recent Advances in Growth of Large&#8208;Sized 2D Single Crystals on Cu Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the growth and production of wafer&#8208;scale and single&#8208;crystal 2D materials on Cu substrates by chemical vapor deposition are presented. The features and roles of Cu in making 2D crystals are comprehensively demonstrated. The daunting quest for mass production of single&#8208;crystal 2D materials poses great potential in electronics and other applications.








Abstract
Large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;quality 2D materials have been an emerging and promising choice for use in modern chemistry and physics owing to their fascinating property profile. The past few years have witnessed inspiringly progressing development in controlled fabrication of large&#8208;sized and single&#8208;crystal 2D materials. Among those production methods, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has drawn the most attention because of its fine control over size and quality of 2D materials by modulating the growth conditions. Meanwhile, Cu has been widely accepted as the most popular catalyst due to its significant merit in growing monolayer 2D materials in the CVD process. Herein, very recent advances in preparing large&#8208;sized 2D single crystals on Cu substrates by CVD are presented. First, the unique features of Cu will be given in terms of ultralow precursor solubility and feasible surface engineering. Then, scaled growth of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) crystals on Cu substrates is demonstrated, wherein different kinds of Cu surfaces have been employed. Furthermore, the growth mechanism for the growth of 2D single crystals is exhibited, offering a guideline to elucidate the in&#8208;depth growth dynamics and kinetics. Finally, relevant issues for industrial&#8208;scale mass production of 2D single crystals are discussed and a promising future is expected.

         <title>Coherent Electron Transport in Air&#8208;Stable, Printed Single&#8208;Crystal Organic Semiconductor and Application to Megahertz Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;type organic semiconductor, PhC2&#8722;BQQDI, which can be used to form single&#8208;crystalline thin films by printing, is identified as a band&#8208;transport material by means of variable&#8208;temperature gated Hall effect measurements. The printed PhC2&#8722;BQQDI single crystal is also used to demonstrate a high&#8208;frequency transistor with a capability of 4.3&#160;MHz under ambient atmosphere.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors (OSCs) have attracted growing attention for optoelectronic applications such as field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs), and coherent (or band&#8208;like) carrier transport properties in OSC single crystals (SCs) have been of interest as they can lead to high carrier mobilities. Recently, such p&#8208;type OSC SCs compatible with a printing technology have been used to achieve high&#8208;speed FETs; therefore, developments of n&#8208;type counterparts may be promising for realizing high&#8208;speed complementary organic circuits. Herein, coherent electron transport properties in a printed SC of a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, air&#8208;stable n&#8208;type OSC, PhC2&#8722;BQQDI, by means of variable&#8208;temperature gated Hall effect measurements and X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction analyses in conjunction with band structure calculations, are reported. Furthermore, the SC FET is tested for high&#8208;speed operations, which obtains a cutoff frequency of 4.3&#160;MHz at an operation voltage of 20&#160;V in air. Thus, PhC2&#8722;BQQDI is shown as a new candidate for practical applications of SC&#8208;based, organic complementary devices.

         <title>Random Polymerization Strategy Leads to a Family of Donor Polymers Enabling Well&#8208;Controlled Morphology and Multiple Cases of High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>

To fine&#8208;tune the energy levels of polymer donors, a family of random polymers is synthesized, which shows favorable properties of aggregation and morphology. The performance of these polymers is less sensitive to their molecular weights compared with PM7. Thus, multiple cases of highly efficient nonfullerene organic solar cells are achieved with efficiencies between 16.0% and 17.1%.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance donor polymers is important for nonfullerene organic solar cells (NF&#8208;OSCs), as state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nonfullerene acceptors can only perform well if they are coupled with a matching donor with suitable energy levels. However, there are very limited choices of donor polymers for NF&#8208;OSCs, and the most commonly used ones are polymers named PM6 and PM7, which suffer from several problems. First, the performance of these polymers (particularly PM7) relies on precise control of their molecular weights. Also, their optimal morphology is extremely sensitive to any structural modification. In this work, a family of donor polymers is developed based on a random polymerization strategy. These polymers can achieve well&#8208;controlled morphology and high&#8208;performance with a variety of chemical structures and molecular weights. The polymer donors are D&#8211;A1&#8211;D&#8211;A2&#8208;type random copolymers in which the D and A1 units are monomers originating from PM6 or PM7, while the A2 unit comprises an electron&#8208;deficient core flanked by two thiophene rings with branched alkyl chains. Consequently, multiple cases of highly efficient NF&#8208;OSCs are achieved with efficiencies between 16.0% and 17.1%. As the electron&#8208;deficient cores can be changed to many other structural units, the strategy can easily expand the choices of high&#8208;performance donor polymers for NF&#8208;OSCs.
